Even below ultimate failure limits, deformation activates pathophysiological cascades resulting in delayed cell death. Injury response of soft tissues, such as the chest and spinal cord, {{is dependent on the}} product of deformation and velocity, a parameter termed the <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion.</b> We set out to test if hippocampal cell death could be predicted by a similar combination of strain and strain rate and if the <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion</b> was valid for hippocampus. Quantitative prediction of the brain's biological response to mechanical stimuli is difficult to achieve in animal models of TBI, so we utilized an in vitro model of TBI based on hippocampal slice cultures. We quantified the temporal development of cell death after precisely controlled deformations for 30 combinations of strain (0. 05 - 0. 50) and strain rate (0. 1 - 50 s(- 1)) relevant to TBI. Loading conditions for a subset of cultures were verified by analysis of highspeed video. Cell death was found to be significantly dependent on time-post injury, on strain magnitude, and to a lesser extent, on anatomical region by a repeated-measures, three-way ANOVA. The responses of the CA 1 and CA 3 regions of the hippocampus were not statistically different in contrast to some in vivo TBI studies. Surprisingly, cell death was not dependent on strain rate leading us to conclude that the <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion</b> is not a valid predictor for hippocampal tissue injury. Given the large data set and extensive combinations of biomechanical parameters, predictive mathematical functions relating independent variables (strain, region, and time post-injury) to the resultant cell death were defined. These functions can be used as tolerance criteria to equip finite element models of TBI with the added capability to predict biological consequences...|$|E

There are different types of KENLW projectiles ranging from rigid to deformable projectiles.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringSignificant advancements in {{enhancing}} passenger safety and vehicle structures {{have been made}} in the automotive industry to protect the occupants and to minimize the injuries during crash events. Variety of crash tests, based on federal regulatory standards, have been performed with an end goal to examine the occupant kinematics and potential injury responses. Among different automotive crash scenarios, the frontal impact is the most common type of accident, which has been considered in this study. In recent years, computer-aided engineering tools have been extensively utilized in modeling, analysis and design of vehicle structures and occupant safety systems. The primary reason for the development and use of simulation models is to reduce the number of full-scale sled tests performed, which require vast flow time and are associated with significant cost. This thesis entirely focuses on the comparison of dynamic responses of human body models versus the crash dummy models in various vehicle frontal federal regulatory standards. For this reason, a ford taurus car representing a typical sedan has been considered as a medium. The simulation tests are conducted for the full frontal impact, small offset overlap impact and oblique impact configurations. A car interior environment is developed in MADYMO code, in which the human and dummy models are placed in. The acceleration acquired from the finite element analysis of frontal crash scenarios and the driver seat node are then input into the MADYMO code for both human and dummy models, and their kinematic responses are then compared. Per regulations, chest injury is considered to be a prominent factor in frontal crashes. Hence, the variations of chest deflection, chest acceleration and <b>viscous</b> <b>criteria</b> are investigated. The results from this study illustrate the potential difference between the human and dummy dynamic performances in various frontal crash scenarios. In particular, the differences in chest acceleration, chest deflection, and flexibility of spine are quantified...|$|R

Methods: Twenty-six children aged 45 days to 7 years (14 girls and 12 boys) took part in this study. The forces applied by the physiotherapist were recorded using a orce-plate embedded in the manipulation table supporting the child. Two synchronized cameras filmed the scene in a calibrated environment. The displacement of reflective targets glued on the physiotherapist's hands was calculated using an automatic tracking procedure and the 3 D reconstruction "Direct Linear Transformation" algorithm. The progression of physical parameters was evaluated according to the age of the child. They included force, displacement, normalized displacement, loading speed, displacement and normalized displacement at the maximum force, force at the maximum displacement, <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion</b> and effective stiffness. Findings: For all patients, the mean maximum displacement and load were 22 mm (SD 9 mm) and 240 N (SD 46 N) respectively. The force-displacement curves had shown the complexity of the in vivo behavior: four phases have been distinguished with cycles in respect with the respiratory phases.

The criteria were assessed in two series of experiments: 90 ° (lateral) car to car collisions and controlled left trunk impacts against either a rigid or padded wall. Forty-two belt restrained human cadavers in the age range 18 – 65 years, located in the near-side front passenger seat, were used. The impact velocity was between 40 and 60 km/h. Left and right side impacts were simulated using standard or modified car side structures. With the second series of experiments, {{the left side of}} each subject was impacted under one of two different test conditions: 24 km/h rigid wall or 32 km/h padded wall. The thorax deformation was evaluated through the double integration of the accelerated difference at the fourth and eight ribs, near and far side. Deformation maxima of 6 – 138 mm (mean 69 mm), VC values of 0. 3 – 4. 7 m/s (mean 1. 6 m/s), and TTI values of 85 – 252 (mean 63) occurred. Torso abbreviated injury severity (AIS) values were between 0 and 5. Statistical analyses showed a stronger influence of age on injury severity than the injury criteria or biomechanical responses in the two series of experiments.

A numerical model that can predict such injuries in crash simulation {{is essential to the}} process of designing a safer motor vehicle. The focus {{of this study was to}} develop a numerical model to predict lung response and injury in side impact car crash scenarios. A biofidelic human body model was further developed. The geometry, material properties and boundary condition of the organs and soft tissues within the thorax were improved with the intent to ensure stress transmission continuity and model accuracy. The thoracic region of the human body model was revalidated against three pendulum and two sled impact scenarios at different velocities. Other body regions such as the shoulder, abdomen, and pelvis were revalidated. The latest model demonstrated improvements in every response category relative to the previous version of the human body model. The development of the lung model involved advancements in the material properties, and boundary conditions. An analytical approach was presented to correct the lung properties to the in-situ condition. Several injury metric predictor candidates of pulmonary contusion were investigated and compared based on the validated pendulum and sled impact scenarios. The results of this study confirmed the importance of stress wave focusing, reflection, and concentration within the lungs. The bulk modulus of the lung had considerable influence on injury metric outcomes. Despite the <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion</b> yielded similar response for different loading conditions, this study demonstrated that the level of contusion volume varied with the size of the impact surface area. In conclusion, the human body model could be used for the analysis of thoracic response in automotive impact scenarios.

40|$|The {{blast wave}} emanating from an {{explosion}} produces an almost instantaneous rise in pressure which can then cause Blast Overpressure (BOP) injuries to nearby persons. BOP injury criteria are specified in test standards to relate BOP measurements in a testing environment to {{a risk of}} BOP injury. This study considered the adequacy of test standards in evaluating BOP protection concepts for the torso. Four potential BOP injury scenarios were studied to determine the likelihood of injury and the adequacy of test standards for appropriate protection concepts. In the case of vehicle blast, BOP injury is unlikely and test standards are adequate. In the scenario involving an explosive charge detonated within a vehicle, and the close proximity to a hand grenade scenario, test standards are not available. The demining scenario was identified as of importance as test standards are available, but do not mandate the evaluation of BOP protection. A prototype South African Torso Surrogate (SATS) was developed to explore this scenario further. The SATS was required to be relatively inexpensive and robust. The SATS was cast from silicone (selected to represent body tissue characteristics) using a torso mould containing a steel frame and instrumented with chest face-on pressure transducer and accelerometer. The SATS was subjected to an Anti-Personnel (AP) mine test and the Chest Wall Velocity Predictor and <b>Viscous</b> <b>Criterion</b> were used to predict that BOP injuries would occur in a typical demining scenario. This result was confirmed by applying the injury criteria to empirical blast predictions from the Blast Effects Calculator Version 4 (BECV 4). Although limitations exist {{in the ability of}} injury criteria and measurement methods to accurately predict BOP injuries, generally a conservative approach should be taken. Thus, it is recommended that the risk of BOP injuries should be evaluated in demining personal protective equipment test standards...|$|E
40|$|Side impact {{motor vehicle}} crashes pose unique {{challenges}} for occupant protection, {{particularly with regard}} to torso injury mitigation. The minimal crush distance between the vehicle exterior and the occupant torso has necessitated advanced passive safety technologies in response to tightened regulatory requirements and increased public awareness of safety issues. In particular, lateral airbag restraints (side airbags) have undergone a rapid and unregulated introduction in recent years, with US availability increasing to over 90 % of new vehicles in 2010. As with frontal airbag restraints, the prdissertationsity for injury to occupants in close proximity to side airbag deployment remains a concern. Test protocols have been proposed to evaluate occupant injury risk from airbag deployment with mechanical occupant surrogates. Yet few studies have attempted to characterize thoracoabdominal responses to close-proximity airbag contact in actual crashes, leaving unaddressed the relevance of test protocols and occupant surrogates currently employed. To address this issue, the present study sought to identify and characterize injury and biomechanical responses of the thoracoabdominal region to torso-interacting side airbag restraints. A novel biological experimental approach was developed from a multi-body analysis and from an evaluation of documented restraint performance. Biomechanical responses of deflection, deflection rate, the <b>Viscous</b> <b>Criterion,</b> and deformation obliquity with respect to subject anatomy were quantified. Further, tissue-level material response was examined through a comparative finite element analysis of subject-specific loading. Results indicated that traumatic visceral injury specific to the posterolateral region was associated with close-proximity airbag interaction. Deformation response was uniquely oblique with respect to anatomy, necessitating the refinement of existing injury metrics. Biomechanical tolerances were also determined for risk of trauma to posterolateral viscera. These results are useful for the development of mechanical occupant surrogates and reductions to injury risks from close-proximity side airbag loading...|$|E

Using a theoretical approach and axisymmetric numerical simulations, we study two distinct phenomena appearing in this librating flow. First, we investigate {{the occurrence of}} a centrifugal instability near the oscillating boundary, leading to the so-called Taylor-Görtler vortices. A <b>viscous</b> stability <b>criterion</b> is derived and compared to numerical results obtained for various libration frequencies and Ekman numbers. The strongly nonlinear regime well above the instability threshold is also documented. We show that a new mechanism of spontaneous generation of inertial waves in the bulk could exist when the sidewall boundary layer becomes turbulent. Then, we analyse the librating flow below the instability threshold and characterize the mean zonal flow correction induced by the nonlinear interaction of the boundary layer flow with itself. In the frequency regime where inertial modes are not excited, we show that the mean flow correction in the bulk is a uniform rotation, independent of the Ekman number and cylinder aspect ratio, in perfect agreement with the analytical results of Wang [J. Fluid. Mech., 41, pp. 581 - 592, 1970]. When inertial modes are resonantly excited, the mean flow correction is {{found to have a}} more complex structure.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new class}} of {{fundamental}} waves arises in conservation laws that are not strictly hyperbolic. These waves serve as transitions between wave groups associated with particular characteristic families. Transitional shock waves are discontinuous solutions that possess viscous profiles but {{do not conform to}} the Lax characteristic criterion; they are sensitive to the precise form of the physical viscosity. Transitional rarefaction waves are rarefaction fans across which the characteristic family changes from faster to slower. This paper identifies an extensive family of transitional shock waves for conservation laws with quadratic fluxes and arbitrary viscosity matrices; this family comprises all transitional shock waves for a certain class of such quadratic models. The paper also establishes, for general systems of two conservation laws, the generic nature of rarefaction curves near an elliptic region, thereby identifying transitional rarefaction waves. The use of transitional waves in solving Riemann problems is illustrated by an example where the characteris-tic and <b>viscous</b> profile admissibility <b>criteria</b> yield distinct solutions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects by crash related car parameters on head and chest injury measures for 3 - and 12 -year-old children in near side impacts. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car which was impacted laterally by a barrier. The car model was validated in two crash conditions: the IIHS and the USNCAP side impact tests. The SID-IIs and the HBM 3 (THUMS 3 -yo) finite element models were used for the parametric investigation (HBM 3 on a booster). The car parameters were: vehicle mass, side impact structure stiffness, a head airbag, a thorax-pelvis airbag, and a seat belt with pretensioner. The studied dependent variables were: resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion,</b> rib deflection, and relative velocity at head impact. The chest measurements were only considered for the SID-IIs. Results: The head airbag had the greatest effect on the head measurements for both of the occupant models. On average, it reduced the peak head linear acceleration by 54 g for the HBM 3 and 78 g for the SID-IIs. The seat belt had the second greatest effect on the head measurements; the peak head linear accelerations were reduced on average by 39 g (HBM 3) and 44 g (SID-IIs). The high stiffness side structure increased the SID-IIs head acceleration, while it had marginal effect on the HBM 3. The vehicle mass had marginal effect on SID-IIs head accelerations, while the lower vehicle mass caused 18 g higher head acceleration for HBM 3 and the greatest rotational acceleration. The thorax-pelvis airbag, the vehicle mass and the seat belt pretensioner affected the chest measurements the most. The presence of a thorax-pelvis airbag, high vehicle mass and a seat belt pretensioner all reduced the chest VC and peak rib deflection in the SID-IIs. Conclusions: The head and thorax-pelvis airbags have the potential to reduce injury measurements for both the SID-IIs and the HBM 3, provided that the airbag properties are designed to consider these occupant sizes also. The seat belt pretensioner is also effective, provided that the lateral translation of the torso is managed by other features. The importance of lateral movement management is greater the smaller the occupant is. Light vehicles require interior restraint systems of higher performance than heavy vehicles do to achieve the same level of injury measures for a given side structure...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and propose improvements to the injury mitigation systems, in near-side impacts, for 6 common sitting positions of young adolescents using a previously validated model. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car, including head and thorax–pelvis air bags, which was impacted laterally by a barrier in 2 load cases. The SID-IIs finite element model was used for the evaluations and was seated in 6 different positions in the rear outboard seat: the nominal anthropomorphic test device (ATD) position, 1 inboard position, 3 outboard positions, and 1 braking (forward) position. These positions have previously been identified as common sitting positions in awake and asleep children. The studied dependent variables were head injury criterion (HIC) 36, resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion,</b> and chest deflection. Results: The lowest head injury measures were seen in the braking positions and in the nominal ATD position, and the highest were seen in the inboard and outboard positions. The lowest chest injury measures were recorded in the inboard and nominal ATD positions, and the highest were recorded in the outboard and braking positions. The occupant in the outboard positions interfered with the air bags during their deployment. The occupant in inboard and braking positions tended to push the curtain air bag over the windowsill. Conclusions: Studies that investigate the injury mitigation effects in common sitting positions, beyond the nominal ATD position, are essential to highlight means to provide improved and robust safety for child occupants. This study was based on the SID-IIs 5 th percentile female, which has very similar anthropometry to a 50 th percentile 12 -year-old. Therefore, the conclusions of this study are applicable to many 11 -year-olds up to young adolescents, as well as to small females. The outboard and inboard positions of this study resulted in the highest head injury measures. Although all of the injury measures were only slightly higher than the nominal position, the trends suggest that, in near-side impacts, these positions should be discouraged. The extensively outboard positions resulted in unfavorable air bag positioning during deployment. The inboard position resulted in head strikes further forward of the nominal one; the curtain air bags need inflated cells at all locations of head strike...|$|E
40|$|These last {{decades have}} seen the {{development}} of a new type of weapons, the non lethal weapons. Unlike the conventional weapons which may cause severe or fatal injuries and whose injury mechanisms are well documented, the non lethal weapons are designed for temporary incapacitation with reversible consequences or minor damage to the human body. They try therefore to fill the gap wherever the use of excessive forces or conventional weapons is not necessary. There are various non lethal technologies but here we will focus on non lethal kinetic energy weapons (NLKEW). The non penetrating characteristics of non lethal projectiles lead to different injury mechanisms to those related to conventional lethal projectiles. In order to better understand these effects and assess the injury severity, experiments are carried out on Post Mortem Human Surrogates (PMHS), animals and mechanical anthropomorphic systems. Nevertheless nowadays with the development of high performance computing systems, numerical simulations based on finite element method are increasingly used because of their cost-effectiveness, their predictive capabilities and their adaptability (for example the possibility of adapting the geometry to take into account various morphologies, …). Physical injury is a consequence of the interaction between the human body and the projectile. To assess the severity of injury, injury criteria are defined. The most used criterion on the assessment of the thorax injury is the maximum <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion.</b> Because of the human body complexity, reliable information on injury mechanisms and tolerance level to the impact of non lethal projectiles is limited. The major challenge in the numerical simulations is the human tissue material model as human tissue responses to impacts are various and complex. As a consequence, models which are biofidelic to the human living tissues are a key issue. To investigate and predict the human thorax response to the impact of the usual non lethal kinetic projectiles (like the FN 303, the 40 mm COUGAR), a finite element thorax model has been developed from thorax CT-scan images and the projectile FN 303 was used. The model was validated by using results (force-time and deflection-time characteristics of the thorax) from experiments on PHMS published in the litterature. Two types of projectiles made of polyvinyl chloride cylinder with 37 mm diameter and respectively 28. 5 mm and 100 mm long were used and the human tissue material models were found in open litterature...|$|E

And a nonlinear viscous time dependent model is developed to evaluate the importance of time dependence and nonlinear effects on the development of the gravity wave-critical level interaction. Results obtained with the three models indicate that a number of effects may be important in correctly modelling the gravity wave-~ritica 1 level interaction. Viscosity and heat conduction tend to stabilize the interaction and can, if sufficiently large, prevent the formation of unstable velocity shears. A <b>Viscous</b> Stability <b>Criterion</b> is obtained and its predictions are found to be consistent with observations in a number of laboratory, atmospheric, and oceanic critical level flows. Nonlinear and time dependent effects are found to be important in gravity wave-critical level interactions in which unstable velocity shears are formed. Such an unstable critical level interaction develops long thin nearly horizontal regions of unstable velocity shear which break down through the development and growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. This suggests that the gravity wave-critical level interaction may be responsible for some of the thin turbulent layers observed at various levels in the atmosphere and the oceans.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} solutions of hyperbolic Riemann problems {{that arise in}} situations when weak self-similar solutions consisting of constant states, rarefaction waves and/or jump discontinuities that satisfy the <b>viscous</b> profile entropy <b>criterion,</b> do not exist. We concentrate on two models: the shallow water equations and on a three-phase flow model derived from petroleum engineering. For these two models we consider hyperbolic Riemann initial data that correspond to Lax shocks that do not admit viscous profiles due {{to the presence of}} limit cycles in the dynamical system associated with the admissibility criterion. We show that in these two models, solutions exhibiting continuously generated oscillations take place and satisfy the inviscid system of conservation laws in a measure-valued sense. To show the main result of this work we study Riemann solutions of inviscid systems of conservation laws obtained in the singular limit of the associated parabolic systems. We solve the parabolic problems numerically and prove that the inviscid limit of numerical solutions of the parabolic problems is a measure-valued solution of the hyperbolic conservation law.

40|$|TAnti-personnel Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) are {{weapons that}} are {{designed}} to impart sufficient effect onto a person in order to deter uncivil, suspect or hazardous behaviour with a low probability of severe or fatal injury. They are used both by military and law enforcement in situations of low-intensity conflicts like riot control, access denial, peacekeeping missions i. e. situations where the use of lethal force is not appropriate nor desired. The most used of these weapons are the Kinetic Energy Non-Lethal Weapons (KENLW). The underlying principle of KENLW is to launch a projectile with a mass varying between 5 g and 140 g at initial velocity up to 160 m/s, which by a mechanical action on the target, will cause enough physical pain to incapacitate or repel the target. But their use is not without risk as in practice, the impacts of Kinetic Energy Non-Lethal (KENL) projectiles on the human thorax resulted in injuries, some of the them were severe even fatal. Therefore {{there is a need to}} develop methods of assessment. These assessment methods are essential in order to help deciders in charge of non- lethal weapon procurement with technical information so they can choose the best product (weapon or projectile) available on the market; to give relevant information to the manufacturers in either developing new weapons or projectiles that are more effective, or improving the existing ones, and finally to the end-users (military or police forces) of these weapons, information on operational distance of engagement. In practice, it has been observed that the thorax is the body region where the impacts of KNL projectiles led to more significant injuries than other parts of the body apart from the head which is never targeted at. Therefore in the present thesis, only assessment of thoracic impacts is investigated. Besides tests on PMHS (Post Mortem Human Subjects), animals or human surrogates, one powerful tool that is used nowadays to assess the thoracic impacts is the finite element method (FEM). It has many advantages like the capability of accounting for complex geometries or complex material modelling and its cost-effectiveness. It also gives insight into physical variables (stresses, strains, [...] .) inside the material which are inaccessible by other means. It helps for a better understanding of the injury mechanism. Moreover, it helps to reduce cadavers or animal testings. In the present thesis, only FEM is considered as tool for injury risk assessment. On the one hand, a thorax finite element (FE) model, the SHTIM (Surrogate Human Thorax Impact Model) has been developed for the injury risk assessment. Number of assumptions has been made relative to the thorax geometry and the material characteristics are based on literature. The model has been validated thanks to the results of experiments carried out by professor C. Bir. A <b>viscous</b> injury <b>criterion</b> was defined as the parameter relevant for the occurrence of the thorax skeletal injury. This criterion is used in the present thesis for the prediction of the thoracic injury outcome. On the other hand, FE models of six projectiles have been developed where most of material characteristics were taken from the literature. For the 40 mm sponge grenades, a new method of characterizing the deformable nose has been developed. The projectile FE models were validated by comparing numerical results to experimental results obtained from real firing tests of the projectile against a rigid wall structure. These firing tests have been performed within the Department ABAL. Good correspondence was found. Once the thorax FE model and the projectile FE models validated, numerical simulations of the impact between the thorax and the projectile were performed. Using the <b>viscous</b> injury <b>criterion,</b> risk assessment of the thorax impacts was carried out. For each projectile, a critical velocity was determined which thanks to the retardation can be linked to a minimum firing distance, the safe distance. This is the distance below which an impact will result in a higher risk of skeletal thoracic injury. This information is very important for the end-users (military, police). Moreover comparison of the performance of different KENL projectiles was carried out. Few years ago, the Department ABAL acquired a thorax mechanical surrogate, the 3 RBID (3 Rib Ballistic Impact Dummy) for the prediction of thoracic injury. It was an opportunity to compare both surrogates and to see if the SHTIM results are consistent with the 3 RBID results. Good correspondence has been found especially for projectiles with larger diameter like the 40 mm sponge grenades...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The main aim of {{this study}} was to improve the quality of injury risk {{assessments}} in steering wheel rim to chest impacts when using the Hybrid III crash test dummy in frontal heavy goods vehicle (HGV) collision tests. Correction factors for chest injury criteria were calculated as the model chest injury parameter ratios between finite element (FE) Hybrid III, evaluated in relevant load cases, and the Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS). This is proposed to be used to compensate Hybrid III measurements in crash tests where steering wheel rim to chest impacts occur. Methods: The study was conducted in an FE environment using an FE-Hybrid III model and the THUMS. Two impactor shapes were used, a circular hub and a long, thin horizontal bar. Chest impacts at velocities ranging from 3. 0 to 6. 0 m/s were simulated at 3 impact height levels. A ratio between FE-Hybrid III and THUMS chest injury parameters, maximum chest compression C-max, and maximum <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion</b> VCmax, were calculated for the different chest impact conditions to form a set of correction factors. The definition of the correction factor is based on the assumption that the response from a circular hub impact to the middle of the chest is well characterized and that injury risk measures are independent of impact height. The current limits for these chest injury criteria were used as a basis to develop correction factors that compensate for the limitations in biofidelity of the Hybrid III in steering wheel rim to chest impacts. Results: The hub and bar impactors produced considerably higher C-max and VCmax responses in the THUMS compared to the FE-Hybrid III. The correction factor for the responses of the FE-Hybrid III showed that the criteria responses for the bar impactor were consistently overestimated. Ratios based on Hybrid III and THUMS responses provided correction factors for the Hybrid III responses ranging from 0. 84 to 0. 93. These factors can be used to estimate C-max and VCmax values when the Hybrid III is used in crash tests for which steering wheel rim to chest interaction occurs. Conclusions: For the FE-Hybrid III, bar impacts caused higher chest deflection compared to hub impacts, although the contrary results were obtained with the more humanlike THUMS. Correction factors were developed that can be used to correct the Hybrid III chest responses. Higher injury criteria capping limits for steering wheel impacts are acceptable.

40|$|Occupant {{thoracic}} injury incurred during {{side impact}} automotive crashes constitutes {{a significant portion}} of all fatal and non-fatal automotive injuries. The limited space between the impacting vehicle and occupant can result in significant loads and corresponding injury prior to deceleration of the impacting vehicle. Within the struck vehicle, impact occurs between the occupant and various interior components. Injury is sustained to human structural components such as the thoracic cage or shoulder, and to the internal visceral components such as the heart, lungs, or aorta. Understanding the mechanism behind these injuries is an important step in improving the side impact crash safety of vehicles. This study is focused on the development of a human body numerical model for the purpose of predicting thoracic response and trauma in side impact automotive crash. The human body model has been created using a previously developed thoracic numerical model, originally used for predicting thoracic trauma under simple impact conditions. The original version of the thorax model incorporated three-dimensional finite element representations of the spine, ribs, heart, lungs, major blood vessels, rib cage surface muscles and upper limbs. The present study began with improvements to the original thorax model and furthered with the development of remaining body components such that the model could be assessed in side impact conditions. The improvements to the thoracic model included improved geometry and constitutive response of the surface muscles, shoulder and costal cartilage. This detailed thoracic model was complimented with a pelvis, lower limbs, an abdomen and a head to produce the full body model. These components were implemented in a simplified fashion to provide representative response without significant computational costs. The model was developed and evaluated in a stepwise fashion using experimental data from the literature including side abdominal and pelvic pendulum impact tests. The accuracy of the model response was investigated using experimental testing performed on post mortem human subjects (PMHS) during side and front thoracic pendulum impacts. The model produced good agreement for the side thoracic and side shoulder pendulum impact tests and reasonable correlation during the frontal thoracic pendulum impact test. Complex loading via side sled impact tests was then investigated where the body was loaded unbelted in a NHTSA-type and WSU-type side sled test system. The thorax response was excellent when considering force, compression and injury (<b>viscous</b> <b>criterion)</b> versus time. Compression in the thorax was influenced by the arm position, which when aligned with the coronal plane produced the most aggressive form of compressive loading possible. The simplified components provided good response, falling slightly outside experimental response corridors defined as one standard deviation from the average of the experimental PMHS data. Overall, the predicted model response showed reasonable agreement with the experimental data, {{while at the same time}} highlighting areas for future developments. The results from this study suggested that the numerical finite element model developed herein could be used as a powerful tool for improving side impact automotive safety...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} injuries following car-to-car side collisions. The injuries {{in this type of}} impact have been evaluated to form the basis for the development of test methods and for the principles of protective systems. Side impacts give rise to relatively more severe injuries than frontal impacts. The study has shown that the neck and the legs of the struck side occupant need to be better protected due to a high risk of permanent disabilities. The head, chest and abdomen/pelvis need to be better protected from a risk of life-threatening injuries. It has also been found that chest injuries increase significantly with age. Improved protection in side impacts can be achieved with car body/door reinforcements and compliant bolstering (padding and/or airbag) {{on the inside of the}} door. In order to develop and evaluate the principles of such protective systems a subsystem sled test method that simulates full-scale test conditions has been developed. The BioSid dummy was used. The use of a chest airbag (8 litre and unventilated) resulted in significantly lower loadings to the chest compared to (50 mm thick) compliant chest padding of polyethylene foam type, and significantly lower loadings to the head, neck and abdomen than a stiff reference door. Pelvis padding (75 mm thick) of the same material effectively reduced the pelvic loads. Both the acceleration based chest injury criterion TTI and the deformation based criterion VC were considerably reduced compared to a stiff door. The head ejection through the side window frame was reduced by an average of 30 mm. To further enhance the protection level, the airbag was increased to 12 litres in volume to cover both the chest and the abdomen down to the door armrest level. The effect of bag pressure and bag ventilation was investigated at two side impact severities. The ventilation of the bag reduced the maximum chest deflection by 30 % and the maximum chest <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion,</b> VC, by 50 % (comparison was made with the same bag without ventilation). A suitable initial bag (over) pressure was found to be about 40 kPa, when the loading of the abdomen was also taken into consideration. The deflection based criteria were found to be very sensitive to the door velocity. The stiffness of the bag corresponds to the tolerance level of the thorax of elderly people. The 12 litre ventilated side airbag resulted in 30 - 40 % lower chest deflection and about 60 % lower VC than 50 mm of another compliant chest padding material (Ethafoam 220 of polyethylene foam). TTI was 30 - 45 % lower. The findings from the evaluation of the airbag (size, initial pressure, ventilation) are also applicable to seat mounted side airbags of the type Autoliv has developed together with Volvo. To further improve the protection of the head/neck in side impacts a supplementary protective device "the curtain" at the side window has been proposed. In an investigation carried out together with the Birmingham University it was found that the optimum location for a side airbag sensor is the rear lower quadrant of the front door. A sensor located in this sector would cover almost 90 % of the impacts with risk of AIS 3 + injuries. A pendulum subsystem test method for the evaluation of sensors for side airbags has been developed and validated against low speed full-scale tests. The method has been used for evaluation of a pyrotechnical sensor. The sensor fires at impact speeds above 15 - 20 km/h, when there is a risk of life threatening (AIS 3 +) injuries to struck side occupants and not at low impact speeds (7 km/h), when the risk of injury is minimal. The principle finding in the study was that protective systems in side impacts must be softer than the corresponding human body segments. This was best accomplished with a ventilated side airbag for the chest and the abdomen (down to the armrest level) and padding for the pelvis and the leg. The proposed "curtain" will further enhance the head/neck protection...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there have}} been {{tremendous}} improvements in crash safety {{there has been an}} increasing trend in side impact fatalities, rising from 30 % to 37 % of total fatalities from 1975 to 2004 (NHTSA, 2004). Between 1979 and 2004, 63 % of AIS≥ 4 injuries in side impact resulted from thoracic trauma (NHTSA, 2004). Lateral impact fatalities, although decreasing in absolute numbers, now comprise a larger percentage of total fatalities. Safety features are typically more effective in frontal collisions compared to side impact due to the reduced distance between the occupant and intruding vehicle in side impact collisions. Therefore, an increased understanding of the mechanisms governing side impact injury is necessary in order to improve occupant safety in side impact auto crash. This study builds on an advanced numerical human body model with focus on a detailed thoracic model, which has been validated using available post mortem human subject (PMHS) test data for pendulum and side sled impact tests (Forbes, 2005). Crash conditions were investigated through use of a modified side sled model used to reproduce the key conditions present in full scale crash tests. The model accounts for several important factors that contribute to occupant response based on the literature. These factors are; the relative velocities between the seat and door, the occupant to door distance, the door shape and compliance. The side sled model was validated by reproducing the crash conditions present in FMVSS 214 and IIHS side impact tests and comparing the thoracic compression, velocity, and <b>Viscous</b> <b>Criterion</b> (VC) response determined by the model to the response of the ES- 2 dummy used in the crash tests. Injury was predicted by evaluating VCmax, selected for its ability to predict rate-sensitive soft tissue injury during thoracic compression (Lau & Viano, 1986). The Ford Taurus FMVSS 214 and Nissan Maxima IIHS tests were selected from side impact crash test data found in the NHTSA database because they included factors not present in standard side impact test procedures. These factors were; the presence of door accelerometers used to provide input velocities to the side impact model and the use of a ES- 2 (rather than the SID) to facilitate comparison of VC response to the human body model. Also, the two crash test procedures (FMVSS 214 & IIHS) were selected to ensure accurate side impact model response to different impact scenarios. The side impact model was shown to closely reproduce the timing and injury response of the full-scale FMVSS 214 side impact test of a Ford Taurus, as well as the IIHS side impact test of a Nissan Maxima. The side impact model was then used to investigate the effects of door to occupant spacing, door velocity profile, armrest height, seat foam, restraint system, and arm position. It was found that the VCmax was controlled by both the first and second peaks typically found in door velocity profiles, but the effect of each varies depending on the situation. This study found that VCmax was reduced by 73 - 88 % when door intrusion was eliminated compared to the VC response incurred by an intruding door. Also, the presence of a deformable door based on physical geometry and material characteristics rather than a simplified rigid door reduced VCmax by 16 % in this study. The study on seat foam determined that significant effects on VC response can be made by modest adjustments in foam properties. Low stiffness seat foam was found to increase VCmax by 41 % when compared to the VC response when using high stiffness foam. Arm position has been proven to be a relevant factor in side impact crash. Positioning the arms parallel to the thorax, in the “down” position, caused a 42 % increase in VCmax when compared to the VC response determined with the arms positioned at 45 degrees. Finally, although restraint systems have limited influence on side impact crash safety compared to front and rear impacts, this study found that the presence of a pre-tensioning restraint system reduced VCmax by 13 % when compared to the VC response of an un-belted occupant. It {{should be noted that the}} current study was limited to velocity profiles obtained from a specific FMVSS 214 test and therefore results and observations are restricted to the confines of the input conditions used. However, the side impact model developed is a useful tool for evaluating factors influencing side impact and can be used to determine occupant response in any side impact crash scenario when the appropriate input conditions are provided...|$|E
