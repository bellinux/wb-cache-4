500|$|Director Adam Smith, new to Doctor Who, felt {{pressure}} {{in making the}} episode be a worthy sequel to [...] "Blink", which he called a [...] "brilliant, brilliant, brilliant episode", but also {{said that it was}} great to work with the Weeping Angels. He decided to have the interaction between the Doctor and River Song resemble that of an old married couple, bickering like [...] "mum and dad arguing over directions in the car". Actress Alex Kingston stated that it was [...] "great fun" [...] on set and she enjoyed working with Matt Smith, although her relationship with Smith was different from his predecessor and her former co-star, David Tennant. In the script it was not written in that River would land on the Doctor when she flew into the TARDIS; it was an idea that Matt Smith came up with in rehearsal that proved difficult to film. In the episode, there is a moment in the <b>viewing</b> <b>room</b> where the Doctor hangs on a strap attached to the ceiling and it breaks. This was originally an accident during one of the takes, but director Adam Smith liked it and filmed it again, with Matt Smith doing it on purpose.|$|E
