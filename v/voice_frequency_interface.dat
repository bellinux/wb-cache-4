40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Oxandrolone (Ox) {{increases}} {{height gain}} {{but may also}} cause voice deepening in growth hormone (GH) -treated girls with Turner syndrome (TS). We assessed the effect of Ox on objective and subjective speaking <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> in GH-treated girls with TS. STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, placebo (Pl) -controlled, double-blind study was conducted. METHODS: One hundred thirty-three patients were included and treated with GH (1. 33 mg/m 2 /d) from baseline, combined with Pl or Ox in a low (0. 03 mg/kg/d) or conventional (0. 06 mg/kg/d) dose {{from the age of}} 8 years and estrogens from the age of 12 years. Yearly from starting Ox/Pl until 6 months after discontinuing GH+Ox/Pl, voices were recorded and questionnaires were completed. RESULTS: At start, mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> SD score (SDS) was high for age (1. 0 +/- 1. 2, P< 0. 001) but normal for height. Compared with GH+Pl, voices tended to lower on GH+Ox 0. 03 (P= 0. 09) and significantly lowered on GH+Ox 0. 06 (P= 0. 007). At the last measurement, <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> SDS was still relatively high in GH+Pl group (0. 6 +/- 0. 7, P= 0. 002) but similar to healthy girls in both GH+Ox groups. <b>Voice</b> <b>frequency</b> became lower than - 2 SDS in one patient (3 %) on GH+Ox 0. 03 and three patients (11 %) on GH+Ox 0. 06. The percentage of patients reporting subjective voice deepening was similar between the dosage groups. CONCLUSIONS: Untreated girls with TS have relatively high-pitched voices. The addition of Ox to GH decreases <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> in a dose-dependent way. Although most <b>voice</b> <b>frequencies</b> remain within the normal range, they may occasionally become lower than - 2 SDS, especially on GH+Ox 0. 06 mg/kg/d...|$|R
50|$|In telephony, the usable <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> band {{ranges from}} {{approximately}} 300 Hz to 3400 Hz. It {{is for this}} reason that the ultra low frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum between 300 and 3000 Hz is also referred to as <b>voice</b> <b>frequency,</b> being the electromagnetic energy that represents acoustic energy at baseband. The bandwidth allocated for a single voice-frequency transmission channel is usually 4 kHz, including guard bands, allowing a sampling rate of 8 kHz to be used as the basis of the pulse code modulation system used for the digital PSTN. Per the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, the sampling frequency (8 kHz) must be at least twice the highest component of the <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> via appropriate filtering prior to sampling at discrete times (4 kHz) for effective reconstruction of the voice signal.|$|R

50|$|The wartime {{upgrading}} {{of telecommunications}} from Townsville to Thursday Island was a dedicated defence facility, but was linked {{directly to the}} 1880s overland telegraph. An R Type Carrier System, developed in Australia during World War II to cater for pockets of telecommunications traffic congestion, particularly in places where a telephone carrier was not available to supply a channel for a <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> system, was installed along the old overland telegraph route from Mount Surprise to Cape York. The R Type system was limited to four duo-directional channels using a frequency between 3300 and 5220 cycles per second, which was above normal <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> but below the range of other established carrier systems, which used high frequency bands. There was no interference when both normal speech frequency and the carrier frequency operated over the same pair of copper wires.

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} dial-up modems, which modulate bits into {{signals in}} the 300-3400 Hz baseband (voice service), DSL modems modulate frequencies from 4000 Hz to {{as high as}} 4 MHz. This frequency band separation enables DSL service and {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) to coexist on the same copper pair facility. On the subscriber's end of the circuit, inline low-pass DSL filters (splitters) are installed on each telephone to filter the high-frequency signals that would otherwise be heard as hiss, but pass <b>voice</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Conversely, high-pass filters already incorporated in the circuitry of DSL modems filter out <b>voice</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Although ADSL and RADSL modulations do not use the voice-frequency band, nonlinear elements in the phone could otherwise generate audible intermodulation and may impair the operation of the data modem in the absence of high-pass filters.|$|R

5000|$|To {{recover the}} {{original}} {{signal from the}} sampled data, a [...] "demodulator" [...] can apply the procedure of modulation in reverse. After each sampling period, the demodulator reads the next value and shifts the output signal to the new value. As {{a result of these}} transitions, the signal has a significant amount of high-frequency energy caused by aliasing. To remove these undesirable frequencies and leave the original signal, the demodulator passes the signal through analog filters that suppress energy outside the expected frequency range (greater than the Nyquist frequency [...] ). The sampling theorem shows PCM devices can operate without introducing distortions within their designed frequency bands if they provide a sampling frequency twice that of the input signal. For example, in telephony, the usable <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> band ranges from approximately 300 Hz to 3400 Hz. Therefore, according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, the sampling frequency (8 kHz) must be at least twice the <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> (4 kHz) for effective reconstruction of the voice signal.|$|R
