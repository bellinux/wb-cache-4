5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve,</b> increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of parasympathetic innervation to {{a very large number of}} structures. Major effects of damage to the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> is rare, but can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The somatic motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and pharyngeal {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve. Fibers cross over to and join the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> in the jugular foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular ganglion, and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|E

40|$|Ghrelin, an {{endogenous}} appetite hormone, is secreted {{from the}} gastro-intestinal tract, and the ghrelin-induced appetite is conveyed through the afferent <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves.</b> However, {{it has not}} been elucidated how the orexigenic sensation produced by ghrelin is transmitted to the afferent <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> that innervate gastro-intestinal tract. To address this issue, ghrelin-induced food intake in Wister rats was evaluated in {{the presence or absence of}} vagal denervation or the administration of a type- 3 serotonin receptor antagonist ramosetoron. Cumulative food intake was significantly increased 1 hr and 2 hr after the intraperitoneally-applied ghrelin (20 μg/kg). Desensitization of C-fiber of the afferent <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> by intraperitoneally-applied capsaicin completely abolished the increases in the ghrelin-induced food intake. Surgical vagotomy of the hepatic or gastric branches markedly suppressed the ghrelin-evoked feeding. Furthermore, pretreatment with ramosetoron also significantly suppressed the ghrelin-evoked feeding. Stimulatory effects of ghrelin on the appetite were transient and the overall food intake was comparable after 24 hr among all groups. These data suggest that 1) exogenous ghrelin rapidly promotes feeding, but such feeding lasts no more than 2 hr; 2) afferent C-fiber of the hepatic or gastric <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> appear to convey ghrelininduced hungry sensation to the brain; 3) type- 3 serotonin receptors at the nerve endings of the C-fiber of the gastric or hepatic afferent <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> may involve in transmitting the ghrelin-evoked hungry sensation...|$|R
40|$|The binding of staphylococcal [125 I]alpha-toxin to rabbit <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> {{in vitro}} was a saturable process. The radiolabeled alpha-toxin binding was {{reduced by the}} coaddition of added navive alpha-toxin, {{indicating}} that the binding is specific. Sucrose gradient analysis of detergent-extracted complexes of [125 I]alpha-toxin-rabbit <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> showed both high and low S-value peaks analogous to those observed with similarly treated alpha-toxin-rabbit erythrocyte preparations (P. Cassidy and S. Harshman, Biochemistry, in press) ...|$|R
5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> (X) {{provides}} sensory and autonomic (parasympathetic) motor innervation to {{structures in}} the neck and also {{to most of the}} organs in the chest and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve.</b> Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve.</b> Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E

5|$|Neurostimulation may {{be another}} option in {{those who are not}} {{candidates}} for surgery. Three types {{have been shown to be}} effective in those who do not respond to medications: <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> stimulation, anterior thalamic stimulation, and closed-loop responsive stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Taste is {{generated}} from receptors {{on the tongue}} and passed along the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves into the solitary tract in the brainstem. Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve.</b> Information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the gustatory cortex.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E

5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve.</b> When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} duct, which drains {{the majority}} of the body's lymph, passes behind the esophagus, curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in {{the lower part of the}} esophagus, to lying behind the esophagus on the left in the upper esophagus. The esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side. The <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus.|$|E
5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from {{the left side of the}} aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E

40|$|Transabdominal fundoplication is an {{effective}} operation for control of gastroesophageal reflux {{in the majority of}} patients. The operation is, however, associated with several sell-documented early and late complications. Recently, a few reports have appeared describing benign gastric ulceration (GU) occurring from one month to several years postplication. The etiology of GU in this setting is unknown, but preexisting delayed gastric emptying, pyloric incompetence, faulty wrap construction, local ischemia, and trauma to the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> have been incriminated. During a recent seven-year period, five cases of GU have occurred among a series of 158 patients who underwent fundoplication. The cases are cited in detail, and the recent literature is reviewed. Discussion is addressed to the various proposed factors and combination of factors thought to contribute to GU. Suggestions are included for the preoperative evaluation of patients with gastroesophageal reflux as an aid to intraoperative management. As trauma to the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> has been frequently mentioned as a contributing factor to postplication ulcer, an operative technique is described in which the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> are isolated and protected from the fundic wrap...|$|R
50|$|The {{upper part}} of the {{posterior}} district of the medulla oblongata is occupied by the inferior cerebellar peduncle, a thick rope-like strand situated between {{the lower part of the}} fourth ventricle and the roots of the glossopharyngeal and <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve.</b> It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve.</b> The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this {{is the result of a}} direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{accessory}} nerve {{is described as}} having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before branching off of the nerve to join the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve.</b> A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that {{in the majority of}} individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject.|$|E
30|$|Repair of disordered functions.

40|$|In this article, {{the example}} of the {{mechanisms}} of heart rhythmogenesis in the intact organism is used to demonstrate the new capabilities provided by an integrative approach. It is shown that the rhythm is formed in the brain, transmitted to the heart in the form of signals along the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> and reproduces the heart. Evidence: the heart rhythm reproduces the natural efferent signals in the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> in the cardio-respiratory synchronism and in the intact organism sino-atrial node performs the functions of the latent pacemaker. Integration of the two hierarchical levels of rhythmogenesis (brain and intracardiac) provides the reliability and functional perfection of cardiac rhythm generation in the body. It is expedient to extend the presented methodology for scientific analysis to other organism systems...|$|R
40|$|The cephalic {{phase of}} gastric acid {{secretion}} {{has been a}} topic {{of great interest to}} physiologists and physicians since its description by Pavlov 100 years ago. 1 In classic “sham” feeding studies performed on dogs equipped with an oesophageal stoma and a gastric fistula, Pavlov demon-strated that food was a prompt and powerful stimulant of gastric secretion. This stimulation occurred {{despite the fact that the}} ingested food entered the dog’s mouth and pharynx and exited through the stoma, never actually reaching the stomach. Pavlov went on to demonstrate that severing the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves</b> just above the diaphragm abolished the gastric acid secretory response to sham feed-ing in dogs. His experiments demonstrated that sham feeding elicited a potent gastric acid secretory response via the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerves...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges}} from the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to one part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy may occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, <b>vagus</b> <b>nerve</b> stimulation and the ketogenic diet.|$|E
