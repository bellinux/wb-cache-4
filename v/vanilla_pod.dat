To {{the best of}} our knowledge, the glucose, cresol, capsaicin, and vanillyl alcohol pathways have not yet been reported in any vanilla curing process. However, these pathways have wide range of distribution in microbial metabolism. Therefore, microorganisms may have participated in vanillin biosynthesis during the curing of vanilla.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The {{traditional}} curing of <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> includes "killing" {{and sweating}} steps when pods {{are exposed to}} heat (35 - 65 degrees C) for various lengths of time. Although {{it is known that}} liberation of vanillin and other phenolics from their non- aromatic glucosides is due to the action of an endogenous beta-glucosidase, its in vivo kinetics remained unknown. Materials and methods. Mature green <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> were pretreated for 2 h at 50 degrees C, 55 degrees C and 60 degrees C, then stored for 118 days at 27 degrees C. Phenolic glucosides and their aglycons were extracted at regular intervals during the storage period and analyzed by HPLC. Results and discussion. All phenolic beta-glucosides were slowly hydrolyzed during the storage period with production of vanillin, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillic acid, and other unknown aglycons. Most of the beta-glucosidase was heat-denatured by the pretreatment, and analysis of its kinetic parameters showed that it adopts, in vivo, an allosteric mode of functioning with a lower affinity for glucovanillin than in vitro, where it behaves as a Michaelian enzyme. Conclusion. Extensive research is needed to confirm the allosteric mechanism of the vanilla beta-glucosidase in vivo...|$|R

30|$|Vanilla is a {{tropical}} orchid, which originated in Mexico (Lubinsky et al. 2008). It {{is one of}} the most important and popular aromatic compound used in food, beverages, and cosmetics (Kaur and Chakraborty 2013; Korthou and Verpoorte 2007). The fruit of a fully grown and mature vanilla is called <b>vanilla</b> <b>pod.</b> Vanilla pods are flavorless, but develop a characteristic aroma during the curing process. Traditional curing process generally comprises four steps, namely killing, sweating, drying, and conditioning. Vanilla bean refers to the <b>vanilla</b> <b>pod</b> after the curing process (Frenkel et al. 2011; Mariezcurrena et al. 2008; Sreedhar et al. 2009).|$|E
30|$|A {{previous}} study {{has shown that}} the colonizing Bacillus isolates produce β-d-glucosidase, which mediates glucovanillin hydrolysis and influences flavor formation (Chen et al. 2015).

40|$|Vanillin is {{a popular}} and {{valuable}} flavour compound. It is the key constituent of the natural vanilla flavour obtained from cured vanilla pods. Here we show that a single hydratase/lyase type enzyme designated vanillin synthase (VpVAN) catalyses direct conversion of ferulic acid and its glucoside into vanillin and its glucoside, respectively. The enzyme shows high sequence similarity to cysteine proteinases and is specific to the substitution pattern at the aromatic ring and does not metabolize caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid as demonstrated by coupled transcription/translation assays. VpVAN localizes to the inner part of the <b>vanilla</b> <b>pod</b> and high transcript levels are found in single cells located a few cell layers from the inner epidermis. Transient expression of VpVAN in tobacco and stable expression in barley {{in combination with the}} action of endogenous alcohol dehydrogenases and UDP-glucosyltransferases result in vanillyl alcohol glucoside formation from endogenous ferulic acid.

We report here quantitative data with respect to these three components {{in relation to the}} anatomy of the pod. Furthermore, the spatial progression of oxidation is shown. Materials and methods. Mature green vanilla pods were analyzed for their contents of phenolics (HPLC), and beta-glucosidase and peroxidase activities by spectrophotometric techniques using p-nitrophenyl glucoside and vanillin as substrates, respectively. Lipids were examined under fluorescence microscopy after Nile red staining. Oxidation development was observed on transverse slices of pods. Results and discussion.

40|$|Biphasic sonoelectroanalysis is {{employed}} in the detection of vanillin (4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzaldehyde). Ethyl acetoacetate is characterized as an electrochemical and sonoelectrochemical solvent and it is shown that quantitative electrochemical measurements {{can be made in}} this solvent of relatively low dielectric constant. The electrochemical oxidation of vanillin in this medium is shown to give oxidative linear sweep voltammetric signals sensitive to microadditions. In addition, the near reversible kinetics of vanillin in ethyl acetoacetate facilitate sensitive square-wave voltammetry. Electrode passivation leads to typically diminishing peak heights for the same concentration of vanillin, but by employing ultrasound between each scan, peak heights are maintained by quantitative depassivation of the electrode surface. Microadditions of 0. 05 mM vanillin to ethyl acetoacetate yield a linear calibration plot with r = 0. 9987 and a detection limit of 0. 016 mM. The determination of vanillin in natural vanilla essence is then achieved by the exploitation of biphasic sonoelectrovoltammetry in aqueous ethanolic <b>vanilla</b> <b>pod</b> extract and ethyl acetoacetate. In contrast with silent voltammetry, ultrasound facilitates emulsification and extraction of vanillin in the extract permitting an analytical square-wave voltammetric signal to be obtained. Micro-additions to two separate samples of vanilla essence facilitate quantification of vanillin in the extract. Close agreement with a blind analysis of the samples using HPLC-UV is observed with a limit of detection in the biphasic medium of 0. 020 mM. Biphasic sonoelectroanalysis removes the need for sample degradation or a separation step, which would lengthen and complicate the analytical protocol. It can therefore be concluded that biphasic sonoelectroanalysis demonstrates an attractive alternative to currently accepted techniques...|$|E

40|$|Production of {{vanillin}} {{from natural}} green <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> {{was carried out}} by enzyme-assisted extraction combined with pre-freezing and thawing. In the first step the green <b>vanilla</b> <b>pods</b> were pre-frozen and then thawed to destroy cellular compartmentation. In the second step pectinase from Aspergillus niger was used to hydrolyze the pectin between the glucovanillin substrate and β-glucosidase. Four main variables, including enzyme amount, reaction temperature, time and pH, which were of significance for the vanillin content were studied and a central composite design (CCD) {{based on the results of}} a single-factor tests was used. Response surface methodology based on CCD was employed to optimize the combination of enzyme amount, reaction temperature, time, and pH for maximum vanillin production.

30|$|The {{curing process}} is an {{essential}} procedure {{for the production of}} vanilla flavor. This process induces destruction of tissue organization and reduces <b>vanilla</b> <b>pod</b> moisture. Furthermore, it creates conditions which allow the free flow of compartmentalized cellular constituents, resulting in enzyme-substrate interactions (Frenkel et al. 2011). Various biochemical and chemical reactions, such as esterification, etherification, and oxidative degradation, take place during this period to produce volatile compounds (Uzio and Derbesy 1989). However, the variations, especially those relating to the metabolism of vanilla fruits, still remain poorly constrained (Palama et al. 2009, 2011). Previous studies mainly focused on volatile compounds of vanilla beans but not on the overall metabolic fingerprints of vanilla fruits (Zhang and Christoph 2012; Pérez-Silva et al. 2006). This study applied untargeted metabolomic and chemometric analysis, indicating a notable differentiation between vanilla pods and vanilla beans. As shown in Figs.  3 and 4, PCA and PLS-DA demonstrated a clear and statistically significant separation of vanilla pods and vanilla beans. The substantial changes were observed in the metabolite composition of vanilla beans. Results showed that the curing process could give rise to metabolite changes in vanilla beans even though they contained similar metabolites in vanilla pods. This could be attributed to the effect of the different environmental microbes during the curing process. As shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1, the stability of glucovanillin ion strength showed that it was mainly involved in the metabolic pathway of vanillin biosynthesis and did not participate in other metabolic ways during the curing process, and the ion strength divergence of the other compounds indicated they not only participated in the vanillin biosynthesis, but were also involved in other flavors formation by the microbial metabolism.|$|E
