5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it as a solution to detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a <b>visit</b> <b>by</b> Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up <b>visit</b> <b>by</b> Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} knowledge on child survival among mothers of children under {{five years of}} age living in nine municipalities in North and Northeast Brazil. A standardized questionnaire was used for home interviews of mothers <b>visited</b> <b>by</b> volunteers from the Pastorate of the Child and mothers not <b>visited</b> <b>by</b> the program (control areas).

This hinders the identification of more serious cases, delays seeking medical care, and reduces the impact on child morbidity and mortality...|$|R
5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler.

Domestically, the flag was not even used in protests against a new Status of Forces Agreement being negotiated between U.S. and Japan. The most common flag used by the trade unions and other protesters was the red flag of revolt.|$|E
