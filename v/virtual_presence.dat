Sita is never {{actually}} seen in the film, but her <b>virtual</b> <b>presence</b> is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a feminist perspective. It {{was shot in the}} interior tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. The roles of the epic heroes are played by Rama Chenchu tribal people, who claim lineage to the mythological Rama. Director Aravindan interweaves the Samkhya-Yoga philosophical concepts of Prakriti-Purusha bonds throughout the film.|$|E

The interaction between buyers and sellers in traditional, face-to-face markets creates phenomena such as social facilitation, where the presence of others impacts behaviour and performance. In the study involving Java-based Internet Dutch auction, the findings indicated that social facilitation does indeed occur and participants improve their results and stay longer in the auction under conditions of higher <b>virtual</b> <b>presence.</b> Participants also indicate a preference for auction arrangements with higher degrees of <b>virtual</b> <b>presence.</b>|$|E
50|$|Telepresence {{refers to}} a user {{interacting}} with another live, real place, and is distinct from <b>virtual</b> <b>presence,</b> where the user is given the impression {{of being in a}} simulated environment.

The main functional difference is the entity on the other end: a real environment in the case of telepresence, vs. a computer in the case of immersive virtual reality.|$|E

This paper presents the architecture of a modern platform to discover the structure, function, and operation of gangs through the lens of social media. Preliminary analysis of social media posts shared in the greater Chicago, IL region demonstrate the platform’s capability to understand gang members’ social media usage patterns...|$|R
