40|$|Heart failure (HF) is the {{end result}} of {{progressive}} and diverse biological adaptations within the diseased myocardium. We used cDNA microarrays and quantitative PCR to examine the transcriptomes of 38 left ventricles from failing and nonfailing human myocardium. After identification of a pool of putative HF-responsive candidate genes by microarrays on seven nonfailing and eight failing hearts, we used quantitative PCR and a general linear statistical model in a larger sample set (n = 34) to validate and examine the role of contributing biological variables (age and sex). We find that most HF-candidate genes (transcription factors, Cebpb, Npat; signaling molecules, Map 2 k 3, Map 4 k 5; extracellular matrix proteins, Lum, Cola 1; and metabolic enzymes, Mars) demonstrated significant changes in gene expression; however, the majority of differences among samples depended on variables such as sex and age, and not on HF alone. Some HF-responsive gene products also demonstrated highly significant changes in expression as a function of age and/or sex, but independent of HF (Ngp 1, Cd 163, and Npat).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel ac-dc {{power factor correction}} (PFC) power conversion architecture for single-phase grid interface. The proposed architecture has significant advantages for achieving high efficiency, good power factor, and converter miniaturization, especially in low-to-medium power applications. The architecture enables twice-line-frequency energy to be buffered at high voltage with a large voltage swing, enabling reduction in the energy buffer capacitor size, and elimination of electrolytic capacitors. While this architecture can be beneficial {{with a variety of}} converter topologies, it is especially suited for system miniaturization by enabling designs that operate at high frequency (HF, 3 – 30 MHz). Moreover, we introduce circuit implementations that provide efficient operation in this range. The proposed approach is demonstrated for an LED driver converter operating at a (<b>variable)</b> <b>HF</b> switching frequency (3 – 10 MHz) from 120 Vac, and supplying a 35 Vdc output at up to 30 W. The prototype converter achieves high efficiency (92 %) and power factor (0. 89), and maintains good performance over a wide load range. Owing to architecture and HF operation, the prototype achieves a high ‘box’ power density of 50 W/ in 3 (‘displacement’ power density of 130 W/ in 3), with miniaturized inductors, ceramic energy buffer capacitors, and a small-volume EMI filter.

40|$|The Jinshajiang ophiolitic mélange zone in {{southwest}} China represents {{a remnant of}} the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean. Field, geochronological and geochemical studies have identified two distinct suites of plagiogranites within the mélange, the Dongzhulin trondhjemite and Jiyidu tonalite, which represent rift and subduction settings, respectively, related to opening and closing of the ocean. SHRIMP U-Pb analysis on zircons extracted from the Dongzhulin trondhjemite yields a mean 206 Pb/ 238 U age of 347 ± 7 Ma. REE and isotopic characteristics suggest an origin from low pressure partial melting of an amphibolitic protolith. Highly <b>variable</b> <b>Hf</b> isotopic compositions for zircons from this body may indicate a heterogenous source involving both depleted mantle and enriched continental components. This, together with geologic relations, suggests formation near an embryonic spreading center in a continent-ocean transition setting. The Jiyidu tonalite has a U-Pb zircon age of 283 ± 3 Ma, and geochemical data indicates high Sr/Y, (La/Yb) N, Nb/Ta and low Y, and marked heavy REE depletion. These signatures suggest derivation from low degree partial melting of subducted slab at pressure high enough to stabilize garnet and rutile. A slab-melt origin is also supported by in situ Hf and O data for zircon that show isotopic compositions comparable with typical altered oceanic crust. Thus, the crystallization age of the Jiyidu high Sr/Y tonalite provides a constraint for the subduction of the Jinshajiang ocean floor. The rift-related Dongzhulin trondhjemite and subduction-related Jiyidu high-Sr/Y tonalite constrain the timing and setting of opening and closing of this segment of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean...|$|R
40|$|Miniopterus schreibersii natalensis and Miniopterus fraterculus  are two morphologically similar, but genetically distinct, {{species of}} insectivorous bat that, {{more often than}} not, share roosts. Identifying these two species {{in the field is}} {{difficult}} because of an overlap in the ranges of both forearm and mass. We thus attempted to find morphological features {{that could be used to}} distinguish between these two species in the field. We compared cranial and external morphological measurements from museum specimens of the two species, using principal component analysis and discriminant function analysis, to determine which variables could be used to discriminate between them. Length of the hind foot and total body length were used to discriminate between them. Length of the hind foot and total body length were identified as the variables responsible for most of the variation between these two species. Miniopterus s. natalensis has a longer total body length (113. 6 ± 3. 5 mm) than M. fraterculus (102. 2 ± 4. 8 mm) but a relatively shorter hind foot (9. 1 ± 0. 6 mm, 9. 8 ± 0. 8 mm, respectively).

For that, 20 dogs in stages B 1 (1), B 2 (14) and C 2 (5) of MVD (ACVIM classification) were divided into untrained control group (CG, n= 9) and training group (TG, n= 11), and assessed at baseline (T 0), after four (T 1) and eight weeks (T 2). Only one B 1 and five B 2 dogs completed the training program. In the time domain, the rMSSD was greater in TG in T 1 (155, 5 + 42, 07) and T 2 (199, 8 + 83, 54) than CG (T 1 : 91, 17 + 35, 79 and T 2 : 88, 17 + 57, 51).

40|$|The Wrangellia {{composite}} terrane {{is one of}} {{the largest}} fragments of juvenile crust added to the North American continent since Mesozoic time, and refining its accretionary history has important implications for understanding how continents grow. New U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons from Late Jurassic-Late Cretaceous strata from the forearc of the Wrangellia composite terrane allows more insight on the tectonic and paleogeographic history of the terrane. Our stratigraphically oldest samples from the Late Jurassic Naknek Formation have a detrital zircon U-Pb signature dominated by Early and Late Jurassic grains (195 - 190 Ma; 153 - 147 Ma). Hf isotopic compositions of these grains are juvenile to intermediate (εHf(t) = 4. 5 - 14. 7). Disconformably above the Naknek Formation are two poorly understood units Ks and Kc. The Ks unit is dominated by Early to Late Jurassic grains (159 - 154 Ma) with a few Paleozoic grains (347 - 340 Ma). Hf isotopic compositions of Carboniferous-Jurassic grains are juvenile to intermediate (εHf(t) = 6. 0 - 18. 8). The overlying Kc unit has Late to Early Jurassic zircons (198 - 161 Ma), and an increase in Paleozoic ages (374 - 323 Ma). Hf isotopic compositions of these grains are juvenile to intermediate (εHf(t) = 4. 5 - 14. 7). Samples from the Matanuska Formation have major Late Cretaceous grains (90 - 71 Ma), and minor Early Cretaceous (137 - 106 Ma), Late to Early Jurassic (200 - 153 Ma), Paleozoic (367 - 277 Ma), and Precambrian grains (2597 - 1037 Ma). Hf compositions have a wider range from both the Late Cretaceous grains (εHf(t) =- 1. 5 - 14. 9) and Paleozoic-Precambrian grains (εHf(t) =- 23. 7 - 16. 3). Our results suggest an evolving provenance from Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous time for the Wrangellia composite terrane forearc basin. The Late Jurassic Naknek Formation samples were dominantly derived from a juvenile to intermediate Jurassic igneous sediment source. During Early Cretaceous time, there is a slight increase in the number of Paleozoic grains in the Ks and Kc unit samples. The Early Cretaceous sediments have a mostly positive Hf isotopic compositions suggesting exhumation of Jurassic and Paleozoic juvenile igneous sediment sources. By Late Cretaceous time, our data illustrates another increase in Paleozoic grain abundances, in addition to the introduction of Precambrian grains, all with widely <b>variable</b> <b>Hf</b> isotopic compositions. We interpret this to reflect a larger sediment flux from the interior of Alaska where more evolved igneous rocks of that age are found...|$|R

Objectives: To examine the relationship between compliance with sodium and fluid restriction measured with a nutrition diary and knowledge, beliefs, and other relevant <b>variables</b> in <b>HF</b> patients. Methods: Eighty-four HF patients completed a nutrition diary for 3 days. Patients also completed questionnaires on knowledge, beliefs regarding compliance, and depressive symptoms.

Although not statistically significant, a higher percentage of patients were compliant with the less stringent restrictions compared with the more stringent restrictions, and in addition, more noncompliant patients perceived difficulty following the regimen compared with their compliant counterparts. In contrast with other studies, no significant differences in knowledge, beliefs, and relevant demographic and clinical variables were found between compliant and noncompliant patients.

With regards to generation, we will be concerned with three experiments con-ducted at the ionosphere- radio wave interaction research facilities at Sura, Rus-siaand Tromsø, Norway.

40|$|The North Qaidam terrane {{lies between}} the Qaidam and Qilian blocks of western China, and {{contains}} the Shenglikou ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) garnet peridotite massif. Simultaneously analyzed U-Pb ages, trace element patterns and Hf-isotope compositions of zircons from the peridotite massif and its country rocks (migmatite and gneiss) reveal the complex {{evolution of the}} terrane. Zircons in peridotite and pyroxenite from the massif document metamorphism at ca. 429 ± 2 Ma (2 σ, n= 30, MSWD= 1. 03). The peridotitic and pyroxenitic zircons have similar trace-element patterns and ranges in e{open}Hf(t) (+ 3. 5 to - 7. 0), suggesting that these zircons crystallized from a metamorphic fluid, sourced mainly from the surrounding garnet-bearing ultramafic rocks. The protolith of the peridotite massif is interpreted as a fragment of the metasomatized Archean subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) from the Qilian block. Hf depleted-mantle model ages (TDM) mainly cluster in the interval 1. 1 - 0. 9 Ga, implying that the protolith of the massif probably underwent mantle metasomatism in Meso-Neoproterozoic time. Zircons from the migmatite yield concordant 206 Pb/ 238 U ages, with a major peak at 468 ± 4 Ma (2 σ, n= 7, MSWD= 2. 2) and smaller populations of 1003 ± 6 Ma, 951 ± 8 Ma, 738 ± 4 Ma and 577 ± 14 Ma. Due to the systematically lower Th/U ratios and trace element concentrations in the early Paleozoic zircons, compared to the Proterozoic grains, we suggest the early Paleozoic (∼ 468 Ma) zircons were formed by metamorphic recrystallization of their Proterozoic precursors. Their <b>variable</b> <b>Hf</b> isotopic compositions, i. e., e{open}Hf(t) from + 14. 2 to - 15. 9, TDM from 1. 7 Ga to 0. 6 Ga and Tcrust (average crustal model ages) from 2. 4 Ga to 0. 6 Ga, imply complex origins, including the introduction of juvenile components during events at ∼ 1. 1 - 0. 9 Ga. Zircons from the gneiss show a major concordant population with 206 Pb/ 238 U ages of 430 ± 5 Ma (2 σ, n= 10, MSWD= 2. 3) and minor populations with ages of 806 ± 13 Ma and 613 ± 24 Ma, indicating that metamorphic recrystallization of the protolith occurred in the early Paleozoic (∼ 430 Ma). The original protolith of the gneiss was ancient (ca. Tcrust= 2. 8 - 1. 8 Ga), with some Meso-Neoproterozoic (ca. 1. 1 Ga) juvenile crustal components. These data together with published {{results suggest that the}} North Qaidam terrane is a collisional orogen with Archean crustal components, and the Qaidam and Qilian blocks underwent crust-mantle coupling events in Meso-Neoproterozoic time (∼ 1. 1 - 0. 9 Ga) and convergent plate-margin processes including the UHP metamorphism in early Paleozoic (∼ 468 - 430 Ma), i. e., the beginning of continental subduction at ∼ 468 Ma, the subsequent continental deep subduction and final continent-continent collision at ∼ 430 Ma. 25 page(s...|$|R

Methods: A sample of 572 HF patients (61 % male; age 71 +/- 12 years; LVEF 34 %+/- 15) was recruited from 17 Dutch hospitals during HF admission. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the CES-D. Demographic, clinical <b>variables</b> and <b>HF</b> symptoms were collected from patient chart and interview.

HF patients with depressive symptoms reported more clinical HF symptoms than patients without depressive symptoms. Even after deleting HF related symptoms (sleep disturbances and loss of appetite) from the CES-D scale, 36 % of patients were still found to have symptoms of depression. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that depressive symptoms were associated with female gender (odds 1. 68, 95 % CI 1. 14 - 2. 48), COPD (odds 2. 11, 95 % CI 1. 35 - 3. 30), sleep disturbance (odds 3. 45, 95 % CI 2. 03 - 5. 85) and loss of appetite (odds 2. 61, 95 % CI 1. 58 - 4. 33).

The Pilates group showed significantly increase in peak VO 2 when compared with conventional group (24. 8 +/- 6 vs. 18. 3 +/- 4, P= 0. 02). Conclusions: The result suggests that the Pilates method may be a beneficial adjunctive treatment that enhances functional capacity in patients with HF who are already receiving standard medical therapy.

40|$|Heart {{failure is}} {{associated}} with autonomic imbalance, and this can be evaluated by a spectral analysis of heart rate variability. However, {{the time course of}} low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) heart rate variability changes, and their functional correlates during progression of the disease are not exactly known. Progressive heart failure was induced in 16 beagle dogs over a 7 -wk period by rapid ventricular pacing. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability and respiration, echocardiography, hemodynamic measurements, plasma atrial natriuretic factor, and norepinephrine was obtained at baseline and every week, 30 min after pacing interruption. Progressive heart failure increased heart rate (from 91 +/- 4 to 136 +/- 5 beats/min; P < 0. 001) and decreased absolute and normalized (percentage of total power) HF variability from week 1 and 2, respectively (P < 0. 01). Absolute LF variability did not change during the study until it disappeared in two dogs at week 7 (P < 0. 05). Normalized LF variability increased in moderate heart failure (P < 0. 01), leading to an increased LF-to-HF ratio (P < 0. 05), but decreased in severe heart failure (P < 0. 044; week 7 vs. week 5). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that among heart rate <b>variables,</b> absolute <b>HF</b> variability was closely associated with wedge pressure, right atrial and pulmonary arterial pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction and volume, ratio of maximal velocity of early (E) and atrial (A) mitral flow waves, left atrial diameter, plasma norepinephrine, and atrial natriuretic peptide (0. 45 < r < 0. 65, all P < 0. 001). In tachycardia-induced heart failure, absolute HF heart rate variability is a more reliable indicator of cardiac dysfunction and neurohumoral activation than LF heart rate variability...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of occurrence of an accident is a key aspect in the risk assessment field. Vari- ables such as the human factor (HF), which is {{a major cause of}} undesired events in process industries, are usually not considered explicitly, mainly due to the uncertainty generated {{due to the lack of}} knowledge and the complexity associated to it. In this work, failure frequencies are modified through Monte Carlo (MC) simulation includ- ing the uncertainty generated by HF. MC is one of the most commonly approach used for uncertainty assessment based on probability distribution functions that represent all the variables included in the model. This technique has been also proved to be very useful in the risk assessment field. The model takes into account the uncertainty and variability generated by several <b>HF</b> <b>variables.</b> In order to test the model, it has been applied to two real case studies, obtaining new frequency values for the different scenarios. Together with the consequences assessment, new isorisk curves were plotted. Since the uncertainty generated by the HF has now been taken in to account through MC simulation, these new values are more realistic and accurate. As a result, an improvement of the final risk assessment is achieved. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
40|$|Aims We {{investigated}} {{predictors of}} 90 -day risk among patients surviving the early period after an {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS). Methods and Results The study population included 15 904 stabilized ST-segment elevation or non-ST-segment elevation ACS patients randomized in SYMPHONY and 2 nd SYMPHONY. We developed risk models for death, death or myocardial infarction (MI), and death, MI, or severe recurrent ischaemia (SRI) using Cox proportional-hazards techniques. Demographic, history, and pre-randomization clinical and medi-cation variables were tested. Validation techniques included development of individual trial models, backward elimination and bootstrapping. Of 118 variables, 17 independently predicted mortality. The strongest associations included greater age (2 = 31. 1), higher randomization heart rate (2 = 27. 4), and heart failure (HF) vari-ables (HF between qualifying event and randomization, 2 = 21. 8; history of HF, 2 = 12. 2). Higher creatinine clearance (2 = 17. 7) and percutaneous coronary inter-vention between qualifying event and randomization (2 = 11. 1) most strongly pre-dicted lower risk. Similar characteristics entered the double and triple composite models, but <b>HF</b> <b>variables</b> and age less strongly predicted these end-points. Conclusions In patients stabilized after ACS, those at highest risk over the next 90 days can be identified. Typical clinical markers are better at identifying risk of death than non-fatal MI or SRI. Novel risk markers are needed for these outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{applicability}} of DFT-based descriptors {{for the development}} of toxicological structure– activity relationships is assessed. Emphasis in the present study is on the quality of DFT-based descrip-tors {{for the development of}} toxicological QSARs and, more specifically, on the potential of the electrophili-city concept in predicting toxicity of benzidine derivatives and the series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) expressed in terms of their biological activity data (pIC 50). First, two benzidine derivatives, which act as electron-donating agents in their interactions with biomolecules are considered. Overall toxicity in general and the most probable site of reactivity in particular are effectively described by the global and local electrophilicity parameters respectively. Interaction of two benzidine derivatives with nucleic acid (NA) bases/selected base pairs is determined using Parr’s charge transfer formula. The experimental bio-logical activity data (pIC 50) for the family of PAH, namely polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), poly-halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PHDD) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are taken as dependent <b>variables</b> and the <b>HF</b> energy (E), along with DFT-based global and local descriptors, viz., electrophilicity index (w) and local electrophilic power (w+) respectively are taken as independent variables. Fairly good correlation is obtained showing the significance of the selected descriptors in the QSAR on toxins that act as electron acceptors in the presence of biomolecules.

40|$|Cardiolipin (CL) is {{responsible}} for modulation of activities of various enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Although energy production decreases in heart failure (HF), regulation of cardiolipin during HF development is unknown. Enzymes involved in cardiac cardiolipin synthesis and remodeling were studied in spontaneously hypertensive HF (SHHF) rats, explanted hearts from human HF patients, and nonfailing Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The biosynthetic enzymes cytidinediphosphatediacylglycerol synthetase (CDS), phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase (PGPS) and cardiolipin synthase (CLS) were investigated. Mitochondrial CDS activity and CDS- 1 mRNA increased in HF whereas CDS- 2 mRNA in SHHF and humans, not in SD rats, decreased. PGPS activity, but not mRNA, increased in SHHF. CLS activity and mRNA decreased in SHHF, but mRNA was not significantly altered in humans. Cardiolipin remodeling enzymes, monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase (MLCL AT) and tafazzin, showed <b>variable</b> changes during <b>HF.</b> MLCL AT activity increased in SHHF. Tafazzin mRNA decreased in SHHF and human HF, but not in SD rats. The gene expression of acyl-CoA: lysocardiolipin acyltransferase- 1, an endoplasmic reticulum MLCL AT, remained unaltered in SHHF rats. The results provide mechanisms whereby both cardiolipin biosynthesis and remodeling are altered during HF. Increases in CDS- 1, PGPS, and MLCL AT suggest compensatory mechanisms during the development of HF. Human and SD data imply that similar trends may occur in human HF, but not during nonpathological aging, consistent with previous cardiolipin studies...|$|R
40|$|Hedge funds&# 146; (HF) assets under {{management}} (AUM) expanded at more than 20 % per annum between 2000 and the mid- 2008 peak of USD 1. 85 trillion. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) led to a drastic industry contraction with an estimated 2, 000 fund liquidations. Nonetheless, the industry&# 146;s AUM {{is expected to reach}} new highs by 2011. Clearly, this asset class continues to grow at a remarkable pace, despite being marked by both high attrition rates and &# 151; as the industry&# 146;s recent experience made clear &# 151; dramatic changes over time. Given the continued growth and the important role of hedge funds, tools that facilitate the understanding of their survival probabilities are of general interest and would specifically benefit investors, service providers, managers and regulators. We use data on individual hedge funds and a range of models to analyse the association between fund specific and market variables with two types of database attrition, liquidation and non-liquidation exits. First, we explore the drivers of not only HF liquidation but also non-liquidation exits. Understanding the latter exit type is of interest to institutional investors who prefer to regularly allocate capital across their HF portfolio. Secondly, we use flexible econometric techniques that can, and indeed do, identify inflection points and turning points between the two database exit types and both fund specific variables and market ones. Liquidation risk is shown to increase immediately and drastically as HF returns move to negative territory and surprisingly, liquidation risk increases at the right tail of the return distribution and decreases at the far left. Finally, we explore the dynamics of two time scales, the lifetime scale and the calendar time scale. Importantly, we find the lifetime analysis requires the flexibility of fractional polynomial models as the time interactions of many variables were non-monotonic. For example, while positive returns remain negatively related to liquidation risk, they have the least impact during the time period of peak liquidation risk, roughly at the 5. 5 year age mark. Similarly, we show that the impact of variables are dynamic over the 14 year sample time period, and in particular during a number of the structural breaks, the relationship between specific market related <b>variables</b> and <b>HF</b> liquidation risk reverses...|$|R
40|$|This {{integrated}} {{study of}} whole rock geochemistry, zircon U–Pb dating and Hf isotope composition for seven felsic rocks from the Nyingchi Complex in eastern Himalayan syntaxis has revealed a complex magmatic history {{for the eastern}} Gangdese belt. This involves multiple melt sources and mechanisms that uniquely identify the tectonic evolution {{of this part of}} the Himalayan orogen. Our U–Pb zircon dating reveals five stages of magmatic or anatectic events: 165, 81, 61, 50 and 25 Ma. The Jurassic granitic gneiss (165 Ma) exhibits ε Hf (t) values of + 1. 4 to + 3. 5. The late Cretaceous granite (81 Ma) shows <b>variable</b> ε <b>Hf</b> (t) values from − 0. 9 to + 6. 2, indicating a binary mixing between juvenile and old crustal materials. The Paleocene granodioritic gneiss (61 Ma) has ε Hf (t) values of + 5. 4 to + 8. 0, suggesting that it originated from partial melting of a juvenile crustal material. The Eocene anatexis is recorded in the leucosome, which has Hf isotopic composition {{similar to that of the}} Jurassic granite, indicating that the leucosome could be derived from partial melting of the Jurassic granite. The late Oligocene biotite granite (25 Ma) shows adakitic geochemical characteristics, with Sr/Y = 49. 3 – 56. 6. The presence of a large number of inherited zircons and negative ε Hf (t) values suggest that it sourced from anatexis of crustal materials. In contrast to the Gangdese batholiths that are mainly derived from juvenile crustal source in central Tibet, the old crustal materials play an important role for the magma generation of the felsic rocks, suggesting the existence of a crustal basement in the eastern Gangdese belt. These correspond to specific magmatic evolution stages during the convergence between India and Asia. The middle Jurassic granitic gneiss resulted from the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab. The late Cretaceous magmatism is probably related to the ocean ridge subduction. The Paleocene–Eocene magmatism, metamorphism and anatexis are interpreted to result from roll-back and break-off of the subducted Neo-Tethyan slab that occurred in the early stage of the India–Asian collision, respectively. The late Oligocene adakitic rocks resulted from the break-off of the subducted Indian continental crust starting at 25 Ma. ...|$|R
40|$|Background—Multiple viruses {{have been}} {{isolated}} from the heart, but their significance remains controversial. We sought to determine the prevalence of cardiotropic viruses in endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) samples from adult patients with heart failure (HF) and to define the clinicopathologic profile of patients exhibiting viral positivity. Methods and Results—EMB from 100 patients (median ejection fraction, 30 %; interquartile range [IQR], 20 % to 45 %) presenting for cardiomyopathy evaluation (median symptom duration, 5 months; IQR, 1 to 13 months) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and parvovirus B 19. Each isolate was sequenced, and viral load was determined. Parvovirus B 19 was the only virus detected in EMB samples (12 % of subjects). No patient had antiparvovirus IgM antibodies, but all had IgG antibodies, suggesting viral persistence. The clinical presentation of parvovirus-positive patients was markedly heterogeneous with both acute and chronic <b>HF,</b> <b>variable</b> ventricular function, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. No patient met Dallas histopathologic criteria for active or borderline myocarditis. Two patients with a positive cardiac MRI and presumed “parvomyocarditis ” had similar viral loads to autopsy controls without heart disease. The oldest parvovirus-positive patients were positive for genotype 2, suggesting lifelong persistence in the myocardium. Conclusions—Parvovirus B 19 was the only virus isolated from EMB samples in this series of adult patients with HF from the United States. Positivity {{was associated with a}} wide array of clinical presentations and HF phenotypes. Our studie...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHelium {{isotopes}} {{were measured}} on 53 glass {{samples from the}} South West Indian Ridge from 32 to 68 ° E. The 4 He/ 3 He ratio is heterogeneous along the SWIR, with values down to 74, 000 and up to 114, 000 (R/Ra between 9. 8 and 6. 3), more variable than for helium isotope systematics measured at other mid-oceanic ridge systems, far from hot spots. Helium–Pb, Hf, Nd and Sr systematics on the SWIR basalts suggest that the large-scale geodynamics of the Indian mantle is mainly controlled by mixing between asthenospheric material and the lower continental crust. The latter is currently interpreted as having been introduced into the mantle by delamination during the Gondwana breakup ~ 180 Ma ago. Superimposed to this global-scale mixing, the asthenospheric mantle presents <b>variable</b> helium and <b>Hf</b> isotopic ratios and relatively constant Pb, Nd and Sr isotopic values. These results are interpreted {{in terms of a}} heterogeneous asthenospheric material source and the helium isotopic ratio represents a mixture between harzburgitic “pyroxenite-free” mantle and recycled materials such as oceanic lithosphere/crust. Using a model of helium diffusion similar to the one developed for recycled oceanic crust by Hart et al. (2008), we are able to constrain the size of the lower crust fragments present in the mantle. Results of this calculation indicate that the He and Pb isotopic compositions observed in SWIR basalts can be explained by mixing between depleted mantle and lower crust fragments up to ~ 5 – 10 km. This result shows that significant lower crust and, probably also subcontinental lithosphere material, can be removed during delamination during continental breakup...|$|R
40|$|French {{spoken in}} Quebec (QF) is largely {{considered}} to be vastly different from Hexagonal French (HF), spoken in France, but this assumption has not been tested empirically. Systematic and accountable analyses of morphosyntactic features in HF are generally absent from the current body of linguistic research on French, which precludes the possibility of reliable comparison. This dissertation addresses this gap through the systematic analysis of three different linguistic <b>variables</b> in spoken <b>HF</b> (the subjunctive mood, the expression of necessity, and the expression of pronominal indefiniteness), using the comparative variationist sociolinguistics framework, which seeks to account for variability in language by demonstrating that choices made by speakers are not random, but rather are constrained by various social and linguistic factors. The analysis tests whether the strong community trends that deviate from the prescribed standard, shown to be operative in QF (e. g., Poplack, Lealess & Dion 2013), are also present in the source variety (HF) and if so, whether the underlying conditioning of the variability is parallel across the two varieties. The results of this research reveal nearly identical underlying systems in both varieties {{in the case of}} the subjunctive mood and the expression of necessity. The most notable difference is the circumstantial proportion of specific lexical items (namely falloir que, which is strongly entrenched with the subjunctive mood in QF and is also the main variant used to express necessity), which is eventually linked to the different strategies employed in each variety to express indefinite necessity and indefiniteness more generally. The results of this research highlight the importance of considering the consequences of one change on another and how variability in one area of the grammar contributes to the larger picture. It also represents the first comparative variationist analysis of morphosyntactic variation in QF and HF, and thus contributes to clarifying our understanding of the (dis) similarities between the two varieties, in addition to offering insight into the relationship between transplanted dialects and their source variety more generally...|$|R
40|$|Memory deficits {{have been}} {{reported}} in patients with chronic HF (heart failure). However, little is known about memory performance and the factors that explain memory performance in women with HF. The purposes of this study were to (a) examine the memory performance among Taiwanese postmenopausal women with heart failure (HF) compared to age- and education-matched healthy women, and to determine the factors that explain memory performance in women with HF, (b) evaluate the validity of the Chinese version of the CogState battery among women with HF in Taiwan, and (c) examine type, frequency, and severity of menopausal symptoms in women with HF, compared with healthy participants, and to explore the association between menopausal symptoms and memory performance among Taiwanese postmenopausal women with HF. A cross-sectional design was used in this study. Seventy-six women with HF and 64 healthy women were recruited from one medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. Women completed memory tests and measures of demographic <b>variables,</b> menopausal symptoms, <b>HF</b> severity symptoms, and global cognitive function. Clinical variables were obtained from medical records. Descriptive statistics, comparative statistics, exploratory factor analysis, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analyses were used. Women with HF performed significantly worse than healthy women on working and verbal memory tests. Among women with HF, older age explained working memory; older age, higher HF severity, more comorbidities, and systolic HF explained verbal memory. In addition, the Chinese CogState Battery had satisfactory construct and c onvergent validity. Furthermore, women with HF had worse menopausal symptoms on subscales for psychological (anxiety and depressive), somatic, and vasomotor symptoms compared with healthy women. Anxiety and sexual symptoms were significantly associated with visual and verbal memory performance. In summary, the Chinese CogState Battery is a valid measure of memory performance in Taiwanese women with HF. Women with HF had poorer memory performance and more severe menopausal symptoms compared with healthy women. Nurses and health care professionals should assist women with HF by early assessment and recommendations regarding compensation for memory deficits. Interventions tailored to these identified factors can be developed to improve memory performance for Taiwanese postmenopausal women with HF...|$|R

OBJETIVO: Em pacientes internados por IC, (1) descrever a prevalência de EP, e (2) avaliar a acurácia diagnóstica dos Escores de Wells e de Genebra. MÉTODOS: Pacientes internados primariamente por IC realizaram sistematicamente cintilografia pulmonar de ventilação/perfusão, sendo EP definida por laudo de alta probabilidade. Para fins de interpretação, definimos baixa probabilidade clínica de EP como prevalência BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of pulmonary embolism (PE) {{has not been}} reported in patients hospitalized due to classical findings of decompensated heart failure (HF). OBJECTIVE: To describe the {{prevalence of}} PE and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the Wells and Geneva scores in patients hospitalized due to HF. METHODS: Patients hospitalized primarily due to HF underwent systematic ventilation-perfusion lung scan, and PE was defined by a result of high probability. Aiming at interpreting, low clinical probability of PE was defined as prevalence < 5 %, according to the literature. When calculating the sample size, 49 patients were required to provide a 95 % confidence interval with ± 10 % accuracy, estimating an a priori prevalence of 15 %. RESULTS: Of 51 patients studied, six had a high probability of PE on lung scan, resulting in 12 % prevalence (95 % CI = 5 % - 23 %). The Wells and Geneva scores had an area under the ROC curve of 0. 53 (95 % CI = 0. 27 - 0. 80; p = 0. 80) and 0. 43 (95 % CI = 0. 13 - 0. 73; p = 0. 56), respectively, indicating lack of accuracy for the diagnosis of PE. Alternatively, <b>variables</b> related to <b>HF</b> showed a tendency towards association with PE, and an exploratory model formed by that type of variable showed diagnostic accuracy for PE (ROC = 0. 81; 95 % CI = 0. 66 - 0. 96; p = 0. 01).
