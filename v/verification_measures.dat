500|$|The treaty {{declares}} as its [...] "principal aim the speediest possible {{achievement of}} an agreement on general and complete disarmament under strict international control," [...] and explicitly states the goal of achieving a comprehensive test ban (i.e., one which bans underground tests). The treaty permanently forbids {{the parties to the}} treaty from conducting, permitting, or encouraging any nuclear explosion in the atmosphere, outer space, or underwater, as well as [...] "any other nuclear explosion" [...] that threatens to send nuclear debris into another state's territory. The wording [...] "any other nuclear explosion" [...] prohibited peaceful nuclear explosions, due to the difficulty in differentiating those from military tests without expanded <b>verification</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|E
500|$|Political {{scientist}} Robert Gilpin later {{argued that}} Eisenhower faced three {{camps in the}} push for a test ban. The first was the [...] "control" [...] camp, led by figures like Linus Pauling and astronomer Harlow Shapley, which believed that both testing and possession of nuclear weapons was dangerous. Second, there was the [...] "finite containment" [...] camp, populated by scientists like Hans Bethe, which was concerned by perceived Soviet aggression but still believed that a test ban would be workable with adequate <b>verification</b> <b>measures.</b> Third, the [...] "infinite containment" [...] camp, of which Strauss, Teller, {{and members of the}} defense establishment were members, believed that any test ban would grant the Soviet Union the ability to conduct secret tests and move ahead in the arms race.|$|E

500|$|Tsarapkin responded {{positively}} to the US proposal, though was {{wary of the}} prospect of allowing underground tests registering below magnitude 4.75. In its own proposal offered 19 March 1960 the Soviet Union accepted most US provisions, with certain amendments. First, the Soviet Union asked that underground tests under magnitude 4.75 be banned {{for a period of}} four-to-five years, subject to extension. Second, it sought to prohibit all outer-space tests, whether within detection range or not. Finally, the Soviet Union insisted that the inspection quota be determined on a political basis, not a scientific one. The Soviet offer faced a mixed reception. In the US, Senator Hubert Humphrey and [...] the Federation of American Scientists (which was typically seen as supportive of a test ban) saw it as a clear step towards an agreement. Conversely, AEC chairman John A. McCone and Senator Clinton Presba Anderson, chair of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, argued that the Soviet system would be unable to prevent secret tests. That year, the AEC published a report arguing that the continuing testing moratorium risked [...] "free world supremacy in nuclear weapons," [...] and that renewed testing was critical for further weapons development. The joint committee also held hearings in April which cast doubt on the technical feasibility and cost of the proposed <b>verification</b> <b>measures.</b> Additionally, Teller continued to warn of the dangerous consequences of a test ban and the Department of Defense (including Neil H. McElroy and Donald A. Quarles, until recently its top two officials) pushed to continue testing and expand missile stockpiles.|$|E

Nonetheless, Brazil’s reluctance to these <b>verification</b> <b>measures</b> and constant refusal to sign the Additional Protocol have been interpreted by some as an attempt to hide undeclared activities.

50|$|The leaders {{reaffirmed the}} {{commitment}} of the two sides to conduct in a single forum full-scale, stage-by-stage negotiations on the issues relating to nuclear testing. In these negotiations the sides as the first step will agree upon effective <b>verification</b> <b>measures</b> which will make it possible to ratify the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976, and proceed to negotiating further intermediate limitations on nuclear testing leading to the ultimate objective of the complete cessation of nuclear testing as part of the effective disarmament process. This process, among other things, would pursue, as the first priority, the goal of the reduction of nuclear weapons and ultimately, their elimination. In implementing the first objective of these negotiations, agreement upon effective <b>verification</b> <b>measures</b> for the U.S.-U.S.S.R.

40|$|As {{the nuclear}} {{industry}} grows around the globe, it brings with it {{a need for more}} safeguards and proliferation resistant technologies. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) depends on effective containment and surveillance (C/S) technologies and methods for maintaining continuity of knowledge over nuclear assets. Tags and seals, a subset of C/S technologies, are an area where innovation has been relatively stagnant for the past fifteen years. It is necessary to investigate technologies not previously used in this field in order to defend against emerging threats and methods of defeat. Based on a gap analysis of tags and seals currently being used by the IAEA, completed with the input of several subject matter experts, the technology selected for investigation was ion-exchanged glass. Ion-exchanged glass is relatively inexpensive, has high strength, and {{can be used in a}} variety of applications. If identical pieces of glass are exchanged under the same conditions and subjected to the same point load, the fracture patterns produced can be compared and used as a <b>verification</b> <b>measure.</b> This technology has the potential to be used in passive seal applications. Each image was categorized depending on its fracture as a " 3 leaf" or " 4 leaf" pattern. These two populations were separately analyzed and evaluated. Several methods used to analyze the fracture patterns involve the use of image analysis software such as ImageJ and the MATLAB Control Point Selection Tool. The statistical analysis software Minitab was used to validate the use of facture pattern analysis as verification tool. The analysis yielded a 60 % verified comparison for samples demonstrating a " 3 leaf" fracture pattern and a 78 % verified comparison for samples with a " 4 leaf" fracture pattern. This preliminary analysis provides a strong indication of the plausibility for the use of ion-exchanged glass as a <b>verification</b> <b>measure</b> for C/S measures and specifically tags and seals...|$|R
