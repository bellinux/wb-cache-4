40|$|The {{metabolism}} of four benzomorphan compounds was {{studied in}} the isolated perfused rat liver, and glucuronide metabolites were identified by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Cyclazocine, ketocyclazocine, <b>volazocine,</b> and pentazocine were each added to the perfusate of the isolated perfused rat liver and the bile collected for 3 hours. The residue from evaporation of the bile was derivatized with the dimethylsulfoxide anion and methyl iodide, and the permethylated glucuronide metabolites were identified by GC/MS. The four compounds were hydroxylated by the liver and excreted in the bile as phenolic glucuronides. For example, permethylated hydroxycyclazocine glucuronide had a mass spectrum with a molecular ion at mle 533 and fragment ions at mb 301 (aglycone) ...|$|E
