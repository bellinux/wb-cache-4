40|$|Objective The {{evaluation}} of discomfort in paediatric research is scarcely evidence-based. In this study, {{we make a}} start in describing children's self-reported discomfort during common medical research procedures and compare this with discomfort during dental check-ups which {{can be considered as}} a reference level of a 'minimal discomfort' medical procedure. We exploratory study whether there are associations between age, anxiety-proneness, gender, medical condition, previous experiences and discomfort. We also describe children's suggestions for reducing discomfort. Design Cross-sectional descriptive study. Setting Paediatric research at three academic hospitals. Patients 357 children with and without illnesses (8 - 18 years, mean= 10. 6 years) were enrolled: 307 from paediatric research studies and 50 from dental care. Main outcome measures We measured various generic forms of discomfort (nervousness, annoyance, pain, fright, boredom, tiredness) due to six common research procedures: buccal swabs, MRI scans, pulmonary function tests, skin prick tests, ultrasound imaging and <b>venepunctures.</b> Results Most children reported limited discomfort during the research procedures (means: 1 - 2. 6 on a scale from 1 to 5). Compared with dental check-ups, buccal swab tests, skin prick tests and ultrasound imaging were less discomforting, while MRI scans, <b>venepunctures</b> and pulmonary function tests caused a similar degree of discomfort. 60. 3 % of the children suggested providing distraction by showing movies to reduce discomfort. The exploratory analyses suggested a positive association between anxiety-proneness and discomfort. Conclusions The findings of this study support the acceptability of participation of children in the studied research procedures, which stimulates evidence-based research practice. Furthermore, the present study can be considered as a first step in providing benchmarks for discomfort of procedures in paediatric researc...|$|R
40|$|Methoxyflurane {{has been}} used to provide {{analgesia}} for burns dressings on sixty occasions in eleven patients. It was administered by way of a new, disposable vaporizer, the Analgizer, which is described. Three patients required either supplementary analgesics or tranquillizers. No side effects were noted, and patient acceptance of the Analgizer was good. This method is thought to represent an advance over previous methods of analgesia for burns dressings, since there is no undue sedation, pre-operative starvation is unnecessary, and <b>venepunctures</b> are avoided. This paper describes our experiences using a disposable methoxyflurane dispenser to provide analgesia during repeated burns dressings. This dispenser is known by the trade name of Analgizer (Abbott). * The provision of analgesia for burns dressings is difficult, since frequent, often daily, dressings are necessary.

40|$|A {{continuous}} glucose {{monitoring system}} (CGMS) was evaluated in 14 cats with naturally occurring diabetes mellitus. The device measures interstitial fluid glucose continuously, {{by means of}} a sensor placed in the subcutaneous tissue. All cats tolerated the device well and a trace was obtained on 15 / 16 occasions. There was good correlation between the CGMS values and blood glucose concentration measured using a glucometer (r= 0. 932, P< 0. 01). Limitations {{to the use of the}} CGMS are its working glucose range of 2. 2 - 22. 2 mmol/l (40 - 400 mg/dl) and the need for calibration with a blood glucose measurement at least every 12 h. When compared to a traditional blood glucose curve, the CGMS is minimally invasive, reduces the number of <b>venepunctures</b> necessary to assess the kinetics of insulin therapy in a patient and provides a truly continuous glucose curve...|$|R

40|$|Soon {{after its}} {{introduction}} in 1910, intravenous arsphenamine treatment for syphilis {{was found to}} be complicated by jaundice.

The infection most often transmitted was probably hepatitis B virus (HBV), but the high mortality in a few of the outbreaks of arsphenamine jaundice suggests that variants of HBV, or other hepatitis viruses, were sometimes involved. Fifty years later, {{at a time when there}} are estimated to be over three hundred million carriers of HBV in the world and probably at least as many hepatitis C virus carriers, and when the World Health Organisation estimates that there have been 17 million infections with human immunodeficiency virus, the lessons learnt around 1945 about the need to use sterile instruments and needles for all injections and <b>venepunctures</b> remain highly pertinent...|$|R

All children except those aged three to six, in the treatment group, had low anxiety throughout. The treatment did not reduce anxiety in these young children, but other factors such as parental presence, lack of motivation or poor memory, shortage of time, interfering existing coping mechanisms could have been responsible. Age had {{the greatest impact on}} anxiety, with younger children being more anxious overall. Parents were administered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and they were found to have anxiety levels similar to a general population sample.

40|$|SUMMARY A 59 -year-old Caucasian male started {{intermittent}} hemodialysis in March 1995 for the treat-ment of end-stage {{renal disease}} of unknown etiology. In December 2002, he started receiving parenteral iron sucrose, 100 mg every two weeks, for iron deficiency. He did not receive erythropoietin. One month later he experienced severe pruritus. Blood analysis revealed erythrocytosis. Iron therapy was discontinued immediately, and four <b>venepunctures</b> were performed to avoid thrombosis of AV fistula. Malignant disease was excluded. It was decided to apply an angiotensin convertase enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), ramipril, in a dose of 2. 5 mg/day. However, the patient developed severe cough as {{a side effect of}} ramipril and was switched to an angiotensin receptor type II antagonist (AAR), losartan, in a dose of 25 mg/day. While the patient was prone to hypotension during the dialysis sessions, losartan was administered every evening at bedtime.

40|$|Periodic {{occupational}} health examinations often require <b>venepuncture.</b> Acute {{psychological and physical}} stressors during such a procedure result in sympathetic stimulation and increased salivary protein secretion, including salivary alpha-amylase (SAA). We studied SAA response to <b>venepuncture</b> during such an examination. Fifty eight healthy males undergoing periodic medical examination reported perceived stress level (PSL) scores (on a 5 -point scale) and provided passive drool saliva samples at 15 -min (T 1) and 1 -min before (T 2); and 1 -min (T 3) and 15 -min after <b>venepuncture</b> (T 4). A subset of 33 participants available for repeat examination on a control day {{when there was no}} <b>venepuncture</b> provided saliva samples at the corresponding times for comparison. Saliva SAA activity levels were analysed using a salivary α-amylase assay kit (Salimetrics LLC, USA) Among 58 participants, mean SAA increased from T 1 (89. 95 U/L) to T 2 (109. 5 U/L) and T 3 (116. 9 U/L). SAA remained elevated 15 minutes after <b>venepuncture</b> (121. 0 U/L). A positive trend in the difference of SAA between T 3 and T 1 was noted among subjects with increasing mean PSL scores. T 3 -T 1 values were 0. 6 (among those with PSL ≤ 1, n= 24), 11. 3 (among those with PSL between 1 and 1. 5, n= 18) and 78. 9 (among those with PSL > 1. 5, n= 16). SAA increment over 4 time points was significantly higher on the <b>venepuncture</b> compared to the control day (p= 0. 021). SAA increases in response to the acute stress of <b>venepuncture</b> during a periodic medical examination, and remains elevated 15 minutes after the procedure.

40|$|Hypocalcemia is {{the most}} {{frequent}} complication after thyroid surgery. The incidence varies and has been reported as ranging from 1. 2 to 40 %. Permanent hypoparathyroidism occurs in less than 3 % of patients, whereas transient postoperative hypocalcemia is much more common. Postoperative hypoparathyroidism is traditionally detected by serial measurement of serum calcium concentrations and requires multiple <b>venepunctures</b> and, potentially, several days of hospitalization following the procedure. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) molecule is a polypeptide composed of an 84 -amino acid sequence with an active amino terminal on one end and an inactive carboxyl unit on the other. Measurement of the intact PTH (iPTH) is an accurate representation of the true parathyroid state. In recent years, iPTH assay has been under investigation for thyroid surgery in many centers as an early iPTH measurement may be of value for prediction of postoperative symptomatic hypocalcemia, guiding the surgeon for parathyroid autotransplatation, and selection of patients requiring onset of calcium substitution or safe discharge home. This paper reviews the relevant medical literature published regarding the influence of PTH assay technology {{on the quality of}} thyroid surgery, {{as well as on the}} prevention of postoperative symptomatic hypocalcemia.

In my little {{experience as a}} medical student and as a house physician-surgeon, I have observed {{that there is a}} gross lack of awareness of this obvious fact; indeed, how many times have we witnessed arrogance in our wards and how often do patients complain that they are not told results of investigations after so many uncomfortable <b>venepunctures,</b> for instance, or that the consultant fails to have a modest word with them? It is true that the workload in our hospital is rather heavy and much is expected from all; we are fallible humans ourselves with personal problems of our own; we do encounter situations which drive us to our wit's end: our facial expression, tone of voice and general demeanour frequently leave much to be desired. A vicious circle is set up as the already morose surroundings are further influenced by our ill-temper. The patient, very young, adult and old alike, finds himself, often quite unexpectedly, in a new and rather hideous environment: the impressive sharp instruments, steel equipment and machinery; the sounds that pollute the air: the moans and groans of patients in pain, sputum being propelled from the depths of respiratory tracts of chronic bronchitis, the clutter of metallic instruments, the voices of stern professors; the cocktail of odours of urine, faeces, drugs and disinfectants.
