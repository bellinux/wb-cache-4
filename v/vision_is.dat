5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.|$|E

5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus.

5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is an ambush predator that employs electricity to capture prey. <b>Vision</b> <b>is</b> of little importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom. Instead, it likely relies on the mechanoreceptors of its lateral line, as it only attacks moving prey. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini may also contribute to prey detection.|$|E
5|$|The {{perception}} of greenness (in opposition to redness forming {{one of the}} opponent mechanisms in human color <b>vision)</b> <b>is</b> evoked by light which triggers the medium-wavelength M cone cells in the eye more than the long-wavelength L cones.

5|$|<b>Vision</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to}} those of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vision</b> <b>is</b> {{the main}} sense of {{orientation}} in humans, {{and the primary}} function of camouflage is to deceive the human eye. Camouflage works through concealment (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle. In modern warfare, some forms of camouflage, for example face paints, also offer concealment from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide concealment from radar.|$|E

As revealed shortly afterwards, this <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> a repressed memory of Brother Justin of him and Iris as the only survivors of a train accident which also cost their mother's life. Reverend Norman Balthus later saved Irina and Alexei and raised them in a church orphanage. A vision prompts Brother Justin to get his chest tattooed early in the second season.|$|E

5|$|Moth Flight's <b>Vision</b> <b>is</b> the 8th Super Edition {{novel that}} was {{released}} on November 3, 2015. It features a cat named Moth Flight, who becomes WindClan's first medicine cat. Moth Flight was also the one who discovered the Moonstone, and that all leaders shall be granted nine lives. It takes place a few moons after the last book in the Dawn of the Clans series. In this book, Moth Flight, an easily distractable she-cat, kit of Wind Runner (later Windstar), leaves her Clan, following a unexpected guide, and meets an unexpected friend, who is vital to her journey. She finds an object, and is told something important. She goes home, and reveals the secret information. Her friend stays with her, and she gives birth to four kits after his death. She lives happily for moons after, until she dies a peaceful death.|$|E
5|$|Partial solar eclipses are {{hazardous}} to view because the eye's pupil is not {{adapted to the}} unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to {{the total amount of}} light in the field of view, not by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2mm to ~6mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer. The hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} Demosthenes fought {{at the battle}} of Chaeronea as a hoplite {{indicates}} that he lacked any military skills. According to historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, in his time the division between political and military offices was beginning to be strongly marked. Almost no politician, with the exception of Phocion, was at the same time an apt orator and a competent general. Demosthenes dealt in policies and ideas, and war was not his business. This contrast between Demosthenes's intellectual prowess and his deficiencies in terms of vigour, stamina, military skill and strategic <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> illustrated by the inscription his countrymen engraved on the base of his statue:* C.Carey, Aeschines, 12–14; K.

40|$|AbstractUsing {{the method}} of limits, we {{measured}} spatial and temporal vision in 13 {{children who had been}} deprived of patterned visual input during infancy until they were treated for dense central cataracts in both eyes. Spatial <b>vision</b> <b>was</b> assessed with vertical sine-wave gratings, and temporal <b>vision</b> <b>was</b> assessed with an unpatterned luminance field sinusoidally modulated over time. Under these testing conditions, spatial contrast sensitivity at low and medium spatial frequencies (0. 33 – 2 c deg− 1) was within normal limits, but sensitivity at higher spatial frequencies and grating acuity were reduced on average by 1. 3 and 0. 5 log units, respectively. Temporal <b>vision</b> <b>was</b> affected less severely, with losses in sensitivity only for low temporal frequencies (5 and 10 Hz), which averaged 0. 4 log units. Thus, spatial and temporal <b>vision</b> <b>are</b> likely mediated by different neural mechanisms, that are differentially affected by deprivation...|$|R

5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they {{must be aware of}} their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E
5|$|The robin uses auditory, visual, {{olfactory}} {{and possibly}} vibrotactile cues to ﬁnd prey, but <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> the predominant mode of prey detection. It is frequently seen running across lawns picking up earthworms, and its running and stopping behavior is a distinguishing characteristic. In addition to hunting visually, {{it also has}} the ability to hunt by hearing. Experiments have discovered that it can find worms underground by simply using its listening skills. It typically will take several short hops and then cock its head left, right or forward to detect movement of its prey. In urban areas, robins will gather in numbers soon after lawns are mowed or where sprinklers are in use. They also are attracted to freshly turned earth in gardens, where worms and grubs are abundant targets. Occasionally, they may visit bird feeders if mealworms or animal-fat suet is offered.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vision</b> <b>is</b> {{generated}} by light that hits the retina of the eye. Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that {{is sent to}} the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Vision from the left visual field is received {{on the right side of}} each retina (and vice versa) and passes through the optic nerve until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of the visual field passes through tracts in the opposite side of the brain. The nerves reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus, and travel through the optic radiation to reach the visual cortex.|$|E
