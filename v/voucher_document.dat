40|$|A {{survey of}} 96 locales in the Big Blue River and its minor tributaries {{supplemented}} by museum <b>vouchers</b> <b>documented</b> {{the presence or}} former presence of 25 native unionid mollusk species and one introduced bivalve. Including the previously reported Little Blue Basin, the total documented unionid inventory ofthe Big Blue Basin consists of twenty-six species. Over a third of these species may have been extirpated from the basin, {{and many of the}} surviving species appear to have experienced significant range reductions. Habitat in the region is adversely impacted by surface and subsurface water withdrawals, erosion/siltation, and grazing. Chemicals and other pollutants from agricultural fields probably exert a further deleterious impact upon the fauna of the region. Despite these conditions, the Big Blue Basin continues to provide habitat for a number of species that are generally uncommon in northern Kansas and Nebraska...|$|R

40|$|Morphology-based keys support {{accurate}} {{identification of}} many taxa. However, identification {{can be difficult}} for taxa that are either not well studied, very small, members of cryptic species complexes, or represented by immature stages. For such cases, DNA barcodes may provide diagnostic characters. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists deposit museum <b>vouchers</b> to <b>document</b> the species studied in their research. If DNA barcodes are {{to be used for}} identification, then both the DNA and the specimen from which it was extracted should be vouchered. We describe a protocol for the nondestructive extraction of DNA from terrestrial arthropods, using as examples members of the orders Acarina, Araneae, Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera chosen to represent the ranges in size, overall sclerotization, and delicacy of key morphological characters in the group. We successfully extracted sequenceable DNA from all species after 1 – 4 h of immersion in extraction buffer. The extracted carcasses, processed and imaged using protocols standard for the taxon, were distinguishable from closely related species, and adequate as morphological vouchers. We provide links from the carcasses and DNA vouchers to image (MorphBank) and sequence (GenBank) databases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of the first statewide survey of the {{freshwater}} mussels of Nebraska. Survey goals were: (1) to document current distributions through collection of recent shells; (2) to document former distributions through collection of relict shells and examination of museum collections; (3) to identify changes in distribution; (4) to identify the primary natural and anthropomorphic factors impacting unionids; and (5) to develop a model to explain the documented distributions. The survey confirmed 30 unionid species and the exotic Corbicula fluminea for the state, and museum <b>vouchers</b> <b>documented</b> one additional unionid species. Analysis of museum records and an extensive literature search coupled with research in adjacent states identified 13 additional unionid species with known distributions near the Nebraska border. Some of these unionids may have formerly inhabited the state. Seven documented species have probably been extirpated, and the ranges of 15 others have contracted significantly. Only nine species are relatively stable at present, and one of these is extremely rare and federally endangered. Diversity is concentrated in the formerly glaciated portion of eastern Nebraska, and drops abruptly along the Missouri River to the east and in the Great Plains westward. The primary natural factors influencing unionid distributions in Nebraska include availability of perennially flowing waters, host fish diversity, substrate composition and stability, and formerly heavy sediment loads. Anthropomorphic factors are surface and subsurface irrigation withdrawals, construction of canals and reservoirs, channelization, erosion, intensive grazing, contaminants, and the introduction of invasive species. Unionid presence and diversity largely correlates with substrate stability. Stream orientation and morphology in portions of eastern Nebraska promote slow currents, and substrates composed of mud, sand, and rock provide greater stability than the shifting sand substrates common elsewhere in the state. In central and western Nebraska, unionid populations are concentrated in headwaters, backwaters, and side-channels of rivers, and canals, reservoirs, and small tributaries, while the generally shifting sand habitats of most rivers provide relatively little viable habitat. In the historic Missouri River, unstable substrates and (formerly) heavy sediment loads limited diversity to silt tolerant species, and viable habitat largely to backwaters, sloughs, attached lakes, side channels, and relatively few main channel environments. Today, upstream dams have greatly reduced the sediment load in the Missouri River, but unstable substrates restrict mussels to backwaters, side channels, pools below wing dams, revetments, and other areas sheltered from strong currents. Channelization and erosion/sedimentation have destroyed or drastically impacted stream habitats in eastern Nebraska resulting in the loss of much of the original unionid diversity. Surface and subsurface irrigation coupled with related declines in water tables have eliminated habitat in western Nebraska, though losses are partially compensated for some species by colonization of viable reaches of newly created impoundments and canals. Intensive grazing along streams and agricultural pollution further exacerbate habitat degradation and pressure remaining unionid populations. Invasive species directly compete with native mussels for sustenance and living space and may become serious threats to the survival of remaining unionid species in some habitats...|$|R

This study {{documents}} the herpetofauna of the Koanaka Hills (KH) in Ngamiland in 2009 following extensive fire destruction and compares it to the pre-fire herpetofauna collected in 2008. We also provide new records for the region for three amphibian and six reptile species, and <b>document</b> <b>vouchers</b> for two taxa that were sighted but not collected in 2008. During 2009, 14 reptile and three amphibian species were collected, bringing the total number of confirmed herpetofaunal taxa near the KH to three amphibian and 19 reptile species. For seven species this is the first published occurrence in quarter degree square 2021 Aa. Analyses measuring changes in the KH herpetofauna following the fire are inconclusive due to differences in collection effort and weather conditions.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Army's individually billed travel card program {{is different from the}} purchase card program in that the cardholder is directly responsible for all charges incurred on his or her travel card account, and the monthly bill is sent to the cardholder for payment. The cardholder is responsible for submitting a properly <b>documented</b> <b>voucher</b> and is reimbursed by the Army for all valid expenses related to official government travel. The intent of the travel card program was to improve convenience for the traveler and to reduced the government's costs of administering travel. GAO found substantial delinquencies and charge-offs of Army travel-card accounts during fiscal year 2001, and delinquencies continued into the first half of fiscal year 2002. GAO's analysis shows a correlation between delinquency problems and the travel cardholder's age and pay grade. GAO found that the Army's delinquency and charge-off problems are primarily associated with young, low- to mid-level enlisted military personnel. In addition, a weak internal control environment compounded by instances of delays in processing travel reimbursements to Army military and civilian personnel contributed to the high delinquency rates. The Army and the Department of Defense have taken action to address and focus command- and installation-level attention on management of delinquent travel card accounts. However, these actions are primarily focused on treating the symptoms or "back-end" problems rather than the "front-end" or preventive controls. GAO's work identified numerous instances of potentially fraudulent and abusive activity related to the travel card. During fiscal year 2001, 1, 200 of the over 4, 200 Army account holders who had written at least one nonsufficient funds (NSF) check to pay their travel card bill had their accounts charged off. In the same period, more than 200 cardholders whose accounts were eventually charged off may have also committed bank fraud by writing three or more NSF checks to the Bank of America. GAO's audit found that weaknesses in the Army's overall control environment, including a number of specific controls that were either flawed in their design or in their implementation, are the root source of the Army's inability to prevent or effectively detect the numerous instances of potentially fraudulent and abusive travel card related activity previously detected. ...|$|R
