40|$|This study {{investigated}} die effect of storage temperature on triacylglycerol (TAG) migration, <b>visual</b> <b>fat</b> bloom and taste of industrially produced milk chocolates with a hazelnut-based filling. The chocolates were stored {{for up to}} 10 months at 18 degrees C, either directly after production or with {{the inclusion of a}} variable time at - 20 or 4 degrees C immediately after production and prior to further storage at 18 degrees C. TAG migration from the filling through the chocolate shell was quantified by HPLC analysis of chocolate sampled from the chocolates' surface. Both [OOO/SOS] and [LOO/SOS] were used as markers for oil migration. Compared to storage at 18 degrees C only, chilling or freezing of the chocolates for part of the storage time was found {{to reduce the amount of}} TAG migration. Effects on diffusion, capillary transport and TAG immobilization during the thermal treatment can be raised as possible reasons for this decrease. Furthermore storage at - 20 degrees C decreased oil migration during subsequent storage at 18 degrees C. This suggests a crystallization effect during the storage at - 20 degrees C, leading to permanent (micro) structural changes. Although a thermal treatment at 4 degrees C compared to - 20 degrees C was less effective in retarding TAG migration, storage at low positive temperatures immediately after production appears already beneficial in the prevention of <b>visual</b> <b>fat</b> bloom. Adverse effects of the thermal treatments on the chocolates' taste were not observed...|$|E

40|$|A feeding {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} {{examine the effect of}} diets high or low in rapeseed and additionally the effect of protein supplementation of diets rich in rapeseed oil in feed for farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The aim was to investigate the impact on growth performance, slaughter parameters, total lipid content and fatty acid profile in skeletal muscle, intestine, liver and heart, together with the impact on health related parameters such as organ morphology, heart fat, and also liver color and patches. The salmon were fed extruded dry feed containing 35. 6 % fat and 41. 4 % protein during August-December, and 37. 7 % fat and 34. 6 % protein during December-March. The lipid source was either 70 % marine and 30 % rapeseed oil in the Marine+ group or 30 % marine and 70 % rapeseed oil in Control group (commercial standard). The third diet, Protein+ was same as Control diet added an extra protein (2 %) which was extracted from fish skin (triplicate net-pens per treatment). Fish weights and lengths were measured in October, December and March. Initial weight of the salmon in August was 2. 5 kg. There {{were no significant differences in}} final weight (mean weight of 6. 5 kg), TGC and FCR due to the dietary treatments. However, the Protein+ and Control group had higher condition factor compared to the Marine+ group. Significantly lower CF of the Marine+ group coincided with higher fork length and lower fillet yield. The Control group showed significantly highest viscera-somatic index, <b>visual</b> visceral <b>fat</b> and <b>visual</b> heart <b>fat,</b> whereas these were lowest in the Protein+ group. It was possible to stimulate increased muscle building by providing extra protein into commercial salmon feed, since the slaughter and fillet yield of the Protein+ group increased significantly by 0. 9 % and 1. 6 %, respectively. The fatty acid profile of all organ tissues examined was significantly altered due to the dietary treatment, where 18 : 1 n- 9 changed most significantly. There were higher levels of n- 3 fatty acids, such as of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the Marine+ group. On the other hand, n- 6 fatty acids and C 18 fatty acids, such as 18 : 1 n- 9 and 18 : 2 n- 6 were presented in a higher amount in the Control group. Consequently, the n- 3 /n- 6 fatty acids ratio was higher in the Marine+ group and fish in the Control group had the lower ratio. In conclusion, the present study suggests that addition of 2 % extra protein from fish skin to salmon diets rich in rapeseed oil is beneficial in terms of stimulating muscle growth and counteracting fat accumulation cost by high levels of rapeseed oil.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the fuel stores that arctic-breeding waders put on before {{departure}} from the breeding grounds. During a ship-based expedition to arctic Canada, we caught waders at seven, mainly coastal sites, with-in 68 °- 76 °N and 139 °- 67 °W, from 28 July to 31 August 1999. More than two hundred waders of twelve species were trapped, mainly White-rumped Calidris fuscicollis, Semipalmated C. pusilla, Baird 2 ̆ 7 s C. bairdii and Buff-breasted Sandpipers Tryngites subruficollis. The vast majority of the birds were juveniles.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether it is possible to predict migration fat bloom based on measurements shortly after production. At different storage times shortly after production (0, 1, 4 h), the chocolate batches, varying in tempering method, tempering degree and amount of added butter oil, were evaluated by DSC, pNMR and texture analysis. Discriminant analysis and principal component analysis were combined to investigate the potential towards prediction. The batches were classified into groups depending on the time when white spots appeared (13 wk). A good separation (100 % correct classifications, 100 % using cross-validation) was obtained using the afore-mentioned analyses and storage times. It was also shown that it is possible to exclude DSC analyses or analyses at 0 h storage time without compromising the classification performances too drastically. The study further elucidated that the tempering method has no significant effect on <b>visual</b> <b>fat</b> bloom development. Furthermore, undertempered chocolates bloomed quicker than well-tempered ones, while fat bloom was delayed on overtempered chocolates. Addition of 6 % butter oil promoted fat bloom development, while no significant difference was detected between chocolate with no added butter oil and chocolate with 3 % butter oil added. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A progeny {{test was}} {{designed}} to test whether genetic superiority for lean growth in terminal sires is expressed in their crossbred progeny when reared in a different environment. In each of 1986, 1987 and 1988, 22 Suffolk rams were chosen {{at the conclusion of}} an indoor, intensive performance testing regime on an index score that rated their propensity for lean growth, while constraining fat growth, at 150 days of age. Half of these rams had high index scores and half had low index scores. In each year, around 400 crossbred ewes were mated and the resulting lambs were finished on grass to one of three target live weights (35 - 5, 41 - 5, and 47 - 0 kg). Shoulder joints were dissected on 1505 lambs whilst half carcasses were dissected on 372 lambs. Double sampling techniques were then used to combine the data from the shoulder and half carcass more precisely to predict the lean, fat and bone weight and content in the carcass. With each increment in target live weight, the carcasses were heavier and had proportionally more fat. The progeny of high index rams consistently had 144 (s. e. d. 32) g more lean, 66 (s. e. d. 12) g more bone, and 186 (s. e. d. 32) g less fat in a 19 - 7 (s. e. 0 - 5) kg carcass than progeny of low index rams, from the double sampling procedure. This improved composition reflected a correlated response to ram selection on the index. One standard deviation increase in ram index score corresponded to 51 g more lean and 64 g less fat in the 20 kg carcass of their crossbred offspring. These results show that the use of rams with high lean index scores in a crossbreeding system will produce lambs with leaner carcasses. <b>Visual</b> appraisals of <b>fat</b> and conformation both increased as the weight and, consequently, the fatness of the carcass increased. Offspring of high index rams were consistently scored as less fat than offspring of low index rams. But, at the lighter weights (35 - 5 and 41 - 5 kg), they were also scored lower in conformation — in effect, a penalty for their higher genetic merit for lean growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth rate}} and carcass {{characteristics}} of rangy and short conformation types of steers in Angus, Hereford and Beef Shorthorn breeds were compared in two trials (Trials X and XI) at Massey University. Rangy and short type weaner steers were chosen {{on the basis}} of visual assessment of conformation by experienced stockmen. The Angus steers in Trial X came from the one herd as did the Hereford steers in Trial XI. The two types of Angus (Trial XI) and Beef Shorthorn (Trial X) steers were bred in four different herds. Types within a breed were chosen by the same people, but different persons selected the representative steers in each breed. The steers were grazed together at pasture (except for a short period on a wintering yard in their second year of life) and weighed "full" at various intervals. They were slaughtered at an age of about 30 months. They were processed according to normal commercial practice and various aspects of carcass yield, composition and data on carcass weight, grade, fat colour, and chiller shrinkage were collected, various carcass measurements were taken and the weights of fat and bone were recorded for the right side quarters of each carcass. Fifteen steers were purchased of each type. Trial X concluded in March 1976 (after a period of 625 days) with 13 rangy and 14 short Angus steers, and 14 rangy and 15 short Beef Shorthorn steers. There were no animal losses in Trial XI (633 days) which finished in April 1977 (with 15 steers in each type group) in which the two types in the Angus and Hereford breeds were compared. The results were analysed within trials by the fitting constants procedure using fixed-effects linear models. Type effects were compared within each breed group. One model included {{the right side of the}} cold carcass as a covariate for some aspects of the carcass data analysed within a breed. Rangy type steers in each breed had heavier initial and final liveweights and carcass weights than short type steers. Rangy steers grew more rapidly than short steers in three of the four comparisons. There was no significant difference in growth rate between types of Angus steers in either trial. Rangy Angus steers gained 0. 02 kg/day (n. s.) more than short Angus steers in Trial X, but the short steers grew faster in Trial XIf 0. 03 kg/day (n. s.) and they may have exhibited compensatory growth in the first half of the trial. Rangy Beef Shorthorn and Hereford steers showed a greater superiority in growth rate (Beef Shorthorn 0. 07 kg/day, P< 0. 001; Hereford 0. 06 kg/day, P< 0. 001), compared with short type steers of these two breeds. These differences are important advantages in beef production, however the large difference in growth rate meant that because all steers were slaughtered at the same time (to meet the experimental design) the faster-growing Beef Shorthorn and Hereford steers were carried to much heavier weights than would be normal in most farming situations and this adversely affected their carcass composition, because of higher proportions of fat resulting from their heavier carcass weights. An analysis of the order in which steers were slaughtered showed that they moved into the stunning box independent of their type, breed group or liveweight. This finding indicated that data collection subsequent to the processing of the carcasses or in the boning-out of the quarters would be spread across types and breeds randomly. There were very small, non-significant differences between types in dressing-out percentage, carcass shrinkage in the chiller overnight (by weight, or as a percentage of hot carcass weight), and between the weight of the right and left sides of the carcass. This meant that the types tended to rank in the same order if their mean carcass composition was expressed on either a right side, cold or hot carcass basis, or liveweight basis. Preliminary statistical analysis showed there was little difference between types in the distribution of trimmed, boneless lean, bone and trimmed-off fat between the forequarters and hindquarters of the right sides. Therefore the data for each quarter were pooled and the composition of the right side of each carcass was compared between types. Rangy steers yielded a greater weight of trimmed, boneless lean and bone in each breed group. They yielded a lower weight of excess fat in Angus steers, but not in Beef Shorthorn or Hereford steers. There were small, inconsistent differences between types in the percentage of commercially trimmed boneless lean and bone, but larger differences in the percentage of excess fat trimmed from the right side of the carcass. The size of the type differences was influenced by right side weight. The ratio of trimmed meat to bone did not differ significantly between types, therefore it was concluded that the main determinant of the differences in the percentage yields was the amount of excess trimmed fat. Rangy steers tended to have a lower percentage of excess fat and were leaner than short steers except in the case of the Beef Shorthorns and Herefords. Angus types had similar amounts of kidney and channel fat (no significant difference between types in Trials X and XI, respectively). Rangy steers had more kidney and channel fat than short steers in Beef Shorthorns (1. 73 kg, P< 0. 05) and Herefords (2. 22 kg, P< 0. 01). When adjusted for right side weight there was less kidney and channel fat in rangy than short Angus (0. 72 kg, n. s. Trial X, 1. 72 kg, P< 0. 05 Trial XI) and Beef Shorthorns (0. 53 kg, n. s.), but slightly more in rangy Herefords (0. 53 kg, n. s.). Rangy Angus (Trial X) and Beef Shorthorn steers had less fat over the 12 th ribeye than short steers (2. 0 and 1. 5 mm, n. s., respectively). There was little difference in fat depth between Angus (Trial XI) and Hereford types (0. 6 and 0. 8 mm, n. s., respectively). When the depth of fat over the ribeye of the 12 th rib was adjusted for right side weight short steers had a slightly greater depth of fat than rangy steers in Angus (2. 5 mm, n. s.) and Beef Shorthorns (5. 1 mm, n. s.) in Trial X. However in Trial XI rangy Angus steers had a slightly greater depth of fat than short steers (0. 4 mm, n. s.), but there was no difference between types in Herefords. Rangy steers had larger ribeyes than short steers except in Herefords. The difference in ribeye areas between types was 2. 51 cm 2 (n. s.) in Angus Trial X, 6. 77 cm 2 (P< 0. 01) in Beef Shorthorns and 5. 81 cm 2 (P< 0. 05) in Angus Trial XI. Short Hereford steers had larger ribeye areas than rangy steers by 3. 77 cm 2 (n. s.). These differences were reduced and became non-significant when adjusted for right side weight except in Herefords where short steers had significantly largerribeyes (6. 76 cm 2, P< 0. 01). Rangy steers had longer carcasses than short steers and longer bone measurements. They had a deeper carcass than short steers in Beef Shorthorn and Hereford steers, but not in Angus steers. The measurement of the depth of the carcass was influenced by fatness which appeared visually to increase the depth of short carcasses in relation to their skeletal size. The types did nof differ in the ratio of carcass length to carcass depth. When carcass dimensions were adjusted for right side weight the differences between types generally became non-significant except in Beef Shorthorn cattle. Rangy steers had slightly greater measures of carcass length, length of the leg and forearm, but had shorter measures of carcass depth than short-type steers except in Beef Shorthorns although the differences were not large. It was concluded that selection of rangy- compared to short-type weaner steers by visual assessment of conformation resulted in more beef being produced by the Angus, Hereford and Beef Shorthorn cattle. The reasons for increased production were various. In each comparison between types the superior initial weight of rangy weaner steers contributed about half of the increase in final yield of lean (assuming a similar composition at weaning). Rapid growth rate of rangy steers in Beef Shorthorn and Herefords contributed to their increased yield of lean although they were over-finished as a consequence of their greater growth rate and the experimental design requiring all cattle to be slaughtered at one time. Growth rate was not found to be an important factor in Angus steers where it appeared that a small superiority in carcass composition resulted in a greater yield of lean meat from rangy steers. Analysis of carcass composition and dimensions at slaughter showed considerable variation within each type. Ratios of body length to depth did not differ and in this respect rangy steers were "bigger" and heavier than short steers though not disproportionately so in relation to weight. The variation within each type suggested that some steers would have been classified into the other group had this been done at the conclusion of the trial. The ratio of body length to chest depth is not a true measure of skeletal size because of the influence of carcass fat in measuring chost depth. It would thus be unwise to draw conclusions about proportionality in size from this study. The experiment has indirectly shown the importance of a heavy weaning weight, of rapid growth rate, and of lean content in beef production. The relative importance of other factors such as age, pre-weaning growth rate, sire and dam and the pre-trial environment could not be assessed with the cattle purchased for this investigation. Visual assessment was not consistent in terms of selection for the same trait. This may have been due to the effect of different persons (between breeds) and their interpretation of "types" and to the amount of phenotypic variation for type in the population from which the steers were selected. The trends observed in this study are in the right direction to improve beef production of traditional beef breeds. The concept will be of use to farmers and others who choose cattle with or without records. The carcasses were graded either P 1 or G in both trials. The number of carcasses in each grade were: Trial X G= 33, P 1 = 23; Trial XI G= 16, P 1 = 44, An analysis tested the hypothesis that there were no differences between grades in carcass characteristics. Carcasses graded G were heavier (15. 4 kg, P< 0. 05) in Trial X, but not significantly so in Trial XI (7. 9 kg, n. s.). They had no more kidney and channel fat (1. 10 kg, n. s., Trial X and 0. 56 kg, n. s. Trial XI) than carcasses graded P 1. Results for other carcass characteristics were inconsistent between trials. Carcasses graded G in Trial X had a greater depth of fat over the 12 th ribeye (2. 4 mm, P< 0. 05), and a greater proportion of excess fat and less trimmed lean of the right side of the carcass (2. 26 % fat, P< 0. 001, and 1. 58 % lean, P< 0. 05). These results agree with grade expectations. In Trial XI however, carcasses graded G had the same fat depth over the 12 th ribeye (0. 0 mm, n. s.), less excess fat trim and more lean as a percentage of right side weight (1. 74 % fat, P< 0. 01, 1. 72 % lean, P< 0. 05) in direct contradiction to the results of Trial X and of grade expectations. Subjective <b>visual</b> assessment of <b>fat</b> depth from the uncut surface of the carcass resulted in 60 and 88 percent of carcasses being wrongly classified in relation to G grade standards (Trials X and XI, respectively). Graders had more success in classifying "leaner" carcasses 30 and 25 percent of carcasses graded P 1 had fat depths outside the grade specification (Trials X and XI, respectively) and then by only a few millimetres. Carcasses graded G in Trial X were of a similar "size" to those graded P 1, but were heavier, whereas in Trial XI carcasses graded G were "larger", but of a similar weight...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This Symposium {{provides}} the opportunity to review recent progress in understanding the biology of intramuscular fat deposition (marbling) in the bovine. Measurement of marbling is still a significant industry issue: subjective assessment based {{on the degree of}} <b>visual</b> <b>fat</b> deposition and its distribution is the ‘gold standard ’ for marbling grades. Yet this measurement is subject to operator error and is influenced by chiller temperature. Chemical extraction gives an unequivocal measure of all fat in the muscle (IMF%), but does this mirror exactly what the trade regards as “marbling”? Near Infrared Spectrometry (NIR) may provide an indirect, on line method for estimating IMF%. This needs immediate further research. Progeny test results from the CRC breeding projects provide improved understanding of breed and genetic effects on IMF % and marble score. EBVs for IMF % have been released to industry for 7 breeds. Heritability estimates confirm that genetic progress will be faster when selection is based on IMF % than marble score. Genetic correlations of IMF % with growth, retail beef yield (RBY%), P 8 fat, Residual Feed Intake (RFI) and tenderness are now available to underpin selection indices. A favourable allele for marbling (TG 5) on chromosome 14 has been identified by CSIRO/MLA as a direct gene marker for the trait. This is now being marketed as GeneStar Marbling. Other favourable chromosomal regions are under investigation by the CRC. Nutritional manipulation of marbling remains problematic. It is accepted that high energy grain diets achieve highe...|$|E
40|$|Size-adjusted mass is {{a common}} body {{condition}} index (BCI) used to indicate nonstructural energy reserves (fat and protein). BCIs are calculated from ratios of mass divided by a morphometric(s) or residuals of a regression between mass and a morphometric(s). The morphometrics used in BCIs must accurately represent structural size to reliably index energy reserves and, ideally, BCIs should be validated with comparisons to true fat and protein reserves. Many studies of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) have included BCIs in ecological analyses; unfortunately, few studies have reported how well morphometrics represented structural size or provided validation of BCIs relative to independent measures of energy reserves. We evaluated relationships between several morphometrics and mass to better understand which morphometrics may best represent structural size for two kestrel populations: captive birds at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and free-living kestrels in southwestern Idaho, U. S. A. We also compared BCIs based on different morphometrics with subjective (<b>visual)</b> <b>fat</b> scores. Our data showed few strong (r 3 ̆e 0. 5) correlations between morphometrics and few strong correlations between each morphometric and mass. Moreover, correlations between morphometrics and mass depended on sex and location. Similarly, not all BCIs had statistically significant, positive correlations with subjective fat scores and correlations varied between sexes, suggesting that the reliability of each BCI differed between males and females. The morphometrics that best represent structural size most likely differ between males and females, and information from both sexes should not be combined to create one size measure for kestrels. Unless BCIs for specific American Kestrel subpopulations are validated, mass and additional qualitative information, such as fat scores, {{may be the most}} appropriate indicators of fat and protein stores...|$|E
40|$|Fat bloom {{is one of}} {{the main}} quality {{problems}} in the chocolate industry. A bloomed chocolate product is characterized by the loss of its initial gloss and the formation of a gray-whitish haze, which makes the product unappealing from a consumer point of view. In the industry, most of the fat bloom related problems arise in filled chocolate products, like pralines and chocolate-coated biscuits. In these products, oil migration is considered the main cause of fat bloom development. It leads to the dissolution of solid cocoa butter crystals in the chocolate shell which may recrystallize with the formation of undesired crystals. These give rise, upon growth, to <b>visual</b> <b>fat</b> bloom. When looking at the available literature, most of the studies elucidate the possible mechanisms of oil migration and the subsequent fat bloom formation using model systems. These model systems are sometimes too distant from the real industrial applications and the important role of the microstructure of the products are often neglected, although it plays a crucial role in migration-induced fat bloom development. The main objective of this review is to describe the relationships between chocolate microstructure, oil migration, and fat bloom. Practical applications: This review can be used as a base for the development of microstructural strategies to retard oil migration and fat bloom development in filled chocolates. An important strategy to retard oil migration and migration-induced fat bloom is the creation of more dense structures. By creating denser structures, the overall mobility is reduced leading to a decrease in the rate and extent of oil migration. Also, more dense structures hinder recrystallization and Ostwald ripening, thereby delaying the migration-induced fat bloom development. As fillings are less standardized and not bound by legislation, modification of the filling composition and microstructure offers more opportunities in delaying fat bloom. The main objective of the review is to describe the relationships between chocolate microstructure, oil migration, and fat bloom, as illustrated in this scheme. The numbers indicate the four parts that are discussed in this review...|$|E
