40|$|Presented for {{the first}} time, {{to the best of}} the authors ´ knowledge, is the design of a power smart in-door optical {{wireless}} link that provides lossless beam propagation between Transmitter (T) and Receiver (R) for changing link distances. Each T/R unit uses a combination of fixed and variable focal length optics to smartly adjust the laser beam propagation parameters of minimum beam waist size and its location to produce the optimal zero propagation loss coupling condition at the R for that link distance. An Electronically Controlled <b>Variable</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Lens</b> (ECVFL) is used to form the wide field-of-view search beam and change the beam size at R to form a low loss beam.

Especially mobile phones have driven that trend to today's ultra-small cameras embedded into the handset. While the image capture IC features ever-decreasing pixel geometries and surging megapixel numbers, the readout circuitry and optical systems are now challenged to follow-up with this trend. This paper describes a miniaturization approach using advanced packaging techniques for the electronic system (bare die assembly in stack-wirebond and flip-chip) onto a high density circuit board and leveraging a MEMS based optical system providing the possibility for <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> an aperture concept.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and control of}} capillary systems such as drop, bubble and liquid bridges are central to many industrial applications. When a single continuous phase of liquid is bound between two disconnected interfaces, the physics of interaction between these two interfaces, coupled by the liquid bulk, is more complex when compared to simple capillary systems, giving rise to some interesting applications such as droplet manipulator and <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens.</b> In this thesis, the study is focused on one such coupled interfacial system called the double droplet system, which is a pendant drop and a sessile drop connected through a liquid filled hole in a plate. In the application as a droplet manipulator, the sessile drop is grown {{at the expense of}} the pendant drop so that it coalesces with a second pendant drop encapsulating an immiscible pendant droplet. Breakup of the resulting liquid bridge provides the energy to detach the encapsulated droplet from its solid support and transfer it into the capillary switch for easy handling. In this work, rigorous numerical algorithms based on Galerkin finite element method (G/FEM) are developed to analyze the dynamics. Success of this technique can be partly attributed to development of elliptic mesh that deforms significantly, aiding in study of singularities such as coalescence and bridge break-up. The dynamics of this process, which are affected by many parameters including but limited to volume, height of bridge, thickness of plate, and external pressure, are studied by two methods (i) exact 2 -D analysis and (ii) 1 -D analysis based on slender jet approximation. The parameter space is reduced by identifying the feasible regions using computationally inexpensive equilibrium analysis of the intermediate coupled bridge-droplet system. By combining a robust arc length formulation and continuation technique, families of equilibrium curves are efficiently tracked. Results show that the coupled bridge-droplet system shows both stable to unstable transition similar to a liquid bridge and multi stable states similar to capillary switch, with much more complexity. ^ While the small size and highly spherical droplet shapes enable the capillary switch to act as a miniature liquid lens, oscillating it at its natural frequency doubles its utility as a <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lens,</b> capable of scanning different focal lengths within one cycle. The frequency response of the capillary switch to both free and forced oscillations are studied numerically using G/FEM for a Newtonian liquid. Complex interactions between the two interfaces produce twice as many oscillatory modes of that of a pendant or a sessile drop. In addition, a lower mode not exhibited by pendant (sessile) drops or free drops is also discovered. The effect of parameters, such as volume, plate thickness, and liquid viscosity, on the shift in modal frequencies are investigated and verified with existing experimental results in literature. Appropriate Green 2 ̆ 7 s functions developed to verify the results analytically, indicate excellent agreement in the limit of vanishing plate thickness for inviscid liquids. ...|$|E
40|$|Electrowetting (EW) {{of water}} drops in ambient oil {{has found a}} wide range of {{applications}} including lab-on-a-chip devices, display screens, and <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lenses.</b> The efficacy of all these applications is dependent on the contact angle hysteresis (CAH), which is generally reduced in the presence of ambient oil due to thin lubrication layers. While it is well-known that AC voltage reduces the effective contact angle hysteresis (CAH) for EW in ambient air, we demonstrate here that CAH for EW in ambient oil increases with increasing AC and DC voltage. Taking into account the disjoining pressure of the fluoropolymer-oil-water system, viscous oil entrainment and electrostatic stresses, we find that this observation can be explained by progressive thinning with increasing voltage of the oil layer underneath the drop. This exposes the droplet to the roughness of the underlying solid and thereby increases hysteresis. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|The use of optics in {{the fields}} of nano-technology, {{telecommunication}} and medicine has been growing exponentially in recent years. Application of liquid crystals within optics has been a growing trend from flat screen displays to <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> in a digital versatile discs. One area of the recent developments within optics has been the development of two-photon fluorescence microscopy and high-density three-dimensional optical data storage. In such applications, where a light beam has to be focused deep within the volume of bulk media, aberrations are introduced. The most dominant aberration is spherical aberration which results from the mismatch in refractive indices of the immersion and recording media. The aim of this thesis is to design a liquid crystal lens for dynamic tube length compensation of the spherical aberration. Liquid crystal phase plates are used in everyday liquid crystal displays (LCDs) such as mobile phones and calculators. The technologies required to manufacture a liquid crystal phase plate are well understood. However, an application like three-dimensional data storage requires different properties in the liquid crystal phase plate, which are investigated in this thesis. To fabricate our liquid crystal phase plate we used ZLI- 5049 - 000 from MERCK as the liquid crystal medium, with poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) and Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) providing the insulating and conducting layers, respectively. It has been demonstrated that vacuum vapour deposition can be used to coat a glass substrate with ITO.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that about one billion people in the Developing World would benefit immediately from distance vision and near vision correction if it were available to them. Here we address this prob-lem by correcting vision in the field with adaptive liquid filled <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lenses,</b> and test whether it is possible by simple means to determine and obtain correct refraction using such lenses. For nearly one billion people in the Developing World 1 currently without the vision correction they require, the benefits of providing a simple and inexpen-sive means of correcting refractive error are clear, since poor vision can hinder a child's educational development and an adult's productivity at work. Studies have demon-strated the prevalence of visual impairment amongst chil-dren. A study performed in Shunyi District, China 2, sampling a total of 6134 children revealed that {{by the age of}} 15 years 46 % of children were myopic (<− 0. 5 D) and that the prevalence of uncorrected vision in at least one eye was 13 %. It also showed that refrac-tive error was the cause in 89 % of the 1236 eyes with reduced vision. Results from a study 3 in La Florida, Chile, indicate that more than 7 % of school-age children could benefit from the provision of proper spectacles. It concluded that efforts are needed to make existing pro-grams that provide free spectacles to school children more effective. Another study in India 4 established that, for {{children between the ages of}} 7 and 15 years, 70 % of those that had visual acuity of 20 / 40 or worse would benefit from spectacles.

30|$|Several {{studies on}} {{liquid-filled}} lens have been reported. An asymmetrical liquid-filled lens was designed, of which both the light direction and the focal length {{can be changed}} by controlling the tilt angel of the pressure ring and the hydraulic pressure of the lens [6]. Likewise, a <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> membrane <b>lens</b> was presented which focused {{on the problem of}} theoretical evaluation of the surface shape using the generalized nonlinear differential equation [7]. In addition, a liquid-filled tunable focus microlens was designed by using a membrane with different thickness between the central and peripheral region [8]. Besides, many kinds of liquid-filled lens with different actuators or control strategies were also designed in recent years, furthermore, the liquid tunable aspherical lenses are formed by liquid sealed with a non-uniform thickness membrane which could alleviate the edge clamping effect and reduce spherical aberration [9 – 15]. In order to decrease the influence of gravity to the performance of liquid lens, one of a method is using an in-plane pretention force to a membrane {{to take the place of}} surface tension and the other is using a non-uniform thickness profile of the flexible membrane [16, 17]. However, one of the common disadvantages of these liquid-filled lenses is that the focus could be adjusted in one region or only have one focus. Therefore, to suit different groups of people under different conditions, a liquid progressive multifocal lens with a non-uniform thickness elastic membrane is designed in this paper.|$|R
40|$|Digital {{microfluidics}} is {{a rapidly}} growing field wherein droplets are manipulated for use in small-scale applications such as <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> <b>lenses,</b> display technology, fiber optics, and lab-on-a-chip devices. There has been considerable interest in digital microfluidics and the various methods for liquid actuation by thermal, chemical, and electrical means, where each of the actuation methods {{make use of the}} favorable scaling relationship of surface tension forces at the micro scale. Another increasingly important field is addressing the ever growing need for improved heat transfer techniques in the next generation of electronic devices. As device size decreases and device efficiency increases, high heat flux removal capabilities (100 - 1000 W/cm 2) are critical to achieve the lower device operating temperatures necessary to ensure reliably and performance. In this thesis, we investigate the nature of the forcing that occurs in the transport of liquid drops by electrical means. The effects of system parameters on the force density and its net integral are considered in the case of dielectrophoresis (insulating fluids) and electrowetting-on-dielectric (conductive fluids). Moreover, we explore the effectiveness of a new heat transfer technique called digitized heat transfer (DHT), where droplets are utilized to enhance the removal of heat from electronic devices. Numerical computations of the Nusselt number for these types of flows provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of DHT in comparison to continuous flows. These two physical phenomena are but two examples that illustrate the growing need for numerical techniques that simply and efficiently handle problems on irregular domains. We present two algorithms appropriate in this environment. The first extends the recently introduced Immersed Boundary Projection Method (IBPM), originally developed for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, to elliptic and parabolic problems on irregular domains in a second-order accurate manner. The second algorithm employs a boundary integral approach to the solution of elliptic problems in three-dimensional axisymmetric domains with non-axisymmetric boundary conditions. By using Fourier transforms to reduce the three-dimensional problem to a series of problems defined on the generating curve of the surface, a Nyström discretization employing generalized Gaussian quadratures can be applied to rapidly compute the solution with high accuracy. We demonstrate the high order nature of the discretization. An accelerated technique for computing the kernels of the reduced integral equations is developed for those kernels arising from Laplace 2 ̆ 7 s equation, overcoming what was previously the major obstacle in the solution to such problems. We extend this technique to a wide class of kernels, with a particular emphasis on those arising from the Helmholtz equation, and provide strong numerical evidence of the efficiency of this approach. By combining the above approach with the Fast Multipole Method, we develop an efficient and accurate technique for solving boundary integral equations on multiply connected domains...|$|R

Chang et al. (2009) presented a flexible material of controlled shape and stiffness embedded with microchannel networks.

It is a powerful technique used to create <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> liquid <b>lenses,</b> electronic paper and other devices, but it depends upon ions within the liquid. Liquid dielectrophoresis (L-DEP) is a bulk force acting on the dipoles throughout a dielectric liquid and is not normally {{considered to be a}} localized effect acting at the interface between the liquid and a solid or other fluid. In this work, we show theoretically how non-uniform electric fields generated by interdigitated electrodes can effectively convert L-DEP into an interface localized form. We show that for droplets of sufficient thickness, the change in the cosine of the contact angle is proportional to the square of the applied voltage and so obeys a similar equation to that for electrowetting – this we call dielectrowetting. However, a major difference to electrowetting is that the strength of the effect is controlled by the electrode spacing and the liquid permittivity rather than the properties of an insulator in a sandwich structure. Experimentally, we show that this dielectrowetting equation accurately describes the contact angle of a droplet of oil viewed across parallel interdigitated electrodes. Importantly, the induced spreading can be complete, such that contact angle saturation does not occur. We then show that for thin films, L-DEP can shape the liquid-air interface creating a spatially periodic wrinkle and that such a wrinkle can be used to create a voltage programmable phase diffraction grating...|$|R

From these two effects, as well as the use of an electron imaging system, sufficient control over the beam path is possible for TEM operation. The optical configuration of a TEM can be rapidly changed, unlike that for an optical microscope, as lenses in the beam path can be enabled, have their strength changed, or be disabled entirely simply via rapid electrical switching, the speed of which is limited by effects such as the magnetic hysteresis of the lenses.|$|R

Theoretical design of <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> {{is carried out}} according {{to the principle of}} grazing incidence, and key parameters of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> are determined. The materials of <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> and the preparation technologies such as the coating process are discussed. The performance parameters of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> are tested respectively under the conditions of visible light and X-ray. The results show that the spot diameter of visible light is 14 mm, the spot diameter of X-ray is 20 mm, and the focusing efficiency is 30. 2 %. The effective area is 2400 mm 2 in a 10 m vacuum pipe when the photon energy is 1. 5 keV. © 2016, Chinese Lasers Press. All right reserved...|$|R

Superconducting solenoids will be used as <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> in the low energy accelerating sections of the front end. The development of <b>focusing</b> <b>lenses</b> for the first accelerating section is in the production stage, and lens certification activities are in preparation at FNAL. The report contains information about the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> design and performance, including solenoid, dipole corrector, and power leads, and about cryogenic system design and performance. It also describes the lens magnetic axis position measurement technique and discusses scope of an acceptance/certification process...|$|R
