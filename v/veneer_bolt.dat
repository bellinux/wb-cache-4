30|$|Due {{to several}} {{unforeseen}} circumstances, problems were encountered with some veneer bolts, particularly those from Site 808. A regression approach was initially considered for estimating missing values but use of predictive equations for extrapolation of data, rather than interpolation, could provide unreliable estimates of stiffness. Thus, {{the decision was}} made to concentrate on veneer from the first <b>veneer</b> <b>bolt</b> of the butt log of each tree from Site 808 for which veneer data remained reasonably intact. For one tree from Site 808 (A 1), and also one tree from Site 803 (C 1), data from the first <b>veneer</b> <b>bolt</b> from the butt log were missing, so data from the second <b>veneer</b> <b>bolt</b> were substituted. It was therefore expected that the mean stiffness of these two bolts, and the mean stiffness of tree C 1 at Site 803, would be slightly under-estimated.|$|E
30|$|In general, high-stiffness {{trees had}} higher density and smaller diameters with taper less than 1.2  cm m- 1. However, trees with smaller diameters produce less veneer. As {{a general rule}} of thumb, the number of sheets in the butt <b>veneer</b> <b>bolt</b> can be {{estimated}} from 80 % of the diameter, less 6.5 sheets for each unit of taper, {{and the number of}} veneer sheets in the tree derived by multiplying that number by 5. Thus there is a trade-off between forestry practices that target high value (stiffness) production and those that target high volume production.|$|E
30|$|Felled {{trees were}} {{crosscut}} into 10.67  m long logs, from which two 5.33  m mill-length logs were obtained. Each mill-length log was crosscut into two veneer bolts (peeler blocks) which were steamed and peeled into veneer until the core measured approximately 8.9  cm in diameter. The veneer sheets were tracked during the peeling process, allowing each sheet to be uniquely {{traced back to}} the <b>veneer</b> <b>bolt</b> and consequently to the position within the bolt, log, and parent tree, thus enabling the construction of internal stiffness maps for each tree (after Todoroki et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Wood {{is often}} limited in {{structural}} applications to relatively small structures {{due to its}} lack of homogeneity and low strength compared to steel and concrete. Wood can become a more versatile material if used with Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP) to form a composite. This thesis {{presents the results of}} an investigation of the increase in yield strength, ultimate strength, and change in yield mode of wood connections when reinforced with FRP. Specifically, this thesis investigates the effects of FRP reinforcement in Laminated <b>Veneer</b> Lumber (LVL) <b>bolted</b> connections under double shear loading. The FRP investigated consists of uniaxial carbon fibers embedded in a two-part epoxy. Sixteen sample wood connections were tested. Eight samples were reinforced with FRP such that the carbon fibers were parallel to the wood fibers. Eight samples tested were not reinforced and used as a means of comparison. Three sizes of bolts and two failure modes were investigated. All materials chosen are readily available and affordable in the current construction market. Finally, the results of a cost vs. strength gain analysis are presented. FRP reinforcement of the glue-laminated wood connections under double shear loading resulted in an increase in yield strength and ultimate strength of all connections tested when compared to unreinforced samples with the same properties. The addition of FRP reinforcement changed the yield mode for some samples. However, it seems that FRP reinforcement is only cost effective in situations in which a higher ultimate strength is desired, rather than a higher yield strength or change in yield mode. by Kathleen Whelton O'Brien.

30|$|Trees {{on a site}} in Washington were 51  years old, {{while those}} {{situated}} in Oregon were 45  years old. Both sites comprised five plots: Plot A was the control, while Plots B, C, D, and E were prescribed with differing thinning treatments. Acoustic readings were stratified, and a sample of six trees per plot randomly selected from the stratified samples. Trees were harvested, cross-cut, and peeled into veneer. Veneer was acoustically tested, and density and MOE calculated for each sheet. Veneer sheets were grouped by parent bolt and tree, and MOE of the butt <b>veneer</b> <b>bolt</b> and the parent tree determined from the mean. Plot means were compared using {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA), and regression models developed with mean tree MOE as the response variable and non-destructive tree measures as explanatory variables. Further models were developed to demonstrate the relationship between tree diameter and the number of veneer sheets peeled, and between MOE of the parent tree and butt bolt.|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} stiffness of parent trees and tree variables, data were plotted and simple linear regression models developed using MOET as the response variable and V, D, H, and T as explanatory variables. V 2 was also tested as an explanatory variable (following Equation  1). Note that {{the strength of the}} relationship between MOET and V 2 remains unaltered by any multiplicative constant that would represent constant wood density. However, the relationship will be weakened if the intercept is set equal to zero, {{as is the case in}} Equation  1. Both model forms, with and without the intercept, were evaluated. Linear regression models with MOEL as the response variable and V, D, H, T, and V 2 as explanatory variables were developed similarly. Multiple regression models using combinations of tree variables and, in the case of MOEL, site variables, were also investigated. Further models were developed to describe the relationship between tree and butt log stiffness (MOET and MOEL), and between breast-height diameter and the number of veneer sheets procured from each tree, NT, and from each butt <b>veneer</b> <b>bolt,</b> NL.|$|E
