40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. The independent analysis results for the Orbiter Rudder/Speedbrake Actuation Mechanism is documented. The function of the Rudder/Speedbrake (RSB) is to provide directional control {{and to provide a}} means of energy control during entry. The system consists of two panels on a vertical hinge mounted on the aft part of the vertical stabilizer. These two panels move together to form a rudder but split apart to make a speedbrake. The Rudder/Speedbrake Actuation Mechanism consists of the following elements: (1) Power Drive Unit (PDU) which is composed of hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>module</b> and a hydraulic motor-powered gearbox which contains differentials and mixer gears to provide PDU torque output; (2) four geared rotary actuators which apply the PDU generated torque to the rudder/speedbrake panels; and (3) ten torque shafts which join the PDU to the rotary actuators and interconnect the four rotary actuators. Each level of hardware was evaluated and analyzed for possible failures and causes. Criticality was assigned based upon the severity of the effect for each failure mode. Critical RSB failures which result in potential loss of vehicle control were mainly due to loss of hydraulic fluid, fluid contaminators, and mechanical failures in gears and shafts...|$|E

The interest {{is focused on the}} analysis and modelling of the whole hydraulic circuit that, beside a load sensing variable displacement pump, features a stack of nine proportional directional control <b>valves</b> <b>modules</b> of which seven are of the load sensing type. Loads being sensed are the boom swing, boom, stick and bucket, right and left track motors and work tools; instead, the blade and the turret swing users do not contribute to the load sensing signal. Of specific interest are the peculiarities that were observed in the stack. In fact, to develop an accurate AMESim modelling, the stack was dismantled and all modules analysed and represented in a CAD environment as 3 D parts. The load sensing flow generation unit was replaced on the vehicle by another one whose analysis and modelling have been developed using available design and experimental data. Although both the Hydraulic Component Design library as well as the Planar Mechanical library were used extensively in the process of modelling the entire circuit, some simplifications became necessary and are detailed in the paper. As the modelling phase was developing, a number of field experiments on the vehicle were also performed: these served the purpose of providing reference data to the end of progressing with the validation phase of the AMESim model. Regarding predictive simulation results, these are appropriately consistent with gathered experimental outcomes. The AMESim model will be instrumental for upcoming analyses that foresee the substitution of the original stack with other load sensing post-compensated modules so to assess with reasonable confidence the effects on potential energy savings...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Test Active Control Technology (ACT) System laboratory tests was to verify and validate the system concept, hardware, and software. The initial lab tests were open loop hardware tests of the Test ACT System as designed and built. During {{the course of the}} testing, minor problems were uncovered and corrected. Major software tests were run. The initial software testing was also open loop. These tests examined pitch control laws, wing load alleviation, signal selection/fault detection (SSFD), and output management.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to generate a reliable experimental database on the fluid hammer phenomenon with real propellants (MMH and NTO) to validate the physical models implemented in the numerical codes. This database with real propellants extends the database obtained by the von Karman Institute on similitude fluids (water, ethanol and acetaldehyde). The test facility is composed with parts provided by VKI (propellant line, fast opening <b>valve,</b> measurement <b>module</b> and instrumentation). The combination of these elements with the Onera pressure vessel and vacuum system enables to build a facility close to the VKI one used for similitude fluids. For each real propellant, experiments were performed for a vacuum pressure in the propellant line below and above the saturation pressure of the fluid to highlight the influence of the physical phenomena encountered (vaporisation, cavitation [...] .) on the fluid hammer. With MMH, the higher is the vacuum pressure, the smaller are the fluid hammer frequency and amplitude. The same conclusions found by VKI for ethanol when compared to water are now found with MMH: the fluid hammer amplitude is smaller and the frequency is higher. Only one experiment was performed with NTO for a vacuum pipe pressure below the saturation pressure due to leaks of the valve seals. Compared to MMH and water experiments performed under the same operating conditions, the fluid hammer amplitude and frequency are smaller. Regarding the temperature, very small variations are recorded for water and MMH while the temperature increase for NTO is higher than 350 °C...|$|R

40|$|A 100 MW-class planar solid {{oxide fuel}} cell {{synchronous}} gas turbine hybrid {{system has been}} designed, modeled, and controlled. The system is built of 70 functional fuel cell modules, each containing 10 fuel cell stacks, a blower to recirculate depleted cathode air, a depleted fuel oxidizer, and a cathode inlet air recuperator with bypass. The recuperator bypass serves to control the cathode inlet air temperature, while the variable speed cathode blower recirculates air to control the cathode air inlet temperature. This allows for excellent fuel cell thermal management without independent control of the gas turbine, which at this scale {{will most likely be}} a synchronous generator. In concept the demonstrated modular design makes it possible to vary the number of cells controlled by each fuel <b>valve,</b> power electronics <b>module,</b> and recirculation blower, so that actuators can adjust to variations in {{the hundreds of thousands of}} fuel cells contained within the 100 MW hybrid system for improved control and reliability. In addition, the modular design makes it possible to take individual fuel cell modules offline for maintenance while the overall system continues to operate. Parametric steady-state design analyses conducted on the system reveal that the overall fuel-to-electricity conversion efficiency of the current system increases with increased cathode exhaust recirculation. To evaluate and demonstrate the conceptualized design, the fully integrated system was modeled dynamically in MATLAB-SIMULINK. Simple proportional feedback with steady-state feed-forward controls for power tracking, thermal management, and stable gas turbine operation were developed for the system. Simulations of the fully controlled system indicate that the system has a high efficiency over a large range of operating conditions, decent transient load following capability, fuel and ambient temperature disturbance rejection, and the capability to operate with a varying number of fuel cell modules. The efforts here build on prior work and combine the efforts of system design, system operation, component performance characterization, and control to demonstrate hybrid transient capability in large-scale coal synthesis gas-based applications through simulation. Furthermore, the use of a modular fuel cell system design, the use of blower recirculation, and the need for integrated system controls are verified. © 2010 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|Properly {{constructed}} modules {{will prevent}} reduced lint value and increased ginning costs when significant rainfall occurs. Additionally, cotton producers often have difficulty finding adequate labor during harvest. These issues were addressed {{by developing a}} graphical operator feedback system, a biomass package measurement system, a powered tramper, and an autonomous module forming system. A system that provided feedback on the module shape by recording {{the position of the}} tramper and carriage was used to direct the operator to move cotton to appropriate locations. The system correctly predicted the height of 67 % of data points. Use of the feedback system resulted in a 55 % reduction in water collection area of the modules. The module builder operators indicated that the system was useful. The module builder feedback system is a simple, useful, and inexpensive tool that can have a rapid payback for producers. A powered tramper, with an auger to move cotton {{to the center of the}} module, was developed to replace the conventional tramper. The powered tramper operated automatically without affecting the operating speed or pressure of the tramper cylinder. During testing, the powered tramper was observed moving cotton to the center and crowned modules were produced. A biomass package measurement system was developed to record the height at multiple points on the top surface of modules. The system was found to produce repeatable measurements with an error of 5 cm. Data collected with this system did not indicate a difference in module shape when using the powered tramper; however, during these tests the powered tramper was turned off prematurely due to an improperly sized <b>valve</b> on the <b>module</b> builder. An automated module building system capable of both moving and tramping cotton was developed. This system utilized the feedback system sensors and photoelectric sensors to determine the location of cotton in the builder.

40|$|An Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is {{a custom}} power device {{commonly}} used in Low voltage networks to protect sensitive loads by mitigating power quality problems like voltage dips, interruptions and improvement of power factor. Sudden power outages, that are unplanned and power disturbances in unprotected low and medium voltage networks with sensitive load of a duration ranging from a hundreds of milliseconds to several hours could eventuate into adverse financial losses. In this thesis, a study is performed {{on the state of}} the art developments in UPS designs and available topologies {{commonly used in}} the industry with static converters. A Modular Multi-level Converter (MMC) based UPS system is proposed and simulated in Matlab/SIMULINK with PLECS blockset under different operating conditions such as load unbalance, voltage dips and operation with both resistive-inductive and non-linear loads with a focus on converter performance. The UPS system is compared the Two-level Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based UPS topology. The results showed that the output voltage wave forms of the Medium Voltage (MV) MMC have a more sinusoidal shape compared with the Two-level converter that has a square output voltage, hence less requirements on the filters for the MMC. In the thesis an MMC UPS was simulated with a switching frequency of 1000 Hz which was significantly lower than the 2000 Hz for Two-level converter based UPS system, resulting in lower losses when using the MMC based UPS system. The structure and operation of the MMC was described and it showed that series modules could be added in the arms of the MMC to alter its operating voltage and power requirement, offering system scalability. With the structure of MMCs, it’s possible to perform cell hot swaps and this increases the reliability of the MMC UPS as modules can be replaced while UPS still remains in operation without necessarily invoking the maintenance by-pass mode. In the MMC, the failed module can also be by-passed, thus offering very high redundancy and possibility to use low cost <b>valves</b> in the <b>modules.</b> The risks of operating the MV MMC and Transformerless UPS systems are also discussed and suggestions are made on how to manage the risks. Finally practical scenarios are identified where the proposed MMC based UPS systems can be applied in industry and how they can improve on the power quality and reduce on the operational losses...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{automotive}} {{market is}} extremely competitive and quickly changing. The customers demand excellent driving performance, new legislations impose increasingly stricter constraints and competition imposes increasingly shorter development cycles because of reduced times-to-market. Environmental awareness and public concerns about CO 2 emissions {{have been for}} a long time a substantial factor in promoting technological advancements in the automotive industry. In this scenario, the actual high penetration of electronic devices in cars is and will be a key factor for the fulfillment of all the above requirements. In fact, in a recent study {{it has been estimated that}} 90 % of automotive innovation includes the electrical and electronics parts. On the other side, next generation of engines will increase in complexity, functionalities and self monitoring capabilities, with true shifts in technology, like e. g. intelligent alternators and variable valve actuation systems. In this respect, the contents of this thesis summarize my last four years of research activity which has been carried out in the field of engine control systems design and validation. Actually, the problem of the production of polluting substances during the combustion phases depends not only by the engine structure but also on the engine management system. Therefore, the control software plays an important role in the achievement of suitable engine and vehicle performance while maintaining low emission levels. To this end, the complexity of the software functions needs to be increased, both in terms of algorithmic complexity and for the need to handle the additional degrees of freedom available (i. e. model based torque management during take off, valve timing or valve actuation management, different values for battery voltage and so on). In turn, the larger control systems complexity imposes the use of more sophisticated tools and methods for the optimization of the engine control system parameters. Most of the work underlying this thesis has been carried out in the automotive company where I actually work for and reports the results of the many efforts accomplished in addressing such kind of problems. In particular, the research activities have been undertaken and experimented on a gasoline engine equipped with a Variable <b>Valve</b> Actuation (VVA) <b>module.</b> The potentialities of VVA systems represent the actual frontier of the engine technology and therefore such a kind of engine represents a relevant baseline for experimenting novel approaches. In particular, four main topics have been investigated: the first one regards the design of smart alternator management algorithms that allow the achievement of lower emission levels than standard alternators and improve the performance during certain manoeuvres. The second topic regards the development of a new method, named drive off algorithm, for handling the take off phases. This algorithm has been proved so effective in test benches that it has been implemented in all commercial vehicles since the beginning of this year. The third and fourth topics have regarded the way to manage the additional algorithmic complexity due to the availability of the further degrees offered by the new VVA technology. For this reason, a new spark advance algorithm has been developed, being the standard one not so good in adequately taking into account the specificities of the VVA technology. A second more complex aspect being addressed it has been the increased number of engine control parameters to be calibrated for this new kind of engines. The old tuning methodology based on a trial-and-error approach resulted not enough accurate for the novel control requirements and too much time-consuming. A novel tuning methodology has been developed which, on the contrary, is based on an optimization approach and allows one to achieve the desired accuracy in short times. For this reason, it has been adopted in my company since last year and it is actually used for steady state calibration of each motorization of MULTIAIR® engines. The thesis is organized in eight chapters The first and second ones describe the scenario in which my work has been developed, showing the restrictive emission levels required in the automobile world and some technological enhancements for fuel economy, emission legislation fulfillment and engine performance improvements. In the third chapter, the control algorithms developed to manage the smart alternator technology are described, showing the achieved benefits. The details of the control algorithms and the obtained results have been described in the paper (SAE 2011) [12]. The fourth chapter describes the control functions used to improve the engine performance during the take off maneuver in MULTIAIR® engines. This work has been published in the paper (EAEC 2011) [11]. In the fifth chapter a control function that optimizes the performance of a VVA engine has been detailed. This algorithm calculates the spark ignition timing (one of the necessary engine parameters) in order to obtain the optimal behavior in each engine working mode and in each variable valve mode. This work has been presented at the Fisita 2010 Conference (see [10]). The tools and the methodology developed for the optimization of the engine parameters have been described in another paper presented at the same conference (see [9]). In the sixth chapter, several tools for engine control systems design and calibration have been described. This chapter contains material published in the book’s chapter [16]) and in the conference papers [71], [78], [79], [80], [81]. The seventh chapter concludes the thesis, reporting some results and showing the benefits of the proposed methodologies on a real application[URL] di Ricerca in Ingegneria dei Sistemi e Informatica, XXIII Ciclo, a. a. 2011 Università della Calabri...|$|R
