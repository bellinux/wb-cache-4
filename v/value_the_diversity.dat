They go on to state {{the reasons for the}} ancient war. Llorn do not colonise other planets, because they <b>value</b> <b>the</b> <b>diversity</b> of intelligent life which evolution naturally produces on different worlds. The Vanryn, in their spacefaring days, valued only their own species, set up colonies on other worlds, and thereby prevented evolution from taking its natural course. To show what they mean about evolutionary diversity, the Llorn lift the veil of shadow that surrounds them, revealing their physical forms — they are two-legged, two-armed humanlike beings, but their bodies differ in several visible ways from those of Earth people — for instance, they don't have necks. They tell Fairlie that they have decided not {{to go to war with}} Earth, even though Earth people have begun to fly to other stars. They simply want to warn Earth people not to repeat the vainglorious and ultimately self-defeating behaviour of their Vanryn ancestors. The story ends with Fairlie and his companions about to return to Earth, uncertain how the message from the Llorn will be received.|$|E

While there are substantial advantages inherent with the increasing interconnectedness and mutual responsibility associated with globalization, it is vital that an inability of the modernisation approach to incorporate the diversity of societies is recognised. Significant risks are apparent for all small-scale farming systems, particularly in relation to changes in climatic and market conditions. Examples are drawn from the researcher's work in Nepal, Turkey and Switzerland to outline the scope of opportunities that emerging for small farmers. In particular, an alternative evolving Human Ecology paradigm focusing on the multifunctional values of agriculture, including the inherent value of difference between and within agricultural systems, provides a framework by which economic development is being redefined within local contexts of social and ecological sustainability.

This paper will discuss ethnographic data from a UK debt recovery organisation that explored {{the lives of the}} debt collectors. Making use of sociocultural theory, the organisation was constructed as a community of practice. In seeking to understand the mechanisms of learning, it emerged that relationships that were centred on learning and knowledge sharing were key to employees understanding the practices of the organisation. The tacit, nuanced nature of knowledge in this organisation relied on functioning learning relationships and an environment that encouraged the promotion of individual identity to enable successful participation. Employees assumed the roles of more learned other and apprentice, supporting Vygotskian (1978) notions of learning through relationship. The implications of this for organisations are that a blueprint for learning within organisation cannot be created and, instead, businesses should <b>value</b> <b>the</b> <b>diversity</b> of individual identity...|$|E

40|$|With the {{commencement}} of Phase III of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in 2013, it is projected that approximately one-half of emission allowances will be acquired through auctioning {{and the provision of}} free allocations to installations will be substantially tightened. As a result, it is likely that many companies will hold purchased (as opposed to freely allocated or gratis) allowances and will have more significant liabilities under the scheme. The accounting treatment of emission allowances has therefore become more relevant and the lack of uniformity in practice that resulted after the withdrawal of IFRIC 3 is now a more pressing concern. This study uses content analysis to examine disclosed accounting policies of companies with significant emission liabilities under the EU ETS and identifies three more common approaches adopted to date. These can be generally described as the following: (i) a net liability approach, based on the classification of allowances as intangibles but only showing an emission liability when it exceeds the free allocation; (ii) an approach broadly based on IFRIC 3 (recognising the free allocation at fair value and a corresponding gross liability under the EU ETS); and (iii) an approach based on inventory classification, with free allocations given at nil <b>value.</b> <b>The</b> <b>diversity</b> in these treatments highlights the need for guidance from the International Accounting Standards Board. 17 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Feminist {{scholarship}} {{has the potential}} of modifying the assumptions, values, and methodologies of any discipline because it examines that field from the viewpoint of both men and women. Faculty development programs across the country are aimed at incorporating this new scholarship into the curriculum. One such program, the University of Maryland's "Thinking about Women, " is used as the model for this paper. Curricular transformation projects share the goal of teaching about women and diversity with sensitivity in the classroom. Statistics show that women comprise 51 percent of the public relations field. This feminization of the field is cause for concern to both males and females, for history shows that shifting from a male to a female majority brings with it a depressed salary schedule and loss of prestige. Since men remain in positions of power in public relations, public relations educators should feel compelled to sensitize them to their responsibilities to the entire field [...] males, females, and minorities. This paper argues for curriculum review and revision of courses in public relations to reflect the new scholarship on women both in the field itself and in related disciplines. The effects of such a transformation should extend well beyond the classroom.

40|$|Methods: This {{case study}} {{describes}} how health may be promoted and disease prevented through development of personalized wellness programs. As critical thinking {{is essential to}} the provision of evidence based wellness care, diverse learning opportunities for developing and refining critical thinking skills have been created. Three of the learning opportunities are an intrinsic component of the subject and, taken together, contributed over 50 % of the final grade of the unit. They include a literature review, developing a client wellness contract and peer evaluation. In addition to these 3 compulsory exercises, students were also given an opportunity to develop their critical appraisal skills by undertaking voluntary self- and unit evaluation. Several opportunities for informal self-appraisal were offered in a structured self-study guide, while unit appraisal was undertaken by means of a questionnaire and group discussion at which the Head of School was present. Results: Formal assessment showed all students capable of preparing a wellness program consistent with current thinking in contemporary health care. The small group of students who appraised the unit seemed to <b>value</b> <b>the</b> <b>diversity</b> of learning experiences provided. Opportunities for voluntary unit and self-appraisal were used to varying degrees. Unit evaluation provided useful feedback that led to substantial changes in unit structure. Conclusion: Students have demonstrated themselves capable of applying critical thinking in construction of evidence based wellness programs. With respect to unit design, selective use of learning opportunities highlighted the desirability of using obligatory learning opportunities to ensure exposure to core constructs while student feedback was found to provide useful information for enriching unit review.
