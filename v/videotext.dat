50|$|Before {{merging with}} Symantec, Winer first met with Bill Gates, the co-founder and then-President, CEO, {{and chair of}} Microsoft, in February 1987.Gates wrote a letter of intent to {{purchase}} the company in return for shares of Microsoft.However, the deal fell through and Microsoft instead purchased Living <b>Videotext's</b> competitor, Forethought, Inc., makers of Powerpoint, in a $14-million deal. Powerpoint went on to achieve widespread popularity {{as part of the}} Microsoft Office suite.|$|R
30|$|In {{the field}} of listening, several studies have {{investigated}} the impact of strategy instruction on learners’ listening comprehension. Graham and Macaro (2008), for instance, measured the effects of strategy instruction on both the listening performance and self-efficacy of the participants against a comparison group. Cross (2009) investigated the impact of listening strategy instruction on the participants’ comprehension of BBC news <b>videotexts.</b> The type of participants together with the target languages of these two studies differ from ours. Students in Graham and Macaro’s (2008) were 16 – 17  years old who had been studying French in England for 5  years; while in Cross’ (2009) study, the participants were Japanese advanced-level learners of EFL (English as a foreign language) aged between 26 and 45. Both studies concluded that the respective strategy intervention programs had {{a positive impact on}} listening performance. In the study by Graham and Macaro (2008), students who underwent strategy instruction outperformed those who did not and demonstrated that they themselves recognized this improvement. In Cross’ (2009), both groups made significant gains, so a significant effect in favour of the experimental group with respect to the comparison group was not evident.|$|R

40|$|Artists {{apply the}} {{elements}} of everyday life from their environment into artworks. This transformation of facts in their artworks {{becomes part of the}} artist's everyday life. The idea of conceptual behaviour applied to everyday life is the cornerstone of my creative process. The idea of conceptual behaviour in my work is inspired by the movement of conceptual art. I believe a form of conduct appears during the process of creation and this is what I have investigated. I was born and grew up in Hong Kong until I was 16 and then moved to Australia. Due to this background, I find myself running between two languages: Chinese is my native language and English is the language for my everyday living. Wherever I travel in different regions, the situation persists. Writing is one of the important factors in my work. There are other forms of written languages and experimental writings in this series of work, for example; newspaper texts from general media, <b>videotexts</b> and form of video writing collaborate with digital media, and calligraphy from Chinese language. Calligraphy becomes a form of performance during the process of this piece of work. This process documented by video camcorder, a tool in digital media. Digital elements {{play a critical role in}} this creation. There are certain formats of digital elements involved. They include, video collage with different visual resources, documentary of the process, split screen projections in further phase of process and the whole series of works presented as embedded video. Another important element in my work is the idea of embedded video as a form of sculpture. Embedded video is introduced by merging digital media with sculptural forms. Video projections and video monitors merge with white pedestals, two white stages and white cans in a gallery environment...|$|R
40|$|Helping all {{students}} achieve literacy {{is viewed by}} many as a fundamental [...] perhaps, the most fundamental [...] goal {{of education in the}} United States. Achieving literacy, specifically for Deaf bilingual students, has been an ongoing main focus of deaf education. There is a trend toward the use of video technology as a learning tool for Deaf bilingual students' American Sign Language (ASL) language and literacy development (Humphries, 2013). The purpose of this mixed methods study was to investigate the ASL literacy practices in which Deaf bilingual high school students engage in three different types of ASL literacy skills during video viewing and discussion of ASL <b>videotexts</b> in their language arts classes. The study is based on the theoretical underpinning focusing on the nature of Deaf bilingual students' multiliteracies (New London Group, 2000) and the relationship between their ASL and English literacy skills (Cummins, 2006). The study included 18 Deaf bilingual high school students and their two language arts teachers. The Deaf bilingual students' ASL and English assessment scores were collected, and their video viewing and discussion activities were videorecorded over two periods of observation. The videorecordings were transcribed and coded to discover patterns of Deaf students engaging in functional, cultural and critical literacy skills. Correlation and regression analyses were employed to find the relationship between the students' ASL and English literacy skills as well as the relationship between their literacy skills and their average percentages of utterances for each type of ASL literacy. The first finding was Deaf students' ASL and English proficiencies appear to dictate the nature, complexities and patterns of their ASL literacy-related utterances. The second finding was contexts appear to influence the nature and patterns of Deaf students' ASL literacy-related utterances. The third finding was that there is a statistically significant relationship between the Deaf students' ASL and English test scores, and also between these test scores and their proportional percentages of different types of ASL literacy-related utterances observed in their classes. These findings suggest that the ASL video viewing and discussion activities create opportunities for the Deaf bilingual students to develop and use their ASL literacy skill...|$|R

50|$|One more {{technique}} that is frequently used by inventors involves {{the analysis of}} substances, fields and other resources that are currently not being used {{and that can be}} found within the system or nearby. TRIZ uses non-standard definitions for substances and fields. Altshuller developed methods to analyze resources; several of his invention principles involve the use of different substances and fields that help resolve contradictions and increase ideality of a technical system. For instance, <b>videotext</b> systems used television signals to transfer data, by taking advantage of the small time segments between TV frames in the signals.|$|E
5000|$|In {{teletext}} mode, {{character codes}} {{were sent to}} users' televisions by encoding them as dot patterns in the vertical blanking interval of the video signal. Various technical [...] "tweaks" [...] and details of the NTSC signals used by North American televisions allowed the downstream videotex channel to increase to 600 bit/s, about twice that used in the European systems. In <b>videotext</b> mode, Bell 202 modems were typical, offering a 1,200 bit/s download rate. A set top box attached to the TV decoded these signals back into text and graphic pages, which the user could select among.|$|E
50|$|At {{one time}} Symantec was {{also known for}} its {{development}} tools, particularly the THINK Pascal, THINK C, Symantec C++, Enterprise Developer and Visual Cafe packages that were popular on the Macintosh and IBM PC compatible platforms. These product lines resulted from acquisitions made by the company in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These businesses and the Living <b>Videotext</b> acquisition were consistently unprofitable for Symantec, and these losses diverted expenditures away from both the Q&A for Windows and the TimeLine for Windows development efforts during the critical period from 1988 through 1992. Symantec exited this business in the late-1990s as competitors such as Metrowerks, Microsoft and Borland gained significant market share.|$|E
