An original methodology is developed to identify the spatial statistical parameters (mean, variance, correlation range) of the hydraulic conductivity in a three-dimensional (3 -D) setting by using geological and geophysical data. More specifically, a large number of inexpensive <b>vertical</b> <b>electric</b> <b>soundings</b> are integrated with a facies model developed from borehole lithologic data to simulate the log 10 (K) continuous distributions in multiple-zone heterogeneous alluvial megafans. The Chaobai River alluvial fan in the Beijing Plain, China, is used as an example to test the proposed approach. Due to the non-stationary property of the K  distribution in the alluvial fan, a multiple-zone parameterization approach is applied to analyze the conductivity statistical properties of different hydrofacies in the various zones. The composite variance in each zone is computed to describe the evolution of the conductivity along the flow direction. Consistently with the scales of the sedimentary transport energy, the results show that conductivity variances of fine sand, medium-coarse sand, and gravel decrease from the upper (zone  1) to the lower (zone  3) portion along the flow direction. In zone  1, sediments were moved by higher-energy flooding, which induces poor sorting and larger conductivity variances.

We present a methodology to retrieve the searched parameters and a lithological interpretation by the joint analysis of magnetic resonance <b>soundings</b> (MRS) and <b>vertical</b> <b>electric</b> <b>soundings</b> (VES). Both data sets are jointly inverted for resistivity, water content and decay time using a joint inversion scheme. Coupling is accomplished by common layer thicknesses. We show the results of three soundings measured on {{the eastern part of}} the North Sea island of Borkum. Pumping test data is used to calibrate the petrophysical relationship for the local conditions in order to estimate permeability from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data. Salinity is retrieved from water content and resistivity using a modified Archie equation calibrated by local samples. As a result we are able to predict porosity, salinity and hydraulic conductivities of the aquifers, including their uncertainties. The joint inversion significantly improves the reliability of the results. Verification is given by comparison with a borehole. A sounding in the flooding area demonstrates that only the combined inversion provides a correct subsurface model. Thanks to the joint application, we are able to distinguish fluid conductivity from lithology and provide reliable hydraulic parameters as shown by uncertainty analysis.

Inside of {{the administration}} of contaminated areas, the application of geophysical methods, in studies of contaminated area, constitutes a confirmatory methodology. This procedure - more precisely the electrical resistivity method through the techniques of the <b>vertical</b> <b>electric</b> <b>sounding</b> and electrical imaging techniques, was applied at Vila Rezendeâ€TMs cemetery, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil, to investigate and to map the contamination of the cemetery for necrochorume. The results indicate a depth of water table among 3. 1 and 5. 1 m, with two flow directions, being one to SW and another to SE. So the probable contamination plumes, that have the same directions of underground flow, as for the conductive anomalies verified at the geoelectrics sections confirm the suspicions of contamination in the area...|$|E

It presents tests achieved with the DualEM- 421 S instrument (Dualem Inc., Milton, Canada) {{in order to be}} able to quantitatively compare these measurements to the standard technique of direct-current (d. c.) resistivity. The test was done over the Gallo-roman site of Vieil-Evreux in Normandy, France and one-dimensional (1 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) inversions were applied to the data set obtained. We have first investigated the signal-to-noise ratio of each of the six DualEM receiver coils both in a static mode and for a quad-pulled system. The dependence on the roll angle was also measured and it is shown that rotation of DualEM must be taken into account if the roll angle is more than ± 10 °. Absolute calibration and in-phase/quadrature (out of phase) component discrimination was checked by measuring the response of a small conductive and non-magnetic sphere. Several electromagnetic soundings by measuring the instrument response at different heights were done in order to check the quadrature (out-of-phase) response of the instrument. Inversions of these electromagnetic soundings were compared to d. c. <b>vertical</b> <b>electric</b> <b>soundings</b> (VESs) over four locations and found in accordance. Several maps using different coil configurations (HCP, VCP, PERP) and different heights were performed and inverted, both for a wide mesh (5 m) and for a finer one (0. 5 m). The wide mesh allows a global and rapid description of the surface geology context (continuous d. c. measurements cannot deliver equivalent depth of investigation). The fine mesh conductivity maps clearly show the walls of a fanum (temple) as well as other structures and prove that the DualEM- 421 S is able to map correctly archaeological resistive targets. These maps and their interpretations were compared to previous results obtained by d. c. technique...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} do {{hydraulic}} modelling for simulating the salt-/fresh water dynamics, the parameters porosity, salinity and hydraulic conductivity are needed. We present a methodology retrieve them by the joint analysis of magnetic resonance (MRS) and and <b>vertical</b> <b>electric</b> (VES) <b>soundings.</b> Both data sets are jointly inverted for resistivity, water content and decay time using a block discretization. We show the results of three soundings measured in the east part of the CLIWAT pilot area Borkum. Pumping test data is used to calibrate the petrophysical relationship for the local conditions. As a result {{we are able to}} predict porosity, salinity and hydraulic conductivities of the aquifers including their uncertainty. The joint inversion significantly improves the reliability of the results, which can be shown by comparison with a borehole. By a sounding in the flooding area we demonstrate that only the combined inversion leads to a correct subsurface model. Thanks to the joint application we are able to distinguish fluid conductivity from lithology and provide reliable hydraulic parameters...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} Bayesian fusion {{approach}} to integrate multiple geophysical datasets with different coverage and sensitivity. The fusion strategy {{is based on}} the capability of various geophysical methods to provide enough resolution to identify either subsurface material parameters or subsurface structure, or both. We focus on electrical resistivity as the target material parameter and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), electromagnetic induction (EMI), and ground penetrating radar (GPR) as the set of geophysical methods. However, extending the approach to different sets of geophysical parameters and methods is straightforward. Different geophysical datasets are entered into a trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) search-based joint inversion algorithm. The trans-dimensional property of the McMC algorithm allows dynamic parameterisation of the model space, which in turn helps to avoid bias of the post-inversion results towards a particular model. Given that we are attempting to develop an approach that has practical potential, we discretize the subsurface into an array of one-dimensional earth-models. Accordingly, the ERT data that are collected by using two-dimensional acquisition geometry are re-casted to a set of equivalent <b>vertical</b> <b>electric</b> <b>soundings.</b> Different data are inverted either individually or jointly to estimate one-dimensional subsurface models at discrete locations. We use Shannon's information measure to quantify the information obtained from the inversion of different combinations of geophysical datasets. Information from multiple methods is brought together via introducing joint likelihood function and/or constraining the prior information. A Bayesian maximum entropy approach is used for spatial fusion of spatially dispersed estimated one-dimensional models and mapping of the target parameter. We illustrate the approach with a synthetic dataset and then apply it to a field dataset We show that the proposed fusion strategy is successful not only in enhancing the subsurface information but also as a survey design tool to identify the appropriate combination of the geophysical tools and show whether application of an individual method for further investigation of a specific site is beneficial.
