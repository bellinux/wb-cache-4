5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after <b>veraison.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{ripening}} is {{broadly defined}} as the development of wine grapes, then {{it could be said}} that ripening is happening throughout the continuous annual cycle of the grapevine. More narrowly defined, ripening begins at the inception of <b>veraison.</b> At this point (which is normally 40–60 days after fruit set though it may be longer in cooler climates), the grapes are hard and green with low sugar levels and very high levels of mostly malic acids. During <b>veraison,</b> which may last from 30–70 days depending on the climate and other factors, the grapes go through several changes which impact their sugar, acid, tannin and mineral composition. The concentration of phenolic compounds in the skin, most notably anthocyanins for red wine grapes, replace the green color of chlorophyll as the grape berries themselves change color.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid, {{also known}} as vitamin C, is found in young wine grapes prior to <b>veraison,</b> but is rapidly lost {{throughout}} the ripening process. In winemaking, it is used with sulfur dioxide as an antioxidant, often added during the bottling process for white wines. In the European Union, use of ascorbic acid as an additive is limited to 150mg/l.|$|E
25|$|Following fruit set, {{the grape}} berries are green {{and hard to}} the touch. They have very little sugar and are high in organic acids. They begin to grow to about half their final size when they enter the stage of <b>veraison.</b> This stage signals the {{beginning}} of the ripening process and normally takes place around 40–50 days after fruit set. In the Northern Hemisphere this will be around the end of July and into August and between the end of January into February for the Southern Hemisphere. During this stage the colors of the grape take form-red/black or yellow/green depending on the grape varieties. This color changing is due to the chlorophyll in the berry skin being replaced by anthocyanins (red wine grapes) and carotenoids (white wine grapes). In a process known as engustment, the berries start to soften as they build up sugars. Within six days of the start of <b>veraison,</b> the berries begin to grow dramatically as they accumulate glucose and fructose and acids begin to fall.|$|E
25|$|While {{the climate}} of Pomerol is broadly similar {{to the rest of}} Bordeaux in the {{maritime}} influence, the region's distance from the sea and the Gironde estuary make the climate distinctly more continental than that of the Médoc. This means that Pomerol sees more diurnal temperature variation during the growing season, between daytime highs and evening lows. Also while the region experiences more rainfall during the spring (which can cause problems for Merlot during flowering) there is overall significantly less rainfall during the summer months after <b>veraison.</b>|$|E
25|$|Acidity {{is highest}} in wine grapes {{just before the}} start of <b>veraison,</b> which ushers in the {{ripening}} period of the annual cycle of grape vines. As the grapes ripen, their sugar levels increase and their acidity levels decrease. Through the process of respiration, malic acid is metabolized by the grape vine. Grapes from cooler climate wine regions generally have higher levels of acidity due to the slower ripening process. The level of acidity still present in the grape is an important consideration for winemakers in deciding when to begin harvest. For wines such as Champagne and other sparkling wines, having high levels of acidity is even more vital to the winemaking process, so grapes are often picked under-ripe and at higher acid levels.|$|E
25|$|After <b>veraison</b> has begun, viticulturists {{will test}} several hundred {{individual}} berries picked from clusters throughout the vineyard in increasing intervals as the harvest draws closers. The berries will usually {{be taken from}} the middle of the cluster bunch, avoiding vines on the end of rows that tend to be exposed to the most unusual elements. The must weight is then plotted on a chart to see the increasing ripeness and sugar levels of the grape. What must weight reading is most desirable will depend on the winemaker's personal goal for ripeness. A wine with the intended potential alcohol level of 12% will need to be harvested at around 21.7°Bx/12 degree Baumé/93°Oe. A wine with the intended potential alcohol level of 15% will need to be harvested at around 27.1°Bx/15 degree Baumé/119°Oe. The desired ripeness for most table wines tend to fall somewhere between those two must weight measurements.|$|E
25|$|The {{annual growth}} cycle of grapevines {{is the process}} {{that takes place in}} the {{vineyard}} each year, beginning with bud break in the spring and culminating in leaf fall in autumn followed by winter dormancy. From a winemaking perspective, each step in the process plays a vital {{role in the development of}} grapes with ideal characteristics for making wine. Viticulturalists and vineyard managers monitor the effect of climate, vine disease and pests in facilitating or impeding the vines progression from bud break, flowering, fruit set, <b>veraison,</b> harvesting, leaf fall and dormancy-reacting if need be with the use of viticultural practices like canopy management, irrigation, vine training and the use of agrochemicals. The stages of the annual growth cycle usually become observable within the first year of a vine's life. The amount of time spent at each stage of the growth cycle depends on a number of factors-most notably the type of climate (warm or cool) and the characteristics of the grape variety.|$|E
25|$|Anthocyanins are {{phenolic}} compounds {{found throughout the}} plant kingdom, being frequently responsible for the blue to red colors found in flowers, fruits and leaves. In wine grapes, they develop during the stage of <b>veraison</b> when the skin of red wine grapes changes color from green to red to black. As the sugars in the grape increase during ripening so does the concentration of anthocyanins. In most grapes anthocyanins are found only in the outer cell layers of the skin, leaving the grape juice inside virtually colorless. Therefore, to get color pigmentation in the wine, the fermenting must {{needs to be in}} contact with the grape skins in order for the anthocyanins to be extracted. Hence, white wine can be made from red wine grapes {{in the same way that}} many white sparkling wines are made from the red wine grapes of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. The exception to this is the small class of grapes known as teinturiers, such as Alicante Bouschet, which have a small amount of anthocyanins in the pulp that produces pigmented juice.|$|E
25|$|Malic acid, {{along with}} tartaric acid, {{is one of}} the {{principal}} organic acids found in wine grapes. It is found in nearly every fruit and berry plant, but is most often associated with green (unripe) apples, the flavor it most readily projects in wine. Its name comes from the Latin malum meaning “apple”. In the grape vine, malic acid is involved in several processes which are essential for the health and sustainability of the vine. Its chemical structure allows it to participate in enzymatic reactions that transport energy throughout the vine. Its concentration varies depending on the grape variety, with some varieties, such as Barbera, Carignan and Sylvaner, being naturally disposed to high levels. The levels of malic acid in grape berries are at their peak just before <b>veraison,</b> when they can be found in concentrations as high as 20g/l. As the vine progresses through the ripening stage, malic acid is metabolized in the process of respiration, and by harvest, its concentration could be as low as 1 to 9 g/l. The respiratory loss of malic acid is more pronounced in warmer climates. When all the malic acid is used up in the grape, it is considered “over-ripe” or senescent. Winemakers must compensate for this loss by adding extraneous acid at the winery in a process known as acidification.|$|E
500|$|There are {{a couple}} of noted Cabernet Sauvignon flavors that are intimately tied to viticultural and climate influences. The most widely {{recognized}} is the herbaceous or green bell pepper flavor caused by pyrazines, which are more prevalent in underripened grapes. Pyrazine compounds are [...] present in all Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and are gradually destroyed by sunlight as the grape continues to ripen. To the human palate this compound is detectable in wines with pyrazine levels as low as [...] 2 nanograms (ng) per liter. At the time of <b>veraison,</b> when the grapes first start to fully ripen, there is the equivalent pyrazine level of 30ng/l. In cooler climates, it is difficult to get Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to ripen fully to the point where pyrazine is not detected. The green bell pepper flavor is not considered a wine fault {{but it may not be}} desirable to all consumers' tastes. The California wine region of Monterey was noted in the late 20th century for its very vegetal Cabernet Sauvignon with pronounced green pepper flavor, earning the nickname of [...] "Monterey veggies". In addition to its cool climate, Monterey is also prone to being very windy, which can have the effect of shutting down the grape vines and further inhibiting ripeness.|$|E
2500|$|The {{onset of}} <b>veraison</b> {{does not occur}} uniformly among all berries. Typically the berries and {{clusters}} that are most exposed to warmth, on the outer extents of the canopy, undergo <b>veraison</b> first with the berries and clusters closer to the trunk and under the canopy shade undergoing it last. There are some factors in the vineyards that can control the onset of <b>veraison,</b> limited water stress and canopy management that creates a high [...] "fruit to leaf" [...] ratio can be encourage <b>veraison.</b> This is because the vine is biologically programmed to channel all its energies and resources into the berries, which houses its seedling offspring, {{so that they may}} {{have a better chance of}} survival. Conversely, very vigorous vines with lots of leaf shading for photosynthesis and water supply will delay the start of <b>veraison</b> due to the vines energies being directed towards continued shoot growth of new buds. For the production of high quality wine, it is considered ideal to have an earlier <b>veraison.</b> During this period the cane of the vine starts to ripen as well changing from green and springing to brown and hard. The vines begins to divert some of its energy production into its reserves in preparation for its next growth cycle.|$|E
2500|$|What {{constitutes}} [...] "ripeness" [...] {{will vary}} according to what style of wine is being produced {{as well as the}} particular views of winemakers and viticulturists on what optimal ripeness is. The style of wine is usually dictated by the balance between sugars and acids. What may be considered [...] "ripe" [...] for one winemaker could be considered under ripe to another winemaker or even overripe to yet a third winemaker. Climate and the particular grape variety will also play a role in determining ripeness and date of harvest. In very hot climates, such as certain areas in California and Australia, ripeness is usually achieved around 30 days after <b>veraison</b> starts while in much cooler climates, like the Loire Valley and parts of Germany, this may not occur until 70 days after <b>veraison.</b> The ripening periods for each individual grape variety will vary with grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon taking much longer to ripen compared to early ripening varieties such as Chardonnay and Pinot noir.|$|E
2500|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} deacidifies {{the wine}} by converting the [...] "harsher" [...] diprotic malic acid to the softer monoprotic lactic acid. The {{different structures of}} malic and lactic acids leads to a reduction of titratable acidity (TA) in the wine by 1 to 3 g/l {{and an increase in}} pH by 0.3 units. Malic acid is present in the grape throughout the growing season, reaching its peak at <b>veraison</b> and gradually decreasing throughout the ripening process. Grapes harvested from cooler climates usually have the highest malic content and have the most dramatic changes in TA and pH levels after malolactic fermentation.|$|E
2500|$|The Greco bianco vine {{tends to}} mature very {{late in the}} grapevine's growing season and is prone to the viticultural hazards of downy and powdery mildew. Ampelographers {{distinguish}} the vine based on its characteristic [...] "winged" [...] clusters. After <b>veraison</b> the grapes turn a golden-grey color. The phenolic compounds in the grape contribute to the wine's characteristically deep color. Greco bianco wines are noted for their aromatic qualities with some wine experts, such as Jancis Robinson, describing the wines as being vaguely similar to Viognier. Some aromas commonly associated with the grape include peaches and fresh green foliage. With age, Greco wines can develop more herbal notes.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} factors that {{contribute}} to the ripeness of the grape. As the grapes go through <b>veraison,</b> sugars in the grapes will continue to rise as acid levels fall. The balance between sugar (as well as the potential alcohol level) and acids {{is considered one of the}} most critical aspects of producing quality wine so both the must weight and [...] "total acidity", as well as the pH of the grapes, are evaluated to determine ripeness. Towards the end of the 20th century, winemakers and viticulturists began focusing on the concept of achieving [...] "physiological" [...] ripeness in the grapes-described as a more complete ripeness of tannins and other phenolic compounds in the grapes that contribute to the color, flavor and aroma of wine.|$|E
2500|$|Muscat blanc à Petits Grains {{is known}} by many names worldwide, {{including}} Muscat Blanc (white Muscat) in France and the United States), Muscat Canelli in the United States, Moscato Bianco (white Moscato) in Italy, Muscat Frontignan in South Africa, Moschato in Greece, Brown Muscat in Australia, Muskateller in Germany and Austria, Muscat de Grano Menudo in Spain, and Muscat de Frontignan and Muscat Lunel in France. While the [...] "petits grains" [...] in the grape's name accurately describes the small, round berries of the vine, some wine experts, such as Oz Clarke, {{believe that the}} term [...] "Muscat blanc" [...] is misleading, since the grapevine is notorious for its frequent color mutations siring clusters of berries in nearly every shade possible though most commonly the grape berries are a deep yellow after <b>veraison.</b> In some vineyards, vines of Muscat blanc à Petits Grains are known to produce clusters of berries of different colors that change every vintage.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{the annual}} growth cycle of other Piedmontese grape {{varieties}}, Nebbiolo {{is one of the}} first varieties to bud and last variety to ripen with harvest taking place in mid to late October. In some vintages, producers are able to pick and complete fermentation of their Barbera and Dolcetto plantings before Nebbiolo is even harvested. To aid in ripening, producers will often plant Nebbiolo in the most favored sites on south and southwestern facing slopes, which give the grape more access to direct sunlight. The most ideal location is at an elevation between [...] and must provide some natural shelter from wind. The vine is very susceptible to coulure, especially if there is wet weather during budbreak or flowering. While rains during this period can affect yield and quantity, rains that occur after the period of <b>veraison</b> can have a detrimental effect on quality. The most highly rated bottles of Piedmont Nebbiolo tend to come from vintages that had dry weather during September & October. Nebbiolo needs sufficient warmth to develop the sugars and fruit flavors needed to balance the grape's naturally high acidity and tannins. In cooler climate areas, such as the subalpine regions of Carema, Valtellina and Donnaz, the grape will produce medium bodied wines with bracing acidity and tannins that need the benefit of a warm vintage.|$|E
2500|$|Water is very crucial {{during the}} early budding and {{flowering}} stages of the growing season. In areas where there is not sufficient rainfall, irrigation may be needed during {{this time in the}} spring. After fruit set, the water needs for the vine drop and irrigation is often withheld till the period of <b>veraison</b> when the grapes begin to change color. This period of [...] "water stress" [...] encourages the vine to concentrate its limited resources into lower yields of smaller berries creating a favorable skin to juice ratio that is often desirable in quality wine production. The benefits or disadvantages of irrigation during the ripening period itself is a matter of debate and continuing research in the wine growing community. The only area of mostly agreement is the disadvantages of water close to harvest after a prolonged dry period. Grapevines that have been subjected to prolonged water stress have a tendency to rapidly absorb large amounts of water if its provided. This will dramatically swell the berries, potentially causing to them crack or burst which will make the prone to various grape diseases. Even if the berries do not crack or burst, the rapid swelling of water will cause a reduce concentration in sugars and phenolic compounds in the grape producing wines with diluted flavors and aromas.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the use of}} {{irrigation}} is disparaged or even prohibited in many premium wine producing regions, its use in Washington is absolutely vital and is a major asset in quality wine production. The average vineyard in Eastern Washington receives approximately [...] in annual rainfall, most of it during the winter months. Without irrigation, agriculture in the region would not be possible. Compared to other wine regions that do not need or practice irrigation, a vineyard manager in Washington State has {{more control over the}} potential quality of the grapes. Utilizing drip irrigation and controlling the amount of water the vines receive and wine allows the grower to limit the amount of vigor (and thus yields) of vine and leverage water stress to produce more concentrated flavors and phenolic compounds in the grape. Growers will often withhold water early in the growing season to control the leaf canopy, which can have a beneficial business aspect by saving money compared to using costly viticultural chores such as sucker pruning, leaf striping and mildew treatment to control and tend to the leaf canopy. Applying a controlled amount of water during the ripening period following <b>veraison</b> encourages the grapes to ripen faster without a reductive loss in quality. One additional benefit {{of irrigation}} is frost protection. Following harvest, growers will soak the soil of the vineyard to moisten the soil down to two feet. As temperatures drop, this water can form a protective layer of ice that will give the vine a few extra degrees of protection from freezing temperature that may damage the roots.|$|E
5000|$|In {{viticulture}} (grape-growing), <b>veraison</b> is {{the onset}} of ripening. The term is originally French (<b>véraison</b> / veʀɛzɔ̃), but has been adopted into English use.
