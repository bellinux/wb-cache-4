5|$|Although the {{military}} {{victory of the}} absolutist city authorities was complete, the war had also shown them that they depended <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> their rural subjects. Soon after the war, the ruling aristocrats instituted a series of reforms and even lowered some taxes, thus fulfilling some of the peasants' original fiscal demands. In the long term, the peasant war of 1653 prevented Switzerland from an excessive implementation of absolutism as occurred in France {{during the reign of}} Louis XIV.|$|E

5|$|The {{implications}} of discovery depend <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> {{the level of}} aggressiveness of the civilization interacting with humanity, its ethics, and how much human and extraterrestrial biologies have in common.

The question of whether contact is physical or through electromagnetic signals will also govern {{the magnitude of the}} long-term {{implications of}} contact. In the case of communication using electromagnetic signals, the long silence between the reception of one message and another would mean that the content of any message would particularly affect the consequences of contact, as would the extent of mutual comprehension.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> the price of feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E

25|$|Be sure to {{frequently}} {{clean the}} feed and water dishes. The {{amount of feed}} a snail eats depends <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> air humidity and {{on the availability of}} drinking water.

Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} factors {{together}} have made it exceedingly difficult to distinguish between what constitutes a language or a dialect in Mesoamerica. Linguistic isoglosses do not coincide often or strongly enough to prove very useful when trying to decide, and sociological factors often further cloud the picture. The significance of measurements of intelligibility (which is itself difficult to measure) depends <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> analysts' purposes and theoretical commitments. In Spanish the word “dialecto” has often been used generically about indigenous languages in order to describe them as inherently inferior to the European languages. In recent years this has caused an aversion to the term “dialect” among Spanish-speaking linguists and others, and the term “variante” has often been applied instead.|$|E
25|$|HPV {{vaccines}} {{protect against}} {{between two and}} seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners {{and the use of}} condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> how early the cancer is detected.|$|E
