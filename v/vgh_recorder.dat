40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{has been}} made of the random deviations from the cruise altitudes (called flight technical error) of a large turbojet transport on scheduled, passenger-carrying operations over the Eastern United States, the Atlantic Ocean, and Western Europe. Data were collected from l 9 O flights through an altitude range of 20, 000 to 41, 000 feet and for a time period from January to August 1959. The results of the investigation, based on an evaluation of the altitude recordings of an NASA <b>VGH</b> <b>recorder,</b> showed that for a high percentage of the total cruise time (99. 0 percent) the airplane operated within 100 feet of its stabilized cruise altitude. On occasion, however, the excursions of the airplane from the cruise altitude reached large values (in excess of 1, 000 feet in the worst case) ...|$|E

40|$|Recent results {{obtained}} from NASA V-G and <b>VGH</b> <b>recorders</b> installed on commercial turbine-powered transports {{have indicated that}} exceedances of placard speeds {{appear to have been}} significantly reduced since the placard speeds have been redefined and changes made in the aural warning. Oscillatory accelerations and unusual events, such as large or rapid departures from the planned flight profile, occur less frequently. Landing-impact accelerations are higher for turbine transports than for piston transports and vary with operator. The total in-flight acceleration experiences for turbine transports, however, are not significantly different from those for four-engine piston transports...|$|R

During 79 flights, turbulence was encountered, and recorded on a <b>VGH</b> <b>recorder,</b> 6. 2 {{percent of the total}} flight distance at supersonic speeds above an altitude of 12, 192 meters (40, 000 feet). Geographical locations are given for selected turbulence encounters. For 22 flights the airplane was instrumented to measure true gust velocities and the structural acceleration response to turbulence. The turbulence intensities measured were very low in comparison with those measured at high altitudes in other investigations. Acceleration response spectra, frequency response transfer functions, and coherence functions were computed from three turbulence encounters at Mach numbers of 0. 88, 1. 59, and 2. 35. Results are compared with calculated studies.

40|$|Acceleration, airspeed, and {{altitude}} {{data obtained}} with an NACA <b>VGH</b> <b>recorder</b> from a four-engine commercial transport airplane operating over a northwestern United States-Alaska route were evaluated {{to determine the}} magnitude and frequency of occurrence of gust and maneuver accelerations., operating airspeeds, and gust velocities. The results obtained were then compared with the results previously reported in NACA Technical Note 3475 for two similar airplanes operating over transcontinental routes in the United States. No large variations in the gust experience for the three operations were noted. The {{results indicate that the}} gust-load experience of the present operation closely approximated that of the central transcontinental route in the United States with which it is compared and showed differences of about 4 to 1 when compared with that of the southern transcontinental route in the United States. In general, accelerations due to gusts occurred much more frequently than those due to operational maneuvers. At a measured normal-acceleration increment of 0. 5 g, accelerations due to gusts occurred roughly 35 times more frequently than those due to operational maneuvers...|$|E

40|$|Measurements of clear-air {{turbulence}} {{by use of}} airplane-borne instrumentation {{have been}} obtained from NASA <b>VGH</b> <b>recorders</b> during research flights of Lockheed U- 2 airplanes to altitudes of 75, 000 feet over several areas of the Northern Hemisphere. An analysis of these data has indicated that for the higher altitudes (50, 000 to 75, 000 feet), turbulence is both less frequent and less severe than for the lower altitudes (20, 000 to 50, 000 feet). Turbulence appears to be present at the high altitudes (60, 000 to 75, 000 feet) less than 1 percent of the time. Moderately heavy turbulence appears to exist on occasion at altitudes of about 50, 000 feet over Japan. As a consequence, the gust experience {{appears to be more}} severe for operations over Japan than for the other areas. Less than 50 percent of the turbulent areas exceeded 10 miles in length...|$|R

Turbulence appears to be encountered at the high altitudes for only about 2 percent of the flight distance as compared with 5 percent or more at the lower altitudes.

40|$|Accelerations in {{the lateral}} and {{vertical}} directions were measured at two locations {{on the floor}} of a three-jet-engine aircraft and at two locations {{on the floor of}} a two-jet-engine aircraft during a total of 13 flights, each of which included taxiing, takeoff, ascent, cruise, descent, and landing. Accelerations over the frequency range 0 to 25 Hz were recorded continuously on magnetic tape and were synchronized with the <b>VGH</b> <b>recorders</b> in the aircraft so that vibratory accelerations could be correlated with the operating conditions of the aircraft. From the results it was indicated that the methodology used in segmenting the data, which were obtained in a continuous and repetitive manner, contributes to establishing baseline data representative of the flight characteristics of aircraft. Significant differences among flight conductions were found to occur. The lateral accelerations were approximately 15 percent of the vertical accelerations during flight but as much as 50 to 100 percent of the vertical accelerations during ground operations. The variation between the responses of the two aircraft was not statistically significant. The results also showed that more than 90 percent of the vibratory energy measured during flight occurred in the 0 - to 3. 0 -Hz frequency range. Generally, the vibration amplitudes were normally distributed...|$|R

40|$|Data {{obtained}} by NASA <b>VGH</b> and V-G <b>recorders</b> on several Lockheed Electra airplanes operated over three domestic routes have been analyzed {{to determine the}} in-flight accelerations, airspeed practices, and landing accelerations experienced by this particular airplane. The {{results indicate that the}} accelerations caused by gusts and maneuvers are comparable to corresponding results for piston-engine transport airplanes. Oscillatory accelerations (apparently caused by the autopilot or control system) appear to occur about one-tenth as frequently as accelerations due to gusts. Airspeed operating practices in rough air generally follow the trends shown by piston-engine transports in that there is {{no significant difference between the}} average airspeed in rough or smooth air. Placard speeds were exceeded more frequently by the Electra airplane than by piston-engine transport airplanes. Generally, the landing-impact accelerations were higher than those for piston-engine transports...|$|R
