This research is a descriptive qualitative study and uses pragmatic approach. The data of this study come from conversations containing compliments, verbal and non <b>verbal</b> <b>acts</b> of responses. The <b>verbal</b> <b>acts</b> are taken from the conversations which are expressed by the main characters of The Ugly Truth Movie. While the non <b>verbal</b> <b>acts</b> are the body language, facial expression, and smile expressed by the main characters in that movie. Based on Wolfson’ theory of compliment, the researcher draws conclusions as follows: there are four types of compliment applied by the characters of The Ugly Truth Movie. They are compliment of personal appearance, possession, compliment of general ability and compliment of specific-act ability. In responses, based on Herbert’s classification, most of the addressees accept the compliment including verbal and non-verbal acceptance called appreciation token type. In verbal acceptance, the addressees deliver the word ‘thank you” or “ thanks” to respond the compliment of the addressers. Moreover, the addressees respond to the compliment by smiling and nodding head to show acceptance in the form of non-verbal language. In the comment acceptance type, the addressee accepts the compliment and adds a relevant comment on the compliment. Meanwhile, in return type, the addressee returned the compliment to the addresser. The researcher also found the other type of responses namely question. In this type the addressee gives responds of compliment by question to the addresseer. Finally, {{there are two ways to}} show no acknowledment responses they are verbal and non-verbal.

The target phrases had linguistically positive or negative meanings and were uttered warmheartedly or coldheartedly by a woman speaker. The results of the fMRI analyses suggest that neural resources responsible for the speakers' mind reading are distributed over the superior temporal sulci (STS), inferior frontal regions, medial frontal regions and posterior cerebellum. When compared to the female subjects, the male subjects showed significantly stronger activation only in the right frontomedian cortex, which can be hypothesized to infer the speaker's hidden but true intentions from the speaking acts. The correct judgment of the speaker's intentions significantly increased with age for the phrases with inconsistent linguistic and emotional valences.

Therefore, affect in this study is formulated particularly in interaction where contact between the students’ native language and the teacher’s native language occurs. The results of this study show that affect is produced along with different teachers’ orientations towards teaching and the student’s reaction to it. Particularly, affect operates negatively, when the context of addressing is perceived negatively.

Browning’s bicentenary seems a most auspicious moment to creatively explore the tenacity of his discordant narrative vein in literary translation. Browning’s fixation on engendering a poetic form that would fully sustain the self-projecting techniques of his protagonists resulted in the employment of narrative verse whose dialogic nature is undermined and embedded in his creations’ monologues.

So far, multimedia has largely been used as a supplementary resource, for follow-up activities or as a form of reward in the classroom, but it can also provide a significant basis for literary instruction. For some teachers, multimedia may appear to be a reductive, even a trivializing, tool, compared to the conventional linear, <b>verbal</b> <b>act</b> of reading literature, a view that students do not seem to share.

40|$|This essay closely studies several works {{written by}} American male writers [...] either while {{the author was}} in an American prison, or shortly after he was released. The first works studied, from the nineteenth century, {{introduce}} the themes and questions for the later discussion of the other works, {{all of which are}} taken from the twentieth century. A central focus of the essay is on the process by which all of the authors studied attempt a textual reversal of the positions of reader and author. In each of the works, the reader, generally seen as a member of 'outside' society, is portrayed {{as a representative of the}} imprisoning society. Thus, the textual confrontation is between a prisoner/author and a warden/reader; and the subsequent reversal that takes place through the medium of the text places the reader in the position of being a prisoner, with the author becoming the prison-authority, or warden. This reversal is used by the authors examined as means or attempt at freeing themselves from both the defining and imprisoning texts of society, as well as from the actual prison where the author finds himself. The writing of the prison-text, therefore, is a <b>verbal</b> <b>act</b> intimately associated with the gaining of various forms of at least visionary freedom...|$|E
40|$|Language Learning Input must be both contextualized {{and natural}} {{if it is}} to be coterminous with actual communication, in which interlocutors {{participate}} in a cooperative and dialogic process. However, when input becomes decontextualized, discourse shifts to a superficial plane. As is commonly the case in theater, <b>verbal</b> <b>act</b> meaning in the classroom setting is formulated in a scripted text and addressed in terms of speaker intention. Unlike the theater, in a second language (L 2) classroom, scenario texts are usually analyzed from a narrower linguistic perspective and their signifiers are linked to communicative problem solving strategies. L 2 learners, therefore, rarely have the opportunity to use the L 2 with all the implicatory force that accompanies actual performance. They are deprived of the essential part of the actual communicative experience. In this paper, it is maintained that the dynamic interaction of the strategic action sort propounded by DiPetro (1994) and the "process drama " type of approach suggested by Shin-Mei Kao and O'Neill (1998) can help learners to expand their language development to include framework in which input serves to spark output.

40|$|The Jinpingmei, as an open text, is {{susceptible}} to different interpretations. But instead of fixing the interpretation within an ideological framework, I choose {{to focus on the}} two transgressive textual elements of sex and laughter, and demonstrate how they work together to contribute to the ambivalent structure of the novel. Considering the morally provocative and aesthetically allusive quality of the rhetorical use of sex and laughter, the study shows that the text has embodied within itself an ambivalence to transgress an established moral threshold. The study on sex and laughter has also led to the question of intertextual play which is partly subordinated to the rhetorical convention of the novelistic discourse, and partly manipulated by the self-conscious author to flaunt his talent. The study shows that the literatus' indulgence in the <b>verbal</b> <b>act</b> is no less excessive than the indulgence of the erotic characters. He has consciously or unconsciously created a metafiction in which the story of the libertine is built upon a multitude of other stories. Through the implied author's narrative voice and its dialogic relationship with the characters, the novel is implicitly seen as an expression of the author's self/other. The frustration as well as the unfulfilled desire of the female figures as narrative object is seen as an oblique reflection of the author's fe/male subjectivity. While the author is subject to the literary convention of using the image of "beauty and flowers" (meiren xiangcao) for self-expression, the female characters, presented as libertine both sympathetic and condemnable, reflect the ambivalence of the author's urge to subvert the stereotypical convention and his anxiety to search for an identity against a constellation of multiple values and ethics. Through his subversion of the rhetorical image of beauty and flowers, the discourse can also be interpreted as a self-parody of the author...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the development in Proto–Indo–European, Latin and Romance of a word–formation pattern which the most adequate terminology in use dubs ‘verbal government compounds with a governing first member’; I use the shorthand ‘pickpocket compounds’. The first member of such compounds derives from a verb, {{while the second}} mostly represents its direct object: thus English pickpocket. Most English examples are functionally agent–nouns, referring to the agent of the implied <b>verbal</b> <b>act.</b> Nevertheless, they lack a suffix indicating this. By contrast, the more prolific type of compound agent–noun, represented by truck–driver, has the deverbal member second and carries an agentive suffix, ‑er. Pickpocket compounds are attested in early strata of Greek and Indo–Iranian and in medieval strata of Germanic, Slavic and Romance. Latin has around a dozen examples. The scholarly debate, continued in this thesis, has been centred round two issues: (1) the morphological make–up of the type and (2) its historical origin. (1) is preliminarily assessed in chapter 2, reviewing the basics of nominal composition and providing {{an account of the}} fundamental difference between pickpocket and truckdriver compounds. It contains a cursory discussion of Homeric Greek, Indo–Iranian and Germanic representatives. This comparative perspective on the morphology of the type is continued in chapters 3 – 5 on Latin and Romance. An important conclusion, and an answer to one of the most–discussed questions in the debate, is that these compounds cannot be considered univerbated imperative clauses. (2) is likewise assessed preliminarily in chapter 2, offering an outline {{of the history of the}} Greek and Indo–Aryan material. Taking the history of the Latin/Romance material up for revision, chapters 3 – 5 conclude that Latin offers no evidence in support of a Proto–Indo–European type. The Romance type may have an origin in Latin; however, the theoretical considerations laid out in Chapter 2 suggest that given the relevant typological conditions, new compositional types may arise spontaneously. Finally, the medieval Germanic and Slavic types result from Romance adstrate and have no bearing on Proto–Indo–European; see the summary discussion in 6. 3. Promotor: A. M.
