For each fixed-duration stimulus, the ratio of reinforcer frequencies contingent upon reporting the fixed versus the variable stimulus was systematically manipulated. Detection performance was well controlled by both the stimulus value and the reinforcer ratio. Both the discriminability between the fixed duration and the set of <b>variable</b> <b>durations,</b> and the discriminability between the fixed duration and each of the <b>variable</b> <b>durations,</b> were independent of the reinforcer-frequency ratio when discriminability was measured as log d. The sensitivity of response bias to reinforcement-ratio changes was independent {{of the value of the}} fixed duration, but was not independent of the discriminability of the <b>variable</b> <b>durations</b> from the fixed durations. Under current models, discriminability measures in complex temporal discrimination may be independent of biasing manipulations, but bias measures are not independent of stimulus values...|$|R

2500|$|Many animals use the {{variation}} in duration of melatonin production each day as a seasonal clock. In animals including humans, the profile of melatonin synthesis and secretion {{is affected by the}} <b>variable</b> <b>duration</b> of night in summer as compared to winter. The change in duration of secretion thus serves as a biological signal for the organization of daylength-dependent (photoperiodic) seasonal functions such as reproduction, behavior, coat growth, and camouflage coloring in seasonal animals. In seasonal breeders that do not have long gestation periods and that mate during longer daylight hours, the melatonin signal controls the seasonal variation in their sexual physiology, and similar physiological effects can be induced by exogenous melatonin in animals including mynah birds and hamsters. Melatonin can suppress libido by inhibiting secretion of luteinizing hormone [...] and follicle-stimulating hormone [...] from the anterior pituitary gland, especially in mammals that have a breeding season when daylight hours are long. The reproduction of long-day breeders is repressed by melatonin and the reproduction of short-day breeders is stimulated by melatonin.|$|E

30|$|The {{duration}} {{dependence of}} the hazard rate is captured in two ways. On the one hand, following Bover et al.

40|$|Descriptive and {{comparative}} analyses of temporal measurements taken from continuous spectrographs of humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae songs and their component themes, phrases and syllables indicate possible coding of information. Predictable relationships occur between {{the majority of}} the <b>variable</b> theme <b>durations</b> and total song durations in all the song types (location-year) studied. In contrast to the <b>variable</b> <b>durations</b> of themes and songs, phrases (which are repeated a variable number of times to compose themes) are remarkably stereotyped and may represent the longest stereotyped displays reported in animal communication. Significant differences exist in these phrase durations between subpopulations within an oceanic dialect (e. g., Mexico vs. Hawaii), but differences between individuals of a subpopulation, in phrases, syllables and intervals are specific and not generally reliable. It is proposed that since humpbacks share song format in each location, temporal cues may be utilized in addition to spectral detail of syllables to code information. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{cycles of}} {{evolution}} of soils have very <b>variable</b> <b>durations,</b> between tens, hundreds, {{or thousands of}} years for quickly evolving soils (A horizon only) {{to more than a}} million years for slowly developing soils. The same soil may achieve several successive steady state conditions during its existence, as exhibited by the Pygmy forest sequence in Mendocino County, California. Soils naturally reach a state of high productivity, from which they naturally degrade as mineral nutrients are removed from the soil system. Thus older soils are more vulnerable to the effects of induced retrogression and degradation.|$|R
40|$|Brief, {{high-frequency}} bursts {{are commonly}} observed in neuronal recordings and {{are thought to}} represent a special neural code. Bursts have <b>variable</b> <b>durations</b> and spike counts which can encode stimulus variables. Here we examine how a burst duration code can be read out by synapses with short-term dynamics. We find that synapses can be tuned to preferentially respond to specific burst durations and the published range of facilitation and depression time-scales matches the typical burst patterns. These findings demonstrate the decodability of a neural code based on burst duration. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
