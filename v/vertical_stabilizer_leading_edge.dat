5000|$|HRSI tiles (black in color) {{provided}} {{protection against}} temperatures up to [...] There were 20,548 HRSI tiles which covered {{the landing gear}} doors, external tank umbilical connection doors, {{and the rest of}} the orbiter's under surfaces. They were also used in areas on the upper forward fuselage, parts of the orbital maneuvering system pods, <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> elevon trailing edges, and upper body flap surface. They varied in thickness from 1 to 5 in, depending upon the heat load encountered during reentry. Except for closeout areas, these tiles were normally 6 by 6 in square. The HRSI tile was composed of high purity silica fibers. Ninety percent of the volume of the tile was empty space, giving it a very low density (...) making it light enough for spaceflight. [...] The uncoated tiles were bright white in appearance and looked more like a solid ceramic than the foam-like material that they were.|$|E

50|$|The orbiter {{resembled a}} {{conventional}} aircraft, with double-delta wings swept 81° at the inner <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and 45° at the outer <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> Its <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer's</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was swept {{back at a}} 50° angle. The four elevons, mounted at {{the trailing edge of}} the wings, and the rudder/speed brake, attached at the trailing edge of the stabilizer, with the body flap, controlled the orbiter during descent and landing.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{failure of}} Continental Express {{maintenance}} and inspection personnel {{to adhere to}} proper maintenance and quality assurance procedures for the airplane's horizontal stabilizer de-ice boots {{that led to the}} sudden in-flight loss of the partially secured left horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and the immediate severe nose-down pitchover and breakup of the airplane. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the failure of the Continental Express management to ensure compliance with the approved maintenance procedures, and the failure of FAA surveillance to detect and verify compliance with approved procedures." ...|$|R
50|$|The Galaxy {{was based}} on a new wider fuselage, {{attached}} to a strengthened Astra SPX wing with integrated winglets and modified high lift devices, powered by new 5,700 lb (25.3 kN) thrust Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306 turbofans, and with improved Pro Line 4 avionics and all-new interior. The decision to use the existing Astra SPX wing imposed a limit on maximum size, but allowed for a fuselage large enough to accommodate three-abreast seating. The main change from the Astra SPX wing was the introduction of Krueger flaps on the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of the inboard section. These recovered some of the field performance lost {{as a result of the}} Galaxy's higher wing loading. It used rubber de-ice boots on wing and horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> The aircraft has seating configurations for 8 to 10 passengers. The G200 has a forward tilting stance when on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The J 2 {{differed}} from the J 1 in having a cowling that almost entirely enclosed the engine, a rounded upper and lower fusalage section instead of the rectangular section of the J 1., and a narrower and deeper ventral radiator enclosure, and had a horizontal stabilizer planform shape that would become familiar on later, all-duralumin Junkers monoplane designs to be built during 1917-18. The [...] "all-moving" [...] rudder still possessed no fixed fin, like the J 1. A faired-in headrest was provided for, {{as well as the}} possibly pioneering appearance of a [...] "roll bar" [...] for an open-cockpit aircraft, placed above the headrest for additional pilot protection in case of the aircraft overturning during landing. The landing gear was of the usual vee-type, but taller than that of the J 1's, and having the upper ends of the legs anchored not onto the lower longerons as on the J 1, but to the first wing rib bay beyond the wing root, with a long tailskid that emerged from the lower rear fuselage directly below the <b>stabilizer's</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> root. The wings had at least three different airfoil changes between root and tip, and had sections of them electrically roll-welded for stronger, more continuous bonding for greater strength. The resulting aircraft was intended to be smaller than the J 1 demonstrator, but with its steel structure, it almost equalled the J 1's completed weight.|$|R
25|$|Many Mooney {{aircraft}} {{have the}} signature <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> with its <b>vertical</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and swept trailing edge {{that gives the}} illusion of being forward-swept.|$|R
5000|$|To reduce low-frequency {{reflections}} {{from the}} fuselage and <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> wires were strung horizontally from {{the nose of}} the aircraft to the tail, and horizontally from the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> to the trailing edge of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> Ferrite beads were placed on the wires to tune them to the expected frequencies. This technique was called simply, [...] "Wires." ...|$|R
50|$|The Space Shuttle orbiter resembled an {{airplane}} in its design, with a standard-looking fuselage and two double delta wings, both swept wings {{at an angle}} of 81 degrees at their inner <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> and 45 degrees at their outer <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> The <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> of the orbiter had a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> that was swept back at a 45-degree angle. There were four elevons mounted at the trailing edges of the delta wings, and the combination rudder and speed brake was attached at {{the trailing edge of}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> These, along with a movable body flap located underneath the main engines, controlled the orbiter during later stages of descent through the atmosphere and landing.|$|R
50|$|Each {{engine cowling}} and nacelle drew back into tail booms that {{terminated}} upwards in large <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and their component rudders, each of a shape {{similar to a}} rounded right triangle. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of each <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> was faired smoothly {{from the surface of}} the tail boom upwards, swept back to 37°. The horizontal stabilizer extended between the inner surfaces of the two <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> and was approximately ¾ the chord of the wing root, including the elevator. The elevator spanned approximately ⅓ of the horizontal stabilizer's width, and in overhead plan view, angled inwards in the horizontal from both corners of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> towards the trailing edge approximately 15°, forming the elevator into a wide, short trapezoid. The horizontal stabilizer and elevator assembly possessed a slight airfoil cross-section.|$|R
5000|$|To further improve {{handling}} and stability, the new UT-2M (modernized) variant {{was developed in}} 1941 and it replaced the original UT-2 in production. The wing planform was redesigned, with a swept <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and a straight trailing edge, and the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> was enlarged.|$|R
50|$|The filler {{materials}} {{were made of}} either white AB312 fibers or black AB312 cloth covers (which contain alumina fibers). These {{materials were}} used around the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the nose cap, windshields, side hatch, wing, trailing edge of elevons, <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> the rudder/speed brake, body flap, and heat shield of the shuttle's main engines.|$|R
50|$|A deicing boot {{is a type}} of ice {{protection}} system installed on aircraft surfaces to permit a mechanical deicing in flight. Such boots are generally installed on the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of wings and control surfaces (e.g. horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer)</b> as these areas are most likely to accumulate ice and any contamination could severely affect the aircraft's performance.|$|R
50|$|The Swift's {{fuselage}} {{is built}} around four welded steel longerons and skinned with composite materials. Behind the cabin the fuselage diameter decreases markedly to the tail. The fin <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and the rudder hinge are both strongly swept but {{the trailing edge of}} the rudder, which carries an electrically operated trim tab, is only slightly swept. The tailplane and single piece elevator, also tabbed, are set well back, with the tailplane <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> behind the rudder hinge. A small triangular underfin provides more <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> area. A fixed tricycle undercarriage is mounted on the lower fuselage with cantilever legs. The wheels are spatted and the nosewheel steerable.|$|R
5000|$|Both Daedalus {{aircraft}} {{were constructed}} with {{a framework of}} carbon fiber tubes. Airfoil shape for the wing and tail elements was maintained with a thin polystyrene foam <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> polystyrene ribs, and a Kevlar trailing edge. Wing skin was Mylar plastic of approximately 0.3 mil (8 μm) thickness. The bottom portion of the fuselage and majority of the pilot seat were made of Kevlar as well. Horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> were [...] "all-moving" [...] control surfaces.|$|R
25|$|During flight testing, the snag on the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the stabilators {{was filled}} in, {{and the gap}} between the leading-edge {{extensions}} (LEX) and the fuselage mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer air discharge (BLAD) slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> due to extreme Structural loads, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads.|$|R
500|$|The F-22 {{had several}} design changes from the YF-22. The swept-back {{angle of the}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was {{decreased}} from 48° to 42°, while the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> were shifted rearward and decreased in area by 20%. To improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward , and the engine intakes moved rearward [...] The shapes of the wing and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics. Increasing weight during development caused slight reductions in range and aerodynamic performance.|$|R
50|$|Parts of {{the wings}} were reskinned and some {{structural}} elements rebuilt, and the aircraft wiring replaced. Because of advances in miniaturization, {{it was possible}} to incorporate these additional electronics items entirely within the fuselage without requiring the use of the dorsal hump. The Kahu-modified Skyhawk could be recognized by a blade-like ILS aerial antenna on the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> The aircraft also received armament upgrades including the capability to fire AIM-9L Sidewinders, AGM-65 Mavericks and GBU-16 Paveway II laser-guided bombs.|$|R
40|$|A subsonic wind-tunnel {{investigation}} of the application of vortex flaps to a supersonic interceptor configuration is described. Experimental results are presented which indicate the aerodynamic effects of vortex-flap deflection, trailing-edge flap deflection, vortex flap chord and span, <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> and a highly cambered <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> designed for attached flow. Data presented include longitudinal forces and moments, upper-surface pressure distributions, and oil- and smoke-flow visualization photographs. It is concluded that a full-span deployable vortex flap can provide a substantial performance improvement for this and other similar configurations...|$|R
50|$|The F-22 {{had several}} design changes from the YF-22. The swept-back {{angle of the}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was {{decreased}} from 48° to 42°, while the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> were shifted rearward and decreased in area by 20%. To improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7 in, and the engine intakes moved rearward 14 in. The shapes of the wing and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics. Increasing weight during development caused slight reductions in range and aerodynamic performance.|$|R
50|$|While at Langley, the DM1 {{underwent}} significant changes. The {{original design}} used airfoils of very thick section, especially the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> which ran {{all the way}} to the nose of the aircraft and served double duty as the cockpit. For high speed flight, thicker airfoils are known to have very high drag, which proved to be true on the DM1. The design was progressively modified in an effort to lower drag. One of the first changes was to remove the large <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and replace it with one of much smaller size in a more conventional layout, and adding a normal cockpit canopy taken from a Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star. Further work introduced sharp extensions along the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the wing, which had the side-effect of showing periodic generation of very large vortexes over the wing. The significance of this effect would not be fully understood until the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the use of}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> is most common, it is {{possible}} to obtain directional stability with no discrete <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b>|$|R
50|$|In modern day, light jet general {{aviation}} aircraft {{such as the}} Cirrus Vision, Eclipse 400 or the unmanned aerial drone Global Hawk often have the power plant placed outside the aircraft to protect the passengers and make certification easier. In such cases V-tails are used to avoid placing the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> in the exhaust of the engine, which would disrupt {{the flow of the}} exhaust, reducing thrust and increasing wear on the <b>stabilizer,</b> possibly <b>leading</b> to damage over time.|$|R
5000|$|The glider {{featured}} two wooden parallel trusses {{running along}} its spine, with two widely spaced truss wing spars. Wing ribs {{were attached to}} the spar with varnished shoelaces. The wing shape featured a straight <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> with the trailing edge tapering back to the tail giving it a distinctive [...] "Half Pie" [...] appearance from the top. The <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> were low, but ran {{the full length of}} the fuselage on either side with small canard like control surfaces at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> The aircraft had conventional landing gear. The pilot sat in a small [...] "bucket" [...] embedded {{in the center of the}} wing. A clear plastic <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> helped ease the poor downward visibility. The internal volume of the wing was so large that Snyder planned on using Helium to assist in buoyancy, giving it the name [...] "Dirigiplane" [...] in several publications. The assisted lift concept was never applied to the glider though.|$|R
50|$|The {{wings are}} built from pine with a birch-plywood skin to 55% from the <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> The wing employs a Wortmann FX62-K-152 airfoil at the wing root, a Wortmann FX62-K-153 {{mid-span}} and a Wortmann FX60-126 at the wing tip. The ailerons are 3.1m long and are constructed with foam plastic ribs {{and covered with}} plywood. The wing also features eight-section dive brakes for glidepath control. The horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> {{as well as the}} flaps are covered with plywood and have foam plastic ribs. The rudder is covered with aircraft fabric.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> {{is mounted}} exactly vertically, and the {{horizontal}} stabilizer is directly mounted to the empennage (the rear fuselage). This {{is the most}} common <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> configuration.|$|R
50|$|At Langley, the thick-section {{airfoils}} of the DM1 {{were found}} to generate considerable drag at transonic speeds, {{and a series of}} experiments followed to try to explore these issues. Two lines of study were considered; sharp fillets were added to the wing's <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> and the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> was significantly shrunken in size, thinned, and moved rearward. This left considerable room in front of the stabilizer, where a conventional cockpit was fitted. During these tests, the tendency for the wings to generate large vortices at high angles of attack was noticed, but the significance of this was not exploited until many years later.|$|R
40|$|Results {{of tests}} on a slender delta wing will be {{presented}} to describe the effect <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> have on vortex breakdown at high angles of attack. The test will consist of flow visualization using Laser Induced fluorescence. The experimental test will vary <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> to compare the effect on the flow. It is anticipated that the presence of <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> will spatially lock the position of vortices thereby reducing the wing-rock. Using the experimental data, the geometry of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> will Be altered to provide for a well behaved flow. Tests were conducted on a modified delta wing to analyze vertical tail influence on delta wing roll oscillation...|$|R
25|$|The Su-57 has a blended wing body {{fuselage}} and incorporates all-moving {{horizontal and}} vertical stabilizers; the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> toe inwards {{to serve as the}} aircraft's airbrake. The aircraft incorporates thrust vectoring and has adjustable <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortex controllers (LEVCONs) designed to control vortices generated by the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> root extensions, and can provide trim and improve high angle of attack behaviour, including a quick stall recovery if the thrust vectoring system fails. The advanced flight control system and thrust vectoring nozzles make the aircraft departure resistant and highly maneuverable in both pitch and yaw, enabling the aircraft to perform very high angles of attack maneuvers such as the Pugachev's Cobra and the Bell maneuver, along with doing flat rotations with little altitude loss. The aircraft's high cruising speed and normal operating altitude is also expected to give it a significant kinematic advantage over prior generations of aircraft.|$|R
500|$|A new <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> was {{introduced}} in 2004 beginning with MSN 555. This newer fin is shorter in height by [...] and {{was derived from the}} design of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> of the A340-500 and -600, later becoming standard on all new A330-200s.|$|R
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the YA-19 design was its horizontal stabiliser located forward of the vertical tail. The small size of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> caused some directional instability (about the yaw axis) so the last YA-19 (S/N 38-555) was equipped with enlarged <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b>|$|R
40|$|A subsonic-to-transonic speed {{wind tunnel}} study has been {{conducted}} to deepen {{understanding of the nature}} and possibilities for control of vortical flows associated with wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> extensions (LEXs) on the F/A- 18 aircraft; these vortical phenomena encompass vortex breakdown and vortex interactions with <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> Wind tunnel results were correlated with in-flight flow visualizations as well as handling-qualities trend data from a USN F- 18 with LEX fences to improve the vertical tail buffet environment. Attention is given to the sensitivity of the vortex flows to Re and Mach numbers, reduced vertical tail excitation due to the presence of a LEX fence, and the interpretation of off-body flow visualizations...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the structural repairs in the radio compartment and tail gunner position, numerous repairs {{have been made to}} the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and related fairings. The <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> is ready for remounting. Radio mounting brackets and landing light housings have been refabricated from scratch.|$|R

50|$|A {{variation}} on the twin tail, it has three <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> An example of this configuration is the Lockheed Constellation. On the Constellation it was done to give the airplane maximum <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> area while keeping the overall height low enough {{so that it could}} fit into maintenance hangars.|$|R
50|$|The PZL.37 was {{designed}} in the mid-1930s at the PZL factory in Warsaw by Jerzy Dąbrowski.The first PZL.37/I prototype, fitted with a single <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> flew on 13 December 1936. The second prototype PZL.37/II, with twin <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and other improvements, was accepted for production. The first 10 serial aircraft were produced in 1938 as the PZL.37A variant with a single <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> however. The next 19 interim aircraft were built as PZL.37A bis, with a twin tail. They all were powered by Bristol Pegasus XII B radial engines produced in Poland under licence.|$|R
