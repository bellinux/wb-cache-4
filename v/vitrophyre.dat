50|$|Rhyolite can be {{considered}} as the extrusive equivalent to the plutonic granite rock, and consequently, outcrops of rhyolite may bear a resemblance to granite. Due to their high content of silica and low iron and magnesium contents, rhyolite melts are highly polymerized and form highly viscous lavas. They also occur as breccias or in volcanic plugs and dikes. Rhyolites that cool too quickly to grow crystals form a natural glass or <b>vitrophyre,</b> also called obsidian. Slower cooling forms microscopic crystals in the lava and results in textures such as flow foliations, spherulitic, nodular, and lithophysal structures. Some rhyolite is highly vesicular pumice. Many eruptions of rhyolite are highly explosive and the deposits may consist of fallout tephra/tuff or of ignimbrites.|$|E

50|$|Occasionally spherulites {{are found}} that are many centimeters and, even more rarely, {{up to two}} or three meters in {{diameter}}. Those spherulites, which are more than 20 centimeters in diameter, are called megaspherulites. Near Silver Cliff, Colorado, megaspherulites, which range in diameter from 0.30 to 4.3 meters occur within a thick layer of rhyolitic <b>vitrophyre.</b> Megaspherulites as large as 0.91 meter occur within rhyolite exposures on Steens Mountain, Oregon and ones as large as 1.83 meters in diameter occur within welded tuffs exposed near Klondyke, Arizona. The best known occurrence of megaspherulites are stone balls, which range in diameter from 0.61 to 3.35 meters, found around Cerro Piedras Bola in the Sierra de Ameca between Ahualulco de Mercado and Ameca, Jalisco. As often happens with considerably smaller spherulites, these megaspherulites have been released by weathering from an ash flow tuff, in which they originally formed, to create natural stone balls.|$|E
50|$|Lunar breccias {{range from}} glassy <b>vitrophyre</b> melt rocks, to glass-rich breccia, to {{regolith}} breccias. The vitrophyres are dominantly glassy rocks that represent impact melt sheets that fill large impact structures. They contain few clasts {{of the target}} lithology, which is largely melted by the impact. Glassy breccias form from impact melt that exit the crater and entrain large volumes of crushed (but not melted) ejecta. It may contain abundant clasts that reflect the range of lithologies in the target region, sitting in a matrix of mineral fragments plus glass that welds it all together. Some of the clasts in these breccias are pieces of older breccias, documenting a repeated history of impact brecciation, cooling, and impact. Regolith breccias resemble the glassy breccias but {{have little or no}} glass (melt) to weld them together. As noted above, the basin-forming impacts responsible for these breccias pre-date almost all mare basalt volcanism, so clasts of mare basalt are very rare. When found, these clasts represent the earliest phase of mare basalt volcanism preserved.|$|E

This study evaluates the susceptibility of an underlying 50 -ft-thick <b>vitrophyre</b> to thermal alteration by examining alteration that occured in the rock as it cooled after deposition. A 10 {sup 0 }C temperature rise should have no mineralogical effects on the <b>vitrophyre,</b> but an increase of 60 {sup 0 } or more is {{likely to result in}} alteration. Expected mineralogic changes in the <b>vitrophyre</b> caused by this amount of thermal loading include crystallization of zeolites and smectite. Alteration will be concentrated of zeolites and smectite. Alteration will be concentrated in a thin interval {{near the top of the}} <b>vitrophyre</b> and along fractures. Adsorbed water and water in preexisting hydrous minerals and in glass may contribute to hydrothermal alteration of underlying <b>vitrophyre.</b> Bulk porosity change would be slight and local porosity increase would probably be restricted to the upper part of the <b>vitrophyre.</b> Although some fracture filling could occur, such a minor sealing effect would be balanced by development of secondary porosity.

40|$|Megaspherulites {{occur in}} the middle zone of a thick {{sequence}} of rhyolitic <b>vitrophyre</b> that occupies a small, late Eocene to early Oligocene volcanic-tectonic basin near Silver Cliff, Custer County, Colorado. Diameters of the megaspherulites range from 0. 3 m to over 3. 66 m, including a clay envelope. The megaspherulites are compound spherulites. consisting of an extremely large number (3. 8 x 10 (exp 9) to 9. 9 x 10 (exp 9)) of individual growth cones averaging 3 mm long by 1. 25 mm wide at their termination. They are holocrystalline, very fine- to fine-grained, composed of disordered to ordered sanidine (orthoclase) and quartz, and surrounded by a thin K-feldspar, quartz rich rind, an inner clay layer with mordenite, and an outer clay layer composed wholly of 15 A montmorillonite. Whole rock analyses of the megaspherulites show a restricted composition from their core to their outer edge, with an average analyses of 76. 3 % SiO 2, 0. 34 % CaO, 2. 17 % Na 2 O, 6. 92 % K 2 O, 0. 83 % H 2 O+ compared to the rhyolitic <b>vitrophyre</b> from which they crystallize with 71. 07 % SiO 2, 0. 57 % CaO, 4. 06 % Na 2 O, 4. l 0 % K 2 O, and 6. 40 % H 2 O+. The remaining oxides of Fe 2 O 3 (total Fe), A 12 O 3, MnO,MgO, TiO 2, P 2 O 5, Cr 2 O 3, and trace elements show uniform distribution between the megaspherulites and the rhyolitic <b>vitrophyre.</b> Megaspherulite crystallization began soon after the rhyolitic lava ceased to flow {{as the result of}} sparse heterogeneous nucleation, under nonequilibrium conditions, due to a high degree of undercooling, delta T. The crystals grow with a fibrous habit which is favored by a large delta T ranging between 245 C and 295 C, despite lowered viscosity, and enhanced diffusion due to the high H 2 O content, ranging between 5 % and 7 %. Therefore, megaspherulite growth proceeded in a diffusion controlled manner, where the diffusion, rate lags behind the crystal growth rate at the crystal-liquid interface, restricting fibril lengths and diameters to the 10 micron to 15 micron and 3 micron and 8 micron ranges respectively. Once diffusion reestablishes itself at the crystallization front, a new nucleation event occurs at the terminated tips of the fibril cones and a new cone begins to develop with a similar orientation (small angle branching) to the earlier cones. During crystallization, these fibril cones impinge upon each other, resulting in fibril cone-free areas. These cone-free areas consist of coarser, fine-grained phases, dominated by quartz, which crystallized from the melt as it accumulated between the crystallizing K-feldspar fibrils of the cones. The anhydrous nature of the disordered to ordered sanidine (orthoclase) and quartz, suggests that water in the <b>vitrophyre</b> moved ahead of the crystallization front, resulting in a water rich fluid being enriched in Si, K, Na, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, and Y. The clay layers associated with the megaspherulites are therefore, the result of the deuteric alteration between the fractionated water and the <b>vitrophyre,</b> as indicated by the presence of the minerals mordenite and montmorillonite. This silica rich fluid also resulted in the total silicification of the megaspherulites within the upper 3 m of the <b>vitrophyre...</b>|$|E
40|$|Modal {{abundance}} and major- and minor-element chemical analysis of homogeneous, non-agglutinitic mare and non-mare glasses from the Luna 24 drill core {{show that most}} glasses {{can be related to}} known rock types.

40|$|A {{selected}} suite containing {{several of}} the largest samples of lunar highland melt rocks includes impact melt specimens (anorthositic gabbro, low-K Fra Mauro) and volcanic specimens (intermediate-K Fra Mauro). Although previous assumptions of LKFM volcanism have fallen into disfavor, no fatal arguments against this hypothesis have been presented, and the evidence of a possibly 'inherited igneous' olivine-plagioclase cosaturation provides cause for keeping a volcanic LKFM hypothesis viable. Comparisons of silicate mineralogy with melt rock compositions provide information on the specimen's composition and cooling history. Plagioclase-rock compositions can be matched to the experimentally determined equilibria for appropriate samples to identify melt rocks with refractory anorthitic clasts. Olivine-rock compositions indicate that melt rock <b>vitrophyres</b> precipitate anomalously Fe-rich olivine; {{the cause of this}} anomaly is not immediately evident. The Al-Ti and Ca-Fe-Mg zonation in pyroxene provide information on relative cooling rates of highland melt rocks, but Cr- and Al-content (where Al-rich low-Ca pyroxene cores are preserved in rapidly cooled samples) can be correlated with composition of the host rock...|$|R
40|$|An analog of the Apollo 12 olivine <b>vitrophyres</b> {{has been}} {{crystallized}} in a 1 -atm gas-mixing furnace at cooling rates ranging between 1250 and 0. 7 C/hr and isothermally at degrees of supercooling ranging from 10 C to 325 C. Mineral chemistry, crystal shapes, grain sizes and textures are systematically related to cooling rate {{and degree of}} supercooling. At linear cooling rates not exceeding 40 C/hr the texture is porphyritic - large olivine crystals are set in a groundmass of finer-grained pyroxene, plagioclase, and ilmenite; a later generation of olivine never crystallizes. There are three shapes of olivine crystals in the Apollo 12 olivine vitrophyres: glomerocrysts of subhedral crystals, large subequant skeletons, and highly elongate skeletons. These result from three generations of nucleation and a two-stage cooling history - a slow preeruption stage and a rapid continuously increasing posteruption stage. It {{seems likely that the}} Apollo 12 olivine basalt magmas were erupted with olivine crystals in suspension. The nucleation temperature of olivine in cooling-rate experiments is dependent on the experimental technique, and hence results of cooling experiments should be applied with caution...|$|R

40|$|The Marysvale Volcanic Field {{is an area}} rich in uranium. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if the}} uranium deposits might be of volcanogenic origin. The leaching, migration, and redeposition of uranium from silicic volcanic rocks are the primary processes responsible for concentrating uranium in volcanogenic systems. This geochemical study consisted of determining the major, minor and trace element concentrations of the major volcanic units, and the relationships of the rock chemistry to uranium mineralization. ^ The units in the Marysvale Volcanic Field, used in this study, consist of ash-flow tuffs, intermediate lava flows, and associated intrusives of the Bullion Canyon volcanics and ash-flow tuffs, volcaniclastic deposits, domes and stocks of the Mount Belknap volcanics. ^ When compared to overlaying welded tuff or rhyolitic units, results of selected trace element analyses indicate that the vitrophyric samples from the Mount Belknap volcanic units, are all enriched in F, Cs, and U, and that 50 % of the <b>vitrophyres</b> are enriched in Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Zr, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. The presence of anamalous Cs in all of the <b>vitrophyres</b> may indicate that an important trace element indicator for uranium exploration has been overlooked. This indicates that the overlying units have been devitrified and have released U as well as other trace elements into the volcanogenic system. ^ This study has reevaluated the Marysvale Central Mining District and has proposed another theory as to the origin of the uranium deposits in that area. This hypothesis places a previously unidentified caldera around the area, and this author has named it the Marysvale caldera. Evidence for this caldera includes: arcurate faults which surround the region; alteration patterns which appear to form a circular pattern along the boundary of the proposed caldera; the presence of small monzonite intrusive bodies appear to ring the caldera; the presence of ash-flow tuffs which thicken appreciably along the northeast boundary of the caldera; and the central intrusive which may represent a resurgent phase of the proposed caldera. The rhyolite flow domes and small stocks associated with the Mount Belknap Volcanics, and the small Red Hills caldera may represent a recycling of caldera evolution with these later volcanics being emplaced along the other caldera structure. This seems to be a viable alternative to the magmatic hydrothermal origin for the uranium deposits presently proposed for the Central Mining District. ...|$|R

This proves to be an excellent method for the characterization of volcanic glasses, particularly when particles of exotic origin are present, because the effect of these is not easily eliminated by conventional whole rock analysis. Analyses of glassy rhyolites (ignimbrites and lava flows) in northwestern Mexico establish a geochemical signature for the samples, providing criteria that allow us to: a) correlate them with a peralkaline volcanic event, previously reported, that occurred during Middle Miocene time; b) distinguish them from other metaluminous varieties in the region and, c) propose a correlation between all the peralkaline <b>vitrophyres</b> that crop out within the studied area, of at least 50. 000 km^ 2, validating the hypothesis that they are related to the same volcanic event.

We interpret this rock as a chemically zoned, rheomorphic, lava-like ignimbrite that formed during a sustained pyroclastic eruption. The Sgurr of Eigg Pitchstone can be subdivided into discrete emplacement units distinguished by the following features: (1) their present-day weathering characteristics; (2) the orientation, spacing and morphology of the columnar joints; (3) sharp, undulating boundaries with marked topographic breaks. The absence of weathered surfaces, palaeosols, pyroclastic fall deposits or sedimentary rocks at emplacement unit boundaries suggests deposition from a single eruption. The emplacement units, some of which display upper and basal <b>vitrophyres,</b> represent distinct depositional packages that record several rapidly emplaced ignimbrites, which welded, cooled and devitrified as a simple, essentially single, cooling unit, during eruption from a sustained, low pyroclastic column. The Sgurr of Eigg Pitchstone displays a pervasive base-parallel flow banding, which is folded into intrafolial recumbent isoclinal folds. The flow banding and folds indicate that rheomorphism occurred throughout deposition.

Dacite and dacite <b>vitrophyre</b> samples are porphyritic, containing phenocrysts of plagioclase, quartz, biotite, amphibole, orthopyroxene, and iron-titanium oxides. Rhyolite and rhyolite <b>vitrophyre</b> samples are porphyritic, containing phenocrysts of plagioclase, alkali feldspar, quartz, and iron-titanium oxides, with minor amounts of biotite and amphibole. Plagioclase phenocrysts are complexly twinned, zoned, and corroded in dacitic samples; whereas, they are simply twinned, unzoned, and uncorroded in rhyolitic samples. Quartz and alkali feldspar phenocrysts contain glass-filled inclusions and are subrounded in rhyolitic samples. Average chemical analyses of five dacitic sample yield weight percent: SiO 2, 69. 11; TiO 2, 0. 31; Al 2 O 3, 14. 18; Fe 2 O 3, 1. 26; FeO, 1. 23; MnO, 0. 04; MgO, 0. 54; CaO, 2. 27; Na 2 O, 3. 30; K 2 O, 4. 07; P 2 O 5, 1. 23; H 2 O+, 1. 89; H 2 O-, 0. 46; total, 99. 27.

Evidence supporting this relative emplacement is the restriction of rhyolite to the southeastern corner of the study area and the intrusion of rhyolite into dacite in the narrows of Death Creek Valley. The volcanic flows of the study area are believed to have been derived during the second stage of Basin and Range volcanism beginning approximately 14 million years ago.

40|$|Drilling, trenching, {{excavation}} of the Exploratory Studies Facility, and other surface and underground-distributing activities {{have the potential}} to release minerals into the environment from tuffs at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Some of these minerals may be potential respiratory health hazards. Therefore, an understanding of the distribution of the minerals that may potentially be liberated during site-characterization and operation of the potential repository is crucial to ensuring worker and public safety. Analysis of previously reported mineralogy of Yucca Mountain tuffs using data and criteria from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) suggests that the following minerals are of potential concern: quartz, cristobalite, tridymite, opal-CT, erionite, mordenite, and palygorskite. The authors have re-evaluated the three-dimensional mineral distribution at Yucca Mountain above the static water level both in bulk-rock samples and in fractures, using quantitative X-ray powder diffraction analysis. Erionite, mordenite, and palygorskite occur primarily in fractures; the crystalline-silica minerals, quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite are major bulk-rock phases. Erionite occurs in the altered zone just above the lower Topopah Spring Member <b>vitrophyre,</b> and an occurrence below the <b>vitrophyre</b> but above the Calico Hills has recently been identified. In this latter occurrence, erionite is present in the matrix at levels up to 35 wt%. Mordenite and palygorskite occur throughout the vadose zone nearly to the surface. Opal-CT is limited to zeolitic horizons...|$|E
40|$|The acidic {{flows from}} Serra Geral Formation in Torres Syncline, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, {{are on the}} top of a {{volcanic}} sequence composed by a complex facies association of compound, simple and rubbly pahoehoebasic flows, acidic lava domes, and tabular acidic lava flows. The origin and emplacement conditions of the acidic volcanic rocks are discussed in this paper based on petrology, on calculated apatite saturation thermometry temperatures, and on estimated viscosity data. The liquidus temperatures for metaluminous rhyodacite to rhyolite samples are about 1, 067. 5 ± 25 ºC in average. The viscosity (&# 951;) values vary from 105 to 106 Pas for anhydrous conditions, suggesting the emplacement of high-temperature - low-viscosity lava flows and domes. The occurrence of acidic lava domes above simple pahoehoe flows as flow-banded <b>vitrophyres</b> was under low effusion rates, in spite of their high temperature and low viscosities, which are reflected in their small height. The emplacement of lava domes has continued until the eruption of rubbly pahoehoe flows and the geometry of these deposits rugged the relief. Presence of tabular acidic lava flows covering the landscape indicates that it was under high effusion rates conditions and such flows had well-insulated cooled surface crusts. The capacity to attain greater distances and overpass relief obstacles is explained not only by high effusion rates, but also by very low viscosities at the time of emplacement...|$|R
40|$|In the São Marcos (RS) and Antonio Prado (RS), the Serra Geral Formation exposes at {{the base}} basalts of pahoehoe type, coveredby basalts of the ´a´ā type. The first {{succession}} was generated by a low rate of eruption in a closed flow system allowed the flow toreach distances > 100 km of the source. T he ´a´ā lava flow types were generated by higher rates of eruption andt ransported in openchannels where rapid cooling prevented long distances from the source to be reached. The two types of basalts are low-TiO 2 tholeiiticand the morphology of flows {{is not related to}} variations in SiO 2 and MgO contents. Above these rock types outcrop acidic volcanicrocks geochemically of Caxias Group (Palmas Subgroup). Dimension stones extraction exposed the inner portions of the acidicfeeder dikes with vertical magmatic foliations. The lava domes have exogenous characteristics and horizontal foliations. We proposea model for the generation of domes involving the diapirically rise of acids magmas that become vesicular and more viscous, thatstop near the surface. New magmatic pulses extracted “pieces” of the vesicular fraction generating autobreccias in the conduit andvertical structures that extend laterally toward the surface organizing the lava domes with <b>vitrophyres</b> in the base and in the top, witha thin massive phaneritic core. Magmatic textures of the domes are typical of effusive units and the identification of the feeder dykesin the area allows the understanding of the emplacement process of acidic flows in the Serra Geral Formation...|$|R
40|$|We have {{conducted}} an investigation {{to determine the}} occurrence and distribution of erionite, a potential carcinogen, at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Using x-ray powder diffraction techniques yielding detection limits to below 0. 05 wt %, we positively identified erionite in only 3 out of 76 bulk and 12 fracture samples investigated. The three erionite-bearing samples (J 12 - 620 / 630, UE- 25 aNo. 1 - 1296. 2, and USW G 4 - 1314) all occur above the static water level in clay/zeolite-rich horizons {{near the top of}} <b>vitrophyres.</b> Erionite occurs as trace amounts of less than 1 wt % in the whole rock, although it may occur locally in significant amounts as fracture fillings (e. g., UE- 25 aNo. 1 - 1296. 2 where it comprises approximately 45 wt % of the fracture filling material). All three occurrences appear to be extremely isolated cases since erionite was not detected in neighboring samples. Erionite at Yucca Mountain apparently formed only in localized microenvironments, possibly restricted to fractures. Since erionite occurs in trace amounts only in extremely isolated instances, it should pose little or no health hazard to workers in the potential repository at Yucca Mountain or to the public. The amounts of erionite liberated to the biosphere should be negligible, particularly when compared with the amounts of erionite occurring naturally at the surface in Nevada and surrounding states. 24 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R
