40|$|Cross-species {{transmission}} and adaptation of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) to humans have {{given rise to}} human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) and type 2 (HIV- 2) were derived from SIVs that infected chimpanzee (SIVcpz) and sooty mangabey (SIVsm), respectively. The HIV- 1 restriction factor SAMHD 1 inhibits HIV- 1 infection in human myeloid cells and can be counteracted by the Vpx protein of HIV- 2 and the SIVsm lineage. However, HIV- 1 and its ancestor SIVcpz do not encode a Vpx protein and HIV- 1 has not evolved a mechanism to overcome SAMHD 1 -mediated restriction. Here we show that the co-evolution of primate SAMHD 1 and lentivirus Vpx leads to the loss of the <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> in SIVcpz and HIV- 1. We found evidence for positive selection of SAMHD 1 in orangutan, gibbon, rhesus macaque, and marmoset, but not in human, chimpanzee and gorilla that are natural hosts of Vpx-negative HIV- 1, SIVcpz and SIVgor, respectively, indicating that vpx drives the evolution of primate SAMHD 1. Ancestral host state reconstruction and temporal dynamic analyses suggest that the most recent common ancestor of SIVrcm, SIVmnd, SIVcpz, SIVgor and HIV- 1 was a SIV that had a vpx gene; however, the <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> of SIVcpz was lost approximately 3643 to 2969 years ago during the infection of chimpanzees. Thus, HIV- 1 could not inherit the lost <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> from its ancestor SIVcpz. The lack of Vpx in HIV- 1 results in restricted infection in myeloid cells that are important for antiviral immunity, which could contribute to the AIDS pandemic by escaping th...|$|E
40|$|The genomes of {{the four}} primate lentiviral groups are complex and contain several {{regulatory}} or accessory genes. Two of these genes, vpr and vpx, are found in various combinations within the four groups and encode proteins whose functions {{have yet to be}} elucidated. Comparison of the encoded protein sequences suggests that the <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> within the HIV- 2 group arose by the duplication of an ancestral vpr gene within this group. Evolutionary distance analysis showed that both genes were well conserved when compared with viral regulatory genes, and indicated that the duplication occurred at approximately {{the same time as the}} HIV- 2 group and the other primate lentivirus groups diverged from a common ancestor. Furthermore, although the SIVagm vpx proteins are homologous to the HIV- 2 group vpx proteins, there are insufficient grounds from sequence analysis for classifying them as vpx proteins. Because of their similarity to the vpr proteins of other groups, we suggest reclassifying the SIVagm <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> as a vpr gene. This creates a simpler and more uniform picture of the genomic organization of the primate lentiviruses and allows the genomic organization of their common precursor to be defined; it probably contained five accessory genes: tat, rev, vif, nef and vpr...|$|E
40|$|The <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> {{products}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 2 (HIV- 2) and of the closely related simian immunodeficiency viruses from sooty mangabeys (SIVsm) and macaques (SIVmac) comprise a 112 -amino-acid virion-associated protein that is critical for efficient virus replication in nondividing cells such as macrophages. When expressed {{in the absence of}} other viral proteins, Vpx localizes to the nuclear membrane {{as well as to the}} nucleus; however, in the context of virus replication Vpx is packaged into virions via interaction with the p 6 domain of the Gag precursor polyprotein (p 55 gag). To identify the domains essential for virion incorporation and nuclear localization, site-directed mutations were introduced into the <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> of SIVsmPBj 1. 9 and functionally analyzed. Our results show that (i) mutation of two highly conserved L 74 and I 75 residues impaired both virion incorporation and nuclear localization of Vpx; (ii) substitution of conserved H 82, G 86, C 87, P 103, and P 106 residues impaired Vpx nuclear localization but not virion incorporation; (iii) mutations of conserved Y 66, Y 69, and Y 71 residues impaired virion incorporation but not the translocation of Vpx to the nucleus; and (iv) a mutation at E 30 (predicted to disrupt an N-terminal α-helix) had no effect on either virion incorporation or nuclear localization of Vpx. Importantly, mutations in Vpx which impaired nuclear localization also reduced virus replication in macaque macrophages, suggesting an important role of the carboxyl terminus of Vpx in nuclear translocation of the viral preintegration complex. Analyzing this domain in greater detail, we identified a 26 -amino-acid (aa 60 to 85) fragment that was sufficient to mediate the transport of a heterologous protein (green fluorescent protein [GFP]) to the nucleus. Taken together, these results indicate that virion incorporation and nuclear localization are encoded by two partially overlapping domains in the C-terminus of Vpx (aa 60 to 112). The identification of a novel 26 -amino-acid nuclear targeting domain provides a new tool to investigate the nuclear import of the HIV- 2 /SIV preintegration complex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrimate {{lentivirus}} (HIV and SIV) vpr accessory genes encode 12 - to 14 -kDa proteins which induce {{cell cycle}} arrest at the G 2 phase of infected cells, {{preventing them from}} going through mitosis. Members of the HIV- 2 /SIVmac/SIVsmm group also encode a second closely related accessory protein called Vpx. Vpx and HIV Vpr are critical for virus replication in nondividing cells due to their participation in nuclear import of the preintegration complex. Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) and maedi visna virus are the natural lentiviruses of domestic goat and sheep, respectively, and their genomes do not carry vpr and <b>vpx</b> <b>genes.</b> In this study, we generated chimeric CAEV-based genomes carrying vpr and <b>vpx</b> <b>genes</b> from SIVmac 239 and tested their ability to induce G 2 cell cycle arrest in infected caprine cells. CAEV–pBSCAvpxvpr is the chimeric genome that was shown to be infectious and replication competent. Our data demonstrated that CAEV–pBSCAvpxvpr-infected goat synovial membrane cell monolayer developed more cytopathic effects and {{a high proportion of}} cells remained in the G 2 phase of cell cycle. This G 2 arrest was observed both at the early and at the late stages of infection, while minimal effect was observed with the parental CAEV–pBSCA. These results, described {{for the first time in}} mammalian cells other than those of primates, indicate that Vpr-induced G 2 cell cycle arrest is not restricted to only primate cells. Thus, conservation of Vpx/Vpr protein functions in caprine cells suggests a possible role for these proteins in the virus life cycle and its ability to adapt to new hosts. The data presented here thus raise a pertinent question about the biological significance of the conservation of Vpr and Vpx functions in caprine cells despite the high phylogenic distance between primates and small ruminants...|$|R

All four rhesus monkeys infected with the vpr deletion mutant showed an early spike in plasma antigenemia, maintained high virus burdens, exhibited declines in CD 4 + lymphocyte concentrations, and had significant changes in lymph node morphology, and two have died to date with AIDS. The behavior of the vpr deletion mutant was indistinguishable {{from that of the}} parental, wild-type virus. Rhesus monkeys infected with the vpx deletion mutant showed lower levels of plasma antigenemia, lower virus burdens, and delayed declines in CD 4 + lymphocyte concentrations but nonetheless progressed with AIDS to a terminal stage. The vpr+vpx double mutant was severely attenuated, with much lower virus burdens and no evidence of disease progression. These and other results indicate that vpr provides only a slight facilitating advantage for wild-type SIVmac replication in vivo.

40|$|Simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV), a lymphocytopathic lentivirus, induces an AIDS-like disease in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). A pathogenic molecular clone of rhesus macaque SIV (SIVmac), SIVmac- 239, replicates and induces cytopathology in T lymphocytes but is restricted for replication in macrophages. In contrast, a nonpathogenic molecular clone of SIVmac, SIVmac- 1 A 11, replicates and induces syncytia (multinucleated giant cells) in cultures of both T lymphocytes and macrophages. SIVmac- 1 A 11 {{does not cause}} disease in macaques. To map the viral determinants of macrophage tropism, reciprocal recombinant genomes were constructed between molecular clones of SIVmac- 239 and SIVmac- 1 A 11. Infectious recombinant viruses were rescued by transfection of cloned viral genomes into permissive lymphoid cells. Analysis of one pair of reciprocal recombinants revealed that an internal 6. 2 -kb DNA fragment of SIVmac- 1 A 11 was necessary and sufficient for both syncytium formation and efficient replication in macrophages. This region includes the coding sequences {{for a portion of}} the gag gene, all of the pol, vif, vpr, and <b>vpx</b> <b>genes,</b> the first coding exons of tat and rev, and the external env glycoprotein gp 130. Thus, the transmembrane glycoprotein of env, the nef gene, the second coding exons of tat and rev, and the long terminal repeats are not essential for in vitro macrophage tropism. Analysis of additional recombinants revealed that syncytium formation, but not virus production, was controlled by a 1. 4 -kb viral DNA fragment in SIVmac- 1 A 11 encoding only the external env glycoprotein gp 130. Thus, gp 130 env of SIVmac- 1 A 11 is necessary for entry of virus into macrophages but is not sufficient for a complete viral replication cycle in this cell type. We therefore conclude that gp 130 env and one or more genetic elements (exclusive of the long terminal repeats, transmembrane glycoprotein of env, and second coding exons of tat and rev, and nef) are essential for a complete replication cycle of SIVmac in rhesus macaque macrophages...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe human SAMHD 1 protein {{potently}} restricts lentiviral {{infection in}} dendritic cells and monocyte/macrophages but is antagonized by the primate lentiviral protein Vpx, which targets SAMHD 1 for degradation. However, {{only two of}} eight primate lentivirus lineages encode Vpx, whereas its paralog, Vpr, is conserved across all extant primate lentiviruses. We find that not only multiple Vpx but also some Vpr proteins are able to degrade SAMHD 1, and such antagonism led to dramatic positive selection of SAMHD 1 in the primate subfamily Cercopithecinae. Residues that have evolved under positive selection precisely determine sensitivity to Vpx/Vpr degradation and alter binding specificity. By overlaying these functional analyses on a phylogenetic framework of Vpr and Vpx evolution, we can decipher the chronology of acquisition of SAMHD 1 -degrading abilities in lentiviruses. We conclude that vpr neofunctionalized to degrade SAMHD 1 even prior {{to the birth of}} a separate <b>vpx</b> <b>gene,</b> thereby initiating an evolutionary arms race with SAMHD 1...|$|E
40|$|HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 {{are members}} of the {{lentivirus}} subfamily. These retroviruses are approximately 50 % related at the nucleotide level (1, 2). A major difference in their genetic organization is that vpu, an accessory gene, is unique to HIV- 1 (3), while the <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> is found only in HIV- 2 (4, 5). Of the two viruses, HIV- 1 is the more widely distributed, accounting for approximately 95 % of all HIV infections worldwide. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences from globally circulating strains of HIV reveal a great deal of genetic diversity. Sequence analyses have shown not only that there is genom-ic heterogeneity between the various strains worldwide, but also that the diversity is unevenly dis-tributed throughout the HIV- 1 genome (2). Furthermore, intrapatient isolates have less diversity than interpatient isolates, but even within a single individual replicating viruses can differ as much as 10 % at the nucleotide level (1, 2, 6).

The target for the invariable part of these oligonucleotides, 5 '-GGAGGGGGAGG- 3 ', is found in a highly conserved 20 bp long purine/pyrimidine tract of the <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> of the SIV and HIV- 2 viruses and could be a target for oligonucleotide directed antivirus therapy. Here were report on the ability of four purine oligonucleotides with different lengths (11 -, 14 -, 17 - and 20 -mer) to form triplexes with the purine/pyrimidine stretch of the <b>vpx</b> <b>gene.</b> Triplex formation was tested by joint dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprint, gel-retardation assay, circular dichroism (CD) and UV-melting studies. Dimethyl sulfate footprint studies revealed the antiparallel orientation of the third strand to the purine strand of the Watson-Crick duplex. However, the protection of the guanines at the ends of the target sequence decreased as the length of the third strand oligonucleotide increased. Melting temperature studies provided profiles with only one transition for all of the triplexes. The melting temperatures of the triplexes were found to be the same as for the targeted duplex {{in the case of the}} 11 - and 14 -mer third strands while for the 17 - and 20 -mer third strands the melting temperature of the triplexes were correspondingly 4 and 8 degrees C higher than for the duplex. Heating and cooling melting curves were reversible for all of the tested triplexes except one with the 20 -mer third strand oligonucleotide. Circular dichroism spectra showed the ability of the target DNA to adopt an A-like DNA conformation. Upon triplex formation the A-DNA form becomes even more pronounced. This effect depends on the length of the third strand oligonucleotide: the CD spectrum shows a 'classical' A-DNA shape with the 20 -mer. This is not observed with the purine/pyrimidine stretch of the HIV- 1 DNA which keeps a B-like spectrum even after triplex formation. We suggest, that an A-like duplex DNA is required for the formation of a stable DNA purine(purine-pyrimidine) triplex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The genomes {{of human}} and simian {{immunodeficiency}} viruses (HIV and SIV) encode the gag, pol and env genes and contain at least six supplementary open reading frames termed tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpx and vpu.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Restriction {{factors are}} {{components}} of the innate immune defense against viral pathogens. They inhibit viral replication by operating as molecular barriers to steps of the viral life cycle, and viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract these blocks. The restriction factor SAMHD 1 prevents lentiviruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus and the related Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) from replicating in myeloid cells and resting T-cells. Many lineages of lentiviruses, including HIV- 2 and other SIVs, encode accessory proteins Vpr or Vpx that serve to abrogate host SAMHD 1 restriction by causing degradation of the antiviral factor. Selective pressure for the host to escape infection and for the virus to persist result in the rapid evolution of SAMHD 1 to escape viral antagonism, characteristic of a molecular arms race between host and virus. In contrast to other well-studied restriction factors, only a subset of extant lentiviruses antagonize SAMHD 1. This trait evolved in one ancient ancestor of a subset of modern viruses, but was lost in SIV that infects chimpanzees, the viral precedent of HIV- 1. Thus, HIV- 1 that founded the pandemic {{does not have a}} method of SAMHD 1 antagonism. To address the questionable necessity of SAMHD 1 antagonism, I examined viral adaptation to SAMHD 1 polymorphism occurring in naturally infected primates. I show that SAMHD 1 antagonism must be important for viral fitness because viruses have adapted to distinct SAMHD 1 variants present in their primate host population. I further examined the molecular basis of lentiviral adaptation to degrade SAMHD 1 by mapping species-specificity in SAMHD 1 antagonism by the viral proteins Vpr and Vpx. I show that despite high sequence diversity in vpr and <b>vpx</b> <b>genes</b> and divergent SAMHD 1 targeting, Vpr and Vpx evolution is constrained by the need to bind the host ubiquitin ligase machinery used to cause SAMHD 1 degradation. Capitalizing on this conservation and a structure of one crystallized Vpx protein, I designed chimeric Vpr and Vpx proteins and mapped specificity of Vpx of the SIVsmm/mac / HIV- 2 lineages to two discrete regions of Vpx. I propose a model to explain how viral antagonists adapt to bind rapidly escaping targets while maintaining their function. Due to extensive and conserved interaction with a host ubiquitin ligase protein, the sequence available for Vpx and Vpr to bind target SAMHD 1 is limited to dedicated regions which are evolutionary and structurally flexible, allowing sampling of great molecular diversity to reestablish target binding without compromising antagonist function and overall structure...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of a <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> distinguishes HIV- 2 from HIV- 1, the main causative agent of AIDS. Vpx degrades the restriction factor SAMHD 1 to boost HIV- 2 infection of macrophages and dendritic cells {{and it has been}} suggested that the activation of antiviral innate immune responses after Vpx-dependent infection of myeloid cells may explain why most HIV- 2 -infected individuals efficiently control viral replication and become long-term survivors. However, the role of Vpx-mediated SAMHD 1 antagonism in the virological and clinical outcome of HIV- 2 infection remained to be investigated. Results: Here, we analyzed the anti-SAMHD 1 activity of vpx alleles derived from seven viremic and four long-term aviremic HIV- 2 -infected individuals. We found that effective Vpx-mediated SAMHD 1 degradation and enhancement of myeloid cell infection was preserved in most HIV- 2 -infected individuals including all seven that failed to control the virus and developed AIDS. The only exception were vpx alleles from an aviremic individual that predicted a M 68 K change in a highly conserved nuclear localization signal which disrupted the ability of Vpx to counteract SAMHD 1. We also found that HIV- 2 is less effective than HIV- 1 in inducing innate immune activation in dendritic cells.

Our attempts to elucidate its molecular pathogenesis through DNA copy-number analysis by genome-wide digital karyotyping and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays identified a dramatic focal amplification on chromosome 1 q 32 in 4 of 57 GBM tumors. Quantitative real-time PCR measurements revealed that HDMX is the most commonly amplified and overexpressed gene in the 1 q 32 locus. Further genetic screening of 284 low- and high-grade gliomas revealed that HDMX amplifications occur solely in pediatric and adult GBMs and that they are mutually exclusive of TP 53 mutations and MDM 2 amplifications. Here, we demonstrate that HDMX regulates p 53 to promote GBM growth and attenuates tumor response to chemotherapy. In GBM cells, HDMX overexpression inhibits p 53 -mediated transcriptional activation of p 21, releases cells from G 0 to G 1 phase, and enhances cellular proliferation. HDMX overexpression does not affect the expression of PUMA and BAX proapoptotic genes. While in GBM cells treated with the chemotherapeutic agent 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU), HDMX appears to stabilize p 53 and promote phosphorylation of the DNA double-stranded break repair protein H 2 AX, up-regulate the DNA repair <b>gene</b> <b>VPX,</b> stimulate DNA repair, and confer resistance to BCNU.

Despite the genetic relationship to SIVcpz in the pol gene, SIVrcmNG 411 did not replicate in chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), although two other viruses unrelated to SIVcpz, SIVmndGB 1 (from mandrills) and SIVlhoest (from L'Hoest monkeys), were able to grow in chimpanzee PBMC.

Importantly, our epidemiological studies indicate a high prevalence of both types of SIVmnd; all 10 sexually mature wild-living monkeys and 3 out of 17 wild-born juveniles tested were infected. The geographic distribution of SIVmnd seems to be distinct for the two types: SIVmnd- 1 viruses were exclusively identified in mandrills from central and southern Gabon, whereas SIVmnd- 2 viruses were identified in monkeys from northern and western Gabon, as well as in Cameroon. SIVmnd- 2 full-length sequence analysis, together with analysis of partial sequences from SIVmnd- 1 and SIVmnd- 2 from wild-born or wild-living mandrills, shows that the gag and pol regions of SIVmnd- 2 are closest to those of SIVrcm, isolated from red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus), while the env gene is closest to that of SIVmnd- 1. pol and env sequence analyses of SIV from a related Papionini species, the drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus), shows a closer relationship of SIVdrl to SIVmnd- 2 than to SIVmnd- 1. Epidemiological surveys of human immunodeficiency virus revealed a case in Cameroon of a human infected by a virus serologically related to SIVmnd, raising the possibility that mandrills represent a viral reservoir for humans similar to sooty mangabeys in Western Africa and chimpanzees in Central Africa...|$|E
40|$|HIV- 2 is a {{contemporary}} human retrovirus {{with the majority}} of infections localised to West Africa. Both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 are able to cause AIDS; however, in contrast to HIV- 1 infection, a common outcome following HIV- 2 infection (∼ 37 % of patients in this study cohort) is long-term non-progression (LTNP), where patients remain aviraemic and asymptomatic in the absence of treatment, often for decades. HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 both arose following zoonotic transmission of SIVs from non-human primates at around the beginning of the 20 th century and when patients develop AIDS caused by HIV- 2 infection, it is clinically indistinguishable from AIDS following HIV- 1 infection. Whilst the estimated number of HIV- 2 infections remains small {{in the context of the}} global HIV pandemic (HIV- 2 ∼ 2 million, HIV- 1 group M ∼ 75 million), the differences in pathogenicity between these two viruses has been a source of great interest, particularly the features of LTNPs that allow control of viral replication in the absence of anti-retroviral treatment. The studies described in this thesis were carried out using samples collected from a well-characterised longitudinal community cohort in Caió, Guinea-Bissau. Chapter 3 of this thesis presents an investigation into the variation and evolution present in the HIV- 2 specific accessory <b>gene</b> <b>vpx.</b> The data showed significantly increased signals of positive selection pressure in vpx in viraemic when compared to non-viraemic patients and also allowed the identification of novel variations at high frequencies (up to 22 %) in this cohort that were previously un-described. Chapters 4 and 5 present a novel application of shotgun RNA sequencing (RNA- Seq) to HIV ex vitro and ex vivo samples. Chapter 4 demonstrates the divergence seen in a cultured viral isolate at the level of the whole genome, in the absence of many of the biases typically involved in sequencing of RNA viruses. Chapter 5 further extends this method to show the applicability of using RNA-Seq on primary patient HIV samples for the first time. Analysis of diversity estimates over the whole genome in the context of a low bias sequencing method show a high level of diversity in HIV- 2 pol and low diversity in vpx. The aim of this work was to combine traditional and novel sequencing methods to facilitate assessment of the variation and evolution acting on vpx and to generate an accurate picture of the genetic diversity over the whole genome of HIV- 2. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Vpr gene {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 and type 2 (HIV- 1, HIV- 2) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) encodes a small nuclear protein which is virion-associated and assists nuclear transport of the preintegration complex. Expression of HIV- 1 Vpr {{has been shown to}} induce differentiation and prevent proliferation of human cells. HIV- 1 Vpr has also been shown to arrest cell growth and cause morphological defects in yeast. In contrast, the <b>Vpx</b> <b>gene</b> of HIV- 2 and SIV, which shares sequence homology with Vpr, does not seem to inhibit proliferation of human cells. It has been suggested that the cell cycle arrest effect of Vpr and Vpx is species and cell-type dependent. In this study, we have taken advantage of a conditional expression system to characterize the growth inhibitory effects of Vpr and Vpx of HIV- 1, HIV- 2, and SIV in the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe. Our results show that both Vpr and/or Vpx of HIV- 1, HIV- 2, and SIV arrest cell growth inS. pombe,and HIV- 1 Vpr is more cytotoxic than HIV- 2 or SIV Vpr or Vpx. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that yeast cells cease proliferating with DNA contents indicative of arrest in G 1 and G 2, with some cells showing signs of overreplication of DNA. While the observed cell cycle arrest phenotype was not identical to that observed in mammalian cells, there were similarities of growth arrest phenotype caused by Vpr and Vpx in yeast and mammalian cells. Specifically, the observation that yeast and mammalians cell both arrest in G 2 with reduced p 34 /cdc 2 kinase activity indicates that Vpr and Vpx interact with conserved target(s) in yeast and mammalian cells. The ability to use genetic analysis to elucidate the mechanisms involved makesS. pombean excellent model system in which to study the effects of Vpr and Vpx on cellular function...|$|E
40|$|G,A-containing purine oligonucleotides {{of various}} lengths form {{extremely}} stable and specific triplexes with the purine-pyrimidine {{stretch of the}} <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> [Svinarchuk,F., Monnot,M., Merle,A., Malvy,C. and Fermandjian,S. (1995) Nucleic Acids Res., 22, 3742 [...] 3747]. The potential application of triple-helix-forming oligonucleotides (TFO) in gene-targeted therapy has prompted us to study triplex formation mimicking potassium concentrations and temperatures in cells. Triplex formation was tested by dimethyl sulphate (DMS) footprinting, gel-retardation, UV melting studies and electron microscopy. In the presence of 10 mM MgCl 2, KCl concentrations up to 150 mM significantly lowered both efficiency (triplex : initial duplex) and rate constants of triplex formation. The KCl effect was more pronounced for 11 mer and 20 mer TFOs than for 14 mer TFO. Since the dissociation half-life for the 11 mer TFO decreases from 420 min {{in the absence of}} monovalent cations to 40 min in the presence of 150 mM KCI, we suggest that the negative effect could be explained by a decrease in triplex stability. In contrast, for the 20 mer TFO no dissociation of the triplex was observed during 24 h of incubation either in the absence of monovalent cations or in the presence of 150 mM KCl. We suppose {{that in the case of}} the 20 mer TFO the negative effect of KCI on triplex formation is probably due to the self-association of the oligonucleotide in competitive structures such as parallel duplexes and/or tetraplexes. This negative effect may be overcome by the prior formation of a short duplex either on the 3 '- or 5 '-end of the 20 mer TFO. We refer to these partial duplexes as 'zipper' TFOs. It was demonstrated that a 'zipper' TFO can form a triplex over the full length of the target, thus unzipping the short complementary strand. The minimal single-stranded part of the 'zipper' oligonucleotide which is sufficient to initiate triplex formation can be as short as three nucleotides at the 3 '-end and six nucleotides at the 5 '-end. We suggest that this type of structure may prove useful for in vivo applications...|$|E
40|$|Studies of viral {{accessory}} genes have progressed {{in order}} to understand pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutics and vaccines. For human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1), one such gene receiving special focus is vpr. Vpr has been implicated in dysregulation of host cellular events (including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis), infection of non-dividing cells, and increased viral replication in infected T cells. In simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a similar gene is seen in a slightly different form, including vpr as well as a duplicate, vpx. In SIV, these two genes have been shown to split the functions of HIV- 1 vpr. In order to use SIV as a model for HIV- 1, it must be determined which SIV gene is responsible for mediation of different functional effects. HIV- 1 vpr has been shown to downmodulate surface markers on dendritic cells and alter cytokine environments in vivo. Studies have shown that HIV- 1 vpr pushes natural killer cells into anergy, rendering them non-functional. Results presented in this study indicate SIV infection also results in these effects, but responsibility for these effects is split between SIV vpr and vpx. The <b>vpx</b> <b>gene</b> appears {{to play a role in}} downmodulation of surface receptors on dendritic cells and changes the cytokine environment within the dendritic cells. The vpr gene, however, appears to be responsible for decreased functionality of NK cells, leading to a non-functional anergic state. These findings suggest SIV vpx and vpr cause similar effects compared to HIV- 1 vpr and, as expected, the SIV genes split the functions of their HIV- 1 homolog. Statement of Public Health Relevance: HIV infection and disease is a growing epidemic and it has become increasingly apparent that in vitro studies are not sufficient to provide the data needed to create an effective vaccine. Because vaccine research cannot be performed on human subjects, the best mode for transition would be a shift to in vivo studies on non-human primates using SIV as a model for HIV- 1 infection and disease. Before this can be adopted, it will be necessary to show HIV- 1 and SIV have similar effects in vitro on immune cells and can be used interchangeably...|$|E
