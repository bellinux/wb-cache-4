It would then be possible to operate 10-car trains <b>via</b> <b>the</b> line and it would also be possible to operate full express service <b>via</b> <b>the</b> line's center express track. The trains operating via Nassau Street would go to Brooklyn <b>via</b> <b>the</b> Montague Tunnel. During non-rush hours trains would terminate at Broad Street. There would be a passageway built from Grand Central via 43rd Street to Second Avenue to permit transfers.|$|E
