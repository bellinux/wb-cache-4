When the stress is released, the material gradually relaxes to its undeformed state. At constant stress (creep), the Model is quite realistic as it predicts strain to tend to σ/E as time continues to infinity. Similar to the Maxwell model, the Kelvin-Voigt model also has limitations. The model is extremely good with modelling creep in materials, but with regards to relaxation the model is much less accurate.|$|E

Three general areas have been discussed, namely material properties, analytical procedures, and criteria for mechanical failure. This particular report is devoted to a more detailed examination of the properties of a filled viscoelastic resin, and their representation by appropriate mechanical models. In addition, a comparison of two methods of computing <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>strains</b> in a pressurized cylinder is presented. In the category of material properties, linear viscoelastic model theory is reviewed, and certain important relations among sets of experimental data are deduced. A justification {{for the application of}} this theory is provided by the analytic representation of available dynamic data in terms of a well-known distribution function. Since the inception of this work additional experimental data on propellants has become available. In the category of analytical procedures, the usual approach of representing material properties by a four-element model, as determined from the dynamic data in a limited frequency range, is compared with the more sophisticated Fourier transform method in which the entire frequency range is utilized. The two approaches are applied to calculate the <b>viscoelastic</b> hoop <b>strain</b> at the inner boundary of an internally pressurized infinitely long hollow cylinder subjected to a ramp-type pressure pulse. In this example, the dilatation is assumed elastic or frequency independent and the distortion viscoelastic. In the following quarter, primary effort will be devoted to the determination of a criterion for mechanical failure of propellants. Two steps are involved. One is the analytical representation of ultimate strain as a function of temperature on strain rate by means of a mechanical model. In addition to the usual distribution of relaxation (or retardation) times, this model will be supplied with a distribution of ultimate strain. Step two involves the choice of a suitable criterion for compounding ultimate strain or ultimate stress components into a single parameter, which, when exceeded at a given rate and temperature, denotes the onset of fracture or mechanical failure...|$|R

For structural thickness design against fatigue cracking, the material response is typically {{assumed to be}} linear elastic to simplify the calculation of the critical horizontal strain {{at the bottom of}} the asphalt layer. An asphalt modulus representing the response of the materials under average conditions for both temperature and traffic speed is generally adopted in the simplified pavement model. This paper presents a method to determine an equivalent asphalt modulus (EAM) for the asphalt layer. The EAM, when used in the linear elastic analysis of a pavement, will result in a resilient response in terms of the critical strain criterion that is equivalent to the response of that structure when calculated using viscoelastic modeling. The methodology of this paper included a qualitative comparison of the EAM approach with published field results. Two thick asphalt pavement configurations representative of typical French pavement designs were considered in this paper. Results showed expected trends of the equivalent asphalt modulus with changes in traffic speed and temperature. The application of time-temperature superposition principle allowed building pseudo-master curves for the EAM dataset.

40|$|Glass fiber {{reinforced}} thermoplastics {{are widely}} used in structural applications because of their high stiffness and failure stress. However, controlling their complex mechanical behavior must rely on numerical simulations. The main outcome of this thesis is an original mean-field approach predicting the mechanical response of fibre reinforced thermoplastics under arbitrary loading paths. The model accounts for the volume fraction and the orientations of fibers {{as well as the}} viscoelastic- viscoplastic (VE-VP) character of the surrounding matrix. The matrix response is described in terms of a coupled VE-VP model suitable for multi-axial strains. The total strain is the sum of viscoelastic and viscoplastic parts, and the Cauchy stress is computed by assuming linear viscoelasticity and relying on a Boltzmann integral of the history of <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>strains.</b> An efficient and robust time-integration algorithm is developed, implemented in a numerical code and studied. In order to evaluate the composite's behavior, an affine linearization procedure is proposed for the coupled VE-VP model. This formulation leads to an incremental constitutive relation in the time domain which is form-similar to linear thermo-elasticity. Hence, existing homogenization models for linear thermoelastic composites can be applied.

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} data treatment is introduced to manage with the tensile test responses of highly non-linear viscoelastic solids such as solid propellants. This treatment allows {{the representation of}} a set of strain–stress curves by a single intrinsic non-linear response which is found independent of the experimental conditions of rate and temperature.

It is believed that the existence of such a <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>strain</b> measure is the characteristic feature of non-linear viscoelasticity. To confer some generality to the principle, the validity is also checked for volumetric and multiaxial stress response of solid propellant.

40|$|Risk of {{low back}} {{disorders}} (LBD) {{is related to}} spinal posture with greater risk reported in flexed and asymmetric trunk positions. Spinal posture, including trunk position and lumbar lordosis, influences spinal load and stability.

Current measurement demonstrated error in spinal reposition sense was increased in flexed trunk positions but was not found to change significantly with trunk asymmetry. Reposition sense error was also found to be reduced in more kyphotic flexed postures (relative to more lordotic flexed postures) possibly due to position sense feedback from ligamentous strain. This research suggests that {{it may be difficult to}} control spinal curvature in flexed positions, leading to an increased risk of injury.

The attention was focused on the shear yielding plastic deformation process and different loading histories were performed under uniaxial compression: constant strain rate at different rates, stress relaxation at different applied strain levels, creep under different stress levels. Some tests were also carried out under shear loading, in which the hydrostatic stress component is equal to zero and its effect on the yield onset can be considered. For the definition of a yield criterion, different quantities, some already proposed in an analogous work on a styrene- acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN), were considered and determined at yield onset for each of the applied loading histories.

The objective {{of this research is}} to separate viscoplasticity and viscofracture from viscoelasticity so that the permanent deformation and fracture of the asphalt mixtures can be individually and accurately characterized without the influence of viscoelasticity. The undamaged properties of 16 asphalt mixtures that have two binder types, two air void contents, and two aging conditions are first obtained by conducting nondestructive creep tests and nondestructive dynamic modulus tests. Testing results are analyzed by using the linear viscoelastic theory in which the creep compliance and the relaxation modulus are modeled by the Prony model. The dynamic modulus and phase angle of the undamaged asphalt mixtures remained constant with the load cycles. The undamaged asphalt mixtures are then used to perform the destructive dynamic modulus tests in which the dynamic modulus and phase angle of the damaged asphalt mixtures vary with load cycles. This indicates plastic evolution and crack propagation. The growth of cracks is signaled principally by the increase of the phase angle, which occurs only in the tertiary stage. The measured total strain is successfully decomposed into elastic strain, <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>strain,</b> plastic strain, viscoplastic strain, and viscofracture strain by employing the pseudostrain concept and the extended elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle. The separated viscoplastic strain uses a predictive model to characterize the permanent deformation.

Because of this behavior, steady state passive force in detrusor is not constant for a given muscle length and can be adjusted by an intracellular mechanism. Thus, passive detrusor exhibits adjustable passive stiffness. Existing three-component mechanical models for muscle, the Kelvin and Voigt, are insufficient to display this characteristic. The goal of this thesis {{is to develop a}} new biomechanical model for passive force in detrusor by adding additional elements to the Kelvin or Voigt models. Eight mechanical characteristics of detrusor are identified from the literature and with three new experiments, and a novel adjustable passive stiffness model for smooth muscle is proposed. Simulations are performed to demonstrate that the model qualitatively exhibits each of the eight tissue characteristics...|$|R
