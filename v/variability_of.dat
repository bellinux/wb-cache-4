40|$|The {{emission}} {{from black}} hole binaries (BHBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) displays significant aperiodic variabilities. The most promising explanation for these variabilities is the propagating {{fluctuations in the}} accretion flow. It is natural to expect that the mechanism driving variabilities in BHBs and AGNs may operate in a black hole hyper-accretion disk, which is believed to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We study the <b>variabilities</b> <b>of</b> jet power in GRBs based {{on the model of}} propagating fluctuations. It is found that the <b>variabilities</b> <b>of</b> jet power and the temporal profile of erratic spikes in this scenario are similar to those in observed light curves of prompt gamma-ray emission of GRBs. Our results show that the mechanism driving X-ray variabilities in BHBs and AGNs may operate in the central engine to drive the <b>variabilities</b> <b>of</b> GRBs.

5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the opposite direction in the fall.

40|$|Received; {{accepted}} Aims. In {{some of the}} lensed quasars, color {{differences between}} multiple images are observed at optical/near-infrared wavelengths. There are three possible origins of the color differences: intrinsic <b>variabilities</b> <b>of</b> quasars, differential dust extinction, and quasar microlensing. We examine how these three possible scenarios can reproduce the observed chromaticity. Methods. We evaluate how much color difference between multiple images can be reproduced by the above three possible scenarios with realistic models; (i) an empirical relation for intrinsic <b>variabilities</b> <b>of</b> quasars, (ii) empirical relations for dust extinction and theoretically predicted inhomogeneity in galaxies, or (iii) a theoretical model for quasar accretion disks and magnification patterns {{in the vicinity of}} caustics. Results. We find that intrinsic <b>variabilities</b> <b>of</b> quasars cannot be a dominant source responsible for observed chromatic features in multiple quasars. In contrast, either dust extinction or quasar microlensing can nicely reproduce the observed color differences between multiple images in most of the lensed quasars. Taking into account the time interval between observations at different wavebands in our estimations, quasar microlensing is a more realistic scenario to reproduce the observed color differences than dust extinction. All the observed color differences presented in this paper can be explained by a combination of these two effects, but monitoring observations at multiple wavebands are necessary to disentangle these...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Commonly used {{measures}} of traffic bursti-ness do not capture the fluctuation <b>of</b> traffic <b>variability</b> {{over the entire}} range of time scales. In this paper, we present a measure <b>of</b> <b>variability,</b> called the Index of Vari-ability (Hvτ), that fully and accurately captures the degree <b>of</b> <b>variability</b> (burstiness) <b>of</b> a typical network traffic process at each time scale and is analytically tractable for many traffic models. As an illustration, we derive the closed-form expression of Hvτ for two traditional traffic models and generate a variety of 2 D and 3 D Index <b>of</b> <b>Variability</b> curves. These curves demonstrate that the Index <b>of</b> <b>Variability</b> is a mathematically rigorous measure which can be used to fully characterize the complexities of the network traffic variability over all time scales. We then introduce a practical method for estimating the Index <b>of</b> <b>Variability</b> curve from a given traffic trace. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the robustness of the method applied to the estimation of the Index <b>of</b> <b>Variability</b> curves from 12 NLANR network traffic long traces.
