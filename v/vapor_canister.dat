25|$|The {{prototype}} car, SP 618000 {{was turned}} out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had filler caps located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the <b>vapor</b> <b>canister</b> during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.|$|E

The target is to prevent issues with vapor pressure build up and fuel spill to <b>vapor</b> <b>canister,</b> operating {{as early as possible}} in the design process. CFD simulations have been used to assess the accuracy of bench tests compared to road tests and the work goes on to perform predictive analysis. A new test bench has been developed, based on FIAT specification and experience, which allows to simulate vehicle accelerations using a combination of tank motion and tilt on all axes. Numerical tests have been performed which confirms the validity of the test approach. Accelerometric measurements have confirmed the substantial equivalence. Additional numerical analyses have been performed to explore fluid dynamic inside the tank, targeted to evolve the CFD approach into a design validation and optimization tool...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper and}} {{presentation}} focus on subsurface vapor data collected {{as part of}} a vapor intrusion assessment where tetrachlorothene (PCE) is the principal volatile organic compound of interest. In support of this assessment, we have conducted soil gas sampling and analysis to aid in identifying and delineating the presence of PCE in soil fill and residual silt-clay saprolite soils derived from in-place weathering of siltstone bedrock. During the assessment, we collected soil gas samples from temporary points, which were advanced using hand-operated Geoprobe® direct push rods to depths ranging from 2 to 7 feet below ground surface. Grab samples were collected using the Geoprobe® post-run tubing (PRT) system into evacuated glass vials, which were later analyzed off-site. Following vial collection and retrieval of the Geoprobe® rods, several sampling locations were completed with permanent soil gas monitoring implants constructed using stainless steel screen and tubing, and backfilled using a glass bead pack overlaid by bentonite chips. Several weeks later, we collected soil gas samples from the monitoring implants using Summa canisters. Despite the differences between sampling techniques, time and duration of sampling, and volume of the samples, PCE concentrations measured in vial and canister samples are remarkably comparable, generally exhibiting order of magnitude agreement. With some limitations, the results suggest that vial sampling {{can be used as a}} complementary method to conduct subsurface <b>vapor</b> surveys. <b>Canister</b> samples collected from the vapor implants on a bimonthly basis illustrate the effects of seasonal variability and underline the importance of monitoring over a period of time under different seasonal conditions to support a rigorous assessment of vapor intrusion potential...|$|R
5000|$|The March 29 riot {{occurred}} after Arizona had lost to Wisconsin by {{one point in}} overtime. Several Hundred people spilled {{out onto the street}} from bars and restaurants and congregated on University Boulevard, only to be met by 60 to 70 riot police who had been standing in the street since before the game had started. Media reports indicate that fans were at first peaceful before some fans began throwing cans and bottles at police. Police asked fans {{to move out of the}} street with a megaphone. After initial warnings store managers asked customers to leave their restaurants and bars. After police had obtained approval to declare an unlawful assembly, they formed a skirmish line and identified themselves as police officers though a megaphone. Soon later, after five minutes for a period of about 40-50 minutes police ordered that fans disperse the unlawful assembly [...] "in the name of the state of Arizona." [...] While some fans left, many refused to leave and began chanting [...] "Fuck the Police." [...] Fans then started throwing firecrackers at police. Police responded with 9 OC <b>Vapor</b> Aerosol <b>Canisters</b> to control the crowd, but the canisters had little affect as the crowd continued to throw objects at police and become more violent toward police. The crowd then began chanting [...] "Police Brutality." [...] Police reminded rioters that the gathering had been declared an unlawful gathering that they were ordered to leave. Next, police responded by shooting about 200 pepper ball rounds, two Arwen Rounds, and 4 foam baton rounds at fans which created a distance between officers and fans that ultimately broke up the crowd. During the exchange of non-lethal fire, police arrested 15 people, 14 of which they released later that night. No injuries where reported and the only property damage came from a knocked down street sign. Charges included unlawful assembly, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{adaptive}} control of time delay systems with applications to automotive control problems. The stabilization of systems involving time delays is a difficult problem since {{the existence of a}} delay may induce instability or poor performance for the closed loop system. A unique approach for controlling systems with known time delay was originated by Otto Smith in the 1950 s by compensating for the delayed output using input values stored over a time window of [t - [tau], t] and estimating the plant output using a model of the plant. Later, this idea was extended to include unstable plants as well, using finite-time integrals of the delayed input values thereby avoiding unstable pole-zero cancellations that may occur in Smith's controller. Adaptive versions of these delay compensating controllers were also developed with rather complicated adaptive rules which might not be practical to use in real applications. In this thesis, a simpler adaptive version of delay compensating controllers is developed, which has adaptive rules that are easily implementable and thus suitable for real life implementations. The developed controller is tested in two important automotive control problems that are idle speed control (ISC) and fuel-to-air ratio (FAR) control. These two applications, ISC and FAR control, constitute the experimental part of this research. In ISC, the objective is to regulate the engine speed to a prescribed set-point in the presence of accessory load torque disturbances such as due to air conditioning and power steering. The adaptive controller, integrated with the existing proportional spark controller, is used to drive the electronic throttle actuator. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrating the performance improvement by employing the adaptive controller are presented. Modifications and improvements to the controller structure, which were developed during the course of experimentation to solve specific problems, are also presented. In addition, the potential for the reduction in calibration time and effort which can be achieved with our approach is discussed. (cont.)
