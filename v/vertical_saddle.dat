The movement of vertical alloy saddle is solved by ball screw. The solution could be improved by replacing the ball screw by linear motor. This will dramatically improve {{the dynamics of the}} movement of the <b>vertical</b> <b>saddle.</b> In addition, if the weight is compensated by pneumatic relief and the construction is welded, the dynamics will further improve...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the study was to {{establish}} the link between the <b>saddle</b> <b>vertical</b> force and its determinants in order to establish the strategies that could trigger the sit–stand transition. We hypothesized that the minimum <b>saddle</b> <b>vertical</b> force would be a critical parameter influencing the sit–stand transition during cycling. Twenty-five non-cyclists were asked to pedal at six different power outputs from 20 % (1. 6 ± 0. 3 W kg− 1) to 120 % (9. 6 ± 1. 6 W kg− 1) of their spontaneous sit–stand transition power obtained at 90 rpm. Five 6 -component sensors (saddle tube, pedals and handlebars) and a full-body kinematic reconstruction were used to provide the <b>saddle</b> <b>vertical</b> force and other force components (trunk inertial force, hips and shoulders reaction forces, and trunk weight) linked to the <b>saddle</b> <b>vertical</b> force. Minimum <b>saddle</b> <b>vertical</b> force linearly decreased with power output by 87 % from a static position on the bicycle (5. 30 ± 0. 50 N kg− 1) to power output= 120 % of the sit–stand transition power (0. 68 ± 0. 49 N kg− 1). This decrease was mainly explained by the increase in instantaneous pedal forces from 2. 84 ± 0. 58 N kg− 1 to 6. 57 ± 1. 02 N kg− 1 from 20 % to 120 % of the power output corresponding to the sit–stand transition, causing an increase in hip vertical forces from − 0. 17 N kg− 1 to 3. 29 N kg− 1. The emergence of strategies aiming at counteracting the elevation of the trunk (handlebars and pedals pulling) coincided with the spontaneous sit–stand transition power. The present data suggest that the large decrease in minimum <b>saddle</b> <b>vertical</b> force observed at high pedal reaction forces might trigger the sit–stand transition in cycling...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{hypothesized}} that the <b>saddle</b> <b>vertical</b> force would be a critical parameter to explain the sit-to-stand transition during cycling. A specific incremental {{test was used to}} determine the power at which the participants would spontaneously transit to the standing position (i. e., the Sit-to-Stand Transition Power; SSTP). Twenty-five participants were required to pedal at six different powers ranging from 20 (1. 6 ± 0. 3 W. kg- 1) to 120 % (9. 6 ± 1. 6 W. kg- 1) of SSTP at 90 RPM. Five 6 -component sensors recorded the loads applied on the saddle, pedals and handlebars. The results showed that the <b>saddle</b> <b>vertical</b> force decreased with increasing cycling power, from a static position on the bicycle (5. 30 ± 0. 50 N. kg- 1) to 120 % of SSTP (0. 68 ± 0. 49 N. kg- 1). Pedal and handlebar force directions were reversed around SSTP, suggesting that the seated position may become constraining in these pedalling conditions. The present data suggest that the <b>saddle</b> <b>vertical</b> force may be predictive of the sit-to-stand transition in cycling, and that pedalling in the seated position at high crank forces may not be optimal, explaining the spontaneous change in coordination mode...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} {{distinctive}} types of coring-induced fractures {{that can be}} recognized in core {{on the basis of}} morphology, assisted by certain characteristics such as edge effects and surface ornamentation. The shape and orientation of many of these induced fractures offer information on the in-situ stress conditions and the coring process. Petal, petal-centerline, scribe-knife, disc, and torque-related fractures may all be caused by coring in <b>vertical</b> wells. <b>Saddle</b> fractures, (related to petal fractures) are unique to horizontal core, as is the polishing of fracture surfaces during coring. other features such as scribe-line rotation, hammer marks, and rotary-bit patterns are important in making correct interpretations of the in situ stress and reservoir permeability, and in making the maximum use of the evidence bearing on reservoir fracture-system permeability provided by both induced and natural fractures...|$|R
40|$|Vibrational comfort {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters evaluated by cyclists during bicycle riding. A method for measuring the saddle vibration transmissibility was developed with the aim of comparing the comfort properties of bicycle saddles without any influence of the full bicycle frame, using a quantitative approach. Three different bicycle saddles were mounted on a stiff seatpost clamped to the extremity of a <b>vertical</b> servohydraulic cylinder: <b>saddles</b> were loaded by a UNI 10814 standard wooden dummy bottom carrying deadweights. After applying a sinusoidal sweep of 0. 6 mm amplitude to the cylinder, from 1 to 100 Hz, with steps of 2. 5 Hz, the application of two piezoelectric accelerometers allowed evaluating the magnitude of the transfer function H between the input acceleration at the cylinder shaft and the output acceleration at the dummy, in the range 1 - 100 Hz. The three curves of the transfer function magnitude were compared and analyzed in order to introduce a Vibrational Comfort Index and to rank the tested saddles from the engineering quantitative point of view...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} on stereoscopic depth perception {{among the elderly}} has led to inconsistent findings. Some {{research on}} stereopsis and aging has found that younger and older adults are essentially the same {{in terms of their}} stereoscopic ability, while other research has found evidence of large differences. This past research has largely been limited to investigations of stereoacuity. The purpose of Experiment 1 was to extend this earlier research to compare how older and younger observers perceive the magnitude of stereoscopically defined depth intervals. Random-dot stereograms depicting sinusoidal surfaces were shown to seven younger (i. e., ages 30 and below) and six older (i. e., ages 60 and above) adults. These surfaces were defined by three levels of peak-trough image disparity, two spatial frequencies, and two densities of texture elements. The observers 2 ̆ 7 task was to estimate the magnitude of the depth interval between the surfaces 2 ̆ 7 peaks and troughs. It was found that the perceived depth intervals of the younger observers were closer to those predicted by the geometry of stereopsis: as disparity increased, so did the magnitudes of their perceived depth intervals. This finding was also true for the five out of the six older adults, but the magnitudes of their perceived depth intervals were less than their younger counterparts. The high frequency surfaces were more difficult to perceive for both groups, but were especially difficult for the elderly. In contrast, texture element density had essentially no effect upon the observers 2 ̆ 7 performance for both groups. The results of this experiment showed that the elderly have a significant amount of stereoscopic functionality that is not qualitatively different from younger adults. Experiment 2 was designed to compare older and younger observers 2 ̆ 7 ability to perceive the shape of stereoscopic surfaces. In this experiment, four different surfaces defined by disparity (i. e., bumps, <b>saddles,</b> <b>vertical</b> cylinders, and horizontal cylinders) were shown to five younger (i. e., 30 and below) and five older (i. e., 60 and above) observers. The random-dot stereograms varied in terms of their texture element density and amount of correspondence. The results showed that the older observers were less sensitive to stereoscopic depth and curvature. In all other respects, however, the results for the older observers were essentially identical to those of the younger observers. In particular, the reductions in density and correspondence led to nearly identical declines in performance for both age groups. In summary, the results of both experiments showed that, despite some reductions in perceptual sensitivity, older adults can effectively perceive and discriminate the shape and depth of stereoscopic surfaces...|$|R
