Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E

5|$|Dumouriez {{believed}} that Coburg would put his main strength {{on the right}} wing to protect the Austrian line of communications.

At 7:00 AM, the French swarmed across the Little Gete but Valence was unable to capture the Mittelwinden hill until noon. The French seized Racour, Oberwinden and finally Neerwinden.|$|E
