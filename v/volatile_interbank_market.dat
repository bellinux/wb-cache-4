40|$|We {{argue that}} the main barrier to an {{integrated}} international <b>interbank</b> <b>market</b> is the existence of asymmetric information between different countries, which may prevail in spite of monetary integration or successful currency pegging. In order to address this issue, we study the scope for international <b>interbank</b> <b>market</b> integration with unsecured lending when cross-country information is noisy. We find not only that an equilibrium with integrated markets need not always exist, but also that when it does, the integrated equilibrium may coexist with one of <b>interbank</b> <b>market</b> segmentation. Therefore, market deregulation, per se, does not guarantee {{the emergence of an}} integrated <b>interbank</b> <b>market.</b> The effect of a repo market which, a priori, was supposed to improve efficiency happens to be more complex: it reduces interest rate spreads and improves upon the segmentation equilibrium, but it may destroy the unsecured integrated equilibrium, since the repo market will attract the best borrowers. The introduction of other transnational institutional arrangements, such as multinational banking, correspondent banking and the existence of "too-big-to-fail" banks may reduce cross country interest spreads and provide more insurance against country wide liquidity shocks.

Following Gale (2004), bank capital is {{considered as a}} buffer to shield deposits from banks’liquidity shocks and then it represents an additional (costly) source of liquidity insurance. Hence, bank capital and <b>interbank</b> <b>markets</b> are {{to a certain extent}} substitutes, and we characterize the conditions under which a negative relationship exists between the level of bank capital and the level of participation in the <b>interbank</b> <b>markets.</b> Moreover, we argue that in order to smooth liquidity shocks banks tend to postpone dividend payments when the <b>interbank</b> <b>market</b> is unable to provide additional liquidity because of highly correlated shocks throughout the economy. This mechanism produces three implications: i) an inverse relationship between bank capital changes and participation in interbank markets; ii) an inverse relationship between dividend changes and participation in interbank markets; iii) a positive relationship between the level of dividends and participation in <b>interbank</b> <b>markets.</b> All these relationships find strong support in the data.
