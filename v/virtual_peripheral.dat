40|$|As {{personal}} computing becomes more popular and affordable, {{the availability of}} peripheral devices is also increasing rapidly. However, these peripheral devices can usually only be connected to a single machine at time. The ability to share peripheral devices between computers without any modification of existing computing environments is, consequently, a highly desirable goal, as it improves the efficiency and usability of such devices. Existing device sharing technologies in the pervasive computing area are not sufficient for peripheral devices designed for personal computers, because these technologies do not provide the degree of networktransparency necessary for both applications and device drivers. In this paper, we propose USB/IP as a peripheral bus extension over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

Using a <b>virtual</b> <b>peripheral</b> bus driver, users can share a diverse range of devices over networks without any modification in existing operating systems and applications.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{embedded}} software education, {{it is usually}} a burden to give every student a development board in the class due to limited budget. Besides, peripheral devices such as LCD panels also increase the cost. A cheap and flexible way is to use virtual embedded systems in the class. However, virtual systems cannot completely reflect the developing environment on real platforms. In this article, we propose the idea that combines the virtual and real embedded platforms. The proposed platform preserves {{the core of the}} hardware board, so that developers can design {{embedded software}} applications in the real developing environment. In addition, we eliminate the peripheral wires and connectors on hardware board and use <b>virtual</b> <b>peripherals</b> and peripherals on PC instead, such that designers can easily control and change peripherals. The proposed idea can significantly reduce cost and increase flexibility when teaching embedded software design. Moreover, the size of development board can be reduced as well.

40|$|We have {{identified}} a spontaneous mutation in mice, which we term HD for “helper T cell deficient. ” This mouse is distinguished by the <b>virtual</b> absence of <b>peripheral</b> T cells of the CD 4 + 8 − major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted T helper subset due to a specific block in thymic development. The developmental defect is selective for CD 4 + 8 − cells; the maturation of CD 4 − 8 + and γδ T cells is normal. The autosomal recessive mutation underlying the HD phenotype is unrelated to MHC class II, since it segregates independently of the MHC class II locus. Moreover, the HD phenotype is not caused by a defect of the CD 4 gene. Bone marrow transfer experiments demonstrate that the defect is intrinsic to cells of the hematopoietic lineage, i. e., most likely to developing thymocytes themselves. The frequency of CD 4 + 8 low intermediate cells is markedly increased in HD mice, suggesting that class II-restricted thymocytes are arrested at this stage.

40|$|Swarm {{robotics}} {{is a new}} {{and quickly}} growing field of research that has many applications to the real-world. The idea {{is to use a}} coordinated group of devices to perform tasks that are either unsafe or infeasible for a single device to accomplish. While a lot of research is being done on swarms, surprisingly, there are not many physical platforms available to apply these ideas to. Being able to take this research out of simulation will greatly improve the quality and feasibility of these ideas outside of near-perfect conditions. In this thesis we develop a new swarm control platform (that can function as either a Centralized or Distributed system), as well as potential research applications and educational exercises that can be created using this platform. The platform utilizes an open source Nano-Quadcopter called the Crazyflie and uses the OptiTrack motion capture camera system for localization. It is designed for scalability using the <b>Virtual</b> Reality <b>Peripheral</b> Network (VRPN), a type of Multi-Cast UDP protocol, to transmit localization data. We use this location data and set of nine nested PID controllers to command the Crazyflie to any location in space. It also supports flying multiple Crazyflies on one USB Radio, and multiple radios per computer, further reducing the scale up cost. As a proof of concept, we crafted a few applications for the Platform to demonstrate its abilities. These examples range from simple single Crazyflie autonomous flight, to more complex gesture controlled multi-Crazyflie master-slave ‘follow-the-leader’ type systems. We intend to extend these systems to test even more complex problems in optimization and stochastic lossy networks, as well as creating lab experiments and educational resources for students to learn more about controls.

30|$|IOMMUs are {{designed}} to virtualize the memory space and the interrupts of the peripherals. Memory virtualization is implemented in the so-called DMA remapping units (DMAR) of the IOMMU. The DMAR {{has been designed to}} simplify address space association and coherency between the drivers and the hardware. Indeed, device drivers use a different address space than the peripherals because they process virtual addresses configured by the kernel. When it is necessary to pinpoint a specific location in the DRAM to configure DMA, the drivers have to translate virtual addresses to the physical address space used by the device. This operation increases the design complexity of the device drivers and microkernels/hypervisors. Using DMAR, the peripherals can share the same virtual address mappings as the drivers (at least for translation). As a consequence, the drivers can configure <b>virtual</b> addresses into <b>peripheral</b> DMA configuration registers. Furthermore, since DMAR has a two-level address translation mechanism, the same strategy can even be used within virtual machines and pass-through drivers. Consequently, virtualized MMU mappings can be easily matched to IOMMU mappings by the hypervisors. The IOMMU also brings similar advantages as the MMU in the cores. It is for example possible to detect faulty devices accessing unmapped physical pages because of software or hardware bugs.|$|R

For this purpose, a hybrid design approach is adopted allowing first investigations of future mobile phone platforms on the system level (using virtual prototyping) com-bined with more accurate power-area explorations of hardware accelerators on the architectural level. Additionally, we show the employment of an LTE data generator peripheral, realizing L 2 uplink processing and thus enabling platform analyses in a closed virtual environment.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{goal of the}} present work was to characterize the responses to gravitational challenges in exercising humans after long-term head-down-tilt bedrest (HDT). HDT is a simulation of weightlessness with respect to effects on the systemic circulation, and previous studies in resting men have suggested that impairments of arterial baroreflexes contribute to the orthostatic intolerance seen after HDT and spaceflight. However, orthostatic challenges are commonly associated with physical activity, so a characterization of cardiovascular responses to gravitational challenges during exercise rather than rest was considered to provide more physiologically relevant information. Furthermore, it was hypothezised that cardiovascular impairments, if any, would be caused by hemodynamic rather than baroreflex mechanisms. In a first step, we studied the applicability during exercise of methods developed for studies of baroreflexes in resting humans. Such methods include apnea during short-lasting carotid sinus stimulation, and they assume a fixed temporal coupling between carotid stimulus and cardiac response. In the present exercise experiments {{it was found that}} apnea induced marked bradycardia and hypertension that tended to confound all but the first 5 s of the response to a carotid stimulation initiated 4 - 5 s after the onset of apnea. Also, both orthostatic stress and exercise were associated with a variable latency of the carotidcardiac baroreflex. In keeping with these findings an alternative mode of baroreflex stimulation, including rapid tilting during eupnea, was developed for exercise studies. In a second step, the cardiovascular responses to rapid tilting were studied in healthy exercising men. The tilts induced a complex pattern of arterial pressure (AP) fluctuations: The efficiency of the skeletal muscle pump promptly changed with posture and with an equally prompt effect on the (<b>virtual)</b> total <b>peripheral</b> conductance. There are also changes in AP at heart level were induced because the heart is located cranial from the hydrostatic indifferent point. In addition, during tilt from upright to supine there were indications that left ventricular stroke volume (SV) transiently decreased due to a rapid increase in right ventricular preload, which acted to impede left ventricular filling (direct ventricular interdependence). The baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) was analyzed with a dynamic model in which HR was a basically linear function of AP recorded at a site between the heart and the carotid sinus. Non-linearities of the FIR responses could be modelled as a result of varying fractional contributions of fast vagal and slow sympathetic HR responses. In a third step, baroreflex and hemodynamic responses were studied in exercising men before and after six weeks of strict HDT. HDT did not alter arterial-cardiac baroreflex sensitivity during light exercise, which is in contrast to previous findings obtained during supine resting conditions. The indices of direct ventricular interdependence were abolished immediately after long-term bedrest; it is suggested that an initial hypovolemia brought about smaller exercise heart volumes, and that the restrictive action of the pericardium was decreased. Within two days, when the plasma volume had been restored, the signs of ventricular interdependence returned to control values. The cardiovascular responses to exercise after long-term strict bedrest differed from those seen after bed rest of shorter duration and after space flights that included exercise countermeasures. Thus, in the present study there were prominent decreases of SV in both supine and upright exercise (- 25 ± 3 % and - 30 ± 5 %, respectively). The decrease in SV during submaximal exercise persisted even after the bed-rest-induced plasma hypovolemia had normalized. There was a more complete recovery of SV and cardiac output during upright exercise compared to exercise in the supine position, where SV had not recovered fully after one month. This suggests a stiffer, and probably smaller, heart that was unable to increase SV with the increased preload induced by supine exercise. It is concluded that cardiovascular impairments in exercising men after long-term bedrest are of hemodynamic rather than of baroreflex origin...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{generated}} {{images have}} always drawn {{the attention of}} millions of people in their different roles: students, professors, researchers, designers, movie directors, etc. It is not only the magic of generating synthetic, static and/or dynamic images, emulations or simulations of reality, but of capturing all the creative abilities of the human being to narrate events, from the memory of the past, descriptions of current reality and projections towards the future. In other words, they may be timeless images and malleable towards the infinite. In them rests the freedom of expression in a chromatic and three-dimensional way where sometimes {{it is difficult to see}} whether we are in the face of something real or virtual. It is the charm of the viewing power of communication where an image is always worth more than a thousand words. Not for nothing when the first graphics appeared to depict the numerical information in the offices, it marked the beginning of the use of computers in the businesses with professional purposes until they reached the home. It was these synthetic images which collaborated to change the meaning of the PC initials, that is, from professional computer to personal computer. The risk lies in the fact that those who manage those images respect the final viewer, at the moment they are presented to his/her eyes. That is, a transparent communication avoiding manipulation through them. If this doesn’t happen, the written word takes again a prevailing place in the communicative process, and one goes back to the time of the appearance of print. It is in this regressive period where the human and social factors may be inserted, which generate different types of structures which do not change over time. Although we are in one of the most dynamic sectors of the current interactive systems, we may come across in some places of the Old Continent with dogmas and their supporters, who slow down the whole creative process which entails working with these computer-made images. Now if the human and social factors are positive, in view of the constant advances of the graphic hardware and software, the only limit that exists is the imagination or originality at the moment of generating static and/or dynamic images in 2 D and 3 D. Computer graphics and computer animation along with text, audio and video have been key in the momentum of the Internet phenomenon of the 20 th century. In the new millennium they have been the main means of drawing the attention of the users to the screens of a great variety of devices of classical computing. There are millions of users who decide to purchase computer equipment because of the images that they can see on the screens. These images gain in quality thanks to their generation from scratch and thanks also to myriad techniques, methods, algorithms, etc. related to computer graphics down to the access to the information stored in the database, such as decompressed files with multimedia information available via the interaction of the user through the various <b>peripherals.</b> <b>Virtual</b> images are generated in 2 D and/or 3 D, thanks to democratization of the pixels in 1990 – 2000. Users are now capable of generating images in movement for 3 D starting from photographs with digital cameras or the commercial applications to generate films with computer animations. In this whole productive process, whether it is at a personal or an industrial level the cost factor is always present, in the equation of maximum quality in the least possible time. To reach that goal it is necessary to resort to several quality attributes that have an influence from the design stage right until the programming of the applications used in the context of graphic informatics. Our intention in the current handbook is to show an essential part of those strategies and also the latest breakthroughs in all that which is directly or indirectly related to computer graphics, computer animation, database, software quality, hypermedia, design, communicability, interfaces, cloud computing, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, computer-aided design, mixed reality, models, techniques and methods of computer science, etc. Some of the works that make up the current compendium have been presented orally by their authors in the following international conference in Venice, Italy: SETECEC 2012 –First International Conference on Software and Emerging Technologies for Education, Culture, Entertainment, and Commerce: New Directions in Multimedia Mobile Computing, Social Networks, Human-Computer Interaction and Communicability, and international symposium in Valle d'Aosta, Italy: CCGIDIS 2012 –Second International Symposium on Communicability, Computer Graphics and Innovative Design for Interactive Systems. The innovation and originality of those proposals has been the reason for which the authors have been invited to enlarge their works submitting again the new versions to an assessment process of said works by the members of the scientific committee. Consequently, these are works that have gone satisfactorily through a double process of international selection. In the next section a short introductory presentation of the research works that make up the current compendium is given: The authors Luigi Barazzetti and Marco Scaioni present an interesting work “Transforming Images and Laser Scans into 3 D Models” where theory and practice converge in the context of 3 D images. They introduce all details of the use of a laser scanner to obtain high quality three-dimensional images and accuracy in the maintenance and the virtual reconstruction of cultural heritage, for instance. Besides, they comprehensively describe computer vision and photogrammetric 3 D modeling techniques that are mainly based on images or laser scans. The description further covers the integration of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) or theodolite data allowing precise geo-referencing. The main goal they have set themselves is to indicate the reliability and robustness of their combined use for real surveys. Simultaneously a set of real examples serves to illustrate each one of the advantages and disadvantages of the used methods and techniques. In these examples the resolution of complex problems and with reduced costs can be verified. Each one of the issues is approached in a didactic way which facilitates the understanding even of the diverse devices used for the measurements. Chih-Fang Huang, Chih-Hsiang Liang, and En-Ju Lin are the authors of the chapter “Sound-Color Synaesthetic Effect Using Algorithmic Composition with Image for Emotional Release. ” In said research they present the qualities of music from an emotive point of view. This is one of the motivations why they spread their study to the field of colors. In this sense, they develop an emotional model for music based on studies of color theory. Another main goal is to present the emotions of the users of a special software starting from the color and the electronic sounds that these represent from the psychological point of view, an approach informed by studies belonging to the set of the music color synesthesis and emotion releasing effect. Throughout the research work the authors explain in a gradual, simple and thorough way each one of the presented concepts with their matching theoretical examples and also the use of a special software for the experiments they have carried out. The research work “User-created Interior Design Service Concepts, Interfaces and Outlines for Augmented Reality” has been made by the following authors Tiina Kymäläinen and Sanni Siltanen. This research work presents us masterfully a design process and the implementation requirements of an interactive interior design system. In said system the use of two focus groups can be detected where the knowledge and the experiences of designers, bloggers and serious amateurs in the field of interior design interact transversally. In that transversal interaction of diverse professionals the presence of user-driven innovation can be seen. The strategies of the conformation of the professionals and the transversal knowledge to the different areas of knowledge are explained with examples. Examples are given, which describe all the aspects of the new technologies applied to augmented reality, the results of tests with real users, the realization of a special software for the three-dimensional visualization of interiors, etc. Each one of the stages of the research project is accompanied by its corresponding textual and graphical explanations. Finally the authors make a wide-ranging reflection about the learned lessons signaling the positive and negative aspects of the used technology and also the future lines of research before their conclusions. In the context of artificial intelligence, Damijan Novak and Domen Verber show us in their research “New Generation of Artificial Intelligence for Real-time Strategy Games” the importance of applying it to computer games. The text starts with a complete state of the art overview, where the main notions to which the current research work refers are defined. In it is a constant interrelation among real-time strategy, games and artificial intelligence. The authors signal the importance of these issues within the academic field since they have detected new fields for research, whether in the present or the immediate future. Besides, in this work an excellent comparison example in the open-source real time strategy game development tools can be seen. The main and secondary goals of the text are gradually developed answering to a set of rhetorical questions with practical examples. All of this makes the reading and understanding easier to the potential readers. Their proposal of an enhanced combat artificial intelligence algorithm is striking in a very positive way. The authors of the chapter “Towards Smart Mobile System for Public Bus Transportation” are Mitja Krajnc, Vili|$|R
