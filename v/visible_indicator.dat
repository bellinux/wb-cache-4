2500|$|Kohn and Mithen {{independently}} {{arrived at}} the explanation that symmetric hand axes were favoured by sexual selection as fitness indicators. Kohn in his book As We Know It wrote that the hand axe is [...] "a highly <b>visible</b> <b>indicator</b> of fitness, and so becomes a criterion of mate choice." [...] Miller followed their example and said that hand axes have characteristics that make them subject to sexual selection, such as that they were made for over a million years throughout Africa, Europe and Asia, they were made in large numbers, and most were impractical for utilitarian use. He claimed that a single design persisting across time and space cannot be explained by cultural imitation and draws a parallel between bowerbirds' [...] (built to attract potential mates and used only during courtship) and Pleistocene hominids' hand axes. He called hand axe building a [...] "genetically inherited propensity to construct {{a certain type of}} object." [...] He discards the idea that they were used as missile weapons because more efficient weapons were available, such as javelins. Although he accepted that some hand axes may have been used for practical purposes, he agreed with Kohn and Mithen who showed that many hand axes show considerable skill, design and symmetry beyond that needed for utility. Some were too big, such as the hand axe found in Furze Platt, England that is over a foot long. Some were too small - less than two inches. Some feature symmetry beyond practical requirements and show evidence of unnecessary attention to form and finish. Miller thinks that the most important clue is that under electron microscopy hand axes show no signs of use or evidence of edge wear. Furthermore, hand axes can be good handicaps in Zahavi's handicap principle theory: learning costs are high, risks of injury, they require physical strength, hand-eye coordination, planning, patience, pain tolerance and resistance to infection from cuts and bruises when making or using such a hand axe.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} of the concepts of work and manifestation for moving image materials was carried out, and both concepts were defined. Research was done on the frequency of occurrence of moving image manifestations, on the types of difference that can occur from one moving image manifestation to another, and on the kinds of <b>visible</b> <b>indicators,</b> accessible to catalogers, {{that are associated with}} these differences. It was found that continuity, i. e. intellectual and artistic content, varies frequently, 39 per cent of the time; an additional seven per cent of works have added subsidiary matter, and an additional 12 per cent of works have differences in language and sound track. In other words, a total of 58 per cent of the works sampled had at least one instance of difference in intellectual and artistic content between two items. Only eight per cent of the works in the sample were mentioned as having manifestations in standard reference sources such as Maltin. 	<b>Visible</b> <b>indicators</b> and physical format are very unreliable indicators of actual difference in intellectual and artistic content; 48 per cent of the time, <b>visible</b> <b>indicators</b> vary with no underlying difference in continuity; 23 per cent of the time, continuity varies with no difference in <b>visible</b> <b>indicators.</b> Length differences of three minutes or more are the most reliable indicators of actual difference in intellectual and artistic content. Of the titles with difference in continuity, 72 per cent of these manifestations were detectible by means of length difference. This corresponds to previous findings for books which indicate paging is the most reliable indicator of true differences in manifestation. 	Findings mean that catalogers need not create nearly as many separate records for the same work as they do under current practice. Fewer records for the same work would also benefit users, who could more easily select the most suitable manifestation of the work they seek if new records were made only for known differences in either intellectual and artistic content or in identification. Since catalogers cannot identify manifestation variation in two items that are no more than two minutes different in length, film scholars and preservationists must watch all available items representing a particular film work before they can be sure they are aware of all manifestation variations that may occur...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{central issue}} of animal welfare studies has been, and {{continues}} to be, how can we measure animals’ welfare? Among measures, health-related and physiological disorders appear as the most universally accepted indicators of altered welfare. However, some disorders could be difficult to assess directly, and consequently could be unappreciated. Moreover, even if good welfare starts with physical condition, it does not stop there and <b>visible</b> <b>indicators</b> reflecting the animals’ internal state (mental well-being) must also be considered. Here we propose to present a critical review of welfare indicators in horses, then to present results from a first multidimensional study about horses’ welfare performed in 59 horses coming from riding schools. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify reliable and <b>visible</b> <b>indicators</b> of the horses’ welfare state, based on a multidimensional approach including health-related, physiological, behavioural and postural measures. Here we identified several visible postural and behavioural indicators that were clearly associated with altered welfare (i. e. presence of health-related disorders). Moreover, these indicators differed between riding schools, allowing us to identify riding schools’ welfare profiles in addition to individual profiles. As a previous study revealed a relationship between horses’ altered welfare and their aggressiveness towards humans, these visible postural and behaviours indicators are crucial to help professionals and non-professionals to identify their horses’ welfare state and consequently to prevent accident...|$|R
