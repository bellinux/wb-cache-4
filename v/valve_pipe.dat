Graphical system can select types of radiators and valves, design pipes and specification. It discerns objects-classes: radiator, <b>valve,</b> <b>pipe</b> and specification, which have some properties and methods that ease programmer’s work. House geometry and desirable temperature is known. First, program selects geometry parameters of radiators from radiators database by using ActiveX Data Objects technology, which by programming method connects drawing and database.

40|$|Instabilities {{associated}} with fluid handling and operation in liquid rocket propulsion systems and test facilities usually manifest themselves as structural vibrations or {{some form of}} structural damage. While {{the source of the}} instability {{is directly related to the}} performance of a component such as a turbopump, valve or a flow control element, the associated pressure fluctuations as they propagate through the system have the potential to amplify and resonate with natural modes of the structural elements and components of the system. In this paper, the authors have developed an innovative multi-level approach that involves analysis at the component and systems level. The primary source of the unsteadiness is modeled with a high-fidelity hybrid RANS/LES based CFD methodology that has been previously used to study instabilities in feed systems. This high fidelity approach is used to quantify the instability and understand the physics {{associated with}} the instability. System response to the driving instability is determined through a transfer matrix approach wherein the incoming and outgoing pressure and velocity fluctuations are related through a transfer (or transmission) matrix. The coefficients of the transfer matrix for each component (i. e. <b>valve,</b> <b>pipe,</b> orifice etc.) are individually derived from the flow physics associated with the component. A demonstration case representing a test loop/test facility comprised of a network of elements is constructed with the transfer matrix approach and the amplification of modes analyzed as the instability propagates through the test loop...|$|E
40|$|Impedance {{characteristics}} of hydraulic components have a signifcant efect on pressure ripple levels in hydraulic circuits. These pressure ripples lead to vibration of pipework and associatedfittings {{and are a}} source of unreliability and noise. This paper describes an experimental investigation of restrictor and flow control valves using a specially designed circuit. For a restrictor valve, {{it was found that the}} impedance characteristics were influenced by fluid compressibility, fluid inertia, valve vibration and downstream impedance effects. When these effects were taken into account, the valve could be modelled as a simple orijice. The impedance {{characteristics of}} a flow control valve were found to be more complex and wave propagation within the valve fluid passageway had a dominant effect on behaviour.

40|$|The Reactor Recirculation System {{has been}} {{designed}} to perform the following functions: a. To provide forced circulation of reactor water through the core to overcome the power density limitation of the fuel. b. To provide a variable moderator (coolant) flow through the core to control reactor power without manipulation of the control rods. The Reactor Recirculation System has been sized to provide a total flow capacity equal to the required flow at rated load. The design pressure of the recirculation pumps is 1300 psig, with a design temperature of 575 0 F. The system piping and valves have been designed for a pressure of 1200 psig and a temperature of 570 °F. 5. 4. 1. 2 System Description The system consists of the reactor vessel and five piping loops, as shown in Drawing GE 237 E 798. Each loop comprises one motor driven pump, a motor generator (M-G) set, suction and discharge valves, a bypass valve around each discharge <b>valve,</b> <b>pipe</b> support hangers, piping, and associated system controls and instrumentation. Recirculated coolant enters the lower head of the reactor through vessel nozzles, passes through the diffuser and orifices {{at the bottom of the}} core and flows upward through the core where bulk boiling produces steam. The steam-water mixture enters the moisture separators and then the steam dryers. The water separated from the steam flows downward across the top of the plenum, where it mixes with the incoming feedwater, and enters the downcomer annulus between the shroud and the vessel wall. The coolant flows through the downcomer region, through the outlet nozzles, and into the recirculation pumps suction piping. The coolant is then returned to the vessel via the pumps and discharge piping. The continuous circulation ensures that hot spots are not created by steam bubbles, which would result in steam blanketing around fuel rods and in reduction of the heat removal capability of the coolant. To control reactor power level, the system makes use of the boiling water reactor large negative power coefficient. A power level increase is achieved b...|$|E

50|$|A trick {{commonly}} used on boats with water ballast {{is to link}} port and starboard tanks with a <b>valved</b> <b>pipe.</b> When preparing to tack, the valve is opened, and water in the windward tank, which is higher, is allowed to flow to the lee side, and the sheet is let off to keep the boat from heeling too far. Once as much water as possible has been transferred to the lee side, the boat is brought about and the sail sheeted in, lifting the newly full windward tank. A simple hand pump can then be used to move any remaining water from the lee to the windward tank.|$|R
50|$|If {{the fluid}} is a liquid, a {{different}} type of limiting condition (also known as choked flow) occurs when the Venturi effect acting on the liquid flow through the restriction causes a decrease of the liquid pressure beyond the restriction to below that of the liquid's vapor pressure at the prevailing liquid temperature. At that point, the liquid will partially flash into bubbles of vapor and the subsequent collapse of the bubbles causes cavitation. Cavitation is quite noisy and can be sufficiently violent to physically damage <b>valves,</b> <b>pipes</b> and associated equipment. In effect, the vapor bubble formation in the restriction prevents the flow from increasing any further.|$|R
