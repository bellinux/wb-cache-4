It is essentially a conventional rifle, but with a rather futuristic visual style. It is introduced in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode [...] "Field of Fire", where it is {{used in conjunction with}} a micro-transporter and a <b>visual</b> <b>scanner</b> headpiece to create an extremely potent sniper rifle. With the scanner, the shooter can precisely target people hundreds of meters away and through solid matter with no difficulty. Using the transporter attached to the barrel, the slug can then be transported at full velocity, materializing at point-blank range.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{automatic}} robotic inspector for tunnel assessment is presented. The proposed platform {{is able to}} autonomously navigate within the civil infrastructures, grab stereo images and process/analyse them, {{in order to identify}} defect types. At first, there is the crack detection via deep learning approaches. Then, a detailed 3 D model of the cracked area is created, utilizing photogrammetric methods. Finally, a laser profiling of the tunnel’s lining, for a narrow region close to detected crack is performed; allowing for the deduction of potential deformations. The robotic platform consists of an autonomous mobile vehicle; a crane arm, guided by the computer vision-based crack detector, carrying ultrasound sensors, the stereo cameras and the laser <b>scanner.</b> <b>Visual</b> inspection is based on convolutional neural networks, which support the creation of high-level discriminative features for complex non-linear pattern classification. Then, real-time 3 D information is accurately calculated and the crack position and orientation is passed to the robotic platform.

40|$|International audienceOur {{researches}} aim at {{developing a}} system which will give assistance to the driver for piloting in rough environments such as off-road or post-crisis environment. The purpose {{of this approach is}} to indicate driver where dangers are and how to avoid them. To achieve it, we use 3 D reconstruction to detect negative (under the ground) and positive (on the ground) obstacles. This article focuses on the 3 D reconstruction. Our approach uses sensors fusion of lidar and stereo cameras and works on a simple strategy. To meet real time perspective and to avoid heavy points cloud matching we use visual odometry to position points cloud in the environment. 3 D points cloud is created using a 2 D lidar tilting with servomotor on 180 ◦ to obtain a cheap 3 D laser <b>scanner.</b> <b>Visual</b> odometry is brought by Libviso 2 (Geiger et al., 2011) using egomotion to determine odometry from stereo images pairs.  This approach is conceived to fit our driver assistance task and not for long time mapping. As a result, after passing by points, they are deleted from created map. This way, the system is not limited by disk space or points cloud computation time in order to meet real time 3 D reconstruction. Ground truth acquisitions have been led to test the veracity of such an approach in an outdoor environment. Results show that coherent map are obtained but this fusion is not yet suitable for off-road driving. With some improvements on visual odometry, we could obtain a good 3 D reconstruction for low speed and high speed driving...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to learn whether {{the principle of}} functional specialization that is evident {{at the level of}} the prestriate visual cortex extends to areas that are involved in grouping visual stimuli according to attribute, and specifically according to colour and motion. Subjects viewed, in an fMRI <b>scanner,</b> <b>visual</b> stimuli composed of moving dots, which could be either coloured or achromatic; in some stimuli the moving coloured dots were randomly distributed or moved in random directions; in others, some of the moving dots were grouped together according to colour or to direction of motion, with the number of groupings varying from 1 to 3. Increased activation was observed in area V 4 in response to colour grouping and in V 5 in response to motion grouping while both groupings led to activity in separate though contiguous compartments within the intraparietal cortex. The activity in all the above areas was parametrically related to the number of groupings, as was the prominent activity in Crus I of the cerebellum where the activity resulting from the two types of grouping overlapped. This suggests (a) that, the specialized visual areas of the prestriate cortex have functions beyond the processing of visual signals according to attribute, namely that of grouping signals according to colour (V 4) or motion (V 5); (b) that the functional separation evident in visual cortical areas devoted to motion and colour, respectively, is maintained at the level of parietal cortex, at least as far as grouping according to attribute is concerned; and (c) that, by contrast, this grouping-related functional segregation is not maintained {{at the level of the}} cerebellum...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilepsy may relate to abnormalities in various brain structures, including the amygdala. Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) without MRI abnormalities (MTLE-NMRI) represent a challenge for diagnosis of the underlying abnormality and for presurgical evaluation. To date, however, only few studies have used quantitative structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based techniques to examine amygdalar pathology in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on clinical examination, 24 -hour video EEG recordings and MRI findings, 50 patients with EEG lateralized TLE and normal structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging results were included in this study. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the amygdalas and hippocampi were conducted in 50 non-epileptic controls (age 7 - 79 years) and 50 patients with MTLE with normal MRI on a 1. 5 -Tesla <b>scanner.</b> <b>Visual</b> assessment and amygdalar volumetry were performed on oblique coronal T 2 W and T 1 W MP-RAGE images respectively. The T 2 relaxation times were measured using the 16 -echo Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence (TE, 22 - 352). Volumetric data were normalized for variation in head size between individuals. Results were assessed by SSPS statistic program. RESULTS: Individual manual volumetric analysis confirmed statistically significant amygdala enlargement (AE) in eight (16 %) patients. Overall, among all patients with AE and a defined epileptic focus, 7 had predominant increased volume ipsilateral to the epileptic focus. The T 2 relaxometry demonstrated no hyperintense signal of the amygdala in any patient with significant AE. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presented AE in a few patients with TLE and normal MRI. These findings support the hypothesis {{that there might be a}} subgroup of patients with MTLE-NMRI in which the enlarged amygdala could be related to the epileptogenic process...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are a wide used {{technique}} for acquisition {{in order to}} create buildings 3 D models, providing the acquisition of a high number of images at very high resolution or video sequences, in a very short time. Since low-cost UASs are preferred, the accuracy of a building 3 D model created using this platforms must be evaluated. To achieve results, the dean's office building from the Faculty of “Hydrotechnical Engineering, Geodesy and Environmental Engineering” of Iasi, Romania, has been chosen, which is a complex shape building with the roof formed of two hyperbolic paraboloids. Seven points were placed on the ground around the building, three of them being used as GCPs, while the remaining four as Check points (CPs) for accuracy assessment. Additionally, the coordinates of 10 natural CPs representing the building characteristic points were measured with a Leica TCR 405 total station. The building 3 D model was created as a point cloud which was automatically generated based on digital images acquired with the low-cost UASs, using the image matching algorithm and different software like 3 DF Zephyr, <b>Visual</b> SfM, PhotoModeler <b>Scanner</b> and Drone 2 Map for ArcGIS. Except for the PhotoModeler Scanner software, the interior and exterior orientation parameters were determined simultaneously by solving a self-calibrating bundle adjustment. Based on the UAS point clouds, automatically generated by using the above mentioned software and GNSS data respectively, the parameters of the east side hyperbolic paraboloid were calculated using the least squares method and a statistical blunder detection. Then, in order to assess the accuracy of the building 3 D model, several comparisons were made for the facades and the roof with reference data, considered with minimum errors: TLS mesh for the facades and GNSS mesh for the roof. Finally, the front facade of the building was created in 3 D based on its characteristic points using the PhotoModeler Scanner software, resulting a CAD (Computer Aided Design) model. The results showed the high potential of using low-cost UASs for building 3 D model creation and if the building 3 D model is created based on its characteristic points the accuracy is significantly improved...|$|R
