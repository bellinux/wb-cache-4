40|$|The {{utilisation}} of cryopreservation for {{the eradication}} of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) or banana streak virus (BSV) from Musa spp. was investigated. Banana plants, cv. Williams (AAA, Cavendish subgroup), were mechanically infected with CMV or naturally infected with BSV, and proliferating meristems were produced from the infected plants. Excised meristematic clumps were cryopreserved through vitrification using PVS- 2 solution. The health status of regenerated in vitro plants was first checked by means of ELISA. The putative <b>virus-free</b> <b>material</b> was subsequently tested a second time following greenhouse acclimatisation. The frequency of virus eradication for CMV and BSV was 30 % and 90 %, respectively, following cryopreservation. In comparison, the frequency of virus-free plants regenerated directly from highly proliferating meristems, corresponding to a spontaneous eradication rate, reached 0 % and 52 % for CMV and BSV. respectively. The conventional meristem culture resulted in 0 % CMV-free plants and 76 % BSV-free plants, while the cryoprotective treatment resulted in 2 % CMV-free plants and 87 % BSV-free plants. To understand the mode of action of cryopreservation for {{the eradication of}} viral particles, we examined {{the structure of the}} meristem tips by light microscopy.

40|$|Comparison {{of seven}} {{isolates}} of rust from leek (Allium porrum), three from chives (Allium schoenoprasum), one from A. scorodoprasum {{and one from}} A. babingtonii {{on the basis of}} telial and uredinial morphology showed there to be three morphologically distinct species. Application of these criteria to herbarium material confirmed these findings and showed the rust on leeks in the U. K. to be the same species found on European leeks, garlic and certain wild Allium spp. from the Mediterranean. It is suggested that the following names be adopted, viz. Puccinia allii (DC.) Rud. for the rust on leeks, Puccinia mixta Fuck. for the rust on chives and Uromyces ambiguus (DC) Lev. for the rust on A. babingtonii. Infection studies on isolates of each rust supported the morphological evidence, and showed the three species to have different, extensive but overlapping host ranges within the genus Allium. In the ampeloprasum complex, A. kurrat accessions were highly susceptible to leek rust whereas some accessions of A. ampeloprasum and A. babingtonii had high levels of quantitative resistance. There was no evidence of 'hypersensitive-type' resistance in the complex. Tests within one leek cultivar (Musselburgh) showed older plants to be more resistant than seedlings in at least two quantitative components. However leaf tissue appeared to become more susceptible to infection with age, except in the leaf tips, which did not change in susceptibility over time. Inoculation of 16 leek cultivars with leek rust isolates from different geographical areas, and subsequent analysis during the disease cycle of several components of resistance (viz; latent period, pustule density and pustule length) showed that some cultivars performed consistently better against all isolates. However, in most cases there was a considerable and complex cultivar-isolate-component interaction. There was no evidence of physiologic specialisation in the isolates, but low levels of specialisation could have been hidden by the high level of variation in the experiments. Comparison of field cultivars of garlic with equivalent <b>virus-free</b> <b>material</b> using an isolate of leek rust gave inconclusive results, and further study of the rust-garlic-virus interaction is recommended. Major trends in the infection/resistance studies included a high level of environmentally-dependent variation and a lack of 'hypersensitive-type' resistance, even in host species quite distantly related to the normal host...|$|E
40|$|Tomato aspermy virus (TAV) {{was found}} infecting more than 90 % of {{chrysanthemum}} plants collected from several gardens in the Hobart district. The virus is readily transferred by sap inoculation to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Hickory Prior) {{in which it}} causes a severe systemic disease, and real relative concentrations of infective particles in tobacco plants can be measured reliably on Chenopodium amaranticolor, a local lesion host, if certain procedures are adhered to. Tobacco plants may be freed from infection by growing them at a constant temperature of 36 C for between 5 and 30 days. The percentage of cures effected is generally greater if cuttings are taken from plants immediately after treatment and rooted in a mist propagation unit. A decreased rate of viral synthesis is {{one reason for the}} effectiveness of the method. Under normal conditions of heat treatment, virus multiplication could never be detected although some indirect evidence, from results with cytokinin applications to treated plants, suggested that limited multiplication still occurred. However, measurable synthesis did take place if heated plants were treated with actinomycin D. These observations, together with some additional information on rates of TAV accumulation in plant tissue under various conditions, support a concept of competition between the virus and its host for substrates and access to ribosomes. As ribosomal concentration falls markedly in plants undergoing heat treatment concomitant with an increase in host protein synthesis, an hypothesis is advanced that viral RNA competes poorly with host messenger RNA for the limited numbers of available ribosomes on which to synthesise their respective proteins. This concept may also be used to account for the successes in obtaining <b>virus-free</b> <b>material</b> from infected plants by meristem culture. The rate of virus inactivation in whole plants at 36 Â°c is much slower than the rate in expressed sap, and faster than the rate in purified virus preparations. Also, the kinetics of inactivation both 'in vivo' and in expressed sap do not fit a reaction of the first order, but one of a higher order, showing that inactivation at high temperature is not solely a direct thermal effect. Large increases in the levels of two enzymes, polyphenoloxidase and ribonuclease, occur during heat treatment and these may directly inactivate TAV. The extent of increase of these heat-induced enzymes may vary greatly with the species and variety of tobacco, thus providing an explanation for many past observations and suggestions implicating a role of the host in heat treatment therapy. Several observations indicates that the cytokinin concentration falls in heated plants. This results in an almost complete cessation of mitosis as well as a decrease in the ionic strength of the cell sap concomitant with a large increase in cell volume. The pH of the cell sap also falls markedly during heat treatment. probably reduce the stability of TAV. These changes The observations on alterations in cell size and mitotic activity are taken to negate the commonly advanced suggestion that heat treatment may be successful because the plant "grows away" from the virus. The results, and some conclusions drawn from them, offer several different mechanisms which may be important in achieving virus therapy by heat treatment. They allow one to predict the types of virus infections which might be cured by heat treatment, and suggest that exogenous application of certain chemicals to plants may be useful in increasing both plant survival and the chances of virus cure in "difficult plants. " A more rational approach to virus therapy by heat treatment should therefore be possible...|$|E

Investigations using the double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) showed that CMV is not entirely systemic within naturally infected plants in the field. In greenhouse tests, 4 % of plants derived from apparently uninfected stems and 12 to 17 % of plants derived from symptomatic stems tested positive for CMV after emergence and later developed symptoms and died. Analyses of the spatial distribution of naturally infected plants in the field indicated that epidemics are initiated from small clusters of diseased plants that rapidly expand and spread.

These viruses are known to have a devastating effect on crop production and constraint to the international exchange and conservation of banana germplasmâa cornerstone for breeding new cultivars. The viruses are particularly problematic in vegetative propagated crops, like bananas, because of their transmission in the planting material.

A pair of degenerate oligonucleotide primers, parRdRp 5 and parCoat 3 was designed based on conserved regions located in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and coat protein (CP) genes of these viruses and one other alphanecrovirus, Tobacco necrosis virus A. Its use in RT-PCR assays generated a product of ca. 2000 bp for the 4 viral species tested. These primers were compared with virus specific primers in multiplex RT-PCR, and identical results were obtained. Its application to dsRNA extracted from 54 olive field growing trees originated the expected ca. 2000 bp amplicon in 17 trees.

40|$|The study {{achieved}} {{a better understanding}} of the epidemiology and ecology of Banana streak virus (BSV) in Uganda, generating information useful in designing management strategies to limit the spread of BSV. An identification key for the mealybugs on Musa in Africa was constructed. Screenhouse transmission experiments identified Dysmicoccus brevipes, Planococcus citri and a Pseudococcus sp. from bananas as mealybugs able to transmit the virus. Field observations also demonstrated that mealybugs are able to spread from plant to plant. Monitoring spread of BSV in new fields revealed that both onset and rate of spread was site specific; however, it was not clear why this was the case. The first incidence of BSV infection in Rakai was 28 months after planting (MAP), but in Ntungamo it was only 6 MAP. BSV incidence then increased to 28 %, 72 MAP at a rate of 0. 10 new infections/infected plant/month and 43 %, 28 MAP at a rate of 0. 23 new infections/infected plant/ month in Rakai and Ntungamo respectively. BSV spreads slowly in some locations, and is therefore probably amenable to control by phytosanitary measures. These would comprise primarily of the use of <b>virus-free</b> planting <b>material</b> and roguing infected plants. BSV spread predominantly within-field once initial infections were established. New infections were more likely to occur within 10 rows/columns from an old infection. More spread occurred to plants bordering established infected fields in Ntungamo.

50|$|One way {{to reduce}} the virus and {{infection}} risk is through aphid management. Aphids are typically found on the undersides of leaves on the lower succulent shoots. After bloom, the lower shoots should be inspected weekly in multiple areas of the field. Wingless aphids are found early in the growing season while later in the season, the colonies will be made up of both wingless and winged aphids. Aphids have multiple natural predators, which growers rely on to naturally control the aphid population, such as parasitic wasps, Aphidius spp., as well as the seven spotted lady beetle,Coccinella septempunctata. The parasitic wasps lay their eggs inside of aphids and the larvae then consume the aphids from the inside. These parasitic predators also attack the aphid eggs. When growing blueberries, it is important to only use certified <b>virus-free</b> planting <b>material.</b> When transferring plants from an infected field to a healthy field it is important to wash the plants with water to remove virus-carrying aphids and prevent the spread of the disease to other areas. For chemical management of the disease, optimal aphid control insecticides are Provado, Actara or Assail. These insecticides belong to the neonicotinoid class and are able to spread in the foliage after application. Studies have shown that infection can be spread by rubbing viral particles on the leaves of healthy blueberry plants so it is important to immediately remove and dispose of infected plant material once infection has been detected. There is no single common way to control the spread of the blueberry shoestring virus. The management option used depends on the severity of the disease and the population density of the aphid vector.|$|R
40|$|Kiwifruit (genus Actinidia) is an {{important}} horticultural crop grown in the temperate regions. The four worldâs largest producers are China, Italy, New Zealand and Chile.

In Italy, {{as well as in}} many other countries, the kiwifruit crop has been considered to be relatively disease free and then no certification system for this species has been developed to regulate importation of propagation plant material in the European Union. During the last years a number of fungal and bacterial diseases have been recorded such as Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae. Since 2003, several viruses and virus-like diseases have been identified and more recent studies demonstrated that Actinidia spp can be infected by a wide range of viral agents. In collaboration with the University of Auckland we have been detected thirteen different viral species on kiwifruit plants. During the three years of my PhD I worked on the characterization of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Pelargonium zonate spot virus (PZSV). The determination of causal agents has been based on host range, symptom expression in the test plant species and morphological properties of the virus particles using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and using specific oligonucleotide primers in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both viruses induced several symptoms on kiwifruit plants. Moreover with new technologies such as high-throughput sequencing we detected additional viruses, a new member of the family Closteroviridae and a new member of the family Totiviridae.

The first step, called pre-indexing, involved only molecular tests and was designed as a pre-screen of new germplasm lines or existing accessions to reduce the need for post-entry virus therapy and repeated virus indexing. The second step, called full indexing, was performed on either older existing accessions or newer accessions which tested negative during pre-indexing, and involved molecular tests, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and symptom observation. In total, 270 germplasm lines (434 samples) were pre-indexed; while full indexing was carried out on 243 accessions (68 of which had been pre-indexed). A significant proportion of the samples tested during pre-indexing was infected with at least one virus (68 %), showing the utility of this early pre-screening step. Banana streak OL virus and Banana mild mosaic virus were the most commonly detected viruses during both pre- and full indexing. For 22 accessions, viral particles were observed by TEM in full indexing while the molecular tests were negative, underlining the importance of combining various detection techniques. After full indexing, viruses were not detected in 166 accessions, which were then released for international distribution from the ITC. This publication exemplifies how the practical application of diagnostic protocols can raise fundamental questions related to their appropriate use in routine practice and the need for their continuous monitoring and improvement after their first publication...|$|R
40|$|Banana and {{plantain}} (Musa spp.), {{produced in}} 10. 3 million ha in the tropics, {{are among the}} world's top 10 food crops. They are vegetatively propagated using suckers or tissue culture plants and grown almost as perennial plantations. These are prone to the accumulation of pests and pathogens, especially viruses which contribute to yield reduction and are also barriers to the international exchange of germplasm. The most economically important viruses of banana and plantain are Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), a complex of banana streak viruses (BSVs) and Banana bract mosaic virus (BBrMV). BBTV is known to cause the most serious economic losses in the "Old World," contributing to a yield reduction of up to 100 % and responsible for a dramatic reduction in cropping area. The BSVs exist as episomal and endogenous forms {{are known to be}} worldwide in distribution. In India and the Philippines, BBrMV is known to be economically important but recently the virus was discovered in Colombia and Costa Rica, thus signaling its spread into the "New World. " Banana and plantain are also known to be susceptible to five other viruses of minor significance, such as Abaca mosaic virus, Abaca bunchy top virus, Banana mild mosaic virus, Banana virus X, and Cucumber mosaic virus. Studies over the past 100 years have contributed to important knowledge on disease biology, distribution, and spread. Research during the last 25 years have led {{to a better understanding of}} the virus-vector-host interactions, virus diversity, disease etiology, and epidemiology. In addition, new diagnostic tools were developed which were used for surveillance and the certification of planting material. Due to a lack of durable host resistance in the Musa spp., phytosanitary measures and the use of <b>virus-free</b> planting <b>material</b> are the major methods of virus control. The state of knowledge on BBTV, BBrMV, and BSVs, and other minor viruses, disease spread, and control are summarized in this review. (RÃ©sumÃ© d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the {{incidence}} of virus infections was conducted in two grapevine collection fields. The first was the National collection of Croatian native grapevine cultivars, situated at the âJazbinaâ experimentation station in eastern Zagreb, where more than 120 different autochthonous grapevine cultivars are held, collected from different Croatian vine-growing regions. The second was a regional collection located in Risika, {{on the island of}} Krk (the North Adriatic region) containing 19 native cultivars from that region. During February 2009 from both collections, 95 plants were selected and tested for presence of eight viruses by ELISA, including: Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), Grapevine fleck virus (GFkV), G rapevine leafroll-associated virus 1 (GLRaV- 1), Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 2 (GLRaV- 2), G rapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV- 3), Grapevine virus A (GVA) and Grapevine virus B (GVB). The dominant virus in both collections was GLRaV- 3, present in 75 vines (78. 9 %) in the National collection and in 73 vines (76. 8 %) in the Risika collection. The second most frequent virus in the National collection was GVA (60. 0 %), followed by GLRaV- 1 (29. 5 %), GFkV (24. 2 %), GFLV (17. 9 %), ArMV (12. 6 %), GLRaV- 2 and GVB (2. 1 %). In the Risika collection, GLRaV- 3 was followed by GFLV (42. 1 %), GFkV (36. 8 %), GVA (32. 6 %), ArMV (23. 2 %), GLRaV- 1 (11. 6 %), GLRaV- 2 and GVB (1. 1 %). Mixed infections with two, three of four different viruses were also common in both collections. In the National collection the most common mixed infections were GLRaV- 3 + GVA (15. 8 %) and GLRaV- 1 + GLRaV- 3 + GVA (14. 7 %), while in the Risika collection dominant were mixed infections with GLRaV- 3 + GVA (10. 5 %) and GFLV + GLRaV- 3 (8. 4 %). Free of all eight tested viruses were ten vines (10. 5 %) in the National collection and only seven vines (7. 4 %) in the Risika collection. This investigation has demonstrated that there has been deteriorated sanitary status of Croatian autochthonous cultivars, and indicates the need for the production of certified <b>virus-free</b> planting <b>material.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to obtain <b>virus-free</b> propagation <b>materials</b> from Granola, Pasinler 92 and Caspar potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivars infected with potato virus X (PVX), potato virus Y (PVY) and potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) by using meristem-tip culture. For in vitro propagation, it was tested the effect of different combinations and concentrations of benzylamino purine (BA) (0. 0, 0. 25, 0. 50 mg L - 1) and gibberellic acid (GA 3) (0. 0, 0. 25, 0. 50 mg L - 1) on the number of shoot and node. On the other hand, it was evaluated the effect of BA (0. 00, 5. 00, 10. 0 mg L - 1) and CCC (chlorocholine chloride) (0. 00, 500 mg L - 1) on the tuberization under two photoperiodic regimes (light and dark). The MS salts and vitamins supplemented with 30 g L - 1 sucrose was used as a medium and the media was solidified with 7. 0 g L - 1 agar and the ratio of sucrose added into media for micro tuber production had been increased from 3 - 8 %. The highest number of shoots was obtained from 0. 00 / 0. 25, 0. 25 / 0. 50 and 0. 00 / 0. 00 mg L - 1 BA/GA 3 treatments for Granola, Pasinler 92 and Caspar cultivars as 1. 52, 1. 24 and 1. 44, respectively. However, the highest number of node were determined on 0. 00 / 0. 50 for Granola (9. 12), Pasinler 92 (8. 76) and on 0. 00 / 0. 25 mg L - 1 BA/GA 3 treatments for Caspar (8. 24). When the results were assayed according to total tuber number, the most micro-tubers for Granola, Pasinler 92 and Caspar cultivars were obtained from 5. 00 / 5000 mg L - 1 BA/CCC treatment as 5. 6, 4. 0, 4. 8 per/bottle under dark treatments. All in vitro regenerated plant materials were tested by DAS-ELISA (double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to determine the presence and absence of viruses and PVX, PVY and PLRV viruses were eliminated from Granola (25, 40 and 60 %), Pasinler 92 (16, 41. 6 and 46. 1 %) and Caspar cultivars (28. 5, 33. 3 and 50 %), respectively...|$|R
40|$|Three Malaysian {{sweet potato}} cultivars, namely Ipomoea batatas (L.) cv. Gendut, Jalomas and Telong, were {{investigated}} for {{their abilities to}} produce somatic embryos. Shoot meristems were used as the starting materials and cultured on Murashige and Skoog basal media (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) {{in the presence of}} auxin 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) or 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4, 5 -T). Auxin 2, 4, 5 -T at 5 ÂµM was most effective for the initiation of primary embryogenic formations in Ipomoea batatas (L.) cv. Gendut. However, the cultivar Jalomas embryogenic cells failed to germinate and Telong meristem cultures formed non-embryogenic calli. Ipomoea batatas (L.) cv. Gendut embryogenic cultures consisted of compact and organized cell growths. Ipomoea batatas (L.) cv. Jalomas embryogenic tissues had ruptured cells which subsequently prevented the formation of viable somatic embryos. Ipomoea batatas (L.) cv. Telong consisted of unorganized cell formations, as there was scattered mitotic activity. Subsequently, Gendut cultures were used for the development of secondary embryogenic inductions using pre-embryogenic calli as explants. Pre-embryogenic calli explants treated with hydrogen peroxide and auxin (0. 5 ÂµM hydrogen peroxide and 5 ÂµM auxin 2, 4, 5 -T) promoted both non-embryogenic and pre-embryogenic calli productions, while heat pre-treatments (20 minutes of exposure to 500 C pre-treatment) promoted embryogenic calli productions and UV-C radiation (1 minute UV radiation pre-treatment) was effective for germinating high number of somatic embryos. Investigations on the antioxidative enzymes that regulated endogenous reactive oxidative species (ROS) in the various morphological structures revealed that the accumulation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals were important for the initiation of pre-embryogenic formations, while the subsequent accumulation of hydrogen peroxide caused the progression to embryogenic calli formations. Subsequent maturation and germination of these embryogenic calli correlated with reduced ROS, with the increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) enzyme activities. The primary induction from meristem explants is important for the production of <b>virus-free</b> planting <b>materials,</b> as viral infections among sweet potato crops are spreading in Malaysia. Secondary embryogenic calli productions provide available embryogenic materials for genetic transfer technologies, artificial seed productions, and the establishment of a germplasm collection...|$|R
40|$|Induction of {{infectious}} type C viruses by {{physical and chemical}} means from avian and routine cells (1 - 4) strongly supports the view that most, if not all, mouse and chicken cells contain at least one normally repressed copy of a complete type C viral genome (5). The state of this endogenous viral information is presently unclear. The recent development of a radioimmunoassay for the major internal viral protein (6 - 8), the group-specific (gs) ~ antigen of murine type C viruses (9 -] 2), provides a method {{for the detection of}} small quantities of this protein in routine cells below the level of sensitivity of complement fixation or gel diffusion assays (9,] 1, 13). Using this technique, {{we have been able to}} measure an immunological reactivity that is similar to the virion gs protein in both virus-producing and virusfree mouse cell lines and also in natural nontumored murine tissues. The findings reported here provide additional evidence for the widespread prevalence of type C viral genes in a variety of mouse cells and strongly suggest a low level of synthesis of at least one virion protein both in apparently virus-negative tissues in the animal and in <b>virus-free</b> cultured cells. <b>Materials</b> and Methods Cdls.

40|$|Cacao swollen shoot virus (CSSV) {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} {{that has}} seriously constrained cocoa production in West Africa, particularly Ghana and Nigeria. To date, cordon sanitaire control measures in Ghana have failed {{to prevent the spread}} of the condition caused by the virus, Cacao swollen shoot virus disease (CSSVD). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of cocoa somatic embryogenesis to produce <b>virus-free</b> clonal propagation <b>material</b> both for replanting and to facilitate the safe international exchange of germplasm. CSSVD detection in the field is hampered by the sometimes slow appearance of visual symptoms and their complete absence in mild strains. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) -based screening, a sensitive tool for microbial pathogen identification, is employed in this study because of its capacity for CSSV detection prior to the appearance of visual symptoms. Degenerate PCR primers were developed in order to improve the CSSV-strain dependence of earlier tests. Accordingly it was found that these primers (comprising a mixture of 48 variable redundant nucleotide bases) were capable of detecting 37 out of a putative 56 CSSV strains maintained at the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana, four more than the sequence specific primers. For tissue culture studies, cocoa staminodes cultures were established from flowers of CSSV-infected cocoa genotypes CL 19 / 10 strain 1 A and Amelonado Plant 2 to produce callus, primary and secondary somatic embryos, with genotype AMAZ 15 from the Intermediate Cocoa Quarantine Facility used as a virus-free control. In terms of primary somatic embryo production tested across five cocoa genotypes the Nestle protocol proved to be more efficient than the Penn State protocol, although the distinction was less clear with virus-infected donor trees. PCR- based CSSV detection proved that virus could be detected at callus, primary somatic embryos and secondary somatic embryo stages, although the frequency of CSSV was reduced, indicating that the progress of the virus was progressively impeded. Assessment on the presence of plasmodesmata within CSSV-infected cocoa tissues by using transmission electron microscopy was hampered with the presence of artefacts in all sections mounted on Formvar films. Plasmodesmata were not detected may be indicative of a low frequency of plasmodesmata and may also be due to the techniques and methods used. Trials were conducted to assess Nicotiana benthamiana plantlets as alternate CSSV indicators and while they did receive viral DNA this was at too Iowa frequency to make them a viable option for glasshouse- based viral screening. The overall findings of this work do, however, support the use of somatic embryogenesis as a means of improving CSSV-free clonal propagation of cocoa.
