To measure the bias, we must first take a long sequence of data, and find the average value. Clearly, in Fig 1, the bias is about 0. 15 deg/sec. Bias stability refers to changes in the bias measurement. For example, what would the bias be if we took data two hours from now? To measure bias stability, we need to measure the bias many times and see how the bias changes over time.

In doing this the pilot is able to adjust the radar so that it will point towards the weather system of interest. If the airplane is at a low altitude, the pilot would want to set the radar above the horizon line so that ground clutter is minimized on the display. If the airplane is at a very high altitude, the pilot will set the radar at a low or negative angle, to point the radar towards the clouds wherever they may be relative to the aircraft. If the airplane changes attitude, the stabilizer will adjust itself accordingly so that the pilot doesn't have to fly with one hand and adjust the radar with the other.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative {{application of the}} Particle Filtering techniques to the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Gyro</b> problem, which is a highly nonlinear and non Gaussian recursive state estimation problem. The classical approach to recursive state estimation problem of nonlinear and/or non Gaussian systems {{is based on the}} Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is a heuristic method based on the linearization of the state dynamics and observations near a nominal path. Depending on the amount of nonlinearities and non Gaussian noise, the EKF often provides a solution far from acceptable. 12 The <b>Vertical</b> <b>Gyro</b> is an instrument adopted to measure the tilt angles (pitch and roll) of an aircraft with respect to local vertical. It is composed by three orthogonal gyros that are used as process sensors and by three orthogonal accelerometers that are used as aiding sensors. The output of accelerometers is filtered using a proper low-pass filter to allow for the estimation of the local direction of the gravity vector that is assumed the same of the local vertical. In the application to the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Gyro,</b> Gordon’s version of the Particle Filter was used. The relevant dynamical model is based on non-linear attitude rate equation using Euler Angles rather than quaternions. The algorithm, developed in Matlab environment, was first calibrated and tested in simulations, obtaining very appealing performances. Subsequently, it was implemented using real data, acquired by means of an inertial unit produced by CrossbowTM (model DMU-HDXTM), and its results were compared to those provided by the proprietary EKF embedded in the unit. First of all, stationary tests were performed. Sensor data were input to the Particle Filter that outputs the tilt angles (roll and pitch) with respect to the local geodetic reference. The results were compared to those provided by the internal EKF. Subsequently, the same operation was done using data that were acquired with moving platform. The accuracy of the filter was tested also for degraded operating conditions (lower data rates) and large initial errors. The main advantage of the methodology is that, while the internal filter works with 7 states (quaternions, biases and temperature), the Particle Filter ensures the convergence with 3 states, and provides acceptable performances with 1000 particles only, appearing promising for a real time application...|$|E

Then, Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) algorithm refines the motion estimation. Afterwards, forward velocity and Azimuth obtained by visual-LiDAR odometer are integrated with reduced IMU outputs in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to provide final navigation solution. In this paper, datasets from KITTI (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota technological Institute) were used to compare stereo visual odometry, integrated stereo visual odometry and reduced IMU, stereo visual-LiDAR odometry and integrated stereo visual-LiDAR odometry and reduced IMU. Integrated stereo visual-LiDAR odometry and reduced IMU outperforms other methods in urban areas with buildings around. Moreover, this method outperforms simulated Reduced Inertial Sensor System (RISS), which uses simulated wheel odometer and reduced IMU. KITTI datasets do not include wheel odometry data. Integrated RTK (Real Time Kinematic) GPS (Global Positioning System) and IMU was replaced by wheel odometer to simulate the response of RISS method.

The effect of initial angular gyro tilt errors (2 deg, 3 deg, 4 deg, and 5 deg), introduced prior to localizer capture, were investigated by use of a small perturbation aircraft simulation. These errors represent the deviations which could occur in the conventional attitude sensor as a result of the maneuver-induced spin-axis misalinement and drift.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the cost and volume of land vehicle {{navigation}} (LVN) systems, a “reduced ” inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of only one <b>vertical</b> <b>gyro</b> and two or three accelerometers is generally used and is often integrated with other sensors. Since there are no horizontal gyros in a reduced IMU, the pitch and roll cannot be calculated or observed directly from the inertial data, and the navigation performance is thus affected by local terrain variations. In this work, a reduced IMU is integrated with global positioning system (GPS) data and a novel local terrain predictor (LTP) algorithm. The latter is used primarily to help estimate the pitch and roll of the reduced IMU system and thus to improve the navigation performance. In this paper, two reduced IMU configurations and two grades of IMUs are investigated using field data. Test results show that the LTP is valid. Specifically, inclusion of the LTP provides more than an 80 % horizontal velocity improvement relative to the case when the LTP is not used in a GPS/reduced IMU configuration.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{vertical}} reference system being considered utilizes a two-degree-of-freedom gyroscope configured as a <b>vertical</b> <b>gyro.</b> Each gimbal erection circuit forms a second-order feedback control system. Gyros are susceptable {{to a number}} of error sources. In view of the closed loop application being considered, all error sources are of negligible consequence with the exception of friction. With friction included in the gyro model, the inner and outer gimbal erection circuits cease to exist as independent second-order systems. Friction couples the gimbal erection circuits together in a type of algebraic loop. Bearing friction is a random phenomenon best described by a Gaussian distribution. Slip-ring friction is best categorized as a sliding friction. For simulation purposes, slip-ring friction is conveniently handled using the Amontons-Coulomb description. The digital technique is better suited to this simulation problem primarily because of the many decision making elements required. The Gaussian distribution needed to produce the random bearing torques is generated by sampling from the more easily produced uniform distribution. The simulation program is written in the FORTRAN IV programming language. Because of the special features required in simulating the {{vertical reference}} system, it was more feasible to develop the simulation program as a self-contained package complete with an integration routine. A second-order Runge-Kutta integration routine was selected. Using an integration interval of 0. 02 seconds, the simulation program produces excellent results when compared with the response characteristic of an actual vertical reference system...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn December 1990 an experiment {{was conducted at}} the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California in which four different receivers, mounted on the mast of a ship, collected data simultaneously for several hours at a time. Ashtech LD -XII, Trimble 4000 ST, TI 4100 and Magnavox MX 4200 receivers were used. The reference system consisted of a Krupp Atlas Polarfix laser system {{set up on the}} shore at a pre-surveyed site. A two-axis <b>vertical</b> <b>gyro</b> system and a heading gyro gave the ship's 3 -dimensional orientation at any instant in time, providing a connection between the laser reflector and the GPS antennas on the ship's mast. This enabled the reduction of the laser reflector's trajectory to the Ashtech and Trimble antennas for subsequent comparison to the kinematic GPS trajectories of these receivers determined by the postprocessing of the data collected. Each data set was processed once with the software provided by the manufacturer and once with an independent software package, OMNI, developed by the National Geodetic Survey. In addition to the software, six factors were examined to determine their effects on kinematic GPS surveys. They included : tropospheric corrections, initialization, satellite geometry, ephemeris type, data interval and multipath. In general the software available is versatile; however each package has some limitations which call for further development. The results indicate that the effects mentioned are small, generally less than the noise in the reference system. An important factor is the initialization of the kinematic process. Bad initialization can cause a reasonable solution for a period of time, but a sudden deterioration when the satellite configuration changes. Accuracy levels of a few decimeters were easily achieved with the systems and procedures used. Both Ashtech and Trimble produced trajectories which were accurate to within the noise level of the laser trajectories. In both cases the solution produced by OMNI differed from the solution produced by the manufacturer's software, only by a few centimeters. [URL] Commander, Israeli Nav...|$|E
