40|$|ObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} long-term {{durability and}} clinical success of deep venous reconstruction for severe chronic venous insufficiency {{as a part}} of routine workload at a university vascular surgery department. Study designRetrospective analysis of clinical series. PatientsBetween 1996 and 2000, 43 patients underwent deep venous reconstruction, and 38 were available for follow-up. Of these, 29 had secondary valve disease. Median follow-up time was 4. 5 years (range, 2 - 6. 5). Preoperatively, 20 had active or healed ulcers. MethodsSeverity of the disease was assessed by the CEAP classification, clinical severity and disability scores, and duplex evaluation. Criteria for clinical success were the following: no or mild symptoms and ability to work for eight hours. Surgical reconstructions included 12 internal and seven external <b>valvuloplasties,</b> 14 vein transpositions, and 29 valve transplantations. Of the 38 patients, six needed at least one further reconstruction. Follow-up visits were set at one month, six months, and thereafter annually.

ObjectivesThis study describes the creation of an international registry of cases presenting for FCI, intended to compile technical and outcome data from a multicenter cohort. MethodsFor this initial analysis, the entire database of the International Fetal Cardiac Intervention Registry (IFCIR) was queried for details of diagnoses, procedures, and outcomes. Maternal-fetal dyads from January 2001 through June 2014 were included. ResultsEighteen institutions submitted data by data harvest. Of 370 cases entered, 245 underwent FCI: 100 aortic <b>valvuloplasties</b> from a previous single-center report (excluded from additional reporting here), an additional 86 aortic and 16 pulmonary <b>valvuloplasties,</b> 37 atrial septal cases, and 6 unclassified cases. FCI did not appear to affect overall survival to hospital discharge. Among live-born infants with a fetal diagnosis of aortic stenosis/evolving hypoplastic left heart syndrome, {{more than twice as many}} were discharged with biventricular circulation after successful FCI versus those meeting institutional criteria but without any or successful FCI (42. 8 % vs. 19. 4 %, respectively). When fetal deaths were counted as treatment failures, the percentages were similar: biventricular circulation at discharge was 31. 3 % versus 18. 5 % for those discharged with univentricular palliation. Survival to discharge for live-born fetuses with atrial restriction was similar to that of those undergoing technically successful versus unsuccessful FCI (63. 6 % vs. 46. 7 %, respectively), although criteria for diagnosis were nonuniform.

S. Mott Children's Hospital was performed. Neonatal cardiac catheterization was performed more frequently (p = 0. 02) in group I, comprising 14 % (110 of 772) of all catheterizations versus 11 % (93 of 880) in group II. Access was performed by cutdown in 15 patients (13 venous and 2 arterial), all in group I.

40|$|From March 1984 to September 1986, 49 transluminal balloon <b>valvuloplasties</b> (TBVs) were {{performed}} in 44 consecutive patients with congenital pulmonary valve stenosis, aged 1 day to 60 years. Seventeen {{of the patients}} were infants aged less than 1 year, five of whom were neonates. The peak systolic gradient was greater than 50 mm Hg (mean, 80. 0 mm Hg) in 36 patients and was less than 50 mm Hg (mean, 35. 4 mm Hg) in eight. A single balloon catheter was used in 41 cases, and two balloon catheters were used in eight cases. In patients with a gradient greater than 50 mm Hg, the mean right ventricular peak systolic pressure was reduced from 99. 8 to 51. 8 mm Hg, and the mean transvalvular gradient was reduced from 80. 0 to 22. 4 mm Hg. In infants and neonates, the mean right ventricular pressure expressed {{as a percentage of}} systemic pressure decreased from 122. 2 % to 63. 5 %. Follow-up cardiac catheterization 1 to 17 months later (in 19 cases) revealed no significant change in the right ventricular systolic pressure (which had decreased from 53. 0 to 48. 5 mm Hg) or the peak systolic pressure gradient (which had decreased from 29. 0 to 24. 5 mm Hg), in comparison with the changes seen immediately after TBV.

40|$|Development in the 1950 s of the transseptal {{technique}} for left heart catheterization is described. Initial studies in animals and human cadavers were followed up by left atrial puncture with measurements of left atrial and left ventricular (LV) pressure (the latter {{using a small}} plastic catheter) in patients with cardiac disease. Many such procedures were performed safely without complications. Subsequent modification of the original {{technique for}} percutaneous catheter insertion allowed placement of a larger taper-tipped catheter in the LV chamber for selective LV angiography. Early clinical research studies at the National Heart Institute were performed using the transseptal method; these included investigation {{of the effects of}} increasing afterload on the normal and failing left ventricle by means of a graded angiotensin infusion to induce a progressive increase in aortic pressure. A marked decrease in the stroke volume occurred with increased afterload in the failing heart. This finding later led to the concept of afterload mismatch with limited pre-load reserve. Another early transseptal catheterization study in which measurements of LV pressure were made at different locations within the left ventricle {{as well as in the}} left atrium confirmed the presence of cavity obliteration in some patients and true obstruction in the LV outflow tract in many others. In addition, left ventriculography showed that obstruction was caused by abnormal anterior position during systole of the anterior mitral valve leaflet. With growing acceptance of retrograde catheterization of the left ventricle, the use of the transseptal technique for diagnostic purposes declined. However, in recent years, substantial renewed application of the transseptal method has occurred for special diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, including balloon <b>valvuloplasties</b> and electrophysiologic ablation procedures within the left heart...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAimTo {{evaluate}} {{the evolution of}} surgical management in a large population of patients with Marfan syndrome. MethodsThis is a retrospective study of patients fulfilling the Ghent criteria for Marfan syndrome, who visited the Centre de référence national pour le syndrome de Marfan et apparentés and underwent a surgical event before or during follow-up in the centre. ResultsOne thousand and ninety-seven patients with Marfan syndrome, according to international criteria, came to the clinic between 1996 and 2010. Aortic surgery was performed in 249 patients (22. 7 %; 20 children and 229 adults), including the Bentall procedure in 140 patients (56 %) and valve-sparing surgery in 88 patients (35 %); a supracoronary graft was performed in 19 patients (7. 6 %), usually for aortic dissection. During the past 20 years, the predominant reason for aortic surgery has switched from aortic dissection to aortic dilatation, while age at surgery has tended to increase (from 32. 4 ± 11. 9 years to 35. 2 ± 12. 4 years; P= 0. 075). Mitral valve surgery was performed in 61 patients (5. 6 %; six children and 55 adults), including 37 <b>valvuloplasties</b> (60. 6 %) and 18 mitral valve replacements (29. 5 %). No significant difference was observed when comparing mitral valve surgery before and after 2000. ConclusionSurgery performed in patients with Marfan syndrome has switched from emergency surgery for aortic dissection to elective surgery for aortic dilatation; this is associated with surgery performed at an older age despite the indication for surgery having decreased from 60 mm to 50 mm.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} analyze cardiac {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) measurements of myocardial extracellular volume fraction (ECV) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in {{children and young adults}} with congenital aortic stenosis (AS) {{to determine the extent of}} fibrosis and examine their association with aortic valve and ventricular function. BackgroundPatients with congenital AS frequently have impaired diastolic ventricular function and exercise capacity that may be related to myocardial fibrosis. MethodsA total of 35 patients with congenital AS (median age 16 years) and 27 normal control subjects (median age 16 years) were evaluated by CMR. ECV was calculated from pre- and post-gadolinium contrast T 1 measurements of blood and myocardium, and the hematocrit. ResultsECV was significantly higher in AS patients than in normal subjects (median 0. 27 [range 0. 22 to 0. 42] vs. 0. 25 [range 0. 18 to 0. 27], p = 0. 001). LGE was present in 8 (24 %) of the AS patients. A higher ECV was correlated with echocardiographic indexes of diastolic dysfunction including a higher mitral E-wave z-score (r = 0. 58, p = 0. 002), E/septal E′ z-score (r = 0. 56, p = 0. 003), E/mean E′ z-score (r = 0. 55, p = 0. 003), and indexed left atrial volume (r = 0. 56, p = 0. 001). Other factors associated with an elevated ECV (> 0. 28) included a greater number of aortic valve interventions (p = 0. 004) and a greater number of aortic valve balloon <b>valvuloplasties</b> (p = 0. 003). ECV was not significantly associated with AS gradient, left ventricular mass, mass/volume ratio, or ejection fraction. ConclusionsIn young patients with AS, myocardial ECV is significantly elevated compared with control subjects and is associated with echocardiographic indexes of diastolic dysfunction. ECV measured by CMR may be a useful method for risk stratification and monitoring therapies targeting fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Valve {{surgery in}} {{children}} {{is aimed at}} restoring correct hemodynamics with few reoperations and limited resort to prostheses, which would imply early deterioration or definitive hypocoagulation. OBJECTIVES: Report a series of paediatric pts with acquired mitral valve disease, mostly due to rheumatic disease, in whom it was possible, for the great majority, to repair the damaged valve. DEMOGRAPHICS: Fifty children with predominant mitral valve disease, 47 rheumatic (94 %) and 3 after endocarditis were consequently operated by the same surgical team {{over the last five}} years. Ages were 12. 5 +/- 3. 1 yrs and weights 33. 2 +/- 8. 4 Kg, 30 pts presented with predominant mitral regurgitation and 20 pts had significant stenosis. In 8 pts there also moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and in 2 pts severe tricuspid regurgitation was present. Patients were not operated during the acute phase of the disease. Five pts were reoperations and from those, all but one received mechanical prosthesis. RESULTS: In all operations the intention was to repair the mitral valve. In 46 pts complex mitral <b>valvuloplasties</b> were performed extended comissurotomies, shortening of chordae, chordal replacement with PTFE, and reconstruction of valve leaflefts by direct patching or pericardial extension of the retracted posterior leaflet (78. 2 % cases), plus reshaping of the annulus by using a fixed prosthetic CE ring (sizes 26 to 32) in every case. Ring sizes correlated poorly with body weights, but correlation was close and positive for the use of pericardial advancement of the posterior leaflet (p< 0. 01). There was no operative mortality, but one pt died early from sepsis and there was no late mortality. Maximum follow up extends now to 50 months (median 28 months) and functional evaluation, at latest follow up, as assessed by Doppler Echocardiography, showed residual mitral regurgitation, mild-moderate in 4 pts and LA-LV gradients mild in 5 and moderate in 2 pts. NYHA functional class, at present follow-up is class I for 43 pts (88 %) and class II in the remaining 6 pts. Along the follow-up period 2 pts had to be reoperated for early repair failures and other three for late failures, presently freedom for reoperation is 91. 8 % at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve repair in children with rheumatic lesions can be achieved for the great majority of cases by using different techniques. Pericardial extension of the retracted posterior leaflet allowed the use of a bigger size prosthetic ring. Intermediate functional results are good with fair functional classes and few reoperations but follow-up is short and does not allow us to draw conclusions about the long-term results of the repair in these rheumatic patients...|$|R
