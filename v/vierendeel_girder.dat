30|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{the principles of}} displacement-based plastic design (DBPD) and its applications to the efficient design of parallel chord steel <b>vierendeel</b> <b>girders</b> under normal nodal forces. A simplifying assumption has been made that the mathematical model is composed of imaginary, pin connected modules that fit within the bays of the prototype. The use of this modeling concept {{in conjunction with the}} applications of the uniform strength theory leads to the development of an algorithm that is ideally suited for manual, minimum weight design of steel <b>vierendeel</b> <b>girders</b> under any distribution of vertical nodal forces. The resulting solutions are exact and unique and lend themselves well to DBPD and minimum weight treatment. In DBPD which is akin to performance control, member strengths and stiffnesses are assigned rather than tested. Several generic examples have been provided to illustrate the applications of the proposed design procedures. The numerical results of these examples have been verified through long hand and computer methods of analysis. An extensive proof of the proposed method of approach has been provided in the “Appendix”.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{prompted}} {{by the need to}} elaborate on recent developments in plastic design of, parallel chord <b>Vierendeel</b> <b>girders</b> (VG). The paper proposes exact, general solutions to two novel classes of VG under practical loading conditions, a-VG of uniform section, where the chords and the verticals may be composed of two different prismatic sections, and b-VG of uniform strength, where the constituent elements are selected {{in such a way as}} to induce a state of equal stress for all members of the structure. It has been shown that the total weight of both classes of VG can be minimized by the proper selection of the relative strengths of the members of each system. The essence of the paper is based on a novel failure mechanism presented for the first time in this article. It has been shown that racking moments can be utilized to conduct spot checks on final solutions. Several generic examples have been provided to demonstrate the applications and the validity of the proposed solutions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{homogenization}} procedure of a <b>Vierendeel</b> <b>girders</b> with elastic joints is shown. The method {{is based on}} the Stephen transfer matrix analysis and employs as substitute continuum a polar Timoshenko beam. The polar character of the equivalent beam arises quite naturally from the analysis of the pure bending eigenvector components of the girder force transfer matrix. Through the girder unit cell, two bending moments are transmitted: one is generated by the couple of axial forces acting on each nodal section of the beam, the other is produced by the moments applied at the nodes of every ones by the adjacent cells and is modelled as the resultant of the micro-polar moments. Transfer force eigenvector analysis reveals that the unit cell bends maintaining the webs undeformed, a property that allows evaluating both the bending stiffnesses and the equivalent material micro-polar scale parameter by means of straightforward equations. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by comparing the predictions of the homogenized model with literature data and with the results of the analysis of a series of girders carried out by the finite element method...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this master’s thesis is to design the {{supporting}} steel structure covered pedestrian bridge between the learning area buildings A and D of the Faculty of Civil Engineering, street Veveří 95 in Brno. The construction is designed as a bridge rod spatial structure with two main girders. The girders are a combination <b>Vierendeel</b> <b>girder</b> and truss structure. The girders are connected {{at the level of}} the upper and lower band by a crosspiece. The horizontal stiffness of the upper and lower surface structure is ensured by bracing. The upper surface of the pedestrian bridge is horizontal in the longitudinal direction. The lower surface of the pedestrian bridge is curved in order to overcome the difference in height between buildings A and D. This solution is the result of comparison an evaluation of three alternative solutions...|$|E
40|$|A {{lattice girder}} frame was {{compared}} with a combined lattice and <b>Vierendeel</b> <b>girder</b> frame on a single-story building with a frame span of 62. 0 m, column height of 15. 0 m, and ridge height of 17. 3 m. The lattice girder frame {{has the advantage of}} being a cheaper solution when considering steel usage. In contrast, the combined girder frame is a less complex production that has the advantage of cheaper labor costs in relation to the higher material consumption costs. The T-joint in Vierendeel girders, designed in accordance with EN 1993 - 1 - 8, was analyzed because of its key importance when designing the overall frame. Guidelines for the preliminary selection of the chord and post member cross sections in the Vierendeel girders based on their geometrical compatibility are given in this paper. This paper also describes a method for selecting the optimal static system for combined girder frames to achieve a more uniform bending moment distribution along the frame girder by adding additional posts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{building}} construction a significant advantage of vierendeel beam systems {{is that they}} can, in portal frames, {{take advantage of the}} member flexural and compression resistances eliminating, avoiding the need for extra diagonal members. For this reason, they allow greater interaction with building services, enabling a free space for pipes, ducts, etc. They are also widely used in staggered-truss systems. This work is aimed at evaluating the influence of initial stiffness variation in the joints of a <b>vierendeel</b> <b>girder</b> type beam, carried out with the inclusion of analyses of semi-rigid portal frames. FTOOL/SRC was the program used to model the semi-rigid joints by means of a simple and compact parametric analysis. The main goal {{of this article is to}} demonstrate, through a series of analyses of a vierendeel beams, the influence of semi-rigid joints in the structural response. These analyses have involved, in a first stage, fixed and simply supported beams configurations followed by three semi-rigid structures, allowing a better understanding of the force-transfer mechanism in this structural system...|$|E
30|$|Plastic {{design is}} the basis of a number of {{recently}} developed design methodologies for moment frames under lateral loading, (Mazzolani and Piluso 1997; Goel et al. 2010; Grigorian and Grigorian 2011). The technical merits and economic benefits of plastic design have been amply documented in the literature as well as such authoritative texts such as Baker et al. (1956), Beedle (1958), Neal (1963), Nethercot (2001). Plastic design is also the cornerstone of the present contribution. The novelty of the present contribution is in that it incorporates the magnitude and location of maximum plastic deformations as part of the member sizing criteria. A prior knowledge of the elastoplastic performance of any structure at distinct stages of loading, such as at first yield and incipient collapse, may help design the system as a structure of uniform strength (US). Structures of US lend themselves well to DBPD, PC and direct material optimization. A large number of regular structural frameworks such as moment frames, (Wong 2009; Grigorian and Grigorian 2012 a), trusses, grillages, <b>vierendeel</b> <b>girders</b> (VG) etc., can be designed and/or optimized as structures of US. Since the demand–capacity ratio is constant for the constituent members of structures of US, they tend to fail in a state of over-complete collapse where all plastic hinges form simultaneously. While the state of over-complete collapse is associated with minimum weight design, the corresponding distribution of plastic hinges can be looked upon as an admissible template for imposing any order of propagation of plasticity without affecting the economics and/or the ultimate carrying capacity of the system.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} on the {{determination}} of the ultimate load-carrying capacity of stub girders. Two different methods are presented for this purpose. In the first method, the stub girder is modeled as a <b>vierendeel</b> truss <b>girder.</b> Based on an assumed collapse mechanism, shear force distribution between the top and bottom chords proportioned according to the shear and flexural stiffnesses and point of contraflexure at the midlength of opening, an explicit expression to calculate the ultimate load is derived. The second method uses the finiteelement software package ABAQUS for the nonlinear analyses of idealized two-dimensional stub girder models. The methods furnish results that are in reasonable agreement with experimental results, for girders in which the premature failure of shear connectors, local buckling of stubs and the main girder, and the longitudinal shear failure are prevented...|$|R
40|$|The {{crossing}} of rivers in Katanga (Democratic Republic of Congo) by railway {{lines in the}} 1920 s and 1930 s gave Belgian engineers and contractors the opportunity to build record spans for railway bridges. The {{crossing of}} the Lualaba River at Bukama consists of four <b>Vierendeel</b> steel <b>girders</b> each with a 62 m span, which were the largest of their type {{at the time of}} their erection in 1925. The crossing of the Lualaba at Kongolo, built in 1937 – 1939, required a 495 m long reinforced concrete continuous beam bridge with 14 spans, the largest measuring 70 m. It was the first significant concrete beam bridge constructed with a travelling gantry supporting movable formwork. The crossing of the Lukaga River (1938 – 1939) is a three-span concrete bridge with the 70 m long central span built using the cantilever method, which makes this bridge the oldest of its type in the world. This paper highlights the landmark characteristic of these forgotten bridges. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{homogenization}} of a Vierendeel girders with elastic jointsis {{is treated}} in the paper. The starting point of the proposed method is the Stephen transfer matrix analysis and the polar Timoshenko beam is adopted as equivalent continuum of the <b>Vierendeel</b> <b>girder.</b> The polar character of the homogenized beam raises by {{the analysis of the}} pure bending eigenvector components of the girder force transfer matrix. Two bending moments are transmitted by the unit cell of the girder: one is caused by the couple of axial forces applied on each nodal section of the beam, the other is due to the moments present at the nodes of each ones by the adjacent cells and is modelled as the resultant of the micro-polar moments. The Transfer force eigenvector analysis bring out that the unit cell bends maintaining the webs undeformed. This property allows evaluating both the bending stiffnesses and the equivalent material micro-polar scale parameter with straightforward equations. The results of the homogenization procedure proposed are tested by comparison with litera-ture data and with the the outcomes of the analysis of a series of girders carried out by the finite element method...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{existing}} methods, {{suitable for the}} analysis of periodic structures are reviewed. Most of these methods are related to the well known Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). It is seen that TMM, though efficient, suffers from a number of numerical stability problems which will prevent a solution being obtained in certain circumstances. Two lines of approach are selected for further development which make both numerical stability and solution efficiency possible. The first is an algebraic solution of the governing difference equations known as the Matrix Difference Method (MDM). Existing closed form solutions by MDM are given for box girders and for beams on elastic supports with axial and transverse loading. The latter is used for a parametric study and in the analysis of U-frame bridges. MDM is also used to investigate the characteristics of <b>vierendeel</b> <b>girders,</b> tall building frames and a counterbraced truss. An upper limit of problem size for MDM analysis is suggested. The second approach to periodic structure analysis is a numerical one in which the structure is modelled using finite elements. A new general method {{for the analysis of}} infinitely long periodic structures, the Deflection Transfer Matrix Method (DTMM), is developed. The method involves an iterative procedure, similar to Gaussian elimination, to find the reduced structure stiffness matrix. DTMM is programmed in FORTRAN and is interfaced with a comprehensive finite element program (LUSAS). Results for the analysis of a closed cylindrical shell and an infinite plate on elastic subgrade are compared with F. E. and published solutions. The method is appraised and suggestions for further developments are given in detail. Extending the numerical approach to finite length periodic structures, an eigenvalue method, used previously for the static analysis of deep beams, is developed. The theory is extended to make it general and the method is programmed in FORTRAN and interfaced with LUSAS. Results are obtained for deep beams and a large coupled shear wall, comparison being made with a normal F. E. solution and existing experimental and TMM solutions. The method (EST) is found to be versatile, stable and efficient. Suggestions for further development are made...|$|R
