Firstly, calculate the natural frequency and displacement of the machine foundation system subjected to the vibration load by dynamic load to avoid resonance, and design to satisfy the allowable displacement given from the machine manufacturer. Next, the strength, stability and ground bearing capacity of the Machine foundation based on static load are evaluated, and in this case, the pseudo-static design considering the additional dynamic load is made up. In general, because the <b>vibration</b> <b>machine</b> foundation has very small amplitude, most of the studies have been performed with respect to the soil-spring-damper model for evaluating the resonance phenomenon of the <b>vibration</b> <b>machine</b> by vibration load rather than the evaluation of the bearing capacity by vibration load [3, 7, 9, 10]. However, because the design criteria or theory that calculate the vertical and horizontal bearing capacity of the <b>vibration</b> <b>Machine</b> foundation by considering the dynamic load, were not clearly established until now, it is the real state that the construction has been performed by a conservative design method.|$|E
