50|$|Traditional {{nunchaku}} {{are made}} from a strong, flexible hardwood such as oak, loquat or pasania. Originally, the wood would be submerged in mud for several years, where lack of oxygen and optimal acidity would prevent rotting and cause the wood to harden. The rope is made from horsehair. Finally, the wood is very finely sanded and rubbed with an oil or stain for preservation. Today, such nunchaku are often <b>varnished</b> <b>or</b> <b>painted</b> for display purposes. This practice tends to reduce the grip and make the weapon harder to handle, and is therefore not advised for combat.|$|E
5000|$|The lead of {{the pencil}} {{is a mix of}} finely ground {{graphite}} and clay powders. Before the two substances are mixed, they are separately cleaned of foreign matter and dried in a manner that creates large square cakes. Once the cakes have fully dried, the graphite and the clay squares are mixed together using water. The amount of clay content added to the graphite depends on the intended pencil hardness (lower proportions of clay makes the core softer), and {{the amount of time spent}} on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead. The mixture is then shaped into long spaghetti-like strings, straightened, dried, cut, and then tempered in a kiln. The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax, which seeps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil. A juniper or incense-cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a [...] "slat," [...] and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves. Another grooved plank is glued on top, and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencils, which are then <b>varnished</b> <b>or</b> <b>painted.</b> Many pencils feature an eraser on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point. Each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a metal ferrule to be secured onto the wood. A rubber plug is then inserted into the ferrule for a functioning eraser on the end of the pencil.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the wood}} surface is {{prepared}} and stained, the finish is applied. It usually consists of several coats of wax, shellac, drying oil, lacquer, <b>varnish,</b> <b>or</b> <b>paint,</b> and each coat is typically followed by sanding.|$|R
5000|$|Non-"drying" [...] waxes, such as hard-film carnauba or paste wax, and resins, such as dammar, copal, and shellac, {{consist of}} long, spaghetti-like strands of {{hydrocarbon}} molecules, which interlace and compact {{but do not}} form covalent bonds {{in the manner of}} drying oils. Thus, waxes and resins are re-dissoluble whereas a cured oil <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> <b>paint</b> is not.|$|R
40|$|Dried varnish {{is rich in}} many ester moieties, {{which may}} {{be broken down into}} small, soluble {{compounds}} by esterase activity or alkaline hydrolysis. Two methods for varnish removal have been developed, including the treatment of either lipase or RbOH / PEG- 400 crown ether which allow aged oil <b>varnishes</b> <b>or</b> <b>paint</b> coverings to be removed or thinned. These techniques are designed to proceed in a controlled manner without damaging lower <b>paint</b> <b>or</b> base layers. Unfortunately, lipase did not react with the aged ester groups of dried linseed oil varnish. Surprisingly, the varnish came off in the presence of Tris buffer alone which, in addition, formed reactive metal complexes. A better choice was the use of high Mr alkali ion polyethylene glycol– 400 (PEG- 400) crown ether type chelates. PEG- 400 complexes alkali ions including rubidium and other alkaliions impeding the diffusion of their basic counter ions into lower <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> <b>paint</b> layers. Possible migration of alkali metal ions into the paint layer during alkaline varnish removal was determined by labelling the cleansing solutions with 86 Rb. Fortunately, varnish is degraded on the surface only. Lower <b>paint</b> <b>or</b> <b>varnish</b> layers are not attacked even if chemically similar to the <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> over <b>painting</b> to be removed as virtually no 86 Rb was detected on the paint surface...|$|R
50|$|The word lacquer {{refers to}} quick-drying, {{solvent-based}} <b>varnishes</b> <b>or</b> <b>paints.</b> Although their names may be similarly derived, lacquer {{is not the}} same as shellac and is not dissolved in alcohol. Lacquer is dissolved in lacquer thinner, which is a highly flammable solvent typically containing butyl acetate and xylene or toluene. Lacquer is typically sprayed on, within a spray booth that evacuates overspray and minimizes the risk of combustion.|$|R
40|$|While OCT {{has been}} applied to the {{non-invasive}} examination of the stratigraphy of paint layers in recent years, it has been recognized that the resolutions of commercially available OCT cannot compete in depth resolution with conventional microscopic examination of cross-sections of paint samples. It is necessary to achieve resolutions better than 3 microns to resolve the thinnest layers of paint and varnish. In this paper, we demonstrate a Fourier domain ultrahigh resolution OCT at 810 nm with depth resolution of 1. 8 μm in air (or 1. 2 μm in <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> <b>paint)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Kamptulicon was {{manufactured}} by sprinkling powdered cork on to thin bands of rubber, {{which was then}} rolled and rerolled until thoroughly mixed. It was then coated on one or both sides with linseed oil <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> oil <b>paint.</b> Powdered sulphur was also sometimes mixed in, and the material then heated to produce a form of vulcanized kamptulicon.|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{coaches were}} {{finished}} in <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> brown <b>paint</b> until the blue livery {{was introduced in}} 1901. As on the locomotives this weathered badly and from 1905 the MGWR reverted to brown, which after 1910 was not so well-adorned with lining. From October 1918 coaches were painted a very dark Crimson and after 1924 the GSR used a similar shade for some years.|$|R
50|$|That {{more or less}} {{finishes}} the boatbuilder's work but the painter has yet to <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> <b>paint</b> it. At stages along the way, he will have been called in to prime the timber, particularly immediately before the timbering is done. The boatbuilder will clean up {{the inside of the}} planking and the painter will prime it and probably more, partly because it is easier that way and partly so as to put some preservative on the planking behind the timbers. Similarly, it is best to have the varnishing done after the fittings are fitted but before they are shipped. Thus, the keel band will be shaped and drilled and the screw holes drilled in the wood of keel and stem then the band will be put aside while the varnishing is done.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally made of wood, carved signs {{allow for}} the most {{creativity}} in terms of painting, shape, and sculpture. Western red cedar and redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is most common, although cherry and oak are also used along {{with a range of}} darker tropical woods. Wood requires regular maintenance and repeated coats of <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> <b>paint.</b> More recently developed synthetic materials, notably high-density urethane (HDU), have been extremely successful, allowing the same quality and craftsmanship coupled with a much greater weather resistance. Carved signs have been a traditional icon of the New England states in the USA, and are frequently also gilded with real gold. Traditional hand carving techniques are still used to create carved signs, although CNC routers are sometimes employed, and some sites exist which allow users to design their own sign prior to having it hand carved.|$|R

Firing is done on a small comal (platter for cooking tortillas) which is covered by a clay bowl. After firing the pieces are initially painted with homemade tempura paints which leave a matte finish. The final touches of facial features are done with <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> dark <b>paint.</b> Each piece is unique.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} 10 years, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has been {{successfully}} applied to art conservation, history and archaeology. OCT {{has the potential to}} become a routine non-invasive tool in museums allowing cross-section imaging anywhere on an intact object where there are no other methods of obtaining subsurface information. While current commercial OCTs have shown potential in this field, they are still limited in depth resolution (> 4 μm in paint and varnish) compared to conventional microscopic examination of sampled paint cross-sections (~ 1 μm). An ultrahigh resolution fiber-based Fourier domain optical coherence tomography system with a constant axial resolution of 1. 2 μm in <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> <b>paint</b> throughout a depth range of 1. 5 mm has been developed. While Fourier domain OCT of similar resolution has been demonstrated recently, the sensitivity roll-off of some of these systems are still significant. In contrast, this current system achieved a sensitivity roll-off that is less than 2 dB over a 1. 2 mm depth range with an incident power of ~ 1 mW on the sample. The high resolution and sensitivity of the system makes it convenient to image thin varnish and glaze layers with unprecedented contrast. The non-invasive 'virtual' cross-section images obtained with the system show the thin varnish layers with similar resolution in the depth direction but superior clarity in the layer interfaces when compared with conventional optical microscope images of actual paint sample cross-sections obtained microdestructively...|$|R
2500|$|The palaces {{and noble}} {{home of the}} Aztecs had ornate furniture. Entire pieces of {{hardwoods}} would be carved into benches and tables, and other items. Furniture was inlaid with gold and some covered in animal skins. [...] A kind of shellac or lacquer existed in pre-Hispanic Mexico and was used in many ceramics. The Mendocino Codex mentions {{it as a kind}} of waterproof oil extracted from a worm called “axe” and mixed with oil from the prickly poppy seed or Mexican sage seed and pigments, which resulted in a paint. After the Conquest, the Spanish demanded European style furniture, which was usually made by indigenous craftsmen. As colonial Mexico was Spain’s gateway to Asia, oriental techniques such as parquetry and other types of inlay became common as well. The state of Michoacán is a major producer of handcrafted furniture, which can be simply <b>varnished</b> <b>or</b> stained <b>or</b> <b>painted</b> in bright colors.|$|R

30|$|Paint layers vary in {{thickness}} between 3.5  µm to over 25  µm, with no highly pastose regions visible. Examination {{of paint}} layering structure in cross sections {{found no evidence}} of an intermediary ground layer between the two paintings, confirming that The Blue Room was painted directly on top of the hidden portrait. A lack of <b>varnish</b> <b>or</b> dirt between <b>paint</b> layers supports the hypothesis that The Blue Room was painted within a relatively short time after the portrait. With one exception (sample X 2; see Additional file 1 : Table S 1 for discussion), the cross-sectional data show clear stratigraphy and no mixing between upper and lower paint layers. This strongly suggests the underlying painting had time to dry before The Blue Room was painted on top of it. This can be seen in sample X 10 taken {{from the center of the}} bed (see detail, Fig.  3 b), where the border between the buried red/yellow layer and white surface layers is distinct, with no bleeding of the underlying colors into the upper layer. A stunning example of the difference between the two paintings is seen in sample X 21, where the layers of the hidden painting are variegated mixtures of yellow, blue, green, and white, mixed wet-into-wet on the canvas. These are topped by a thin, smooth, blue surface layer that is a well-blended mixture with zinc white and Prussian blue. In general, one finds more wet-into-wet mixing in the underlying layers and more blended paint mixtures in the surface layers. These differences are discussed in more detail below, in the section “Picasso’s palette and use of color”.|$|R
