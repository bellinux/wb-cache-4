5|$|On May 18, 1980, a major <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> {{occurred}} at Mount St. Helens, a volcano located in Skamania County, {{in the state}} of Washington, United States. The eruption (a VEI 5 event) was the most significant <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California. It has often been declared as the most disastrous <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> in United States history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.|$|E
5|$|A large <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> {{from any}} volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field would have major {{effects on the}} Sea-to-Sky Highway and {{municipalities}} such as Squamish, Whistler, Pemberton and probably Vancouver. Because of these concerns, the Geological Survey of Canada is planning to create hazard maps and emergency plans for Mount Cayley, as well as Mount Meager north of the volcanic field, which experienced a major <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> 2,350years ago similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{from the}} {{eruption}} {{was estimated at}} $160 million, the second costliest <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> in United States history.|$|E
50|$|Seafloor {{exploration}} {{has discovered}} that more <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> occur {{at the bottom of}} the sea than on land. However, the effects of ambient water and hydrostatic pressure on silicic <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> in subaqueous settings are not entirely understood because deep marine eruptions are not directly observed and studied. Because of this, information of recent deep-water <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> are still incomplete and limited.|$|R
40|$|<b>Volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> disturb {{directly}} and indirectly the ecosystems {{and the health of}} the exposed populations. Hazards include, among others, toxic volcanic ashes with diameters < 10 μm (PM 10). During <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> and their immediate aftermath, increased respiratory system morbidity has been observed as well as mortality among those affected by <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions.</b> Unfavorable health effects could partly be prevented by timely application of safety measures.

40|$|Dust ejected {{into the}} high {{atmosphere}} during explosive <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> has been considered as a possible cause for climatic change. Dust veils created by <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> can {{reduce the amount of}} light reaching the Earth`s surface and can cause reductions in surface temperatures. These climatic effects can be seen for several years following some eruptions and the magnitude and duration of the effects depend largely on the density or amount of tephra (i. e. dust) ejected, the latitude of injection, and atmospheric circulation patterns. Lamb (1970) formulated the Dust Veil Index (DVI) in an attempt to quantify the impact on the Earth`s energy balance of changes in atmospheric composition due to explosive <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions.</b> The DVI is a numerical index that quantifies the impact on the Earth`s energy balance of changes in atmospheric composition due to explosive <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions.</b> The DVI is a numerical index that quantifies the impact of a particular <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> release of dust and aerosols over the years following the event. The DVI for any <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> are available and have been used in estimating Lamb`s dust veil indices...|$|R
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{recorded}} <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> was between 1820 and 1854, but many eyewitnesses reported eruptive activity in 1858, 1870, 1879, 1882 and 1894 as well.|$|E

5|$|Even though {{earthquake}} swarms can be dangerous, {{scientists are}} able to model such events to analyze their structure. During the earthquake swarm in 2007, {{a group of scientists}} investigated the possibility that a <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, scientists with the United States Geological Survey, the University of Washington, and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko earthquakes probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone. However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko earthquakes, no <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> is likely. Other recent earthquakes in North America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> include the 2003 earthquakes under Lake Tahoe in the U.S. state of California and a 2004 earthquake swarm at Jordan Craters in the U.S. state of Oregon.|$|E
50|$|Between 1972 and 1991, twenty-nine <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> were recorded, {{mostly on}} Java. The two most violent <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{in modern times}} {{occurred}} in Indonesia; in 1815 Mount Tambora in Sumbawa erupted killing 92,000 and in 1883, Krakatau, erupted killing 36,000.|$|R
40|$|Using the dataset {{provided}} by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program, we have extracted the large <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> (<b>volcanic</b> explosivity index >= 4) from the period 1750 - 2010 and have then analyzed the main characteristics of large <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> since 1750 according to their geographic latitudes, their elevations, and the years and months in which they occurred. The results show that most large <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> were located around {{the margins of the}} Pacific Ocean and the islands of Sumatra and Java, especially in the equatorial regions (10 degrees N- 10 degrees S). Large <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> were concentrated at 1000 - 2000 m elevations and in the months of January and April. There were more eruptions in the summer half-year (from April to September) than in the winter half-year (from October to the next March) : Large <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> have interdecadal fluctuations, including cycles of 15 - 25 years and 35 - 50 years, which were detected by Morlet wavelet analysis, with the fluctuations being more frequent after 1870 than before. During the periods 1750 - 1760, 1776 - 1795, 1811 - 1830, 1871 - 1890, 1911 - 1920 and 1981 - 1995, there were relatively many large <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Indonesia's {{population}} has been increasing rapidly since the 1815 eruption, reaching 222 million in 2006, of which 130 million were living on Java. A new <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> as large as 1815 probably would cause catastrophic devastation with many more fatalities.|$|E
5|$|The latest <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> {{created a}} small tree-covered basaltic cinder cone {{at the east}} end of Kostal Lake called Kostal Cone perhaps as {{recently}} as 400 years ago, {{making it one of the}} youngest volcanoes in Canada based on tree-growth data.|$|E
5|$|Reid Turner Blackburn (August 11, 1952 – May 18, 1980) was a {{photographer}} {{killed in the}} 1980 <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> of Mount St. Helens. A photojournalist covering the eruption for a local newspaper—the Vancouver, Washington Columbian—as well as National Geographic magazine and the United States Geological Survey, he was caught at Coldwater Camp in the blast.|$|E

5|$|Built {{on top of}} an {{alluvial}} fan that had been host to historic lahars, the town was previously destroyed by a <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> in 1595 and by mudflows in 1845. In the 1595 eruption, three distinct Plinian eruptions produced lahars that claimed the lives of 636people. During the 1845 event, 1,000people were killed by earthquake-generated mudflows near the Magdalena River.|$|E
5|$|Further hazards {{exist in}} the form of snowpack on about half of the volcanoes; under the {{influence}} of pyroclastic flows, the snowpack can melt, generating dangerous lahars such as the one generated by the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia. This eruption claimed 23,000 fatalities, and lahars are a major cause of <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> associated fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint.

5|$|In 2008, the British Antarctic Survey {{reported}} a <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> under the Antarctica ice sheet 2,200 years ago. It {{is believed to}} be that this was the biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years. Volcanic ash deposits from the volcano were identified through an airborne radar survey, buried under later snowfalls in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Large {{explosive}} eruptions in {{the southern}} segment of the Southern Volcanic Zone occur on average every 725 years, and tephras from volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone have been transported over large distances.

5|$|Subglacial eruptions are {{a type of}} <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> {{characterized}} by interactions between lava and ice, often under a glacier. The nature of glaciovolcanism dictates that it occurs at areas of high latitude and high altitude.

This meltwater mix means that subglacial eruptions often generate dangerous jökulhlaups (floods) and lahars.|$|E
