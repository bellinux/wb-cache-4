6000|$|We shall {{suppose that}} most of our readers are {{sufficiently}} acquainted with the general character of that class of animals to which the whale belongs, to know {{that all of the}} genus breathe the atmospheric air, which is as necessary for life to them as it is to man himself. The only difference in this respect is, that the whale can go longer without renewing his respiration than all purely land-animals, though he must come up to breathe at intervals, or die. It is the exhaling of the old stock of air, when he brings the [...] "blow-holes," [...] as seamen call the outlets of his respiratory organs, to the surface, that forces the water upward, and forms the [...] "spouts," [...] which usually indicate to the whalers the position of their game. The [...] "spouts" [...] vary in appearance, as has been mentioned, owing to the number and situation of the orifices by which the exhausted air escapes. No sooner is the <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> exhaled, than the lungs receive a new supply; and the animal either remains near the surface, rolling about and sporting amid the waves, or descends again, a short distance, in quest of its food. This food, also, varies materially in the different species. The right-whale is supposed to live on what may be termed marine insects, or the molluscæ of the ocean, which it is thought he obtains by running in the parts of the sea where they most abound; arresting them by the hairy fibres which grow on the laminæ of bone that, in a measure, compose his jaws, having no teeth. The spermaceti, however, is furnished with regular grinders, which he knows very well how to use, and with which he often crushes the boats of those who come against him. Thus, the whalers have but one danger to guard against, in assaulting the common animal, viz., his flukes, or tail; while the spermaceti, in addition to the last means of defence, possesses those of his teeth or jaws. As this latter animal is quite one-third head, he has no very great dissemblance to the alligator in this particular.|$|E

The experiment was done in Lewis' Planar Reacting Shear Layer facility, which was adapted to accept a lobed mixer {{in addition to the}} original planar tip. A graduate student at MIT provided the mixer design concept, and Lewis provided the engineering, operations, and research expertise.

The data showed that the lobed mixer consumed the reactants between 3 to 10 times faster than a corresponding planar shear layer. The figure shows the dramatic difference in the measured temperature distribution with and without the lobed mixer.

40|$|The 2, 7 km long Saukopf-tunnel in Weinheim (Germany) is {{operated}} with bidirectional traffic and ventilated using a transverse ventilation system. This incorporates a continuous smoke extraction that enables {{to extract the}} smoke over the half or the entire tunnel length. In addition, the <b>vitiated</b> tunnel <b>air</b> can be extracted {{from the middle of}} the tunnel using the point extraction that can also perform smoke extraction. Due to the enforcement of the new German guideline on tunnel equipment of road tunnels (RABT- 2003 [1]), the ventilation system has to be upgraded in order to cater for the more onerous requirements for the fire case. The distributed smoke extraction is to be replaced with localised smoke extraction using remote controlled dampers. Furthermore during the smoke extraction, a control of the longitudinal flow is recommended. In this tunnel with bidirectional traffic, the most efficient smoke extraction is obtained, if the smoke is extracted such that air flows equally from both sides of the fire towards the extraction point situated above the fire. In order to enable a regulation of the longitudinal flow, new ventilation systems typically use jet fans. However due to civil constraints, this would be difficult to realize for this tunnel and consequently alternatives have been considered. One method is to enable air supply as well as extraction at the current middle extraction point. Furthermore, when smoke is extracted in one half of the tunnel, fresh air could be supplied in the other half. With these means, the flow velocity at the location of the fire can be influenced favourably. In the present work, the theoretical framework for the control of the flow velocity using a punctual air supply or exhaust is developed. The analysis is tested by conducting one-dimensional non-stationary calculations with the in-house computer program SPRINT. Using a scenario approach, the concept for the control routines has been simulated, evaluated and optimised...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{capture and}} {{sequestration}} of CO 2 {{will be necessary}} to mitigate CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel (coal, oil, natural gas or biomass) power generation facilities in a carbon constrained world. Post combustion carbon capture is a viable technology alternative to reduce CO 2 emissions from power plants in the short term. The CO 2 concentration in the exhaust gases of natural fired power plants can be increased through exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). A joint CO 2 Capture Project (CCP) and GE study of the Best Integrated Technology (BIT) shows that EGR enables reduced exhaust gas flow to the post combustion capture plant and cost of the CO 2 capture. This paper describes the experimental work performed at General Electric Global Research Center in order to better understand the risks of utilizing EGR in combination with dry low NOx (DLN) combustors. A research combustor was developed for exploring the dry low emissions capability of nozzles to operate in low O 2 environment. A series of experiments have been conducted at representative gas turbine pressures and temperatures, in an EGR test rig. Exhaust gas generated in a first stage, at pressure, is used to <b>vitiate</b> the fresh <b>air</b> to levels determined by cycle models. Experimental results include the effect of applying EGR on operability, efficiency and emissions performance under conditions of up to 30 % EGR (low oxygen). Our findings confirm the feasibility of EGR for enhanced CO 2 capture, exceeding the expectations of operability and combustion efficiency predicted by models.

Lastly, the vessel has a pipette for drinking through, and a larger hole by which it is to be filled, and which at other times is stopped with a cork or wooden plug. When drinking out of the pipette, the cork must be loosened in order to admit air, like a vent hole. Macintosh bags, for wine or water, are very convenient to carry and they will remain water-tight for a long period when fairly used. (Mem.--Oil and grease are as fatal to macintosh as they are to iron rust.) But the taste that these vessels impart to their contents is abominable, not only at first but for a very long time; in two-thirds of them it is never to be got rid of. Never believe shopkeepers in an india-rubber shop, in their assurances to the contrary; they are incompetent to judge aright, for their senses seem <b>vitiated</b> by the <b>air</b> they live in.

The primary goal is to evaluate the effects of H 2 O and CO 2, the two major vitiated species generated by combustion heater, on hydrogen-fueled supersonic combustor performance with experimental and numerical approaches. The comparative experiments in the clean air and <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> are conducted by using the resistance heated direct-connected facility, with the typical Mach 4 flight conditions simulated. The H 2 O and CO 2 species with accurately controlled contents {{are added to the}} high enthalpy clean air from resistance heater, to synthesize the <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> of a combustion-type heater. Typically, the contents of H 2 O species can be varied within the range of 3. 5 %– 30 % by mole, and 3. 0 %– 10 % for CO 2 species. The total temperature, total pressure, Mach number and O 2 mole fraction at the combustor entrance are well-matched between the clean air and <b>vitiated</b> <b>air.</b> The combustion experiments are completed at the fuel equivalence ratios of 0. 53 and 0. 42 respectively. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3 D) reacting flow simulations of combustor flowpath are performed to provide insight into flow field structures and combustion chemistry details that cannot resolved by experimental instruments available. Finally, the experimental data, combined with computational results, are employed to analyze the effects of H 2 O and CO 2 <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> on supersonic combustion characteristics and performance. It is concluded that H 2 O and CO 2 contaminants can significantly inhibit the combustion induced pressure rise measured from combustor wall, and the pressure profile decreases with the increasing H 2 O and CO 2 contents in nonlinear trend; simulation results agree well with experimental data and the overall vitiation effects are captured; direct extrapolation of the results from <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> to predict the performance of actual flight conditions could result in over-fueling the combustor, possible inlet un-start and inappropriate combustion mode transition.

40|$|A second-order parabolized Navier-Stokes {{algorithm}} {{based on}} the MacCormack (1969) explicit scheme is used to study three-dimensional chemically reacting flows with finite-rate chemistry. The method can treat the chemical source term implicitly, and it accounts for the multicomponent diffusion and convection of the chemical species. The method is demonstrated with the nonreacting case of a Mach- 3 flow over a double-wedge compression corner and the case of streamwise hydrogen injection at sonic velocity in a Mach- 2. 44 <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> stream...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{study was}} performed using axisymmetric nozzle and tubular opposed jet burners {{to measure the}} effects of laminar plug flow and parabolic input velocity profiles on the extinction limits of H 2 -air counterflow diffusion flames. Extinction limits were quantified by 'flame strength', (average axial air jet velocity) at blowoff of the central flame. The effects of key air contaminants, on the extinction limits, are characterized and analyzed relative to utilization of combustion contaminated <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> in high enthalpy supersonic test facilities...|$|E

A modern computer based automatic data acquisition/control system was {{installed at the}} Department of Aeronautics' Combustion Laboratory. This system utilizes an HP- 85 desktop computer as system controller for the HP- 3054 A data acquisition system. These major control applications include: (1) particle size determination by measurement of scattered laser light, (2) a <b>vitiated</b> <b>air</b> heater system, and (3) a solid fuel ramjet test unit. Details involving specific data acquisition/control techniques for these applications are discussed. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
