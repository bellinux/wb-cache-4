40|$|Abstract: The {{temporal}} {{stability and}} static calibration {{and analysis of}} the Velodyne HDL- 64 E S 2 scanning LiDAR system is discussed and analyzed. The mathematical model for measurements for the HDL- 64 E S 2 scanner is updated to include misalignments between the angular encoder and scanner axis of rotation, which are found to be a marginally significant source of error. It is reported that the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> laser <b>offsets</b> cannot reliably be obtained with the current calibration model due to their high correlation with the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>offsets.</b> By analyzing observations from two separate HDL- 64 E S 2 scanners {{it was found that the}} temporal stability of the horizontal angle offset is near the quantization level of the encoder, but the <b>vertical</b> angular <b>offset,</b> distance offset and distance scale are slightly larger than expected. This is felt to be due to long term variations in the scanner range, whose root cause is as of yet unidentified. Nevertheless, a temporally averaged calibration dataset for each of the scanners resulted in a 25 % improvement in the 3 D planar misclosure residual RMSE over the standard factory calibration model...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the surgical methods of Helveston syndrome. METHODS: Fifteen cases(30 eyes) with Helveston syndrome were studied. Surgical method was selected {{according to the}} degree of superior oblique muscle overaction and dissociated vertical deviation(DVD). RESULTS: Binocular superior oblique intrathecal tenectomy was performed in 8 patients(16 eyes). Follow-up period after surgery was 1 - 3 a. Those 8 patients got A-sign correction, of which 3 patients(6 eyes) got DVD vanished and 5 patients(10 eyes) got DVD alleviation. None of the 8 cases needed another operation for DVD. Binocular superior rectus recession and binocular lateral rectus recession with <b>vertical</b> <b>offsets</b> was performed in 4 patients(8 eyes). Follow-up period after surgery was 1 - 3 a. The 4 patients got A sign correction and with orthophoria, of which 1 patient(2 eyes) got DVD vanished and 3 patients(6 eyes) got DVD alleviation. None of the 4 cases needed another operation for DVD. Binocular lateral rectus recession and <b>vertical</b> <b>offsets</b> was performed in 3 patients(6 eyes). Follow-up period after surgery was half a year, with orthophoria, no A sign, DVD weakened, and no second operation was needed.

30|$|We mapped surface {{ruptures}} {{associated with}} the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence and measured their displacement using measuring tapes, leveling staffs, and handheld laser rangefinders. Here, we report slip measurements in terms of strike-slip and vertical components, {{because most of the}} surface ruptures had predominantly dextral strike-slip or <b>vertical</b> <b>offsets</b> with little extension. Only surface ruptures along the northeastern part of the Futagawa segment had a significant extensional component. Near the Takaki area on the Takano-Shirahata segment, we measured displacements twice (April 16 and 28) after the mainshock to assess possible afterslip.|$|R
50|$|This zone has two parts: the 40 km long Chon-Aksu segment and the 34 km long Aksu segment. Along the Chon-Aksu valley the {{movement}} was dominantly reverse in type along a 60° north-dipping reverse fault, with up to 10.5 m vertical displacement and at most 1 m horizontal displacement, {{from the lack of}} observed offset of river thalwegs. The outcrop pattern of the Aksu segment rupture indicates a low-angle thrust, possibly steepening with depth, with a maximum <b>vertical</b> <b>offset</b> or 3 - 5 m, decreasing steadily to the east. In total about 200 km of fault surfaces ruptured, although there was no visible faulting joining the two main rupture zones.|$|E
50|$|For {{convenience}} the Rocky Mountain Trench may {{be divided}} into two sections, the Northern Rocky Mountain Trench and Southern Rocky Mountain Trench. The dividing point reflects the separation of north and easterly flows to the Arctic Ocean versus south and westerly flows to the Pacific Ocean. A break in the valley system at ~54°N near Prince George, British Columbia may be used for this purpose. The northern portion of the Trench is dominated by strike-slip faulting, while {{the southern part of the}} Trench was created by normal faults. Despite differences in timing and faulting styles of the northern and southern portions, they were aligned with each other because faulting for both was controlled by a pre-existing, west-facing, deep basement ramp with over 10 km of <b>vertical</b> <b>offset.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike many {{oil fields}} in central California, the Russell Ranch field {{is not an}} {{anticlinal}} formation with an obvious surface expression - indeed the geologic formation containing oil is quite invisible from the ground surface, being covered with alluvium and masked by the mountain ranges running almost perpendicular to the oil field. The oil is in a large homocline, including porous sedimentary units dipping northeast and essentially planar, which terminate at the Russell Fault, a normal fault with an approximately 1000 ft <b>vertical</b> <b>offset</b> which has barricaded upwards movement of hydrocarbons against impermeable rock of Pliocene age. The oil-bearing rocks in the homocline - the Santa Margarita and Vaqueros Formations, of late and early Miocene age respectively - are sandstones with a porosity of between 23 and 32 percent.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{simplified}} {{implementation of the}} Concentric Mosaics image-based rendering technique is proposed. The greatest difficulty for an ordinary user in obtaining the pre-captured images {{for use in the}} Concentric Mosaics technique is the precise control of the rotation of a long beam. In the proposed Simplified Concentric Mosaics technique, the camera positions where the pre-captured images will be taken are not precisely controlled, but are estimated from the pre-captured images. We use a stereo technique for estimation of camera positions in this special scenario instead of using the traditional camera pose estimation methods of computer vision. The estimation errors have been analyzed and a closed-loop constraint is used to achieve better rotation angle estimation. In addition, a ratio fitting technique is proposed to select good matching features in the special tri-view matching detection scenario, which subsequently improves rotation angle estimation. Another contribution of the paper is a pre-processing step to eliminate or reduce the possible <b>vertical</b> <b>offsets</b> and other distortions in the pre-captured images, which are caused by any possible motions of the camera that deviate from the ideal one. In a column-based view synthesis technique like the proposed method and the conventional Concentric Mosaics technique, these <b>vertical</b> <b>offsets</b> and distortions in the pre-captured images will lower the quality of the synthesized images. Thus our pre-processing can be applied on both the proposed method and the ordinar...|$|R
40|$|We {{carried out}} geomorphologic and {{geological}} investigations in a south-eastern tributary {{valley of the}} Tiber River in Rome, the Grottaperfetta valley, aimed to reconstruct its buried geometry. Since results of the geomorphologic study disclosed anomalies of the stream beds, we performed geoelectric and boreholes prospecting to check whether recent faulting, rather than an inherited structural control, possibly contributed {{to the evolution of}} the alluvial valley. <b>Vertical</b> <b>offsets</b> of the stratigraphic horizons across adjacent boreholes were evidenced within the Late Pleistocene-Holocene alluvium and its substratum. In order to Rile out the effects of irregular geometry of the alluvial deposits, we focussed on sectors where <b>vertical</b> <b>offsets</b> affected all the stratigraphic horizons (alluvium and pre-Holocene substratum), showing an increasing displacement with depth. We identified a site where repeated displacements occur coupled with a lateral variation of soil resistivity, and we drilled an oblique borehole aimed to cross and sample the possible fault zone affecting the terrain. A 7 cm thick granular layer, inclined 50 degrees divided by 70 degrees on the horizontal, was recovered 5 m b. g., and interpreted as the filling material of a fracture. The convergence of the reported features with independent evidence from geoelectric and geomorphologic investigations led its to hypothesize the presence of a faulting zone within the Holocene alluvial terrains and to propose the excavation of a trench to verify this hypothesis...|$|R
