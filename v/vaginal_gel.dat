40|$|Objective: A generic <b>vaginal</b> {{progesterone}} <b>gel</b> {{has recently}} been developed in China. Little is known about its pharmacokinetic properties in Chinese subjects. The purpose of our {{study was to investigate}} the pharmacokinetics of three forms of <b>vaginal</b> progesterone <b>gel</b> (test formulations at 4 and 8 % strength vs. a reference formulation: Crinone 8 %) in Chinese healthy post-menopausal women. Methods: This study consisted of two parts study. The part 1 study was a single-center, open-label, 3 -period study. Twelve healthy post-menopausal women were to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of 45 mg <b>vaginal</b> progesterone <b>gel</b> (Test 4 %) following single dose and multiple doses administered once every other day (q. o. d.) for six times or once daily (q. d.) for 6 days. The part 2 study was a randomized, open-label, 3 -stage crossover study. Twelve post-menopausal women received 90 mg <b>vaginal</b> progesterone <b>gel</b> (Test 8 %) or 90 mg Crinone (Reference 8 %) following single dose and multiple doses (q. o. d. or q. d.). Plasma concentrations of progesterone were measured up to 72 h by using a validated liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry method. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) from time zero to last measurable concentration (AUC 0 -t) and extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0 -∞) were compared by an analysis of variance using log-transformed data. Results: Totally 24 subjects were enrolled in and completed the study. Following single dose, The geometric mean Cmax values for Test 4 %, Test 8 %, and Crinone 8 % were 6. 35, 10. 34, 10. 45 ng/mL, and their geometric mean AUC 0 -t (AUC 0 -∞) were 113. 73 (118. 00), 169. 39 (173. 98), and 190. 07 (201. 13) ng⋅h/mL, respectively. The mean T 1 / 2 values of progesterone were 11. 00, 10. 92, and 11. 40 h, respectively. For 8 % test formulation vs. reference, the 90 % CIs of the least squares mean test/reference ratios of Cmax, AUC 0 -t, and AUC 0 -∞ were 78. 32 – 124. 85 %, 54. 31 – 146. 24 %, and 53. 64 – 137. 75, respectively. The most frequent adverse events were increased vaginal secretions, most of which were of mild intensity and considered related to treatment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{strategies for}} reducing HIV-virion transport to mucosal surfaces to prevent HIV infection. Infection requires contact between HIV and an infectable cell, so any means of inhibiting this step {{could contribute to}} HIV prevention. Our goals were to quantify the effects of strategies that reduce transport of HIV virions and to evaluate them {{in the context of}} HIV prevention. We used fundamental transport theory to design two basic strategies: (1) modifying the effective radius of virions; and (2) modifying the native medium through which virions diffuse. We proposed to implement these strategies using (1) anti-HIV antibodies that would bind and aggregate virions and (2) topically-applied semi-solid <b>gels</b> that coat <b>vaginal</b> epithelial surfaces. We measured diffusion coefficients of HIV virions and HIV-like particles in the presence of antibodies and within semi-solid gels. In experiments with antibodies, we did not observe reductions in the diffusion coefficients. In experiments using particle tracking to measure the diffusion coefficients of virions in <b>vaginal</b> <b>gels,</b> we found that the diffusion coefficients in gels were approximately 10, 000 times lower than those in water. We proceeded to evaluate the potential for semi-solid gels to prevent HIV transmission at mucosal surfaces. From previous experiments in our lab that characterized the topical deployment of <b>vaginal</b> <b>gels</b> in vivo, we know that <b>vaginal</b> <b>gels</b> form an uneven coating on the epithelium with gel layer thicknesses of the order of hundreds of microns. Thus, we determined whether semi-solid gels could function as physical barriers to HIV when deployed as thin, incomplete layers on the epithelium. We developed an experimental system to test the barrier functioning of thin gel layers. We applied thin gel layers to the porous membrane of a Transwell system, and added a solution of HIV to the top compartment. After incubation, samples were assayed for levels of HIV. We found that thin gel layers reduced levels of HIV in the bottom compartment compared to controls where no gel had been applied: There was a log reduction in levels of HIV in conditions where gel layers of approximately 150 μm thickness had been applied to the membrane after 0 -, 4 -, and 8 -hour incubation. Thus, it appears possible for gel layers of thicknesses found in vivo to function as physical barriers to HIV over biologically-relevant time scales. We studied how nonuniform deployment of semi-solid gels affects accumulation of virions in tissue using a mathematical model. We used transport theory to develop a model of HIV diffusing from semen, through gel layers where present, to tissue. Our findings suggest that comprehensive coating of over 80 % of the tissue surface area and gel layer thicknesses over 100 μm are crucial to the barrier functioning of topical gels. Under these conditions, the level of viral restriction makes a significant contribution to increasing the time required for virions to reach tissue. Overall, the work presented here applies transport theory in the context of HIV transmission and prevention. Results contribute to theoretical and experimental frameworks that can help understand events in HIV transmission and to design and evaluate new technologies for HIV prevention. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} mucus to {{function}} as a protective barrier at mucosal surfaces rests on its viscous and elastic properties, which are not well understood at length scales relevant to pathogens and ultrafine environmental particles. Here we report that fresh, undiluted human cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) transitions from an impermeable elastic barrier to non-adhesive objects sized 1 µm and larger to a highly permeable viscoelastic liquid to non-adhesive objects smaller than 500 nm in diameter. Addition of a nonionic detergent, present in <b>vaginal</b> <b>gels,</b> lubricants and condoms, caused CVM to behave as an impermeable elastic barrier to 200 and 500 nm particles, suggesting that the dissociation of hydrophobically-bundled mucin fibers created a finer elastic mucin mesh.

40|$|Objectives: Preterm birth {{contributes}} {{to a range of}} healthcare problems amongst infants surmounting to sizeable healthcare costs. Twin pregnancies are at particular risk of preterm birth. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the cost-effectiveness of <b>vaginal</b> progesterone <b>gel</b> for the prevention of preterm birth in twin pregnancies. Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized placebo controlled trial (the STOPPIT trial) of <b>vaginal</b> progesterone <b>gel</b> for the prevention of preterm birth in twin pregnancies. Five hundred women were recruited from nine maternity hospitals in the United Kingdom. The outcomes of the economic evaluation were presented in terms of net benefit statistics, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, generated using the nonparametric bootstrap method, and the expected value of perfect information. Results: Mean health service costs between the period of randomization and discharge for mother and infant were £ 28, 031 in the progesterone group and £ 25, 972 in the placebo group, generating a mean nonsignificant cost difference of £ 2, 059 (bootstrap mean cost difference £ 2, 334; 95 percent confidence interval: −£ 5, 023, £ 9, 142; p =. 33).

40|$|AbstractTopical {{microbicide}} {{products are}} being developed {{for the prevention of}} sexually transmitted infections. These include vaginally-applied gels that deliver anti-HIV molecules. Gels may also provide partial barriers that slow virion diffusion from semen to vulnerable epithelium, increasing the time during which anti-HIV molecules can act. To explore the barrier function of microbicide gels, we developed a deterministic mathematical model for HIV diffusion through realistic gel distributions. We applied the model to experimental data for in vivo coating distributions of two <b>vaginal</b> <b>gels</b> in women. Time required for a threshold number of virions to reach the tissue surface was used as a metric for comparing different scenarios. Results delineated how time to threshold increased with increasing gel layer thickness and with decreasing diffusion coefficient. We note that for gel layers with average thickness >∼ 100 μm, the fractional area coated, rather than the gel layer thickness, was the primary determinant of time to threshold. For gel layers 100 μm and fractional area coated > 0. 8 is critical in determining the ability of the gel to serve as a barrier to HIV diffusion...|$|R

Intravaginal use of a variety of products was widely acknowledged. We found that the experience of using trial gels - which made sex ‘hot’, ‘tight’ and ‘dry’ - matched the desired outcomes of intravaginal insertion. We found that vaginal ‘dryness’ described the removal of excessive amounts of unusual discharge, rather than the removal of normal vaginal secretions and that intravaginal insertion is not exclusively associated with a desire for ‘dry’ sex.

Apoptosis was determined by gel electrophoresis for the detection of DNA fragmentation and by immunohistochemistry using the M 30 CytoDEATH and anti-cleaved caspase- 3 (CASP 3) antibodies for the detection of caspase activity. The ability of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor and CASP 3 -specific inhibitor to prevent N- 9 -induced cell death was measured. Expression of apoptosis-related genes such as BCL 2, BAX, Fas receptor (FAS), and Fas ligand (FASLG) was quantified using real-time polymer-ase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. This study demonstrated that N- 9 induced DNA fragmentation and caspase activity in endo-metrial explants in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Caspase inhibitors did not fully prevent the N- 9 -induced DNA fragmen-tation. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that FAS and FASLG were largely increased following N- 9 treatment.

Moreover, mice were significantly more susceptible to infection with low doses of HSV- 2 when challenged 12 h after the 7 th daily dose of CS or nonoxynol- 9 (p< 0. 05). The increased susceptibility {{was associated with a}}lterations in epithelial architecture. CS prevented genital herpes when present at the time of viral challenge, but increased the rate of infection when gel was applied daily for 7 days with a vaginal wash prior to viral inoculation. The findings presumably reflect altered epithelial architecture, which may have contributed to the trend towards increased HIV observed clinically...|$|R
