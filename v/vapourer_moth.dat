60|$|And now--as if sent {{to drive}} away sad {{thoughts}} and vain regrets-- before our feet lay a jest of Nature's, almost as absurd as a 'four- eyed fish,' or 'calling-crab.' A rough stick, {{of the size of}} your little finger, lay on the pitch. We watched it a moment, {{and saw that it was}} crawling--that it was a huge Caddis, like those in English ponds and streams, though of a very different family. They are the larvae of Phryganeas--this of a true moth. {158} The male of this moth will come out, as a moth should, and fly about on four handsome wings. The female will never develop her wings, but remain to her life's end a crawling grub, like the female of our own <b>Vapourer</b> <b>moth,</b> and that of our English Glow-worm. But more, she will never (at least, in some species of this family) leave her silk and bark case, but live and die, an anchoritess in narrow cell, leaving behind her more than one puzzle for physiologists. The case is fitted close to the body of the caterpillar, save at the mouth, where it hangs loose in two ragged silken curtains. We all looked at the creature, and it looked at us, with its last two or three joints and its head thrust out of its house. Suddenly, disgusted at our importunity, it laid hold of its curtains with two hands, right and left, like a human being, folded them modestly over its head, held them tight together, and so retired to bed, amid the inextinguishable laughter of the whole party.|$|E

40|$|A {{review is}} given of the {{recurrent}} outbreaks of the tentcaterpillar, Malacosoma neustria L., affecting the elm {{trees in the}} city of Amsterdam in the period 1930 — 1957. An outbreak of the brown tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea L., in 1935 — 1936 is also mentioned and some occasional loss of foliage through the caterpillars of the <b>vapourer</b> <b>moth,</b> Orgyia antiqua L. Large fluctuations {{in the size of the}} Malacosoma populations were found. After some years in which the damage was negligeable, the increase always started in the N. W. part of the centre of the city. In the following years the outbreaks moved to adjacent parts of the centre and finally sometimes even to more eccentric parts (see Fig. 6 — 9). However, the occurrence of really harmful numbers of tentcaterpillars was mostly restricted to the centre of the town. The merits of the control measures which were carried out with derris/talcum powder spread by motordusters are discussed. The insecticide was thought to be the only sufficiently harmless for its use in the centre of a city. Some cases of defoliation and other inconveniences caused by the presence of crowds of caterpillars could apparently be reduced by the control measures. In several instances, however, the efficacy of the method remained doubtful. The urgency is stressed of further studies of the bionomics of Malacosoma under local conditions and some suggestions are made for a better organization of the measures applied...|$|E
