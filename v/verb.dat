5|$|Mayan {{languages}} are ergative in their alignment. This {{means that the}} subject of an intransitive <b>verb</b> is treated similarly to the object of a transitive <b>verb,</b> but differently from the subject of a transitive <b>verb.</b>|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the <b>verb</b> and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a <b>verb</b> in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main <b>verb</b> is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary <b>verb</b> have is inflected for time and the main <b>verb</b> to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main <b>verb</b> is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect <b>verb</b> form expressed {{the idea of the}} <b>verb</b> as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the <b>verb</b> came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect <b>verb</b> translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
5000|$|Many <b>verbs</b> {{that serve}} as light <b>verbs</b> can also serve as {{auxiliary}} <b>verbs</b> and/or full <b>verbs</b> {{depending on the context}} in which they appear. Light <b>verbs</b> are similar to auxiliary <b>verbs</b> insofar as they contribute mainly functional content (as opposed to semantic content) to the clauses in which they appear. Light <b>verbs,</b> however, are not auxiliary <b>verbs,</b> nor are they full <b>verbs.</b> Light <b>verbs</b> differ from auxiliary <b>verbs</b> in English insofar as they do not pass the syntactic tests that identify auxiliary <b>verbs.</b> The following examples illustrate that light <b>verbs</b> fail the inversion and negation diagnostics that identify auxiliary verbs: ...|$|R

5|$|Greenlandic is a polysynthetic {{language}} {{that allows the}} creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument ("subject") of an intransitive <b>verb</b> like {{the object of a}} transitive <b>verb,</b> but distinctly from the agent ("subject") of a transitive <b>verb.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mongolian has a complementizer {{auxiliary}} <b>verb</b> ge- {{very similar}} to Japanese to iu. ge- literally means 'to say' and in converbal form gež precedes either a psych <b>verb</b> or a <b>verb</b> of saying. As a verbal noun like gedeg (with n or case) it can form a subset of complement clauses. As gene it may function as an evidentialis marker.|$|E
5|$|Negation is {{done with}} the adverb not, which precedes the main <b>verb</b> and follows an {{auxiliary}} <b>verb.</b> A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula <b>verb</b> to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E
30|$|In the {{following}} sections, {{different types of}} complement-taking verbs/predicates will be selected for discussion. All of these complement-taking elements will be morphosyntactically divided into three categories: lexical <b>verbs,</b> adverbial <b>verbs</b> 4, and auxiliary <b>verbs.</b> Lexical <b>verbs</b> consist of high-order evaluatives, cognition <b>verbs</b> 5, utterance <b>verbs,</b> tough/middle predicates, control <b>verbs,</b> and causative dynamic verbs; adverbial <b>verbs</b> consist of manner and frequency expressions; and auxiliary <b>verbs</b> include evidential, deontic, and epistemic modals. All of these <b>verbs</b> may function as a predicate or occur {{as part of a}} predicate. In spite of their similarity, these <b>verbs</b> differ in some morphosyntactic behaviors. Lexical <b>verbs</b> are prototypical <b>verbs</b> that can be inflected for voice/TAM, designate a subject in the non-actor voice (NAV) form, and attract clitics, as in (7 a). Adverbial <b>verbs</b> are in the semi-lexical category, which may bear voice/TAM markers or attract clitics like lexical <b>verbs</b> but cannot freely designate a subject without the help of lexical <b>verbs</b> (Chang 2010), as in (7 b). Unlike lexical <b>verbs</b> and adverbial <b>verbs,</b> which can be inflected for voice and TAM, auxiliary <b>verbs</b> are least verb-like but still retain a verbal property, such as clitic attraction (Huang 1995), as in (7 c).|$|R

5|$|Typologically, Erromintxela {{displays}} the same features as the Basque dialects it derives its grammatical structures from. Its case marking follows the ergative–absolutive pattern where {{the subject of}} an intransitive <b>verb</b> is in the absolutive case (which is unmarked), the same case being used for the direct object of a transitive <b>verb.</b> The subject of a transitive <b>verb</b> is marked with the ergative case. Similarly, auxiliary verbs agree with the subject and any direct object and indirect object present and <b>verb</b> forms are marked for allocutive (i.e. a marker is used to indicate the gender of the addressee).|$|E
5|$|<b>Verb</b> {{morphology}} in Wagiman {{is highly}} irregular. Of the small inventory of inflecting verbs, many {{have their own}} unique tense suffixes, while other tense suffixes are common to several verbs, and while some rudimentary <b>verb</b> classes can be identified - stance verbs always take the past tense suffix -nginy , for instance - the tense suffixes must be learned for each individual <b>verb.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While raising-to-subject <b>verbs</b> {{are like}} {{auxiliary}} <b>verbs</b> {{insofar as they}} lack the content of predicates, they are unlike auxiliaries in syntactic respects.

5|$|Verbs are a {{class of}} word in Wagiman which {{contains}} fewer than 50 members. As it is a closed class, no more verbs are possible. They are often monosyllabic <b>verb</b> roots and all are vowel-final. Wagiman verbs obligatorily inflect for person and number of core arguments, and for the tense and aspect of the clause. A small set of verbs may take a non-finite suffix -yh, in which {{it may not be}} further inflected for person or tense. That non-finite <b>verb</b> must then co-occur with another auxiliary <b>verb.</b>|$|E
5|$|A complex {{predicate}} is {{the combination}} {{of more than one}} element, more than one individual word, to convey the information involved in a single event. For instance, the event swim is conveyed in Wagiman using a combination of a <b>verb</b> ya- 'go' and a coverb liri-ma 'swimming'. There is no <b>verb</b> in Wagiman that, on its own, conveys the event of swimming.|$|E

5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight verbs {{are heavily}} inflected, being marked for tense, aspect, mode, voice, person, and polarity. Tamazight verbs have at their core a stem, {{modified}} by prefixes, suffixes, moveable affixes, circumfixes, and ablaut. The prefixes indicate voice, tense, aspect, and polarity, while the suffixes indicate mood (normal, horatory, or imperative). Subject markers are circumfixed to the <b>verb,</b> while object marking and satellite framing are accomplished via either prefixing or suffixing depending on environment Some <b>verb</b> forms {{are accompanied by}} ablaut, and sometimes metathesis.|$|E

5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary <b>verb.</b> For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated <b>verb</b> did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E
2500|$|In Japanese, causative {{alternation}} {{is seen in}} ergative <b>verbs</b> and paired <b>verbs.</b> [...] Ergative <b>verbs</b> are <b>verbs</b> {{that can}} be transitive or intransitive without morphological change, while paired <b>verbs</b> are <b>verbs</b> that require morphological changes {{in order to be}} read as transitive or intransitive.|$|R

5|$|Most verbs {{have six}} inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, {{a third person}} {{singular}} present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund–participle and a past participle. The copula <b>verb</b> to be is the only <b>verb</b> to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first person present tense form is am, the third person singular form is and the form are is used second person singular and all three plurals. The only <b>verb</b> past participle is been and its gerund-participle is being.|$|E

50|$|Semantic {{divisions}} mainly involve <b>verbs</b> that express someone's {{state of}} mind, or something's properties (of course, things {{can also be}} expressed via other language mechanisms as well, particularly adjectives). The precise categories vary by linguist. Huddleston and Pullum, for example, divide stative <b>verbs</b> into the following semantic categories: <b>verbs</b> of perception and sensation (see, hear), <b>verbs</b> of hurting (ache, itch), stance <b>verbs</b> (stand, sit), and <b>verbs</b> of cognition, emotion, and sensation (believe, regret). Novakov, meanwhile, uses the slightly different categories: <b>verbs</b> denoting sensations (feel, hear), <b>verbs</b> denoting reasoning and mental attitude (believe, understand), <b>verbs</b> denoting positions/stance (lie, surround), and <b>verbs</b> denoting relations (resemble, contain).|$|R
