40|$|Hunter (2006) {{states that}} the image of a {{shopping}} centre is one of the factors that may increase the frequency of visits. In addition, the anticipated emotion that the customers experience during shopping is also a variable that influences the frequency of visits. The customers that have emotional relationship with a shopping centre have a higher desire to visit the related shopping centre. The customers’ higher desire to visit the shopping centre will influence the increasing intention to <b>visit</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre and will positively contribute to the frequency (the number) of customers’ <b>visits</b> to <b>a</b> shopping centre. The research was conducted in Yogyakarta, namely to the customers who visited Plaza Ambarrukmo Yogyakarta. The objectives that the researcher would like to investigate were the role of anticipated emotion in mediating the influence of shopping centre image to the desire of visiting the shopping centre, the influence of <b>a</b> desire to <b>visit</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre to the intention of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre, the influence of <b>an</b> intention to <b>visit</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre to the frequency of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre, and the difference of customers’ evaluation toward the shopping centre’s image, the anticipated emotion, the intention to <b>visit</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre and the frequency of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre between men and women. The results of the research conducted to the customers of Plaza Ambarrukmo Yogyakarta Shopping Centre provides a hard evidence that the shopping centre’s image, the anticipated emotion, the desire of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre and the intention of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre influence positively and significantly the increase of customers’ visits to Plaza Ambarrukmo Yogyakarta. Anticipated emotion is a mediation variable from the relationship between the shopping centre image and the intention of <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> shopping centre...|$|R

Routine dental attendance was defined as last <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> dentist {{less than one year}} ago or <b>visiting</b> <b>a</b> dentist for a check-up. Both bivariate and multivariable analytical techniques were used. Results. While 27 % <b>visited</b> <b>a</b> dentist in the past year, 29 % of these <b>visited</b> for <b>a</b> check-up.
