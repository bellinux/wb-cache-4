5|$|Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Franklin Center, {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{recognized}} buildings in Chicago. The building's form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on pile foundations. The structure is characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase <b>verticality.</b> The building's <b>verticality</b> evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the sturdiness of the structure is reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} architecture, the church {{features}} a round dome {{and a single}} apse. The naos or cella has {{the shape of a}} cross, in line with the popular Byzantine cross-in-square design. Of particular interest is the formerly two-storey narthex, which is notable for its unusual <b>verticality</b> and the towers {{on either side of the}} entrance. Judging by the models depicted in the donor's portraits inside the church, it is clear that the towers were originally further apart and the west facade with the narthex included much woodwork. The towers are topped off by sharp-pointed pyramidal elements, with additional sharp-pointed details in each of the pyramids' four corners. The towers and their design are entirely unusual and unprecedented in medieval Bulgarian church architecture. Art historian Nikola Mavrodinov believes these resemble Gothic architecture, though a more modern researcher, Bistra Nikolova, dismisses his assessment and considers these an influence from Hungary or Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} façade of {{the main}} wing, in the same classical style as its counterpart facing the Ill, is narrower. A strong emphasis is put on the <b>verticality</b> of the windows, by which means the impression of height is accentuated. Again, a central avant-corps is crowned with a triangular pediment bearing reliefs {{and in this case}} also statues. Both façades are richly decorated with allegorical mascarons (depicting seasons, temperaments, continents and elements), eighteen in all on the riverside façade and nine in all on the courtyard façade, to which the riverside façade adds a pair of broad wrought-iron balconies. Due to the difference in width and the trapezoidal plan, the centres of the façades are not aligned.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{averaging}} kernels {{to assess}} {{the sensitivity of the}} Aqua Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) to water vapor. The averaging kernels, in the tropical and extra-tropical upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric region of the atmosphere, indicate that AIRS is primarily sensitive to water vapor concentrations typical of tropospheric values up to a level around 260 hPa. At lower pressures AIRS retrievals lose sensitivity to water vapor, though not completely as indicated by the non-zero <b>verticalities</b> at pressures less than 260 hPa. The MLS is able to provide high quality retrievals, with <b>verticalities</b> ~ 1 for all pressure levels, down to the same level for where AIRS begins to lose sensitivity. Previous analyses have estimated both instruments to have overlapping sensitivity to water vapor over a half temperature scale height layer, within the upper troposphere, for concentrations between ~ 30 – 400 ppmv. Thus, we implement a method using the averaging kernel information to join the AIRS and MLS profiles into an merged set of water vapor profiles. The final combined profiles are not only smooth functions with height but preserve the atmospheric state as interpreted by both the AIRS and MLS instruments...|$|R
5|$|The game's setting {{received}} positive responses. Carter {{thought that}} the <b>verticality</b> nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, {{as well as the}} game's long draw distance. Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture.

Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of Far Cry 3. Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from Game Informer praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich. Ludwig Kietzmann from Joystiq praised the content found within the world, and thought that the world itself was absorbing and interesting.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{brought with}} them {{architectural}} styles from their own duchy, where austere stone churches were preferred. Under the early Norman kings this style was adapted to produce large, plain cathedrals with ribbed vaulting. During the 12th century the Anglo-Norman style became richer and more ornate, with pointed arches derived from French architecture replacing the curved Romanesque designs; this style is termed Early English Gothic and continued, with variation, {{throughout the rest of}} the Middle Ages. In the early 14th century the Perpendicular Gothic style was created in England, with an emphasis on <b>verticality,</b> immense windows and soaring arcades. Fine timber roofs in a variety of styles, but in particular the hammerbeam, were built in many English buildings. In the 15th century the architectural focus turned away from cathedrals and monasteries in favour of parish churches, often decorated with richly carved woodwork; in turn, these churches influenced the design of new chantry chapels for existing cathedrals.|$|E
5|$|Sergey Zagraevsky, {{a modern}} art historian, {{surveyed}} hundreds of Russian icons and miniatures, from {{the eleventh century}} onward. He concluded that most icons painted after the Mongol invasion of Rus display only onion domes. First onion domes displayed on some pictures of twelfth century (two miniatures from Dobrylov Evangelie). He found only one icon from the late fifteenth century displaying a dome resembling the helmet instead of an onion. His findings led him to dismiss fragments of helmet domes discovered by restorators beneath modern onion domes as post-Petrine stylisations intended to reproduce the familiar forms of Byzantine cupolas. Zagraevsky also indicated that the oldest depictions of the two Vladimir cathedrals represent them as having onion domes, prior to their replacement by classicizing helmet domes. He explains the ubiquitous appearance of onion domes in the late thirteenth century by the general emphasis on <b>verticality</b> characteristic of Russian architecture from the late twelfth to early fifteenth centuries. At that period, porches, pilasters, vaults and drums were arranged to create a vertical thrust, to make the church seem taller than it was. It seems logical that elongated, or onion, domes {{were part of the}} same proto-Gothic trend aimed at achieving pyramidal, vertical emphasis.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the main {{changes in the}} distribution of food and drinks in Argentina, which began with the economic, political and social crisis in 2001. The territory used by some of the social actors involved, such as businesses of different sizes (supermarkets and neighborhood stores) and people (consumers), will no longer respond exclusively to a global order or to territorial <b>verticalities.</b> Many of these new tendencies will be led by local norms connected with territorial horizontalities. The most important of these changes is the fact that consumption has become oriented towards: sales, smaller packaging, second and third brands, supermarkets' own brands, new shopping frequencies, a combination of several distribution channels with the so-called "back-to-the-neighborhood" phenomenon, and single-item shopping...|$|R

We view, firstly, to do a periodisation that search the companies' social acts' basements and the valors that prescribed the relation between the company and the place it is installed. Nowadays, when searching how these actions occur territorially, we established three basics organizations: focused, punctual and diffuse actions. Each organization presupposes a specific combination of <b>verticalities</b> and horizontalities that aim to diferential relations between the place's dynamic and the companies' actions. In this way, we attempted to demystify the corporate strategy through {{the manner in which it}} uses the territory...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} a new method for examining harmony, identifying consonance and dissonance through differential tones, and describing voice leading for pieces using just intonation, in particular for Ben Johnston’s String Quartet No. 5 (1979). Johnston employs microtonality in nearly all of his works, which contain more than the typical twelve equal-tempered pitches in the octave. This particular quartet features a great number (over 100) of pitches within the octave {{as is the case}} with many of his pieces up to his composition of String Quartet No. 5. This complex tuning system for microtonality requires a meaningful method for analyzing the novel harmonic syntax in order to model an analysis. The purpose of this analysis is 1.) to establish a scale for measuring consonance and dissonance in the sonorities (particularly those in the homorhythmic sections), 2.) to illustrate and explain the mechanism of the smooth transitions between tuning areas, and 3.) to examine the continuity among sonorities at the phrase level. The first level of analysis considers the consonant and dissonant qualities of the sonorities. This is measured by the resulting differential tones and is an extension of the theories of German physicist Hermann Helmholtz. The sonorities are then placed in context to their surrounding <b>verticalities</b> by observing the superparticular ratios of the melodic voice leading. These ratios yield a difference of one between the numerator and denominator, which signifies a common fundamental between the pitches. The focus of this writing is to show the levels of consonance and dissonance at phrase endings and crucial sections in the quartet. Generally, more stable sonorities begin and conclude sections of repose that feature the recurring “Lonesome Valley” theme. Smooth voice leading and consonant intervals between tuning areas provide a sense of continuity in the more turbulent transitional sections between sections of harmonic stasis. This dissertation examines these phrases in the form of the quartet...|$|R

25|$|The {{sculpture}} {{that made}} her significant {{to the development of}} Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a thin line of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and <b>verticality,</b> was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} design the stair cores were moved {{near to the}} ends of the {{building}} to give views out on both the north and south façades. These, in conjunction with double-height galleries added to the top floor created a vertical rhythm to the façade.

The stair towers have been compared with those of Charles Rennie Mackintosh at the western end of the Glasgow School of Art.|$|E

25|$|Wesley Church {{is built}} of {{load-bearing}} brick laid in Flemish bond in the Victorian academic gothic style and features a landmark spire, steeply pitched roofs, parapeted gables, label (hood) moulds and wall buttressing. The church {{has a strong}} <b>verticality</b> of form emphasised by tall lancet windows with plate tracery to the east facade. Angle buttresses divide the nave wall into five bays and the major windows have stucco label moulds above them. The bricks of the building, fired at uncertain temperatures in wood-burning kilns, show a range of mellow tones and, laid in Flemish bond, create a chequerboard effect on the walls, which provides a decorative element to {{the walls of the}} building. The spire is 35 metres high with a weathercock on top; it is surrounded by four smaller spires at its base which are capped by metal finials. The north-east tower replicates these smaller spires above the gable. The roof structure is of hand-sawn timber and the roof covering was originally shingles, but at some point the Church was re-roofed in clay tiles.|$|E
25|$|Due to its dual {{commercial}} and residential purpose, the building's facade design received a different treatment than those of most other homes of the time. Thus, in the first level, the neoclassical elements are austere; the exterior is articulated by {{the doors and windows}} openings. These openings are framed by moldings and pilasters resembling Tuscan columns. The pilasters are crowned by an unadorned, flat architrave that runs along the entire facade, clearly dividing the commercial first floor from the residential upper level. The second level received a more complex treatment, to emphasize its residential and, thus, social significance. The upper level facade is completely articulated around its many openings. There are 13 sets of wooden double doors with adjustable louvers, nine facing Calle Castillo and four overlooking Paseo Atocha. Each doorway is accentuated by a combination of balconies, plaster moldings and pediments, all framed by a rhythmic articulation of Corinthian pilasters. The balconies have the original 19th century wrought iron grilles. The facade is crowned with a sober, but strong entablature. The Tuscan and Corinthian pilaster accent the building <b>verticality,</b> against its massive and dominating horizontality.|$|E

500|$|Saarinen was {{a veteran}} {{architect}} {{but had never}} before designed a skyscraper. To arrive at his noteworthy design, he took as a starting place the upward sweep of Gothic architecture, but then advanced this sense of <b>verticality</b> as his primary design principle.

In the U.S., he contributed to an overall design for the Chicago lakefront, and he lectured at the University of Michigan, but none of his skyscraper designs were ever built. Instead, others found success by incorporating his vision. Tribune Tower competition co-winner Raymond Hood adopted Saarinen's skyscraper style for several of his subsequent projects, and Saarinen's design was emulated by other contemporary architects such as Timothy L. Pflueger, George W. Kelham, Hubbell and Benes, Holabird & Roche, Alfred C. Finn, and James Edwin Ruthven Carpenter, Jr., as well as later architect César Pelli.|$|E

500|$|Titanfall is {{a shooter}} game played from a first-person perspective.

The game {{is set on}} derelict and war-torn colonies at the Frontier fringe of space exploration as either the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) or the Frontier Militia. Online multiplayer is the sole game mode, but contains single-player elements such as plot, character dialogue, and non-player characters (NPCs). Titanfall has no offline, single-player, or local splitscreen modes, and does not support system link over a local area network (LAN). Respawn founder Vince Zampella described the game as bringing [...] "scale, <b>verticality,</b> and story" [...] to the first-person shooter genre of multiplayer gaming.|$|E
500|$|In Titanfall, players control [...] "pilots" [...] {{and their}} mech-style Titans, and fight in six-on-six matches set in war-torn outer space colonies.

Up to 50 characters can {{be active in}} a single game, and non-player activity is offloaded to Microsoft's cloud computing services to optimize local graphical performance. The game's development team began work on the title in 2011, and their Titan concept grew from a human-sized suit into a battle tank exoskeleton. The team sought to bring [...] "scale, <b>verticality,</b> and story" [...] to its multiplayer genre through elements traditionally reserved for single-player campaigns. The 65-person project took inspiration from Blade Runner, Star Wars, Abrams Battle Tank, and Masamune Shirow of Ghost in the Shell.|$|E

The two found that the chaotic forces behind sandstorms would help them to convey the message of how fragile humans are, as well as the harshness of war. The team believed that the location provided them with a [...] "fantastic" [...] real-world environment allowing them to produce great visuals. Using Dubai as a setting allowed the game's levels to have <b>verticality</b> and variety. The development team sent their art directors to Dubai to inspect the local environment. To prevent the game from featuring the typical [...] "dirty, grungy brown environment", the team added more colors to the game, as well as objects such as glass, marble, gold, and crystals to make the location look vivid and vibrant.|$|E
500|$|The Palazzo dei Conservatori ("Palace of the Conservators") {{was built}} in the Middle Ages for the local {{magistrate}} on top of a sixth-century BC temple dedicated to Jupiter [...] "Maximus Capitolinus". Michelangelo's renovation of it incorporated the first use of a giant order that spanned two storeys, here with a range of Corinthian pilasters and subsidiary Ionic columns flanking the ground-floor loggia openings and the second-floor windows. Michelangelo’s new portico is a reinvention of older ideas. The portico contains entablatures and a flat, coffer-like ceiling. The entablatures rest on columns set at the front of each bay, while matching half-columns stand against the back wall. Each pilaster forms a compound unit with the pier and column on either side of it. Colossal pilasters set on large bases join the portico and the upper story. All of the windows are capped with segmental pediments. A balustrade fringing the roof emphasizes the emphatic horizontality of the whole against which the vertical lines of the orders rise in majestic contrast. The <b>verticality</b> of the colossal order creates the feeling of a self-contained space while the horizontality of the entablatures and balustrades emphasize the longitudinal axis of the piazza. The palazzo’s facade was updated by Michelangelo in the 1530s and again later numerous times.|$|E
500|$|When {{brainstorming}} {{ideas for}} the new Far Cry game, the development team originally planned on developing a direct sequel to Far Cry 3. The sequel would be set on the same tropical island, would extend upon the protagonist's story, and would bring back characters, such as Far Cry 3s secondary antagonist, Vaas. However, after four days, the team found that a sequel was not {{what they wanted to}} achieve. As a result, they decided to scrap the idea and build a brand new game with a new setting and a new set of characters. The team adapted a “we want it all” approach, in which they hoped to experiment with all kinds of ideas. Some team members hoped that the game would allow players to fly, which led to the game's <b>verticality.</b> The game's director also hoped that players would be able to ride a rampaging elephant, in a place with [...] "exotic mountainsides" [...] and [...] "unique culture". This led to the concept of a mountainous setting and the introduction of elephants in the game. The developers aimed for players to consider Far Cry 4 a standalone experience, and therefore they avoided bringing back any characters from Far Cry 3 except for Hurk. The decision to bring Hurk back was made because the team thought that they should provide some references to previous games in the series, as all of the games are set in the same universe even though they are not directly related.|$|E
500|$|Grand Theft Auto IV sees a {{shift in}} the series to a more {{realistic}} and detailed style and tone, partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered high-definition graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles. Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser said [...] "what we're taking as our watchword on [...] is the idea of what high definition actually means. Not just in terms of graphics, which obviously we are achieving, but in terms of all aspects of the design. [...] You know, trying to make something more realistic, more held together, but still retaining the overall coherence that the other games had." [...] Art director Aaron Garbut said {{one of the reasons they}} decided to set the game in New York because [...] "we all knew what an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city it is," [...] and since they were hoping the push the [...] "detail, variety and life" [...] to a high level, it seemed that [...] "basing the game in a city so synonymous with these things was a great fit." [...] Dan Houser added [...] "because we were working in high definition and we knew we'd need a shitload of research, we wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold." [...] The developers consciously avoided creating a block for block recreation of New York City; Dan Houser said [...] "what we've always tried to do is make a thing that looks real and has the qualities of a real environment, but is also fun from a game design perspective." [...] The Grand Theft Auto IV rendition of Liberty City is far more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series. Although smaller than San Andreas, the main setting for Grand Theft Auto IVs predecessor , Liberty City is comparable to it in terms of scope when [...] "the level of <b>verticality</b> of the city, the number of buildings you can go into, and the level of detail in those buildings" [...] are taken into account. The goal for Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas. To achieve a realistic environment, the Rockstar North team, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, made two trips to New York for research, one at the start of the project (which was done with every previous Grand Theft Auto game) and another smaller one further into development. A full-time research team, based in New York, handled further requests for information ranging from the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood to videos of traffic patterns.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian Orthodox {{churches are}} {{distinguished}} by their <b>verticality,</b> bright colors and multiple domes which provide a striking {{contrast with the}} flat Russian landscape often covered in snow. The very first churches in Kievan Rus', such as the 13-domed wooden St. Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod, differed in this regard from their mainly single-cupola Byzantine predecessors. The number of domes was important symbolically. [...] One dome symbolized the single God; three represented the Trinity and five represented Christ and his four evangelists. At first the baptistery, narthex, and choir gallery above the narthex were a common feature of Rus' churches, but gradually they disappeared.
