The atomic interactions were analyzed in macroscopic and microcosmic views. The calculated formation energy can describe the deviation degree between the actual alloy and the ideal melt quantitatively.

40|$|The Ni 3 Al-based {{intermetallic}} alloys as engineering {{materials in}} service, {{they may be}} subjected to a wear environment of some sort. Hence, it is technologically {{important to understand the}} tribological response and to determine methodologies to improve wear resistance of these advanced materials. The tribological performance of Ni 3 Al-based alloys is among the mostly promising in the group of intermetallics. Therefore, a Fe-alloyed Ni 3 Al (NAC-alloy) with composition of Ni- 18. 8 Al- 10. 7 Fe- 0. 5 Mn- 0. 5 Ti- 0. 2 B (at. %) and its composites tailored respectively with hard Cr 3 C 2 and soft MnS particles were selected in this thesis work for investigation. The testing materials were prepared by powder <b>metallurgy,</b> <b>vacuum</b> casting process and cladding technique, respectively. To evaluate the friction coefficient and specific wear rate of the test materials, a conventional pin-on-disk (POD) tribometer was used. The monolithic NAC-alloy showed similar wear properties with respect to its specific wear rate and friction coefficient under the applied pin-on-disk testing conditions to those of commercial vermicular graphite cast iron. Unfortunately, NAC-alloy worked inadequately with its counterpart disk of a grey cast iron used as liner material in engines. Added hard Cr 3 C 2 particles reduced wear {{on both sides of the}} pin and disk by 50 %. The soft MnS particles, which functioned as an effective solid lubricant, reduced friction coefficient of the friction pair and decreased specific wear rate of the grey cast iron disk by 20 %. However, the specific wear rate of the pin was not lowered. In general, the NAC-alloy may function well as a matrix material to develop wear-resistant composites. In this thesis study, it was also recognized that development of metallurgical processes may play an important role for further improving wear properties of the investigated materials. For further understanding wear mechanism of the NAC-alloy and its composites, nanoindentation and numerical simulation were applied to study friction-induced nanohardness variation in subsurface layer of the tested materials. An exponential decay fitting function was applied and the deformation strain of the monolithic NAC-alloy versus surface distance was derived. The addition of hard Cr 3 C 2 particles reduced the thickness of the subsurface layer and retained the same peak hardness of the friction surface as the monolithic NAC-alloy. Due to ineffective strain hardening, the addition of soft MnS particles decreased both of the thickness of subsurface layer and the peak-hardness on the friction surface. These results were coupled to the experimental data from pin-on-disk tests and microstructural analysis...|$|R

40|$|Electron beam {{technology}} {{has a long}} history with wide range of applications in research and industrial use. Development and applications of high power thermionic electron beam sources have been studied in this work. A detailed account of the three types, strip, line and hairpin thermionic electron beam sources, which have been developed and experimented has been given. These sources are employed in a diode configuration with different beam trajectories (axial and transverse) and heating modes (directly and indirectly). Performance of these sources has been described at temperature and space charge limited modes of operation. We obtain constant and stable focal spots at the work site that are in good agreement with the designed dimensions of the sources. High emission current, low thermal efficiency and high power density at the work-site have been recorded with an extended life expectancy (up to 100 hours). This was possible through novel design parameters for these sources by protecting them from arcing and shortening even at high vacuum (10 - 6 - 10 - 3 Torr). These electron beam guns produce beautiful seam geometry with the penetration depth up to 5 mm and evaporation rates (up to order of 100 kg/h) for refractory metals, with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV only. Besides scientific applications, these guns can also be used in large-scale <b>vacuum</b> <b>metallurgy</b> plants for melting, welding, coating and heat treatment. Guns are very simple in construction, economical to manufacture and have high reliability and performance in operation.

40|$|Abstract: In general, {{semiconductor}} {{materials for}} thermoelectric generation prepared by <b>vacuum</b> <b>metallurgy</b> shows {{a relatively high}} value of figure-of-merit. However, differences in some properties of alloys elemental constituents can cause processing problems. Recently, Mechanical Alloying (MA) {{has been used to}} produce polycrystalline thermoelectric materials, such as (Bi,Sb) 2 and (Te,Se) 3 (1). The industry is using this process since early 70 â€™s to produce oxide dispersion strengthened alloys and those with widely different melting temperatures (2) In the present work, Si 0. 80 Ge 0. 20 alloys were prepared via Mechanical Alloying (MA), using 99. 9 % pure silicon and germanium powders, with a sieve size of 100 mesh. The MA has been performed, for several balls- to- powder ratio, in a SPEX 8000 vibratory high energy milling with tungsten carbide balls. Time for alloy formation was in a range from 3 to 9 hours, corresponding to charge ratio of 12 : 1 and 4 : 1, respectively. After two hours of processing time, the grinding temperature reached 80 0 C, and remained at this level {{until the end of the}} process. It was possible to follow the SiGe alloy formation by x-ray diffractometry, as the peak lines positions of elemental Si and Ge were continuously shifted, and end up to merge into a single broad peak. There was a convergence of the individual lattice parameters of Si and Ge to a single value of 5. 470 A, measured within the limit of Â± 0. 005 A. For the Si 0. 80 Ge 0. 20 system evaluated in this work, the alloying progress occurred continuously, and changed inversely with charge ratio...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn <b>vacuum</b> <b>metallurgy</b> {{one of the}} {{purposes}} is the reduction (or at least the accurate prediction) of the evaporation losses. It {{is well known that}} the addition of an inert gas in a vacuum furnace increases the recondensation of the volatile elements and then reduces the evaporation losses. We may define the pressure P_ 1 / 2 required to halve the evaporation rate. The objective of this study is a theoretical and experimental evaluation of P_ 1 / 2 {{in the case of an}} austenitic stainless steel, and the analysis of the parameters which influence this value. The experimental programme was carried out on an austenitic stainless steel to determine the net flux of evaporation from a well-mixed liquid in an ambient pressure of argon ranging from 0. 03 to 133 Pa. P_ 1 / 2 = 30 Pa is estimated from the experimental curve. The mechanisms of volatilization have been modeled using both a system based and a mechanistic approach, and the calculation of the pressure P_ 1 / 2 gives respectively 45 and 90 Pa. The numerical simulations (mechanistic approach) emphasize the strong expansion of the vapor from the high density regions close to the liquid surface. The macroscopic velocity of the vapor decreases as the argon pressure in the chamber increases since the average frequency of collision with the argon atoms increases. We have set up a sensitivity study in order to analyse the effects of the geometry and scale of the furnace and of the liquid temperature on the factor P_ 1 / 2. Since geometry and temperature vary in large scales for the industrial applications, the use of the experimental value P_ 1 / 2 = 30 Pa obtained is discussed...|$|E

These conditions {{are similar to the}} operating conditions of the materials of the first wall and divertor place of the thermonuclear reactors (TNR) with magnetic plasma sustainment. For example, it is assumed to than the first wall of the discharge chamber of the reactor will be subjected, during the working pulse, to the effect of the flux of particles with the density of #approx# 10 cm"-" 2 s" 1 ", and the density of the heat flux will be 25 W#centre dot#cm" 2. For the place of the divertor these values may be an order of magnitude higher. At collapse of the of plasma current, the calculated value of the density of the heat flow according to the data in Ref. 1 is 10 - 100 MW#centre dot#cm"-" 2. The characteristic collapse time is 100 - 300 #mu#s. Erosion of the materials {{as a result of the}} alternating effect of the flows of hydrogen plasma of different power density is also characteristic of the electron beam guns of high-voltage glow discharge (HVGD) used in <b>vacuum</b> <b>metallurgy.</b> The cathodes of the systems in the first minutes after the supply of high-voltage are subjected to the effect of a large number of 'breakdowns', i. e. short-term (#approx# 0. 01 s), self-liquidating transitions of glow to arc discharge. The high current density in the cathode spots and the surface density of the energy flux (10 - 100 MW x cm" 2) results in the intensive evaporation and spattering of the cathode material. For more efficient reproduction of the service conditions of the material used as the cathode of the HVGD and the material of the first wall of the thermonuclear reactor, the tested specimens were subjected consecutively to the effects characteristic of the stationary and non stationary operating regimes of plasma systems. The combination of the two different effects in the examination of stainless-steel has made it possible to develop the structure of the irradiated layer. Preliminary irradiation of the specimens was carried out using the complex simulation method of testing in high-voltage glow discharge. The principle special feature of the HVGD is the coincidence of the conditions of irradiation with the actual conditions of the radiation effect on the materials in partial the gas-discharge systems such as thermonuclear reactors or melting electron guns of the HVGDTranslated from Russian (Fiz.
