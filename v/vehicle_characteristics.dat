Moore (the NASA PAV Sector Manager) from NASA Langley Research Center. This paper was presented in September 2003 at an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) conference as AIAA Paper 2003-2646. This paper established advanced concepts that would provide <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> that dramatically enhanced the 1) Ease of Use, 2) Safety, 3) Efficiency, 4) Field Length Performance, and 5) Affordability. Many additional papers were presented at AIAA and Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) conferences through 2006 that further refined the definition of PAV capabilities, technologies, and concepts. In 2006 the Vehicle Systems Program was replaced by new NASA Aeronautics initiatives. PAV technology development efforts at NASA shifted to a prize-based investment, with NASA Centennial Challenge Prize funds being provided for competitions in 2007 (Personal Air Vehicle Challenge, with $250,000 in prizes), 2008 (General Aviation Technology Challenge, $350,000 in prizes), and 2011 (Green Flight Challenge, $1,500,000 in prizes).

5000|$|However, {{the focus}} of the European Commission has rather been on lorries than on private cars, as lorries are {{concerned}} directly by the internal market. But {{it was only in the}} end of the last century, that the legal basis for road tolling was established in Directive 1999/62/EC ("Eurovignette") on European Community level. This Directive had the focus on the tolling of motorways, bridges, tunnels and mountain passes, but only for lorries over 12 tonnes maximum laden weight, and the charging was only possible for infrastructure costs. Eight years later in 2006, the Directive was amended by Directive 2006/38/EC, which has a new focus on road tolling of the trans-European road network, but leaves the EU Member States the right to apply tolls as well on roads not included in the trans-European road network. The amended Directive gives the EU Member States the possibility of varying tolls according to a number of factors such as distance travelled, place, infrastructure type and speed, <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics,</b> time of day and congestion level. In addition, the EU Member States are obliged to include all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes maximum laden weight after 2012, and after 2010, the tolls must be differentiated according to the environmental performance of the vehicle.Recently, the European Commission proposed a new, second amendment to the Directive 1999/62/EC, enableling EU Member States to integrate the cost of air and noise pollution caused by traffic in tolls levied on heavy goods vehicles and allowing tolls to be calculated on the basis of the cost of congestion imposed upon other vehicles during peak periods.Map: charging of heavy goods vehicles in the EU ...|$|E

Changing the blade geometry of the stator and/or turbine will change the torque-stall characteristics, {{as well as the}} overall efficiency of the unit. For example, drag racing automatic transmissions often use converters modified to produce high stall speeds to improve off-the-line torque, and to get into the power band of the engine more quickly. Highway vehicles generally use lower stall torque converters to limit heat production, and provide a more firm feeling to the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Vehicle {{dynamics}} {{is typically}} handled by models whose parameters are found through system identification or manually computed from the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>characteristics.</b> While these methods provide accurate theoretical dynamical models, {{they may not}} take into account differences between individual vehicles, lack adaptability to new environments and may not handle sophisticated models, requiring hand-crafted heuristics for backwards motion for example. Similarly to space and aerial maneuver-based planning methods, we demonstrate a simple and computationally fast planning method for ground robots with obstacle avoidance. It bypasses the need for model parameters identification and hand-crafted heuristics, learns the particularities of individual vehicles, allows on-line adaptation and sophisticated models. Human-driven or autonomouslydriven trajectories are recorded and stored into a trajectory bank. While in learning mode, the robot records each traveled trajectory and places it into a bank, indexed by the initial speeds of each left and right wheels and the ending position at a fixed radius. Only the best trajectories are stored in the trajectory bank and then reused during autonomous runs for optimal short-range planning. Pre-computed (but not recorded) trajectories have been used in previous work and provide an important computational advantage over on-line computation methods, which are less practical in real-time applications due to the high-dimensional search space. A collision-free platform was developed without any hand-crafted heuristics or knowledge about the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This method is demonstrated on the LAGR platform, a non-holonomic (differential drive) off-road mobile robot...|$|R

40|$|There is {{evidence}} linking certain <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> to crash involvement and one possible mechanism behind {{this relationship is}} that these <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> infuence drivers 2 ̆ 7 risk-taking behaviour. In order to investigate this, we conducted a roadside observation survey and a questionnaire-based study. Both revealed {{a significant relationship between}} vehicle performance and drivers 2 ̆ 7 risk-taking behaviour. The causal direction of this relationship has important consequences. If drivers 2 ̆ 7 risk taking predicts their car choice, then it could be justifiably argued that individuals who take more risks when driving simply choose more powerful vehicles to facilitate their behaviour. However, if it is the case that <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> adversely influence drivers 2 ̆ 7 risk-taking propensity then this has implications for vehicle design. Results indicated that the causal pathway operates independently in both directions. Finally, we sought to determine which <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> influenced risk-taking intentions independently of other confounded characteristics. We found that high vehicle performance and a greater number of safety features led independently to greater intended risk taking in general, while higher internal car noise led to closer car following and more risky gap acceptance, but not to greater speed. Vehicle smoothness and handling did not affect risk-taking intentions...|$|E

The reason for using K&C parameters to design and evaluate suspension systems are that the handling, steering and ride characteristics of the full vehicle are highly dependent on these parameters.
