40|$|Different purposes, {{for which}} Philips Electrometer Triode, tvpe 4060, {{can be used}} have been {{described}} with special references to the measurement of voltage. It is pointed out that when the voltage source has a high resistance, this particular tube can be used, in a circuit identical in principle with an ordinary <b>valve</b> <b>voltmeter,</b> {{in order to measure}} the voltage...|$|E
40|$|The {{periodic}} fluctuations present in arc voltage and luminous intensity of D. C. plasma jet have been studied. The D. C. plasma jet generator was a non-transferred, vortex and axial gas flow, constricted configuration, and taper type single port nozzles {{were prepared for}} Argon, Nitrogen and mixed gas. A P-P type <b>valve</b> <b>voltmeter</b> {{was used to measure}} the arc voltage and luminosity fluctuations were observed by a MS- 9 SY photomultiplier tube, which was positioned perpendicular to the jet axis at a nozzle exit. A SS- 5102 synchroscope was used to determine the instantaneous waveforms of arc voltage and photocurrent. A saw-tooth fluctuation of the arc voltage has been produced in Argon plasma jet and similar in form to the fluctuation obtaind with Nitrogen. The frequency and amplitude of this fluctuation were dependent upon the arc current and the gas flow rate. There was a tendency for the frequency to increase with the gas flow rate, and for the amplitude to reduce gradually. An increase in the arc current to 60 ～ 80 A caused the frequency of the voltage fluctuation to a maximum value. A further increase in current over 100 A reduced the frequency and fluctuations were vanished. So the transition the fluctuating mode to the steady mode depens upon the value of the arc current. The typical value of the frequency in voltage fluctuation was of the order of 4 ～ 10 kc/s in Argon and 10 ～ 20 kc/s in Nitrogen for our experimental condition. It is suggested that the cause of voltage fluctuations is the movement of the anode spot. But the different forms in Argon and Nitrogen may be attributed to the different arc mechanism in these gases. The waveform of luminosity fluctuations in plasma jets was synchronized to the voltage fluctuation and the peak-to-peak intensity fluctuations was equal to the 17 % about the mean output of a photomultiplier...|$|E
25|$|Vacuum Tube <b>Voltmeters</b> or <b>valve</b> <b>voltmeters</b> (VTVM, VVM) {{were used}} for voltage {{measurements}} in electronic circuits where high input impedance was necessary. The VTVM had a fixed input impedance of typically 1megohm or more, usually through use of a cathode follower input circuit, and thus did not significantly load the circuit being tested. VTVMs were used before the introduction of electronic high-impedance analog transistor and field effect transistor voltmeters (FETVOMs). Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The input impedance of some poorly-designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary {{over the course of}} a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some sensitive circuits under test.|$|R
