5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them <b>venter</b> to <b>venter,</b> with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig <b>Venter,</b> {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} of the Human Genome Project, has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing, in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found DNA from nearly 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. <b>Venter</b> has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton.|$|E
5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown spots that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The <b>venter</b> is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E
50|$|The Braves added <b>Venters</b> {{to their}} 40-man roster with an {{invitation}} to spring training. After spring training, <b>Venters</b> started the 2010 season in Triple-A. After 2 games (1 start), <b>Venters</b> went 1-0 with a 1.35 ERA until being called up to the Majors on April 17, 2010.|$|R
50|$|After the season, <b>Venters</b> {{signed a}} one-year {{deal with the}} Braves for the 2014 season, thereby {{avoiding}} arbitration. <b>Venters</b> began the 2014 season on the 60-day disabled list while recovering from the surgery, enduring many setbacks in the process. On August 28, 2014, <b>Venters</b> learned he had torn his ulnar collateral ligament again and would need a third Tommy John surgery to continue his baseball career. The third procedure was performed in September 2014, and prevented <b>Venters</b> from pitching in 2015.|$|R

5|$|In 2002 McCaw {{played for}} the All Blacks against the touring Ireland team (15–6 and 40–8 victories) and in the TriNations against Australia and South Africa. Of the six 2002 test matches McCaw played in, five were won by New Zealand with the only loss to Australia. The 14–16 loss {{occurred}} in New Zealand's third TriNations match and ensured the Bledisloe Cup stayed with Australia. During the All Blacks match against South Africa in Durban a pitch invader attacked Irish referee David McHugh as a scrum was being set, dislocating his shoulder in the process. McCaw and A.J. <b>Venter</b> wrestled the assailant off the referee and, according to McHugh, {{if they had not}} got involved his shoulder would have been broken. McCaw was rested, along with 20 other members of the TriNations squad, from the 2002 end-of-year tour to Europe.|$|E

60|$|Then for the {{hundredth}} time he measured the width of space separating him from Jerry Card. Wrangle had ceased to gain. The blacks were proving their fleetness. <b>Venters</b> watched Jerry Card, admiring the little rider's horsemanship. He had the incomparable seat of the upland rider, born in the saddle. It struck <b>Venters</b> that Card had changed his position, or {{the position of the}} horses. Presently <b>Venters</b> remembered positively that Jerry had been leading Night on the right-hand side of the trail. The racer was now on the side to the left. No--it was Black Star. But, <b>Venters</b> argued in amaze, Jerry had been mounted on Black Star. Another clearer, keener gaze assured <b>Venters</b> that Black Star was really riderless. Night now carried Jerry Card.|$|R
50|$|<b>Venters</b> {{was drafted}} by the Atlanta Braves in the 30th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft. He began his {{professional}} career with the Rookie League GCL Braves in 2004. During the 2004 season in the Rookie League, <b>Venters</b> started 8 games making 11 appearances total going 1-6 with a 5.74 ERA and 3 saves. In 2005, <b>Venters</b> was promoted to the Class-A Rome Braves. In 23 games (12 starts) with the Class-A team, <b>Venters</b> had a 8-6 record and a 3.93 ERA. After undergoing Tommy John surgery in late 2005, <b>Venters</b> missed the entire 2006 season. In 2007, <b>Venters</b> was promoted to the Class-A Advanced Myrtle Beach Pelicans. He appeared in 17 games (12 starts) going 3-3 with a 3.39 ERA and 1 save in the Class-A Advanced system. <b>Venters</b> was demoted {{all the way down}} to the Rookie League level to begin the 2008 season where he posted a 4.70 ERA in 4 starts. He was promoted to Class-A Advanced, where he went 1-2 with a 4.08 ERA in 5 games (3 starts). He was then promoted to the Double-A Mississippi Braves, where he finished the season by going 1-0 with a 1.00 ERA in 3 games (2 starts). All together in the 2008 campaign, <b>Venters</b> posted a 3.41 ERA, 1 save, and a 2-2 record in 12 total games combined with the 3 affiliate levels. <b>Venters</b> started the 2009 season in Double-A posting a 4-4 record in 12 starts with a 2.76 ERA. He was promoted to the Triple-A Gwinnett Braves, where he finished 4-7 with a 5.62 ERA in 17 starts. Combined with both Minor League levels in 2009, <b>Venters</b> went 8-11 in 29 total starts with a 4.42 combined ERA.|$|R
50|$|On July 17, 2010, in a {{game against}} the Milwaukee Brewers, <b>Venters</b> was deemed to have {{intentionally}} thrown at Brewers first baseman Prince Fielder. He was ejected from the game along with Braves manager Bobby Cox and later suspended 4 games, a decision which <b>Venters</b> later appealed. <b>Venters</b> suspension was subsequently overturned. He finished the season with a 1.95 ERA, in an NL 6th-best 79 games pitched.|$|R

25|$|In 1998, a similar, {{privately funded}} quest was {{launched}} by the American researcher Craig <b>Venter,</b> and his firm Celera Genomics. <b>Venter</b> was a scientist at the NIH during the early 1990s when the project was initiated. The $300,000,000 Celera effort was intended to proceed at a faster pace and {{at a fraction of}} the cost of the roughly $3 billion publicly funded project. The Celera approach was able to proceed at a much more rapid rate, and at a lower cost than the public project because it relied upon data made available by the publicly funded project.|$|E
60|$|<b>Venters</b> {{calculated}} that {{a mile or}} more still intervened {{between them and the}} riders. They were approaching at a swift canter. Soon <b>Venters</b> recognized Tull's white horse, and concluded that the riders had likewise recognized Black Star and Night. But it would be impossible for Tull yet to see that the blacks were not ridden by Lassiter and Jane. <b>Venters</b> noted that Tull and the line of horsemen, perhaps ten or twelve in number, stopped several times and evidently looked hard down the slope. It must have been a puzzling circumstance for Tull. <b>Venters</b> laughed grimly at the thought of what Tull's rage would be when he finally discovered the trick. <b>Venters</b> meant to sheer out into the sage before Tull could possibly be sure who rode the blacks.|$|R
60|$|She {{suddenly}} opened {{eyes that}} transfixed <b>Venters.</b> They were fathomless blue. Consciousness {{of death was}} there, a blended terror and pain, but no consciousness of sight. She did not see <b>Venters.</b> She stared into the unknown.|$|R
60|$|<b>Venters</b> knelt with a {{gathering}} horror of his deed. His bullet {{had entered the}} rider's right breast, high up to the shoulder. With hands that shook, <b>Venters</b> untied a black scarf and ripped open the blood-wet blouse.|$|R

25|$|In {{the command}} module, Christopher's son {{remotely}} activates the mothership and an alien mechanized battle suit in Obesandjo's base, {{using it to}} kill Obesandjo and his men. Wikus takes control of the battle suit and rescues Christopher, who promises to return in three years with the cure. Wikus kills all the attacking soldiers before <b>Venter</b> cripples the suit, which ejects Wikus. As he corners a heavily injured Wikus, a group of aliens protect Wikus and kill <b>Venter</b> by tearing him apart. The command module with Christopher and his son is lifted into the mothership, which they use to leave Earth, and Johannesburg's residents celebrate the alien ship's departure.|$|E
60|$|As <b>Venters</b> {{ran back}} to Black Star he saw the horse stagger on shaking legs into the sage and go down in a heap. Upon {{reaching}} him <b>Venters</b> removed the saddle and bridle. Black Star had been killed on his legs, <b>Venters</b> thought. He had no hope for the stricken horse. Black Star lay flat, covered with bloody froth, mouth wide, tongue hanging, eyes glaring, and all his beautiful body in convulsions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shore we're goin' to {{live with}} Fay an' John, an' be near <b>Venters</b> an' Bess, an' see the blacks again, Jane.... An' <b>Venters</b> will tell you, as he did me, how Wrangle run Black Star off his legs!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Venters</b> {{thought out}} the race shrewdly. The rider on Bells would {{probably}} drop behind and {{take to the}} sage. What he did was of little moment to <b>Venters.</b> To stop Jerry Card, his evil hidden career {{as well as his}} present flight, and then to catch the blacks--that was all that concerned <b>Venters.</b> The cattle trail wound for miles and miles down the slope. <b>Venters</b> saw with a rider's keen vision ten, fifteen, twenty miles of clear purple sage. There were no on-coming riders or rustlers to aid Card. His only chance to escape lay in abandoning the stolen horses and creeping away in the sage to hide. In ten miles Wrangle could run Black Star and Night off their feet, and in fifteen he could kill them outright. So <b>Venters</b> held the sorrel in, letting Card make the running. It was a long race that would save the blacks.|$|R
25|$|The Craig <b>Venter</b> Institute {{has used}} a system {{derived from the}} rapid DNA repair {{mechanisms}} of D. radiodurans to assemble synthetic DNA fragments into chromosomes, with {{the ultimate goal of}} producing a synthetic organism they call Mycoplasma laboratorium.|$|E

60|$|<b>Venters</b> looked back. Black Star stood riderless in the trail. Jerry Card {{had taken}} to the sage. Far up the white trail Night came {{trotting}} faithfully down. <b>Venters</b> leaped off, still half blind, reeling dizzily. In a moment he had recovered sufficiently to have a care for Wrangle. Rapidly he took off the saddle and bridle. The sorrel was reeking, heaving, whistling, shaking. But he had still the strength to stand, and for him <b>Venters</b> had no fears.|$|R
60|$|<b>Venters</b> rode to the barn, and, leaping off, shouted for Jerd. The boy came running. <b>Venters</b> {{sent him}} for meat, bread, and dried fruits, to be packed in saddlebags. His own horse he turned loose {{into the nearest}} corral. Then he went for Wrangle. The giant sorrel had earned his name for a trait the {{opposite}} of amiability. He came readily out of the barn, but once in the yard he broke from <b>Venters,</b> and plunged about with ears laid back. <b>Venters</b> had to rope him, and then he kicked down a section of fence, stood on his hind legs, crashed down and fought the rope. Jerd returned to lend a hand.|$|R
25|$|On 28 October 2000, {{just south}} of the Mozambique border in Sodwana Bay in the St. Lucia Marine Protected Area, three deep-water divers, Pieter <b>Venter,</b> Peter Timm, and Etienne le Roux, made a dive to 104 metres and {{unexpectedly}} spotted a coelacanth.|$|E
25|$|The {{human genome}} is the genome of Homo sapiens, which is stored on 23 {{chromosome}} pairs. Whereas a genome sequence lists {{the order of}} every DNA base in a genome, a genome map identifies the landmarks. A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome. While working at the National Institute of Health, Craig <b>Venter</b> discovered a technique for rapidly identifying all of the mRNAs present in a cell, and began {{to use it to}} identify human brain genes. The short cDNA sequence fragments discovered by this method are called expressed sequence tags. Through his scientific research of bringing the world one step closer to personalized medicine, Craig <b>Venter</b> was listed on Time Magazine's 2007 and 2008 Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.|$|E

5000|$|Gryponautilus is a genus of Upper Triassic nautilids (generally coiled nautiloid cephalopods) {{belonging}} to the trigonoceratacean family Grypoceratidae, characterized by involute, inflated shells, which at maturity develop narrowly rounded keel-like <b>venters.</b> <b>Venters</b> on inner whorls are truncated and broadly convex to concave.|$|R
60|$|Between {{the trees}} twinkled lights of cottage candles, and far down flared bright {{windows of the}} village stores. When <b>Venters</b> got closer to these he saw knots of men {{standing}} together in earnest conversation. The usual lounging on the corners and benches and steps was not in evidence. Keeping in the shadow <b>Venters</b> went closer and closer until he could hear voices. But he could not distinguish what was said. He recognized many Mormons, and looked hard for Tull and his men, but looked in vain. <b>Venters</b> concluded that the rustlers had not passed along the village street. No doubt these earnest men were discussing Lassiter's coming. But <b>Venters</b> felt positive that Tull's intention toward himself that day had not been {{and would not be}} revealed.|$|R
60|$|Wrangle whistled his {{pleasure}} at {{the smell of}} the sage. Remounting, <b>Venters</b> headed up the white trail with the fragrant wind in his face.
