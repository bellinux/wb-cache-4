40|$|The rapid {{proliferation}} of 2 ̆ 2 problem-solving courts, 2 ̆ 2 particularly of drug courts, occasions this Article. These progeny of the 1989 Dade County, Florida drug court 2 ̆ 7 {{can be found}} throughout the country. According to one report, there are approximately 500 drug courts operating nationwide, with several hundred more coming on line. From these drug courts, {{a number of other}} courts have evolved, all under the problem-solving handle. In New York, for example, in addition to drug courts, there are community courts and domestic violence courts. In the State of Washington there is a mental health court. While disparate in their focus, their 2 ̆ 2 problem solving 2 ̆ 2 characterization appears to result from a shared, urgent common goal of judicially addressing problems deemed, usually by the court, as not adequately addressed through the quotidian mills of, at least, the overloaded urban criminal justice system. Chief Justice Kathleen A. Blatz of the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota has forged a palpable description of this problem- solving stimulus: I think the innovation that we 2 ̆ 7 re seeing now is the result of judges processing cases like a vegetable factory. Instead of cans of peas, you 2 ̆ 7 <b>ve</b> got cases. <b>You</b> just move 2 ̆ 7 em, move 2 ̆ 7 em, move 2 ̆ 7 em. One of my colleagues on the bench said: 2 ̆ 2 You know, I feel like I work for McJustice: we sure aren 2 ̆ 7 t good for you, but we are fast. 2 ̆ 2 This emergence of problem-solving courts as an alternative to 2 ̆ 2 McJustice 2 ̆ 2 has begun to engender debate over the three foundational premises on which problem-solving courts rest: first, courts are appropriate institutions for solving the undertaken problems; second, the resources commanded for this problem-solving do not shortchange the resolution of more important but more complex problems; and third, the problem-solving protocols employed by these courts are effective...|$|R

40|$|I 2 ̆ 7 m {{going to}} speak about bird baits that are {{produced}} by the rodent-control fund. In my estimation, there are about six criteria for mixing good, high quality bait materials. The first one would be a toxicant. This {{is the first thing}} people talk or think about. I would assume that you would select a toxicant that has the quality to do the intended job. The second point is the sticker. So our criteria for a sticker are as follows: good adhering qualities, good spreading qualities (by this I mean if you introduce the toxicant into a sticker as is often done-we don 2 ̆ 7 t do this—you must be able to disperse this material in either a suspension or in a solution so that you get an even distribution over the bait material), good sacking quality (that is, a material you can sack directly from the mixer or from whatever equipment you use; having to take a material out for instance in a production run and spreading it to dry just doesn 2 ̆ 7 t lend itself to any type of production), good storage qualities (it can 2 ̆ 7 t harden the material in the bag if you must store it {{for a long period of}} time, nor should it change any of the color, odor, or taste characteristics of the bait material), good lasting quality in the field (we wish a material to last more than past the first rain storm). The third point is mixing procedure. This of course depends on the type of equipment you have. But in general our practice is to dry mix the toxicant and bait materials together. A fourth point is housekeeping. I have seen an awful lot of bait material; and one of the things that is commonly done in the feed industry, or used to be, was that you didn 2 ̆ 7 t throw things away. If you could sweep it up and remix it into some other preparation, this was an acceptable practice. It is not an ac-ceptable practice in mixing quality bait materials. We also have another criteria we think of as bags. There are criteria for the type of bag. I am not at all pleased with a multi-wall paper bag. I know commercial industry has gone with this; but as Bemus has illustrated to me, you can take a multi-wall paper bag and drop it from your shoulder 25 times and you 2 ̆ 7 <b>ve</b> had it. <b>You</b> can take a burlap bag or a bag with 7 -ounce burlap in it, and drop it all day long from your shoulder, and still use the bag with no apparent effect from the jarring. Probably the most important thing in bait mixing, and if there is any secret to bait mixing, and I 2 ̆ 7 m a bug on this, it 2 ̆ 7 s selection of the bait material. I might say that we do not use materials of a quality less than human consumption. We do not consider number one corn good enough; it contains too much trash and other materials to be suitable for bait material...|$|R

At this time of year there are as many vacationists as there are service men but during the summer months the facilities are mostly used by men and women in uniform. Well, I 2 ̆ 7 ll sign off for this time and hope to hear from you folks again real soon. Please pardon the red typing but the upper half of the ribbon is all shot and I 2 ̆ 7 m too lazy to change it tonight. SincerelyBert Bullock[Transcription ends...|$|R
40|$|Full Text: Like most Americans, I do {{not read}} much poetry. After a long day with patients, I 9 ̆ 2 m ready to relax with some football, some episodes of " 24," or maybe a good novel. I do have a tiny twinge of guilt when I skip over the New Yorker poems, but it quickly passes. Imagine my {{surprise}} when the American Poets Project published Cole Porter: Selected Lyrics. I {{had always wanted to}} read the lyrics of his fabulous songs and now they were available as bona fide poetry. Cole Porter (18919 ̆ 61964) was born to a wealthy family in Peru, Indiana, and was somewhat of a musical prodigy as a child. He attended Yale University, where he sang with the new a cappella group called the "Whiffenpoofs" and composed a host of college songs, including one for the football team that concludes with the semi-immortal lines: When the sons of Eli Break through the line That is the sign we hail Bull dog! Bull dog! Bow, wow, wow Eli Yale! My immediate association is the chorus of frogs in the play by Aristophanes, which probably means that I am either hopelessly overeducated or mind-addled. After a series of Broadway flops, Porter proceeded to settle in Paris, marry a rich American divorc 9 e, avoid the military draft, falsely claim enlistment in the French Foreign Legion, and spend most of the next 20 years traveling lavishly in Europe and around the world. In 1928 he burst back onto the Broadway scene with the musical Paris and his first major hit song, the witty "Let 9 ̆ 2 s Do It (Let 9 ̆ 2 s Fall In Love). " In the song, among those who "do it" are "little cuckoos in their clocks," "courageous kangaroos," and even Boston beans. In the 1930 s Porter produced an incredible number of hits that earned him a place in the pantheon of American songwriters. Unlike his contemporaries George Gershwin and Irving Berlin, Porter wrote both the lyrics and the music for all his songs. In the sad song from the Great Depression, "Love For Sale," a streetwalker offers only "slightly soiled" love and invites the buyer of her wares to follow her upstairs. Porter wrote very passionate songs about taunting and teasing, deceiving and deserting, but in his lyrics love always lasted until death, because "so in love with you am I. " He wrote often about the uncertainty of love. Is it a "dream come true"? Or will it, like the moon, grow dim and fade away in "the chill, still of the night"? Porter wrote about love affairs that were "too hot, not to cool down" in "Just One of Those Things"; about languorous, tropical love in the cynical "Begin the Beguine," where women are all the same in the dark; about desperate love in "Down in the Depths (on the Ninetieth Floor) "; about sugar-daddies; and about existential love, wondering if love is a kiss on the lips or just a kick in the pants. His greatest score was the show Anything Goes, with such songs as "I Get A Kick Out Of You," "All Through The Night," "Anything Goes," "Blow, Gabriel, Blow," and everybody 9 ̆ 2 s favorite, "You 9 ̆ 2 re The Top," in which two lovers compare each other to the "tread of the feet of Fred Astaire," as well as an "O 9 ̆ 2 Neill drama," "Whistler 9 ̆ 2 s mama," and "Camembert. " In 1937, a tragic horseback riding accident left Porter crippled. He endured 33 orthopedic surgeries and suffered from severe depression. He was one of the earliest patients to receive electroconvulsive therapy. The depression lifted but the chronic pain remained. Critics feel that the quality of his songs declined during this time, yet he wrote his most financially successful show, Kiss Me Kate, in 1948 and other major Broadway hits such as Can-Can in 1952, Silk Stockings in 1955, and High Society in 1956, which featured his last hit song, "True Love. " Although he had several long-term homosexual relationships over the years and had separated from his wife in the early 1930 s, they reunited after his accident. His leg was amputated in 1958 and he never wrote another song. If you are a Cole Porter fan, you must get this book. If you do not know about him, you are missing a glorious piece of Americana. Many artists have recorded his songs but I strongly recommend the 1990 release "Red Hot + Blue. " It contains modern versions of his songs by such artists as U 2 and Deborah Harry. The compilation was produced as part of an AIDS benefit series, and in that context, the song "I 9 ̆ 2 <b>ve</b> Got <b>You</b> Under My Skin" takes on a whole new meaning. I absolutely guarantee that when you hear the drums go wild in the song "Don 9 ̆ 2 t Fence Me In," you will crank up the stereo and, at least for a few minutes, feel overcome by youthful exhilaration. In truth, Porter was a good but not great poet. There 9 ̆ 2 s no mistaking him for Robert Frost or T. S. Eliot (thank God!). But when he set his words to music, the results really were "delightful [...] . delicious [...] . de limit [...] . deluxe," and "de-lovely. ...|$|R
40|$|Women s long {{struggle}} If government and aid agencies could divert {{some of their}} funds to fulfilling the aims stated above, or at least ensure {{that the role of}} women farmers is not overlooked in their schemes, it would not only improve the welfare of rural women but, by increasing food supplies, would improve the well-being and wealth of nations as well. Spore 12 - January 1988 It is argued that because these programs concentrate on income-generation and the elimination of drudgery in the subsistence sector, instead of micro-enterprise development or cash crop production (projects which usually target men), these approaches tacitly accept the notion that women's productive work is less important than men's and, hence, that lower standards for women are acceptable. Spore 76 - August 1998 Across the ACP countries, women are coming out of their enforced invisibility. Through a tide of conference resolutions, commissions and fora over the decades, an awareness has grown of their economic and social role. Gender is now mentioned in all the speeches about development, and the notion of gender, which embraces a strategy to integrate women in development, is sowing its seeds just about everywhere. The Year of the Woman in 1975 triggered off a movement which the international women s conference in Beijing in 1995 transformed into an unstoppable force. Spore 87 - June 2000 Biodiversity: a treasure to be shared Members of traditional African communities have a unique understanding and interpretation of their surroundings. This includes an understanding of the crops and weeds that are used for food and medicine and their relationship to the environment. Today there is a double risk which threatens that understanding. There is a risk that in the quest to grow enough food, modern high yielding varieties (HYVs) will displace traditional crops resulting in genetic erosion, and there is an associated risk that the knowledge of how to use those traditional crops may die out, even before the plants themselves disappear. Spore 43 - February 1993 One of the principal recommendations of international organizations is that efforts should be made to conserve the wild relatives of cultivated species. They are found in the species' areas of origin which still harbor many wild species, indigenous varieties and weeds related to modern cultivated plants. The wild species form a natural reservoir for breeders seeking genes for resistance, hardiness or adaptability. In developing countries it is farmers and other rural people who have the responsibility for the evolution of genetic resources: they grow the plants in their farms and gardens. Spore 54 - December 1994 In the field of agricultural innovation, there is in general too little dialogue between the farmer, the planner and the banker. Given the appeal of biodiversity, the urgency of its erosions, and the topicality of the issue (the Rio+ 10 summit in late 2002 will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the UN Convention on Biodiversity), surely here there are opportunities galore for finding ways to use credit, savings and finance instruments, all the way along to village level. It would be a brave person who tried to move such triangular dialogues into concrete actions, but, if they could talk, a few million species could be very grateful. Spore 90 - December 2000 From CD-ROM to cyberspace In ACP countries, where the emphasis has been primarily on rural development, {{it is often difficult to}} acquire technical information about agriculture. In Africa, for example, there are only a few documentation centres that are even partially computerized. In Europe and North America, however, it is now common for farmers to be made aware of the latest developments in agricultural science via well-developed, computerized information systems. Spore 9 - May 1987 The internet and the electronic information services to which it gives access have already shown phenomenal growth rates and have brought prosperity and economic development to users and providers alike. The ACP States should not be left behind. Some are already on-line and the chance is there for others to catch up. The internet, like information itself, should be available for all who need it, but it could be that many of the ACP States will be left further and further behind in a world that is accelerating fast along the world's information superhighways. Spore 72 - December 1997 While the techies have been twiddling away with the Internet, and <b>you</b> <b>ve</b> been wondering if you d be left out, the phone has still been getting on with connecting people.

40|$|Before leaving CTA in late March 2000 {{to take up}} his {{new post}} as Head of the Technical Advisory Division at the International Fund for Agricultural Development in Rome, Italy, Dr Cooke shared some {{insights}} into institutions and change with Spore. You are devoting much of your life to agriculture and development, but the words are strikingly absent from the agendas of today s international community. Not exactly. The preferred terms today are not agriculture and food security, but poverty reduction and rural development. In international negotiations many developed countries assume that ACP agriculture equates with developed country agriculture, with a very small slice of the GDP and a small share of employment. When I met with the development group of the European Parliament, they were genuinely surprised to hear the figures that we know well: agriculture means 30 - 60 % of GDP in sub-Saharan Africa and 70 % of jobs, of which 70 % are held by women. So {{the challenge is to}} ensure that the roles of agriculture are duly recognised in poverty reduction. Then the topic is on the agenda, but through that and other terms like poverty reduction, sustainable livelihoods, impact on equity, or the role of women, and not through agriculture and productivity and the classic banners of 20 years ago. These new terms are often applied in the context of domestic development, rather than that of {{a major player in the}} world agricultural economy. One of CTA s priority themes has been conquering regional and the global markets but also domestic. This is a fundamental difficulty. It s very difficult to get into global markets without having organised a national market: what are you going to trade? There is a supposition that some of the poorer countries can rapidly follow Asian models, forgetting that in almost all cases they went through an agro-industrial development process, generating the wealth to support education and to develop human capital. You can t leapfrog from essentially subsistence agriculture to a semi-industrialised economy unless you discover oil or diamonds, or you re fortunate with tourism. It s a process, and here the challenge for CTA is ensuring that institutional change takes place. All our ACP partners are in a very tough position, coping with economic and political change, decentralisation, technical change, and we re adding on to that 'PS: communicate better with your farmers, your decision takers, and your users'. It s easy to underestimate the barriers to that. If <b>you</b> <b>ve</b> been working in a research centre on oil palm in plantations, it requires considerable change to worry about women subsistence farmers in semi-arid zones. It requires changes in incentive, leadership, and organisation, moving from being supply-driven to responsive, and there are political, social and cultural constraints. What sort of timeframe are you talking about, and how do you recognise that change has taken place? Well, CTA has a 5 -year plan by virtue of being part of the Lomé Convention. For ACP partners the timescale must be longer. This is reflected in the switch away from project or even programme approaches to sectoral approaches. Very long-term processes must be confronted: democratisation and decentralisation, the promotion of sustainable organisations servicing the poor, the development of human capital. And the hardest of all: encompassing sustainable natural resource management with its trade-offs between short- and long-term gains. So we re talking about a long timeframe, but also about getting institutional imperatives correct, sooner rather than later. The results will take years. Our constituency has changed too. Ten years ago if you looked at a CTA annual report, it was all ministries of agriculture and the public sector. Now, we talk about our constituency being public and private. Regrettably there has been a lot of hesitation from some ACP governments. It s very difficult to get them to send a delegation to a meeting that isn t entirely public sector. To be fair, sometimes we suggest including women or NGO or private sector representatives but even when we have had the green light to invite a woman or have shortlisted a woman for a staff post she will often decline at the last minute for personal reasons. Change is happening faster in another field: information and communication technologies. One in nine Spore readers now has an email address This is a regular debate at our Advisory Committee, to what extent should we move our funds away from more traditional areas like video and rural radio to electronic on- and off-line techniques. We have tried to meet the clear needs of many partners who claim that they do not get neutral advice on these topics. We ve been going too slowly for some countries, and too fast for others. Everyone wants the maximum benefit from ICTs but they don t want us to stop doing any of the rest either. How can you encourage change? The whole process of change is a tricky one. Even within the small world of CTA, we have undergone considerable change. Some people feel that we changed too much, more than necessary to satisfy our stakeholders. That is correct if our stakeholders are interpreted as diplomats representing the EU or ACP in Europe; it s not correct if, as I hold, our stakeholders are the subsistence farmers in the poorer sectors of the poorer countries. ACP needs and priorities continue to change, further consultations and seminars are in train to respond to that, and I wish Carl Greenidge all the best in continuing to confront the high rate of change required to do the best for the farmers in the developing world.

40|$|While the techies {{have been}} {{twiddling}} {{away with the}} Internet, and <b>you</b> <b>ve</b> been wondering if you d be left out, the phone has still been getting on with connecting people. Yesterday s future is tantalisingly close, today. Make that call. Send that email. Hands up {{if you have not}} seen an Internet café or telecentre in a market near you this year! There are thousands in ACP countries. Some are public, others private, and a good many are geared up to provide market information (from costs of inputs and goods available, to sales opportunities) for agricultural producers and traders, as just a part of their services. Some are fumbling to translate their fuzzy vision of an ICT-enabled knowledge society into working reality, and some are more sanguinely trying to sort out the most reliable sources of market information. None are yet financially viable, {{in the same way that}} most Internet services in the West are still climbing their expensive learning curves. The rise and fall of dot com companies in the years 1999 - 2000, when the balloon-like faith of finance companies inelectronic commerce swelled and burst, bear witness to the volatility of the new economics (see Spore 88). Far from being dead, electronic commerce, or e-commerce, has now culled its weak and weak-hearted and is preparing for a serious surge from 2002 onwards. Unlike what happened in the first wave, many ACP countries will be relatively well equipped to join in. There is reason for confidence; some even talk euphorically of e-velopment. Some of today s initiatives will indeed flourish. They will be the ones that looked before they leaped. They will be taking a deep breath and ensuring financial stamina to get through the thankless early days. They understand that cash flow will come from social phone calls, emails or Internet searches (illness, family news, lotto results, shopping lists for visitors from the diaspora, even ecotourism bookings!). Calls and emails about fertiliser prices, shipping costs or veterinary services will not alone provide the critical volume of business. Is the waiting almost over? We think so, for most. A kind of magic, all the same It all started with the second telephone, and the world s first telephone call, in 1876. The world has not looked back since then. For the 3 billion people who allegedly have never made a phone call, most of them in Africa and Asia, the notion of hearing the voice of an unknown person, an untold distance away, will be a surprise. It will come soon, as more people become wired. The stated goal of the telecommunications people Universal Service has suffered from the Last Mile problem. This defines the technical and financial difficulty of installing telephone cables from a central point in a city, or a market town, to customers in surrounding communities. With apologies to the copper producers amongst us, we have to stop thinking of only phone wires, and Think Wireless. Revolutionary: from cell to cell While many specialists have focussed on how to computerise ACP countries, the telephone infrastructure has been growing fast. A virtual miracle has appeared in the form of the handheld mobile cellular phone, and low-cost satellite links. What has made the mobile a revolutionary tool, even in rural areas? The cost of installing and maintaining local receiver/transmitter stations (called cells) has fallen dramatically, as have the costs of sending signals by satellite. Each local station needs to be at most at a few kilometres distance from the next cell, literally to pass signals along. In isolated areas where there are no or few customers, and access is hard for maintenance, the signals can now be leapfrogged over longer distances via satellite. Where there are just a few dozen customers in a settlement, it makes most sense to establish a local station with fixed-line phone on the spot, ideally in a so-called telecentre which provides fax and computer services too. If there are several hundred customers in the area, cellular mobile phones become viable. The economics of covering an entire nation are not yet sound even parts of the densely-populated Netherlands have no mobile phone access but it is now feasible to provide such access to a good 95 % of your population in any country. Universal Service has been quietly replaced by Universal Access. If you can get your hands on a mobile phone, or go to a telecentre, you can reach any other phone or computer in the world. Many governments have resisted the de-regulation which would allow such systems to flourish, in part because a heavily regulated system offered a slim chance of collecting significant revenues from incoming international phone calls. The global telecommunications market, however, is fast becoming a free-for-all, and there are opportunities galore. Barefoot telecentres Normally such liberal talk excludes much of the ACP world. Not here. Here is not a reason to curse globalisation, nor to despair at the prospect of your rural community being isolated and never getting connected. Those classical reactions just do not work. The technology is evolving so quickly that notions of 'being priced out of the system' or 'the unbridged Last Mile' no longer apply. Hence, The Economist magazine reported in November 2000, Ghana now has five Internet service providers, and three mobile-phone operators. They set up a subscriber with a phone for $ 50 and a crystal clear connection within four hours, instead of the dark tunnel of a $ 150 connection, when it came, from the former state monopoly. It takes little to see what that means for entrepreneurs with an eye for ICTs. The Grameen Bank saw it first, seven years ago, in Bangladesh, where almost every village now has its barefoot telecentres which rent out mobiles. In ACP countries with deregulated telecoms, the telecentre booths that line most markets show what a flourishing trade there is in linking into the national phone network. No network nearby? No trouble (stay within the law though!); make your own links. The Economist: 'The most deregulated and dynamic system in Africa is in Somalia. The state system was destroyed in the civil war and has now been replaced, at least in the main towns, by enterprising Somalis. They simply buy a satellite dish and telephones, build a shed of phone booths and charge $ 1 a minute for anywhere in the world. A model for the rest of the continent?'.
