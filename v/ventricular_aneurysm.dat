Later he developed the multistage test, consisting of several stages of progressively greater workloads. It was this multistage test, a description of which was first published in 1963, that became known as the Bruce Protocol. In the initial paper, Bruce reported that the test could detect signs of such conditions as angina pectoris, a previous heart attack, or a <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysm.</b> Bruce his and colleagues also demonstrated that exercise testing was useful in screening apparently healthy people for early signs of coronary artery disease.|$|E
25|$|If {{heart failure}} ensues after a {{myocardial}} infarction due to scarring and aneurysm formation, reconstructive surgery {{may be an}} option. These aneurysms bulge with every contraction, making it inefficient. Cooley and coworkers reported the first surgical treatment of a left <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysm</b> in 1958. They used a linear closure after their excision. In the 1980s, Vincent Dor developed a method using a circular patch stitched {{to the inside of}} the ventricle (the endoventricular circular patch plasty or Dor procedure) to close the defect after excision. Dor's approach has been modified by others and is today the preferred method for surgical treatment of incorrectly contracting (dyskinetic) left ventricle tissue, although a linear closure technique combined with septoplasty might be equally effective. The multicenter RESTORE trial of 1198 participants demonstrated an increase in ejection fraction from about 30% to 40% with a concomitant shift in NYHA classes, with an early mortality of 5% and a 5-year survival of 70%. It remains unknown if surgery is superior to optimal medical therapy. The STICH trial (Surgical Treatment for IschemiC Heart Failure) will examine the role of medical treatment, coronary artery bypass surgery and left ventricle remodeling surgery in heart failure patients.

The aneurysm was assessed for resectability by both techniques using these criteria. In all cases there was a distinct and diagnostic change in the contour of the ventricle on computed tomography. Computed tomography indicated eight aneurysms to be unresectable, and this agreed with the angiographic assessment.

50|$|<b>Ventricular</b> <b>aneurysms</b> {{are usually}} {{complications}} {{resulting from a}} heart attack. When the heart muscle (cardiac muscle) partially dies during a heart attack, a layer of muscle may survive, and being severely weakened, start to become an aneurysm. The blood may flow into the surrounding dead muscle and inflate the weakened flap of muscle into a bubble. It may also be congenital.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTrue {{congenital}} <b>ventricular</b> diverticulum and <b>aneurysm</b> {{in children}} are very uncommon. We report our experience {{to clarify the}} diagnosis and outcome of these little-known entities. MethodsTwenty-two patients with congenital ventricular outpouchings were identified in our database from 1973 to 2004. Morphologic characteristics (localization, connection to a ventricle, contractility), histologic findings, and cardiac and/or extracardiac abnormalities were analyzed in all 22 patients. Cardiovascular events and clinical courses were reviewed. ResultsCongenital ventricular diverticula (n = 16) were characterized by synchronal contractility and three myocardial layers on histologic examination. Two categories of congenital ventricular diverticulum could be identified {{with regard to their}} localization: apical and nonapical. Apical diverticula (n = 8) were always associated with midline thoracoabdominal defects and other heart malformations. Nonapical diverticula (n = 8) were always isolated defects. Congenital <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysms</b> (n = 6) were characterized by akinesis with paradoxical systolic motion, wide connection to the ventricle, fibrosis on histologic examination that appeared with high signal on T 2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and absence of other heart or midline thoracoabdominal defects. The outcome was different in these two types of outpouchings: congential <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysms</b> were associated with adverse outcomes whereas the prognosis for congenital ventricular diverticula was good. ConclusionCongenital <b>ventricular</b> diverticulum and <b>aneurysm</b> are two distinct entities, with different histologic and morphologic characteristics and outcomes. Assessment of these differential characteristics is of importance for prenatal counseling...|$|R
40|$|Operative {{repair of}} <b>{{ventricular}}</b> <b>aneurysms</b> should improve left ventricular function. Despite its theoretic advantage, the mortality following this operation is high, and many patients have severe postoperative hypotension. The cardiac findings were studied in 18 patients who died after repair of <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysms.</b> All hearts were examined at autopsy after postmortem coronary arteriography and fixation in a distended state. Five patients in Group I had intractable fatal postoperative hypotension, 7 in Group II initially had severe hypotension that improved, and 6 in Group III {{did not have}} postoperative hypotension. Curvature thickness indexes (CTIs) of the ventricular segments, which correlate with their pressure-producing activity, were determined in the 18 hearts. CTIs for the left ventricular free wall and septum were lower in Group I and Group II patients with hypotension than those in Group III without. The reduced CTIs in patients with postoperative shock appear to arise {{as a result of}} ventricular reconstruction that reduces ventricular wall curvature. The authors suggest that left <b>ventricular</b> function after <b>aneurysm</b> resection would be improved by inverting, rather than everting, the edges of the ventriculotomy, thereby increasing wall curvature and the CTI. Noninvasive determinations of the CTI may prove of value in guiding topographic reconstruction of ventricles with aneurysms...|$|R
5000|$|Myocardial rupture is {{most common}} {{three to five}} days after {{myocardial}} infarction, commonly of small degree, but may occur one day to three weeks later. In the modern era of early revascularization and intensive pharmacotherapy as treatment for MI, the incidence of myocardial rupture is about 1% of all MIs. [...] This may occur in the free walls of the ventricles, the septum between them, the papillary muscles, or less commonly the atria. Rupture occurs because of increased pressure against the weakened walls of the heart chambers due to heart muscle that cannot pump blood out effectively. The weakness may also lead to <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysm,</b> a localized dilation or ballooning of the heart chamber.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{scenarios}} {{will require}} emergent consultation with cardiothoracic surgery. Heart failure due to acute aortic regurgitation is a surgical emergency {{associated with high}} mortality. Heart failure may occur after rupture of <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysm.</b> These can form after myocardial infarction. If it ruptures on the free wall, it will cause cardiac tamponade. If it ruptures on the intraventricular septum, it can create a ventricular septal defect. Other causes of cardiac tamponade may also require surgical intervention, although emergent treatment at the bedside may be adequate. It should also be determined whether the patient {{had a history of}} a repaired congenital heart disease as they often have complex cardiac anatomy with artificial grafts and shunts that may sustain damage, leading to acute decompensated heart failure.|$|E
5000|$|The current {{guidelines}} for the ECG diagnosis of the ST segment elevation type of acute myocardial infarction require at least 1 mm (0.1 mV) of ST segment elevation in the limb leads, and at least 2 mm elevation in the precordial leads. These elevations must be present in anatomically contiguous leads. (I, aVL, V5, V6 correspond to the lateral wall; V3-V4 correspond to the anterior wall V1-V2 correspond to the septal wall; II, III, aVF correspond to the inferior wall.) This criterion is problematic, however, as acute myocardial infarction {{is not the most}} common cause of ST segment elevation in chest pain patients. Over 90% of healthy men have at least 1 mm (0.1 mV) of ST segment elevation in at least one precordial lead. The clinician must therefore be well versed in recognizing the so-called ECG mimics of acute myocardial infarction, which include left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, paced rhythm, early repolarization, pericarditis, hyperkalemia, and <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysm.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Ventricular</b> <b>aneurysms</b> in {{children}} are unusual. Three patients with cardiomyopathy associated with angiographically proved left <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysms</b> {{in this age}} group are reported. Two of them were girls. The ages were 20 months, 7 years, and 14 years. Heart failure was present in all patients. There was radiological evidence of cardiomegaly in all three, and the electrocardiogram showed signs of necrosis in two of them. Selective left ventricular angiography disclosed generalized hypokinesis in all patients. One child had an aneurysm of the diaphragmatic wall. In another the aneurysm was localized in the muscular ventricular septum, causing severe subpulmonary stenosis by encroaching in the right ventricular outflow tract during systole. The third patient had an aneurysm of the left ventricular free wall partly encircling the left ventricle. The coronary arteries appeared normal in all cases. The clinical features of the underlying disease were not altered by the presence of the aneurysm except in the patient with the septal aneurysm and subpulmonary stenosis. In this patient the aneurysm was successfully resected...|$|R
40|$|To {{correlate}} morphologic {{subgroups of}} left <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysms</b> {{with the major}} clinical manifestations (ventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and systemic emboli), we studied 73 patients with such aneurysms— 34 at autopsy and 45 after surgical excision. Sixty-three patients {{had a history of}} congestive heart failure, 5 had systemic emboli, and 28 had recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Two types of endocardial abnormalities were noted: thick endocardial plaque composed of fibrous elastic tissue that contained little or no thrombus (type I, 30 patients); and aneurysms with little or no endocardial fibroelastosis (type II, 43 patients), some with layers of thrombus obliterating the aneurysmal cavity. Emboli only occurred in 5 patients with type II aneurysms who had mural thrombi. Recurrent ventricular tachycardia occurred in 20 patients with type I aneurysms but only in 8 with type II (p < 0. 001), showing a relation between endocardial fibroelastosis and ventricular tachycardia. Structural differences in <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysms</b> thus appear to have pathophysiologic significance. Our findings have implications for the mechanisms of ventricular tachycardia in postinfarction patients and for its prevention by endocardial resection...|$|R

5000|$|Ventricular {{aneurysm}}s usually {{grow at a}} {{very slow}} pace, but can still pose problems. Usually this type of aneurysm grows in the left ventricle. This bubble {{has the potential to}} block blood flow to the body, and thus limit the patient's stamina. In other cases, a similarly developed pseudoaneurysm [...] "false aneurysm" [...] may burst, sometimes resulting in death of the patient. Also, blood clots may form on the inside of ventricular aneurysms, and form embolisms. If these blood clots escape from the aneurysm, they will be moved in the circulation throughout the body. If these blood clots get stuck inside a blood vessel, they may cause ischemia in a limb, a painful condition that can lead to reduced movement and tissue death in the limb. Alternatively, if they block a vessel going to the brain, they can cause a stroke. In certain cases, <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysm</b> may cause ventricular failure or arrythmia. At this stage, treatment is necessary.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{consequence}} of his heart attack, Eisenhower developed a left <b>ventricular</b> <b>aneurysm,</b> which was in turn {{the cause of a}} mild stroke on November 25, 1957. This incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand. The stroke had caused an aphasia. The president also suffered from Crohn's disease, chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine, which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9, 1956. To treat the intestinal block, surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine. His scheduled meeting with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was postponed so he could recover at his farm. He was still recovering from this operation during the Suez Crisis. Eisenhower's health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits, but he still indulged in alcohol. During a visit to England he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29, 1959; however, before dinner at Chequers on the next day his doctor General Howard Snyder recalled Eisenhower [...] "drank several gin-and-tonics, and one or two gins on the rocks ... three or four wines with the dinner".|$|E
