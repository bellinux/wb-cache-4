Most were based on RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Methods: In this report we searched for expressed <b>viral</b> <b>sequences</b> in 58 BC transcriptomes using five distinct in silico methods. In addition, we complemented our RNA sequencing results with exome sequencing, PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses. A control sample {{was used to test}} our in silico methods. Results: All of the computational methods correctly detected <b>viral</b> <b>sequences</b> in the control sample. We identified a small number of <b>viral</b> <b>sequences</b> belonging to human herpesvirus 4 and 6 and Merkel cell polyomavirus. The extremely low expression levels-two orders of magnitude lower than in a typical hepatitis B virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma-did not suggest active infections. The presence of viral elements was confirmed in sample-matched exome sequences, but could not be confirmed by PCR or IHC. Conclusions: Our results show that no <b>viral</b> <b>sequences</b> are expressed in significant amounts in the BC investigated. The presence of non-transcribed viral DNA cannot be excluded.

Phylogenetic analysis of intrapatient envelope V 3 -V 5 region HIV- 1 DNA sequence sets revealed that brain <b>viral</b> <b>sequences</b> were clustered {{relative to the}} blood <b>viral</b> <b>sequences,</b> suggestive of tissue-specific compartmentalization of the virus {{in four of the}} six cases. In the other two cases, the blood and brain virus sequences were intermingled in the phylogenetic analyses, suggesting trafficking of virus between the two tissues. Slide-based PCR-driven in situ hybridization of two of the patients' brain biopsy samples confirmed our interpretation of the intrapatient phylogenetic analyses. Interpatient V 3 region brain-derived sequence distances were significantly less than blood-derived sequence distances. Relative to the tip of the loop, the set of brain-derived <b>viral</b> <b>sequences</b> had a tendency towards negative or neutral charge compared with the set of blood-derived <b>viral</b> <b>sequences.</b> Entropy calculations were used as a measure of the variability at each position in alignments of blood and brain <b>viral</b> <b>sequences.</b> A relatively conserved set of positions were found, with a significantly lower entropy in the brain-than in the blood-derived <b>viral</b> <b>sequences.</b> These sites constitute a brain "signature pattern," or a noncontiguous set of amino acids in the V 3 region conserved in <b>viral</b> <b>sequences</b> derived from brain tissue.

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the symbiotic polydnavirus {{is the fact that the}} virus does not and cannot replicate on its own- it does not contain the genes necessary to replicate itself.

Male wasps contain the <b>viral</b> <b>sequence,</b> but do not have the capacity to produce it. The proteins and genetic payload of the virus are produced by these cells, and the virions are assembled within the nucleus of these cells. As the female matures, the nuclear membrane will dissolve, followed by the cell membrane, releasing the virions and cell debris into the lumen of the oviduct. Phagocytic cells will clean up the debris, and the virions will be injected into the host along with eggs and venom upon oviposition.|$|E

40|$|Background: Acute HIV {{infection}} (AHI) is {{a critical}} phase of infection when irreparable damage to the immune system occurs and subjects are very infectious. We studied subjects with AHI prospectively to develop better treatment and public health interventions. Methods: Cross-sectional screening was employed to detect HIV RNA positive, antibody negative subjects. Date of HIV acquisition was estimated from clinical history and correlated with sequence diversity assessed by single genome amplification (SGA). Twenty-two cytokines/chemokines were measured from enrollment through week 24. Results: Thirty-seven AHI subjects were studied. In 7 participants with limited exposure windows, the median exposure to HIV occurred 14 days before symptom onset. Lack of <b>viral</b> <b>sequence</b> diversification confirmed the short duration of infection.

However, covering a considerable {{proportion of the}} circulating <b>viral</b> <b>sequence</b> variants would likely require long immunogens, which for the conserved portions of the viral genome, would contain unnecessarily redundant sequence information.

Compression of immunological information is achieved by partial overlapping shared sequence motifs between individual epitopes.

40|$|The {{integration}} of hepatitis B <b>viral</b> <b>sequences</b> {{in the human}} hepatoma Alexander cell line has been investigated after fractionation of the cell line DNA by centrifugation in a Cs 2 SO 4 /BAMD (3, 6 -(bis-acetato mercurimethyl) dioxane) density gradient. Eight out of nine integrated <b>viral</b> <b>sequences</b> were localized in DNA component H 3, which only represents 4 % {{of the human genome}} and matches the base composition of HBV sequences. These results indicate a targeting and/or a higher stability of the latter in a specific, small compartment of the host genome...|$|R
