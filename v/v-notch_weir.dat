A compound sharp-crested weir consisting of two triangular parts with different notch angles was used. The lower triangular part of the weir handles the normal range of discharges while the upper part measures the higher peak flows. This paper evaluates experimentally the local scour downstream compound sharp crested <b>V-notch</b> <b>weir.</b> Forty-eight (48) experimental runs were conducted. Three models of weirs with different geometries (combination of notch angles), four upstream water levels, three water levels at the tailgate, and two bed materials were used. Multiple regression equations based on energy principal and dimensional analysis theory were deduced to estimate the local scour downstream of the weir models. The developed equations were compared with the experimental data. The comparison between the local scour downstream classical <b>V-notch</b> <b>weir</b> and a compound sharp-crested weir consisting of two triangular parts with different notch angles {{was found to be}} unnoticed.

40|$|Real-time flow {{measurement}} and monitoring are important components of modern irrigation SCADA systems. Many projects have existing sharp-crested weir structures {{that have not}} been incorporated into SCADA systems because they are partially contracted, and thus do not have a simple rating equation relationship. The Kindsvater-Carter procedure for calibrating partially contracted sharp-crested weirs is accurate and straightforward, but also somewhat tedious. Existing computer programs simplify the process but can presently be applied only to individual measurements. This paper presents a Microsoft ® Excel spreadsheet model that can compute complete rating tables for sharp-crested weirs with full or partial flow contraction, using the Kindsvater-Carter procedure. Furthermore, through regression analysis, the spreadsheet determines a simplified rating equation that can easily be incorporated into remote terminal units (RTUs) and SCADA systems. The spreadsheet can be applied to fully contracted <b>V-notch</b> <b>weirs</b> with included angles of 25 ° to 100 °, partially or fully contracted 90 ° <b>V-notch</b> <b>weirs,</b> partially or fully contracted rectangular weirs (including suppressed rectangular weirs), and fully contracted Cipoletti weirs...|$|R

Note that it only corrects offsets orriginating from the DTS device (Halo, Sensornet, UK). It does NOT correct for periods when the cable is not properly submerged in the stream. The DTS obtained temperatures were calibrated with five independent temperature loggers (TidbiT v 2 Temp logger, HOBO, USA) located along the cable at 26, 395, 931, 1111 and 1270 m from the DTS desktop computer, respectively. Note that the investigated branch lies between 717 (<b>V-notch</b> <b>weir</b> Q 3) and 1282 m (<b>V-notch</b> <b>weir</b> Q 4) from the desktop computer. For each Tidbit temperature logger, which measured at a 6 min interval, a linear relation was determined between the DTS derived temperature {{and the difference between}} the TidbiT and DTS derived temperature for the period 4 -Apr- 2008 until 4 -Dec- 2008 (dT = a*T_DTS + b). For each Tidbit location a slope (a) and an offset (b) was determined: Tidbit		Distance(m) 	a	b T coolbox	 26 		- 1. 31 	 0, 0974 	 T road		 395 		- 0. 49 	 0, 0664 	 T Mai 171 u	 931 		- 0. 69 	 0, 122 	 T Mai 11 u	 1111 		- 0. 25 	 0, 109 	 T Q 4 - 2 		 1270 		- 0. 056 	 0, 0965 	 Then a lineair relation between distance from the DTS desktop computer and slope (a_slope + b_slope*X), and between distance from desktop computer and offset (a_offset + b_offset*X) was derived, resulting in an offset as a function of distance and DTS derived temperatures.

The calibration formulae of such devices rely upon some empirical coefficients {{and there is a}} need to obtain new accurate physical data to complement the existing evidence. In the present study, the discharge calibration of a large 90 degrees V-notch thin plate weir was performed using an unsteady volume per time technique. The <b>V-notch</b> <b>weir</b> was initially closed by a fast-opening gate. The sudden opening induced an initial phase of the water motion dominated by the free-falling motion of a volume of fluid in the vicinity of the weir, followed by a gradually-varied phase, during which some seiche was observed in the tank. The relationship between water discharge and upstream water elevation was derived from the integral form of the continuity equation. The results yielded a dimensionless discharge coefficient C-d = 0. 58 close to previous experiments for 90 degrees V-notch weirs.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of sulphides in acid sulphate soils (ASS) {{causes the}} acidification of many Australian coastal river systems. The acidity negatively impacts upon coastal ecosystems, aquaculture, agriculture and concrete and steel infrastructure. In the low-lying floodplains, relatively deep surface drains fitted with one-way floodgates lower the watertable, thereby exposing the sulphidic minerals to oxidation. On the Broughton Creek floodplain in SE Australia, four distinct remediation strategies {{have been developed}} to tackle the issue of acidification by ASS: (i) simple <b>V-notch</b> <b>weirs</b> that raise the level of the watertable surrounding the drains thereby submerging the pyrite and preventing the further formation of acidity; (ii) modified two-way floodgates that allow the inflow of tidal water into the drains, thereby offering the acidity within the drain before it enters the river and raising the level of the watertable surrounding the drain; (iii) lateral impermeable lime barriers that both prevent oxidation of pyrite by stopping the downward movement of oxygen into the soil and neutralise the acidity in the groundwater; and (iv) permeable reactive barriers (PRB) that passively intercept the groundwater flow and neutralise the acidity.

One project, the Viewlands Cascade Drainage System, replaced a narrow, partially concreted ditch with a wide series of stepped pools. The second installation, at 2 nd Avenue NW and known as a Street Edge Alternatives (SEA Streets) project, involved the complete reconstruction of the street and its drainage system to reduce impervious area and install stormwater detention ponds.

A 1. 4 ha natural gas well pad was constructed in an intermittent stream channel at the Alto Experimental Watersheds in East Texas, USA (F 1), while another 1. 1 ha well pad was offset about 15 m from a nearby intermittent stream (F 2). <b>V-notch</b> <b>weirs</b> were constructed downstream of these well pads and stream sedimentation and water quality was measured.

40|$|A {{commonly}} used flood mitigation technique in coastal areas of Australia {{during the late}} 1960 ’s was the installation of one-way floodgates on flood mitigation drains. In regions affected by acid sulphate soils (the oxidation of pyrite in the soil forms sulphuric acid), the floodgates prevent tidal carbonate/bicarbonate buffering of the drains and thereby create reservoirs of acidic water (pH 3 ̆c 4. 5) that discharge during low tide. Several acid sulphate soil remediation techniques {{have been used in}} coastal lowland in southeastern NSW, Australia. Following extensive monitoring and finite element modelling of groundwater conditions and quality, fixed level <b>v-notch</b> <b>weirs</b> were installed at three elevations to maintain elevated groundwater levels.

Following further monitoring, investigation into anaerobic acid sources, and finite element based geochemical modelling, modified two-way floodgates that allow tidal ingress were installed. The modified floodgates were successful in buffering the drain water pH before discharging the drain water into adjacent waterways.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{hydrological}} {{constraints on the}} existence of forested peat domes (peat swamp forests) in the humid tropics, the self-regulation mechanisms that enable them to persist and the implications for restoration of damaged domes. The most important requirement for the preservation of peat is permanent saturation by water. The variable input of precipitation must be translated into a constant water supply to the peat mound. In intact tropical peat swamp domes, water is stored above the peat surface in depressions between hummocks that surround tree trunks and between spreading buttress roots. This above-ground water store is analogous to the water stored in the loose upper layer of peat and vegetation in Sphagnum bogs. The horizontal differentiation of the peat swamp forest floor into hummocks with limited hydraulic conductivity and depressions with high storage capacity resembles the hummock-hollow patterning of these Sphagnum bogs. Hummocks and other surface elements functionally resemble <b>V-notch</b> <b>weirs</b> that regulate water availability. Buttressed trees {{play a key role in}} providing the structural elements for hydrological self-regulation. An additional level of regulation is found in the concentric zonation of forest types with increased presence of buttressed trees on steeper margins.

40|$|The {{acidification}} of Australian coastal waterways as {{a result}} of the oxidation of acid sulphate soil (ASS) containing appreciable quantities of sulphidic material (e. g. pyrite) has well recognised environmental, economic and social effects including the loss of fish, biodiversity and agricultural productivity as well as the corrosion of concrete and steel infrastructure by acidic drainage. Largescale artificial drainage and one-way floodgates in low-lying coastal floodplains has lowered the groundwater table, thus enhancing pyritic oxidation and increasing the distribution, magnitude and frequency of acid generation and release of toxic metals such as aluminium (Al 3 +) and iron (total Fe) from ASS. Engineering strategies implemented on the Shoalhaven Floodplain, southeast New South Wales, Australia have been designed to remediate ASS. These include: (1) fixed-level <b>v-notch</b> <b>weirs,</b> which raise the groundwater table above the pyritic layer and reduce the rate of discharge of acidic products from the groundwater into the drains; (2) modified two-way floodgates, which allow for tidal buffering of acidic drainage; (3) a subsurface alkaline horizontal impermeable lime-fly ash barrier, which prevents pyrite oxidation and neutralises acidic groundwater and (4) an alkaline permeable reactive barrier (PRB) using recycled materials, which significantly increases groundwater pH and reduces Al and Fe concentrations within and down-gradient of the PRB.

We studied storm {{discharges}} of nitrate and dissolved and particulate {{forms of}} ammonium, organic N, phosphate, and organic P from four adjacent small watersheds of differing land {{use on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland. We used <b>V-notch</b> <b>weirs</b> and automated storm samplers to measure discharges and collect samples at flow intervals during 76 storms. The watershed aquifers are perched on an impervious clay layer slightly above sea level, so that combined groundwater and surface water discharges were measured at the weirs. The concentrations of particulate forms of organic N (PON), organic P (POP), and inorganic P (PPi) increased up to 3 orders of magnitude during storm events and usually peaked prior to the peak water discharge, while concentrations of dissolved forms of organic N (DON), organic P (DOP), inorganic P (DPi), and nitrate did not change very much. Dissolved and particulate ammonium (DNH 4 and PNH 4, respectively) concentrations increased up to fivefold in storm events but remained low compared to other N forms. The watershed with the most cropland discharged the highest concentrations of total N, PON, DNH 4, nitrate, POP, and PPi. A forested watershed discharged the highest concentrations of DON, PNH 4, and DOP. The watershed with the most grazed land discharged the highest concentration of DPi. PON and POP were the dominant forms of N and P in storm discharges from all watersheds. Concentrations of nitrogen were higher in spring and summer storms than in winter storms, but phosphorus concentrations were much higher in the summer storms than in spring or winter. The concentrations of PPi, POP, PON, DNH 4, and PNH 4 increased significantly with peak water discharge among storms, while concentrations of DPi, DOP, DON, and nitrate {{were not correlated with}} peak discharge.

40|$|Land {{degradation}} due to {{soil erosion}} {{is a major}} issue in the Ethiopian Highlands. Deforestation leads to ongoing gully erosion during the rainy season (June to September) and thus the hydrology of a watershed changes as dense gully networks cause direct drainage of rain water. To better understand watershed scale gully processes in the Ethiopian Highlands, three gauging stations were installed in the 56 km 2 large Gumara-Maksegnit catchment in the northern Amhara region, to monitor discharge and sediment load in the gullies during rainy season. Various weirs respectively a fixed cross section was installed: Two <b>v-notched</b> <b>weirs</b> were built in two approximately 30 ha large sub catchments. Discharge was determined based on continuously logged water level data (ultrasonic sensor respectively pressure sensor) and using a calibrated weir equation. Sediment concentration was estimated based on continuously logged turbidity sensor data. In the main outlet discharge was calculated based on water level data (pressure sensor) and by using a calibrated rating curve which was derived by means of spatial distributed flow velocity measurements within the fixed and rectangular shaped cross section. Sediment concentration was estimated by turbidity sensor equipment. To validate the continuously logged turbidity sensors data additional manually taken runoff samples were used. Additionally, rainfall data was logged at three gauging stations distributed in the watershed. Observed data from the rainy season 2012 showed that the runoff in the sub catchments {{as well as in the}} main outlet was mainly controlled by heavy single storm events. Although baseflow and interflow was observed in the main outlet, the portion of surface runoff dominated the runoff in the gully. As a consequence of the surface runoff driven regime in the gullies, huge amounts of sediment were observed during heavy rainfall events. The hydrological study at Gumara-Maksegnit watershed is part of an entire watershed monitoring program and provides local runoff and sediment yield data as a basis for regional soil conservation planning. Moreover watershed specific relations between precipitation, runoff and sediment concentration in the channels can support predictions of future event scenarios...|$|R

The permeabilities of the schist landslides have previously {{been reported to}} be c. 1 x 10 ⁻¹⁷ - 4 x 10 ⁻⁶ m 2 and the permeability structure is dominated by large fracture zones. Of the 315 hydrological instruments in the gorge for which data have been analysed, 21 monitoring well piezometers record repeated metre- or centimetre-scale groundwater level changes, and 12 underground <b>V-notch</b> <b>weirs</b> record elevated flow rates induced by the same earthquakes. Groundwater level changes exhibit consistent temporal characteristics at all monitoring sites, namely a time to peak pressure change on the order of one month and a subsequent recovery period on the order of one year. Changes in weir flow rate are near-instantaneous with maximum flow rates reached within 0 - 6 hours, followed by recession periods on the order of one month. Hydrological responses to different earthquakes at each monitoring site are systematic in terms of polarity and amplitude. This comprehensive dataset enables consistent patterns in the amplitude, time to peak pressure change and recovery time of groundwater level changes, and elevated weir discharge volumes in response to earthquake shaking to be documented. Earthquakes inducing hydrological responses have been categorised into five categories based on shaking characteristics (duration, bandwidth and amplitude). Larger hydrological responses and proportionally shorter time to peak pressure change and recovery time are associated with long duration (25 - 50 s or longer), high-amplitude, broad bandwidth shaking. The larger amplitudes of hydrological response and proportionally shorter times to peak pressure change and recovery times, are interpreted to represent greater temporary enhancement of the landslides hydraulic properties, particularly permeability. Understanding how earthquakes can enhance or otherwise affect hydraulic properties such as permeability in fractured reservoirs is intrinsically important and may prove of economic utility for both the geothermal and hydrocarbon energy sectors...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying {{effectiveness}} of soil management practices on surface and subsurface water quality {{at the field}} scale is becoming increasingly important in the Lake Champlain Basin and other agricultural watersheds. During 2012 and 2013, field plots (22. 9 x 45. 7 m) were established at the Lake Alice Wildlife Area in Chazy, NY to begin a long-term water quality monitoring study. Plots were established in a cool season grass field (1 ha) leased and managed by the William H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute in Chazy, NY. The soil type transitions from an excessively drained outwash soil on the upslope to a very poorly drained silty clay series at the toeslope. Tile drainage lines were installed in each plot and drained to concrete manholes {{at the corner of}} each plot where water was sampled and measured. Plots were randomly assigned to a tile-drained (TD) or naturally-drained treatment (UD). Tile outlets were plugged in the UD treatment to enable natural drainage conditions. Surface runoff water was collected at the lower boundary of each plot by shallow PVC-lined trenches that outlet to the manholes. Continuous water flow from each hydrologic pathway was measured in 5 -gallon buckets with <b>v-notch</b> <b>weirs</b> and pressure transducers. Total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus SRP), unreactive phosphorus (UP) and sediment (TSS) loads were estimated by multiplying the mean hourly runoff volume by the respective sample concentration for each hydrologic pathway. Data were collected April 21, 2014 through June 30, 2015. Loading rates were unable to be calculated from February 22, 2015 through April 9, 2015 due to freeze/thaw cycles preventing accurate water flow data collection. Event-based loading for TP, SRP, UP, TSS, and water yield were calculated in addition to cumulative losses over the study duration. No significant differences in cumulative TP exports were found between treatments (UD = 230. 9 g ha- 1; TD = 233. 9 g ha- 1). Approximately 55 % more SRP and 158 % more TSS was exported by UD (130. 8 g ha- 1; 168. 8 kg ha- 1) than TD (84. 2 g ha- 1; 65. 5 kg ha- 1). Unreactive P exports from TD (149. 7 g ha- 1) were 50 % greater than UD (100. 1 g ha- 1). Two runoff events dominated the treatment response. An intense rain storm on May 16, 2014 generated the greatest sediment losses in both treatments during an individual event, contributing 65 and 67 % of the cumulative losses from TD and UD, respectively. This event was also responsible for 40 % of UP losses from TD. A 3 d rain/snowmelt event beginning on December 24, 2014 resulted in 61 and 84 % of all SRP losses for TD and UD, respectively.

This research investigates {{the importance of the}} vadose zone in a small headwater basin (Harp 4 - 21) in the Canadian shield with respect to the generation of stream runoff quantity and quality during episodic rainfall and snowmelt events. The study focused specifically on: ﬁrstly the effect of variable antecedent moisture conditions on water-table and stream response, secondly, the significance of the stored vadose water in water extracted from a rising water-table, and thirdly the significance of preferential flowpathways in the vadose zone as a means of rapidly rotating, stored vadose water to the stream during runoff events. The instrumentation of the Harp 4 - 21 basin includes three <b>v-notch</b> <b>weirs</b> along the stream, numerous piezometers and wells, several soil lysimeters, and three tensiometer nests. Much of the data used in this study was obtained from five sites located along a hillslope transect. Soil water content at each of the hillslope sites was accurately determined using time domain reflectometry (TDR), whereas water table elevations were measured using both electronic water level tapes and calibrated rod ﬂoats. Preferential flowpath data was derived from ﬂow gauging and chemical analyses of water samples. Results obtained from the near-stream and lower slope reaches of the hillslope transect indicated that soil water content in the vadose zone is maintained at a high level of saturation by shallow water-table depths. Further analysis of simultaneously measured soil water content and depth to water—table data clearly showed that the existence of a thick essentially saturated zone overlying the water table (capillary fringe) was responsible for the large and rapid water-table responses observed during many of the nine studied precipitation events. On a basin scale, the seasonal variability of the area in which the capillary fringe extended to the ground surface was largely responsible for the observed trend in basin yield (runoff volume/ rainfall volume) for the nine runoff events. Chemical tracing results using silica, pH and DOC showed that the large vadose water reservoir in the near-stream and lower slope areas was a dominant component in water extracted from a rising water-table during most precipitation events. Silica results from the near-stream vadose zone showed that only the massive groundwater recharge associated with spring snowmelt could completely replace the vadose water reservoir with shorter residence time snowmelt/rainfall water. The rapid routing of stored near-stream capillary fringe vadose water through preferential pathways (macropores, soil pipes) was a significant source of runoff to the stream during runoff events. The presence of soil pipes, along with the significant vadose water reservoir in near-stream and lower slope areas are sufficient to explain the large phreatic/vadose water component typically identified in two component flow separation models, and constitutes the basis of a physically-based conceptual runoff model for the Harp 4 - 21 basin...|$|R

40|$|Water-quality in many rivers remains {{poor and}} needs to be improved. Diffuse {{pollution}} continues to cause difficulties. Some instruments are available which can monitor pollution of rivers from land. They allow measurement and sampling of overland flow (OLF), but they do not offer the precision required (proportional sampling and samples 0. 1 % of OLF). A laboratory unit was constructed to mimic instrument performance in the field. This was used to test three sampler designs. A <b>V-notch</b> <b>weir</b> was used in the first sampler and a Sutro weir {{in the second and third}} as this unit possessed a proportional discharge to head ratio, which the Vnotch weir did not have. Other parameters investigated included ground slope, sampler slope, pipe size and port location. The remaining issues of nozzle size (0. 7, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mm), the number of 1. 0 mm nozzles and the effect of aspiration were investigated. The arrangement with the Sutro weir and three 1. 0 mm nozzles in series gave proportional discharge and the target low sampling rate of 0. 1 %. This will allow the calculation of sediment and chemical losses for the monitored area and will put the loss in context with other losses in a catchment. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{climate warming}} in northwestern Canada is {{occurring}} at an unprecedented rate in recorded history and {{has resulted in}} the widespread thaw of permafrost. Where present, permafrost exerts a significant control on local hydrology, and disappearance of permafrost threatens to change the hydrology of northern basins. In the peatlands that characterise the southern distribution of permafrost in low relief terrain, permafrost takes the form of forested peat plateaus and is interspersed by permafrost-free wetlands (i. e. channel fens and flat bogs). Previous field studies have found that channel fens serve as the drainage network and route water to the basin outlet, whereas flat bogs have been viewed primarily as storage features. Wetland expansion in response to permafrost thaw can transform the primary hydrologic function of flat bogs from storage units to runoff-producing units by removing the relatively impermeable permafrost barrier that encompasses them. As a result, permafrost thaw has the potential to greatly increase the runoff contributing area when large storage features form hydrological connections with the basin drainage network. It has been well documented that permafrost thaw in this region results in the loss of forest and a concomitant expansion of wetlands, however the hydrologic response of these changes is poorly understood. Stream flow records in four Water Survey of Canada gauged basins (152 - 2050 km 2) in the lower Liard River valley were analyzed to determine the impact of permafrost thaw-induced land cover change on basin runoff. Annual runoff between 1996 and 2012 increased by between 112 mm and 160 mm and these changes were significant in all four basins (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). Changes to stream flow were assessed using the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and the Kendall-Theil robust line. Permafrost thaw between 1977 and 2010 was quantified by comparison of historical aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite imagery (World View 2) over a 6 km 2 area of interest, where changes in tree-covered terrain were used as a proxy for permafrost loss. It was found that land cover change from forest to wetland was the most important factor contributing to the increases in runoff (37 - 61 mm), and that basins with a relatively high cover of flat bogs were subject to the largest increases in runoff. This analysis examined increases in runoff contributing area when a direct connection was formed between wetlands. Field studies have indicated the presence of ephemeral drainage channels connecting flat bogs within a peat plateau-bog complex. These drainage channels cut through the peat plateaus and create a series of cascading bogs that ultimately discharges into the channel fen. The bog cascades can greatly increase the runoff contributing area of a basin when the cascade is hydrologically active. To investigate the transport of water through these features, two bog cascades were instrumented with sharp crested <b>v-notch</b> <b>weirs</b> and cut-throat flume boxes in 2013 and 2014. Within the peat plateau-bog complex, the two cascades had markedly different plateau:bog ratios, and therefore different contributing areas. Runoff between the two cascades varied significantly with one cascade producing 125 mm of runoff over the two year period and the other producing only 25 mm. Both cascades were active during the snowmelt period of each year, however only the cascade with the higher plateau:bog ratio produced runoff in response to rain events. It is proposed that the bog cascades operate under an “element threshold concept’, whereby in order for water to be transmitted through a bog, the depression storage capacity of that bog must first be satisfied. This work suggests that neglecting to represent these cascades of connected bogs in numerical models can underestimate basin stream flow by between 10 and 15...|$|R
40|$|According to the 2008 Water Quality Inventory and 303 (d) List, 291 of the 516 {{impairments}} (i. e. 56 %) {{were the}} result of excessive bacteria. Modeling and bacteria source tracking has identified grazing cattle as a source of this bacterial contamination. To help address this, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) funded this project to evaluate the effect of stocking rate on pathogen transport from beef cattle operations and develop guidance for landowners on restoring water quality. The project included three tasks: (1) Project Coordination and Administration, (2) Assess Bacteria Runoff from Intensively Managed Beef Cattle Operations, and (3) Technical Transfer. Task 1, Project Coordination and Administration, consisted of the Texas Water Resources Institute (TWRI) preparing and submitting eleven quarterly progress reports and the final project report, holding 25 coordination meetings, and submitting 12 invoices. To evaluate the impact of grazing management on bacterial runoff (Task 2), TWRI and Texas AgriLife Extension Service (AgriLife Extension) installed three 1 -hectare watershed sites at the Texas A&M University Beef Cattle Systems Center (BCSC), located near College Station. Sites were bermed and equipped with 90 o <b>v-notch</b> <b>weirs,</b> ISCO? samplers with bubble flow meters, and a rain gage. TWRI and AgriLife Extension maintained these watershed sites for two years, conducting over 30 site visits. A variety of stocking rates were evaluated. Site BB 1 was ungrazed. Site BB 2 was stocked at typical stocking rates (SR) for the area (i. e., 3 - 4 acres per animal unit [AU]). Site BB 3 was stocked at a rate twice that of site BB 2. Over the course of the project, six grazing treatments were conducted at sites BB 2 and BB 3. From November 2008 through October 2010, TWRI and AgriLife Extension assessed bacterial concentrations and runoff volume from the watershed sites. E. coli concentrations at all sites greatly exceeded Texas Water Quality Standards. Even at the ungrazed site, non-domesticated animals (i. e., feral hogs) and wildlife significantly impacted E. coli levels preventing attainment of water quality standards, thus indicating the difficulty in achieving standards during runoff events due to background loadings. Data also indicated moderate stocking does not significantly increase E. coli levels above background levels and suggests that 67 - 85 % reductions in E. coli levels may be achieved by converting from heavy to moderate stocking rates. It was also found that pastures stocked heavier than 10 acres per AU should be the primary focus of implementation efforts in this and similar environments. Our data indicated (1) stocking at rates heavier than 10 acres per AU (as is much of the improved pastureland in Texas) may increase E. coli concentrations in runoff while (2) stocking at rates less than 10 acres per AU (much of the rangeland in Texas) does not yield higher E. coli levels than ungrazed pastures. Finally, data show that runoff events occurring while the sites were stocked or within two weeks of them being stocked produced the highest E. coli concentrations; thus, it is recommended grazing in creek pastures be deferred during rainy periods. Within two weeks of grazing, E. coli levels had fallen substantially and after 30 days, E. coli values had declined to background levels. The findings and recommendations regarding appropriate stocking rates/grazing management to minimize bacterial runoff into surface waters of Texas are being included in a fact sheet, presentation, and other resources that will become part of the Lone Star Healthy Streams Beef Cattle Resource Manual. Throughout this project a series of educational programs conducted through the Lone Star Healthy Streams Program transferred information regarding bacterial runoff and conservation practices for reducing it to livestock producers at over 60 programs around the state. Additionally, the website reached 1, 038 unique visitors since its inception. These programs have increased awareness of bacterial runoff from beef cattle grazing operations and conservation practices designed to reduce bacterial loading to Texas streams and water ways. Much work remains to be done. The applicability of water quality standards during runoff events should be evaluated in light of the findings of this study; more data is needed to evaluate the impact of stocked pastures on bacterial runoff; work is needed to assess the impacts of continuous grazing on E. coli runoff; and transfer of this information to cattlemen throughout Texas must continue...|$|R

Journal of Soil Science, 41 (2), 189 - 198. A {{study of the}} leaching of sulphate, chloride, nitrate and the associated cations was carried out over two winter periods on three mole-drained paddocks on a yellow-grey earth (Tokomaru silt loam). The paddocks were occasionally grazed by sheep. At {{the beginning of each}} drainage season potassium chloride (KCl) and sulphur fertilizer, as either single superphosphate (SSP) or elemental sulphur (S°), were applied to two of the paddocks, while the third served as a control. The amount of KCl applied was 200 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, while sulphur was applied at 50 kg S ha- 1 in 1988 and 30 kg S ha- 1 1989. Drain flow from the fertilized paddocks was measured with <b>V-notch</b> <b>weirs,</b> and sampled using proportional samplers. Large differences in the total drainage flow were measured in the two years, with values of approximately 280 mm in 1988 and 110 mm in 1989. Significant amounts of the chloride added through both fertilizer and rainfall were leached, amounting to approximately 105 kg Cl ha- 1 yr- 1. The leaching of sulphate-S depended on the form of S fertilizer applied, the quantity of drainage, and the rate of mineralization. Leaching losses of 17 and 3. 4 kg S ha- 1 were measured from the SSP and S° fertilized paddocks, respectively, in 1988, and 9. 4 and 3. 5 kg S ha- 1 in 1989. The study showed that applying SSP just before the drainage season increased leaching losses of sulphate-S substantially. Although the particle sizes of S° used in both years were much bigger than those specified by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of New Zealand, there appeared to be no difference in the yield response to S applied either as SSP or as S°. The reduced leaching of S when applied as S° resulted from the slow oxidation of S° to sulphate-S. Relatively little nitrate-N was leached, the amount ranging from 11 to 17 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1. Losses of potassium were less than 10 kg K ha- 1 yr- 1, despite the large quantity applied as KCl fertilizer immediately before winter. However a large amount of calcium was leached, between 31 and 52 kg ha- 1 yr- 1. The amount of magnesium leached was between 9 and 15 kg ha- 1 yr- 1. A considerable quantity of sodium was leached, around 58 kg ha- 1 in 1988, and 31 kg Na ha- 1 in 1989, roughly equal to the input in rainfall. Good mass balances were obtained for both chloride and sulphate. The measured moles of negative and positive charge from cations and anions in the leachate were also almost equal. Three models were developed for the leaching of chloride and sulphate-S. An approach dividing the soil water into mobile-immobile phases, and using a fairly detailed soil water flow model was developed. The model was able to simulate the concentration of chloride in the drainage closely, even just after the application of chloride fertilizer, and during highly preferential flow conditions induced by heavy rain. A transfer function model, assuming a log-normal probability density function (pdf) of solute travel pathway lengths, was able to simulate the leaching of chloride reasonably well in 1988. The prediction was less satisfactory in 1989 and during highly preferential flow. By adapting the pdf for chloride to sulphate and by taking adsorption of sulphate into account, the model could predict the sulphate concentration in the drainage quite successfully. A simpler model, using the idea that the two-dimensional flow geometry to the mole drain implies that the drainage concentration approximately equals the average soil solution concentration, was also developed. Despite its simplicity it was able to simulate the leaching of chloride and sulphate as well as the transfer function model. Irrespective of the model being used, the net mineralization rate of soil organic sulphur emerged as an important factor in predicting the leaching of sulphate...|$|R
