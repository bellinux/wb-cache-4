40|$|In {{this paper}} we report results from some {{investigations}} {{on the use}} of ultrasonics in controlling travelling bubble cavitation. Control of this type of cavitation, generated using a <b>venturi</b> <b>device,</b> has been achieved by manipulation of potential nuclei using a piezoelectric device, termed the Ultrasonic Nuclei Manipulator (UNM). The performance of the UNM, activated in continuous-wave (CW) and pulsed modes, has been studied over a range of dissolved gas concentration (C). The performance under Cwexcitation is found to depend sensitively on C, with lack of control in near-saturated water samples. Failure to control cavitation at C≈ 1 under CW-excitation is suggested to be a result of bubble growth by recti. ed di. usion under these conditions. The pulsed mode of excitation of the UNM, in such cases, seems to be a very promising alternative. Further improvement is observed by using two piezoelectric crystals, one driven in the CW-mode and the second in pulsed mode, as the UNM. Through carefully designed experimentation, this has been traced to the movement of nuclei under the in. uence of Bjerknes forces. Besides reduction of noise, other measures of control have been identi. ed and investigated. For example, it has been found that the maximum velocity achievable at the venturi throat can be increased from about 15 ms^- 1 to about 22 ms^- 1 with nuclei manipulation using ultrasonics...|$|E
40|$|Subsurface drip {{irrigation}} {{as a source}} that provides the water directly to the root zone develops a saturated wetted front in the rhizosphere, particularly when the irrigation is close to 100 % of evapotranspiration. Long duration irrigations collect root development around the drip emitters and relatively low hydraulic conductivity, mainly in heavy soils, lead to preservation of saturation in the root layer, resulting in lack of air, which is detrimental to the function of roots and directly influences crop development.

The air application (aerogation) affected the soil moisture in the root zone reducing the water content or repelled the water from the proximal environment of the emitter.

40|$|Summary: Of {{the many}} {{environmental}} factors and stressors associated with clinical illness in cattle feedyards, fugitive dust {{is recognized as}} an important but ill-defined contributor. To date, {{little research has been}} conducted to quantify accurately the contribution of fugitive dust to the onset, duration and severity of respiratory disease in feedyard cattle. As a result, the art and science of conducting controlled experiments to quantify such effects are poorly developed. We report preliminary results of an attempt to correlate two independent means of estimating the cumulative exposure of livestock to dust in a semi-enclosed environment. In this experiment, a known quantity of simulated feedyard dust was manufactured from dried, sieved f edyard manure. The dust was delivered via a <b>Venturi</b> <b>device</b> into a leaky tent constructed over two sorting pens at a research feedyard in Bushland, TX. Particle-size distributions of the manufactured dust were determined using a Coult r Counter. High-volume PM 10 samplers operated inside the tent for the duration of dust delivery. An analytical model of the tent system was derived to predict the average concentration of PM 10 in the air during the dust event. Model-predicted concentrations based on Coulter Counter analysis were a factor of 28. 2 greater than the concentrations measured with EPA-designated Federal Reference Method PM 10 samplers. The disparity between measured and predicted concentrations appears to be a result, in part, of the use of ultrasonic energy to suspend the dust samples in electrolyte for Coulter Counter analysis...|$|E

In this thesis, I investigate the capabilities of various new and established ionization techniques including (a) the Array of Micromachined UltraSonic Electrosprays (AMUSE), (b) Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) and (c) Electrospray Ionization (ESI) for bioanalytical and biomedical analysis purposes. The AMUSE is a MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) -based device that was created as an alternative, and more sensitive approach for ion generation in an array format. In the AMUSE, the processes of droplet formation and DC droplet charging are separated allowing ionization of liquid samples using low charging voltages and a wide variety of solvents. Our analytical characterization work with the AMUSE showed that ion generation with this device was indeed possible, and that incorporation of a <b>Venturi</b> <b>device</b> increased signal stability and sensitivity due to enhanced droplet desolvation and increased ion transfer efficiency. A detailed investigation to determine the optimal source parameters for ionization of aqueous solutions of model compounds including reserpine, leucine enkephalin and cytochrome C was carried out and it was found that ionization was possible even without the application of a DC charging potential. Subsequent experiments using the thermometer ion method to characterize the AMUSE from a more fundamental point of view, showed that AMUSE ions are lower in internal energy than ESI ions, opening interesting possibilities for the mass spectrometric study of labile species. Furthermore, it was found {{that it was possible to}} manipulate the internal energy of the ion population by varying the parameters that most strongly affect desolvation and focusing. Our studies with DART were directed at investigating its analytical potential for application to the identification of active ingredients (AIs) in low quality combination medicines and counterfeit antimalarials that are commonly sold in regions of the world (particularly Southeast Asia) where drug resistant malaria is endemic as their use may engender increased resistance against the few remaining effective antimalarials.

Investigations of Van de Sande (1974) on plunging jets having 10 -mm-dia. nozzle suggested slightly decrease in oxygen transfer rate with diminishing angle. Ahmed (1974) and van de Donk (1981) researched over inclination angles of jet and found that oxygen transfer coefficient was weakly influence by angle of impact. Tojo et al. (1982) findings on inclination angle of two cylindrical nozzles ranged from 45 ° to 90 ° were significantly different from above studies and indicated that the jet impact angle of the nozzles considerably influences the oxygen transfer rate of a jet mixer, and the author suggested an optimum inclination angle of 60 o for efficient oxygen transfer and mixing. Ohkawa et al. (1986) experimented over inclined jets having angles of 45 ° and 60 ° and found no significant influence of inclination angle on oxygen transfer rate. Bagatur et al.

Deswal and Verma (2007 b) studied the performance of conical plunging jet aerator having jet angle of 60 ° with smaller jet thicknesses and tested the validity of support vector machines modeling technique. Deswal (2011) used SVM and GP regression techniques in modeling oxygen transfer by multiple plunging jets. Singh et al.

40|$|In {{recent years}} it has been proved {{possible}} to design synthetic molecular systems in which positional displacements of sub-molecular components occur upon the application of external stimuli. [1 - 4] Through the pioneering work of Stoddart, Sauvage and others[1 - 3] {{it has become clear}} that the remarkable ability of rotaxanes to change the relative positions of their interlocked components in response to various external stimuli (light, electrons, heat, pH, nature of the environment) should one day find practical uses. However, truly functional systems based on synthetic molecular machines are still to be produced. Some key questions remain unanswered: What are the structural features necessary for molecules to convert this controlled motion into useful function? At what level (single molecule, nanoscopic, microscopic, macroscopic) can this be done? Can we address and utilize the induced-motion in a single molecular machine? To answer those questions we are advocating the use of molecular machines coupled to a polymeric scaffold. We are convinced that this is an efficient route to translate the sub-molecular motion into a useful response that can be exploited to perform physical tasks. Molecular machines with mechanically interlocked architectures are particularly suited for these sorts of applications because, they permit the controlled, large amplitude, movement and positioning of one mechanically interlocked component with respect to another. Among these architectures, rotaxanes -i. e. molecules consisting of a macrocycle threaded on a linear molecule capped with bulky end stoppers- are a particularly promising kind of synthetic molecular 'shuttles'.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. 1. 1 Background: Acid {{mine water}} {{containing}} sulphate and {{high concentrations of}} dissolved heavy metals, including iron(II), can have pH values as low as 2. 5. Environmental pollution caused by such effluents are major contributors to the salinisation of receiving water, and may prove toxic to both fauna and flora. Acid, sulphate-rich solutions are produced bacteriologically from pyrite present in waste dumps from mining and metallurgical operations and from spent sulphuric acid used in chemical or metallurgical plants. The following large mine water treatment projects are currently receiving attention in South Africa on a national level: 1. Amanzi Water Project. The Amanzi project deals with the treatment of mine water (potentially 240 Ml/d) for the recovery of potable water and by-products (e. g. gypsum). Participating mines in the project are Randfontein Estates, First Wesgold, Durban Roodepoort Deep, Rand Leases, ERPM and Grootvlei. The pH of these waters varies fiom 2. 8 to 6. 0 and the sulphate concentrations h m 600 to 3 000 mg/l (SWaMP Steering Committee, 1998). 2. Olifants Forum. Polluted mine water, estimated at a volume of 130 Ml/d, is currently discharged to water courses on the Highveld. The mine water has a pH level between 2 and 4 and contains high sulphate concentrations (> 700 mg/l) (Van Zyl, et al., 2000). Unless neutralized, such water may not be discharged into water courses. Lime is generally used for neutralization. Neutralization costs could be reduced significantly should lime be replaced with limestone. The cost of limestone is currently R 130 /t compared to R 700 /t for lime. Furthermore, increasing pressure is being exerted by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry to enforce sulphate removal from effluent. Extensive studies have already been {{carried out by the}} mining industry to evaluate possible sulphate removal technologies. The high cost of these technologies are considered a major obstacle. Therefore, efforts to develop a cost-effective treatment process for the recovery of re-usable water from sulphate-rich effluents, is of national importance. 1. 2 Objectives: The objectives of this investigation were to develop processes whereby acid and/or sulphate-rich water can be treated. The specific aims of the investigation were to: 1. Develop the integrated iron(II) -oxidation and limestone neutralization process where powdered limestone is used for the neutralization of iron(II) -rich acid water in a completely-mixed reactor (Chapters 3 and 4 and Patents 1 - 3). 2. Develop the biological sulphate removal process for treatment of sulphate-rich effluents (Chapters 5 and 6). 3. Develop the barium sulphide process for treatment of sulphate-rich effluents (Chapter 7). 4. Develop a water flow and chemical mass balance model to identify the most cost-effective treatment option for a water network (Chapter 8). 1. 3 Findings: The following innovative processes/models were developed for neutralization and sulphate removal from industrial effluents: 1. A limestone handling and dosing system. 2. A limestone neutralization and iron(II) -oxidation process for the removal of free acid, iron and aluminium. 3. A biological sulphate removal stage which includes biological sulphate reduction, H 2 S-stripping and aerobic treatment for the removal of residual organic material, and calcium carbonate precipitation. The barium process, which is similar to the biological sulphate removal process, can also be used for sulphate removal. 4. Modelling of a typical water network of a mining operation. 1. 3. 1 Limestone neutralization: In order to develop the limestone neutralization technology to the stage of full-scale implementation it was necessary to understand its limitations, study its kinetics, develop design criteria for full-scale plants and to protect the intellectual property through patents. 1. 3. 1. 1 The limestone neutralization process. Limestone was not used previously on a large scale for neutralization of iron(II) -rich acid water. The reasons were: 1. The pH of iron(II) -rich water could not be raised sufficiently with limestone to rapidly allow iron(II) to be oxidized to iron(II). Rapid oxidation of iron(II) occurs only at pH 7 and higher. This can however be achieved with lime, while limestone only raises the pH of iron(II) -rich water to pH 6. 2. The reactivity of limestone is too low to neutralize acid water completely within an acceptably short residence time when stoichiometric dosages are applied. 3. Iron(II) passivates limestone particles due to Fe(OH) 3 preferentially precipitating {{on the surface of the}} limestone particles, where the pH is the highest. 1. 3. 1. 2 Kinetics of limestone neutralization. Stumm and Lee (1961) investigated the rate equation for biological iron(II) -oxidation and determined that it is a function of the pH, iron(II) and oxygen concentrations. This rate equation was investigated for the case where limestone was used as the neutralization agent. Special attention was given to the effect of suspended solids concentration on the rate of iron(II) - oxidation. 1. 3. 1. 3 Full-scale implementation of limestone neutralization For the present investigation a demonstration plant was constructed and evaluated for iron(II) - Oxidation/limestone neutralization (Maree, et al., 2004). A plant with a capacity of 1 Ml/d was constructed at BCL, a nickel and copper mine in Botswana. Ore tailings leachate, with an acid concentration of 10 g/l (as CaC 03), was treated. Limestone, available at a cost of R 150 /t, was used for neutralization of the acid water. Previously, leachate with a high acid concentration was combined with less acidic streams before it was neutralized with lime. The result of this approach was that a large volume of product water was slightly over-saturated with respect to gypsum, resulting in scaling of pipelines and other equipment. The leachate was neutralized separately from the less acidic streams. The over-saturated fraction was first allowed to crystallize from solution in the fluidized-bed reactor before being combined with the other streams. The following patents were registered, following the investigation: 1. A patent on the integrated limestone and iron(II) -oxidation process. 2. A patent for a limestone handling and dosing system was registered where powdered precipitated CaC 03 was dumped onto a concrete slab, slurried to constant density with an automatic control, and used for neutralization of the acid water. 3. A patent on an integrated limestone and lime process for the treatment of acid and sulphate-rich effluents. This allows the following: - Stage 1 : The bulk of the acid is neutralized with limestone while C 02 is produced and stripped off by aeration. - Stage 2 : Lime is added to allow precipitation of magnesium and other metals as well as sulphate associated with these metals. - Stage 3 : The C 02 that is produced in Stage 1 is used to adjust the high pH of the water from Stage 2 to 8. 3. This allows CaC 03 precipitation. 1. 3. 2 Biological sulphate removal A biological process was developed whereby sulphate reduction to sulphide and sulphide oxidation to elemental sulphur occur in the same reactor. The following aspects were investigated: the reaction rate of biological sulphate reduction, the effect of various parameters on the reaction rate such as temperature, sulphide and sulphate concentrations and the identification of intermediate products formed. Pilot scale evaluation of the following stages of the biological sulphate removal process were evaluated: 1. Heating stage. Feed water to the anaerobic stage was first contacted directly with hot coal gas to raise the temperature of the water to 30 °C. 2. Anaerobic stage. A pilot plant with a capacity of 8 m³/h was operated, using ethanol or sugar as energy source. H 2 S-stripping and processing stage. A laboratory unit was operated to evaluate the suitability of the following reactor types for H 2 S-stripping and processing: <b>Venturi</b> <b>device</b> and a packed-bed reactor. 1. 3. 3 Integrated Bas process for sulphate removal Laboratory studies were carried out to demonstrate that the integrated Bas-process is technically and economically viable for sulphate removal. The Bas process consists of the following stages: 1. Thermal stage where barium sulphate is reduced to barium sulphide at 1 050 °C, using coal as the reductant. 2. Sulphate removal stage 3. Sulphide stripping and processing stage 4. Softening stage where limestone is precipitated. 1. 3. 4 Modeling The water network of a coal mine was audited and simulated by an interactive, steady state model to determine the optimum effluent treatment process configuration. The findings from this investigation were used to optimize the mine's water management strategy. Simulation of the interactions in the water network was used to show the following: (i) Powdered CaC 03 can be used as an alternative to lime for the neutralization of acid water at a cost saving. (ii) The amount of gypsum crystallization that occurred in the primary neutralization and coal processing plants. This information was needed to plan for sludge disposal. (iii) The benefits associated with separate treatment of the most polluted stream versus combined treatment of all streams during mine water treatment. By treating the higher polluted streams separate from the lesser polluted streams, higher salt removal efficiencies are achieved. (iv) The OSI (gypsum oversaturation index) value can be controlled effectively at 1 by treating the feed water to the coal processing, for sulphate removal. The capacity of the sulphate removal plant required was determined as well as the associated capital and running costs. 1. 4 Benefits The treatment approach outlined offers the following benefits: (i) The cheapest alkali, a by-product from the paper industry, can be used for neutralization of the acid and for the removal of the bulk of the sulphate concentration through gypsum crystallization. The more advanced biological process is then used only for removal of the remaining sulphate, to low concentrations. (ii) A robust biological process is used for sulphate removal to produce process water which is non-scaling and suitable for discharge into public streams. (iii) This is an integrated process as CO 2 produced during limestone-neutralization is used for H 2 S-stripping in the biological stage. The stripped H 2 S-gas is utilized in the limestone-neutralization stage for precipitation of iron as iron sulphide.
