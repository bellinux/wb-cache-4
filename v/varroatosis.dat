40|$|The {{rigorous}} dissertation {{extending the}} graduation thesis deals in its general part comprehensively with a parasitic mite Varroa destructor {{and its relation}} to the bees of the Apis genus (with focus on the species Apis mellifera). Both the host and the parasite are comprehensively introduced in terms of systemic classification, anatomical constitution, biology, developmental cycle, learning the mutual relationship, diagnosis, spreading, treatment and prevention of <b>varroatosis</b> in honey-bearing bees (Apis mellifera). As a part of the rigorous dissertation, there is discussion on Eastern honey bee (Apis cerana), concentrating on its spreading (subspecies) and its defence against <b>varroatosis.</b> The dissertation also mentions basic information about the American foulbrood (Histolysis infectiosa perniciosa larvae apium) and nosemosis. It also states the infection situation of Varroa destructor in the period of 2004 - 2010. Last but not least, I attempted to outline the infection situation of Varroa destructor on selected continents. Practical part of the dissertation lists the actual results of experimental incubation of Varroa destructor together with the honey-bearing bee in different temperatures.

40|$|International audienceColony losses {{caused by}} <b>varroatosis</b> {{in the western}} hive bee, Apis mellifera, are mainly due to worker bee injury by Varroa {{destructor}} mites during preimaginal development. These effects have been examined repeatedly; however, {{little is known about}} effects on drones. Here we present the first exact data on individual drone weight loss, especially from the red eyed pupal stage onwards. The resulting reduction in weight of adult drones was related to the number of female mites (up to 20) that had invaded a brood cell. Weight loss was significant even if only one female mite was present. From several of the heavily infested brood cells adult mini-drones emerged...|$|E
40|$|<b>Varroatosis,</b> as {{the current}} bane of the beekeepers, is causing the {{greatest}} economic damage in the apicultural sector. Varroa mites have a vector role, distributing viruses and weakening bees that then become more susceptible to other pathogens as well. Disorientation of bees, robbing, and frame exchanging can transport mites from one colony to another (Oliver, 2011). It is generally accepted {{that there are no}} colonies without mites in Hungary. Infection levels increase over time in colonies that are left untreated or not managed regularly. The infection level must be kept as low as possible for a sustainable production. Consistent control of <b>varroatosis</b> should be provided without harmful effects such as toxic residues persist in the hive products (honey, wax, etc.). Organic beekeeping methods only allow the use of natural materials such as essential oils and organic acids for managing hive hygiene. In 2013 within the on-farm beekeeping research program, the Hungarian Research Institute for Organic Agriculture (ÖMKi) is collaborating with beekeepers throughout Hungary in comparative trials that test the efficacy of different Varroa control treatments and management methods. These trials are set up in market operations. One essential objective of the program is to monitor Varroa infection levels systematically with different mite-counting techniques. Throughout the season, different treatments and managements are chosen that match with a colonies’ biological state and environmental conditions such as brood period, temperature, etc. Most of the treatments affect only the phoretic mites. Therefore during the season some operations - where it is possible - generate a capped broodless state for treatments. The major part of effective mite control is good timing of the closing treatment in the end of the beekeeping season in the broodless period...|$|E

40|$|Quanto às enfermidades apícolas descreve-se que o Brasil está em situação vantajosa comparando com outros países, por apresentar enxames rústicos que, por serem mais resistentes a doenças, dispensam a utilização de antibióticos. Entretanto, a dinâmica de populações do ácaro Varroa mostrou ser muito diferente das outras regiões afetadas pela varroose sendo os primeiros índices registrados superiores a 20 % e, ainda, se têm poucos trabalhos em relação à taxa de infestação em diferentes regiões do Brasil. Desta forma, este trabalho teve como objetivo realizar um levantamento de incidência do ácaro Varroa {{destructor}} (Anderson & Trueman) em colmeias na região de Sinop, MT. As coletas foram realizadas nos meses de julho e agosto de 2011 em oito apiários fixos. Abelhas que estavam próximas aos quadros centrais foram coletadas e no laboratório de Entomologia da UFMT, Campus Universitário de Sinop, foi realizada a triagem e armazenamento das abelhas e ácaros. Os apiários visitados estão situados nos municípios de Santa Carmen e de Sinop e estão localizados em áreas de preservação, embora estejam próximos a áreas destinadas ao cultivo de soja e milho. Como resultado, obteve-se média de infestação superior a 9 %. The {{incidence of}} Varroa destructor (Anderson & Trueman) in the Breeding of Stinging Bees in Sinop and Surrounding Regions, Mato Grosso, Brazil Abstract. In terms of apiculture diseases, Brazil stands in an advantageous situation {{compared to other}} countries, because of its rustic swarms that are more resistant to diseases, and, therefore, do not require antibiotics. Nevertheless, {{it was observed that}} the Varroa mite population was very different from those of other regions affected by <b>varroatosis,</b> with the first recorded rates above 20 %. Furthermore, the studies regarding infestation rates in Brazil are scarce, which poses a barrier for comparisons in this regard. Hence, this study was performed with the objective to survey the incidence of the Varroa destructor (Anderson & Trueman) mite in bee colonies located in the region of Sinop, Mato Grosso. Samples were collected during July and August 2011 in eight apiaries fixed. Bees that were close to the central frames were collected and laboratory UFMT of Entomology, University Campus of Sinop was performed sorting and storage of bees and mites. Visited apiaries are located in the cities of Santa Carmen and Sinop and are located in areas of preservation, although they are near areas for the cultivation of soybeans and corn.

40|$|Ziel der Studie Die Varroatose ist eine Bienenkrankheit verursacht durch die Milbe Varroa destructor. Seit Anfang der 1990 er Jahre werden Bienenvölker erfolgreich mit Oxalsäure-Aerosolen gegen Varroatose behandelt. Es bestehen jedoch Bedenken hinsichtlich der Anwendersicherheit der Behandlungsverfahren. Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war es, die inhalative Belastung von Imkern durch Oxalsäure-Aerosole während der Varroatose-Bekämpfung zu ermitteln und zu bewerten. Methodik An der Untersuchung beteiligten sich 20 Imker. Eine Gruppe (n= 10) versprühte eine 3 %-ige wässrige Oxalsäure-Lösung mit einem Zerstäuber direkt auf die Waben (Sprühverfahren). Eine zweite Gruppe (n= 10) sublimierte 1 bis 2 g Oxalsäure-Dihydrat mit Hilfe eines beheizten Metallpfännchens über das Flugloch in den Bienenkasten (Verdampfungsverfahren). Pro Imker wurden 10 bis 21 Bienenvölker behandelt. In Atemnähe des Imkers wurden Proben der einatembaren und der alveolengängigen Fraktion luftgetragener Partikel nach der Membranfiltermethode gewonnen. Es wurde dabei auf bewährte Probenahmeverfahren des Berufsgenossenschaftlichen Instituts für Arbeitssicherheit (BIA) und der US-amerikanischen Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) zurückgegriffen. Die Oxalsäure-Belegung der Membranfilter wurde anschließend im Labor mittels HPLC bestimmt. Ergebnisse Der mittlere Anteil einatembarer Oxalsäure-Aerosole betrug beim Sprühverfahren 0, 22 mg/m³ (Spannweite 0, 07 - 0, 41 mg/m³), beim Verdampfungsverfahren 0, 23 mg/m³ (Spannweite 0, 01 - 0, 36 mg/m³). Der mittlere Anteil alveolengängiger Oxalsäure-Aerosole betrug beim Sprühverfahren 0, 15 mg/m³ (Spannweite 0, 03 - 0, 67 mg/m³), beim Verdampfungsverfahren 0, 07 mg/m³ (Spannweite 0, 01 - 0, 36 mg/m³). Zwischen den beiden Behandlungsverfahren zeigte sich kein signifikanter Unterschied. Schlußfolgerungen Alle gemessenen Einzelbelastungen lagen unter dem derzeitigen Luftgrenzwert (MAK) von 1 mg/m³ (einatembarer Staub) nach TRGS 900. Die Tagesexpositionszeiten waren deutlich geringer als der Bezugszeitraum von 8 Stunden. Da sich zudem die Varroatose-Behandlung auf wenige Tage im Jahr beschränkt, besteht gegen die Anwendung von Oxalsäure zur Varroatose-Bekämpfung unter den untersuchten Bedingungen kein prinzipieller Einwand. The use of {{oxalic acid}} for {{treatment}} against <b>varroatosis</b> by evaporation or spraying procedure is considered as highly effective and well tolerated by bees. However there exists doubt among beekeepers regarding user-security, {{in particular with}} regard to the evaporation procedure. So far no studies were present for this. The presented study shows that the existing exposure-limit for oxalic acid in the air at working places is clearly fallen below by both procedures. By appropriate use there is no risk {{to the health of the}} apiarist. At the Institute of Occupational and Social Medicine (Institut für Arbeits- und Sozialmedizin), University of Tübingen, Germany, user-security for evaporation and spraying procedure was examined the first time systematically. 20 beekeepers in southern Germany participated in October 2001 in the study. During the respective oxalic acid treatments air samples in breath proximity of the beekeepers were taken. These samples were analysed afterwards in the chemical-analytic laboratory for their oxalic acid content. The results were compared to the existing exposure-limit (MAK-Wert) for oxalic acid. The technical rule for hazardous substances „TRGS 900 “ of German „Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Arbeit“ limits the concentration of oxalic acid in the air at working places to 1. 0 mg/m³. Methods In October 2001 in the context of the presented study 20 beekeepers were accompanied along their oxalic acid treatments. 10 beekeepers used the Varrox-evaporator of Andermatt Biocontrol AG according to the operating instructions. 10 beekeepers applied the spraying procedure with a 3 %-solution of oxalic acid following a proven method. Each beekeeper treated 10 to 21 of his hives, 244 hives altogether. The beekeepers needed for their works an average of 100 minutes (8 minutes per hive) applying the evaporation procedure, an average of 111 minutes (9 minutes per hive) applying the spraying procedure. During this entire work-time the sampling device was filtering oxalic acid particles from the air surrounding the working place. In the presented study standard methods were implemented in order to ensure conformity to „DIN EN 401 “, defining the so-called breathable fraction of airbourne particles. The used sampling equipment is a developement of the German „Berufsgenossenschaftliches Institut für Arbeitssicherheit“ (BIA). The oxalic acid particles were filtered by mixed cellulose ester membranes of 0. 8 microns according to a method of US-American „Occupational Safety and Health Administration“ (OSHA). The membrane filters were inserted into a standardized air sampler which was connected to a power-stabilized air collecting pump and to a volume gauge. The air-sampler built onto a stand was put as close to the place that the oxalic-acid emerged as possible, without interfering with the beekeeper’s work. This was for the evaporation procedure within an area of 1 m and a something above the hive‘s entrance by which the Varrox-evaporator was introduced. For the spraying procedure this was within an area of 1 m from the place of spraying, approximately at shoulder height of the beekeeper. After completion of the sampling the oxalic acid carrying membrane filters were brought to the laboratory of the Institute of Occupational and Social Medicine, University of Tübingen, where further analyses took place. Oxalic acid was washed from filters by double-distilled water and was measured according to a proven method by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results Evaluation of data led to a clear result: None of the 20 participating beekeepers reached even half the exposure-limit of 1. 0 mg/m³. The average value of the 10 measurements on evaporation procedure was 0. 23 mg/m³, the average value of the 10 measurements on spraying procedure was 0. 22 mg/m³. There was no significant difference between both methods. To better comprehend these results we must briefly concern ourselves with the definition of the exposure-limit (MAK-Wert) : The exposure-limit is in such a way selected that for an employee no health damage is to be expected if he stays 8 hours a day during a working life-time at working places at which the air concentration of the respective hazardous substance doesn‘t exceed the exposure-limit. Thus, based upon the presented data, a commercial apiarist could use oxalic acid treatments during the whole year 40 hours a week without damaging his health. Conclusions With evaporation- and spraying-procedure of oxalic acid, beekeepers have possibilities of treatment against <b>varroatosis</b> whose effectiveness and beecompatibility have already convincingly been proven. The presented study dispelled reservations against both procedures concerning possible health risks, appropriate application presupposed...|$|E
