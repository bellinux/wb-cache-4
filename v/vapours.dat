5|$|Prolonged skin {{contact with}} {{glacial acetic acid}} may result in tissue destruction. Inhalation {{exposure}} (eight hours) to acetic acid <b>vapours</b> at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. Skin sensitization to acetic acid is rare, but has occurred.|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} an iterative technique for {{the definition of}} condensation across two-dimensional elements via the boundary element method (BEM). Initially, the BEM {{is used to calculate}} the steady-state conduction of heat and <b>vapour</b> diffusion, discretizing only the boundary materials' discontinuities. Then, a small sub-domain is defined, where condensation develops; that is, where the <b>vapour</b> pressure exceeds the <b>vapour</b> saturation pressure. Using the Glaser approach, the <b>vapour</b> pressure is equalised to the <b>vapour</b> saturation pressure, and then the <b>vapour</b> equilibrium is redefined by means of the BEM solution. This process is repeated until all sub-domains where <b>vapour</b> pressure exceeds <b>vapour</b> saturation pressure are eliminated. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Wood frame walls {{typically}} need a <b>vapour</b> barrier at {{the warm}} side to avoid interstitial condensation due to <b>vapour</b> diffusion and air leakages from the interior. A more <b>vapour</b> open material {{than the traditional}} <b>vapour</b> barriers, here called <b>vapour</b> retarder, could allow condensed moisture, built-in-moisture or moisture from minor leakages to dry to the interior {{in addition to the}} outward drying. The application of permeable <b>vapour</b> retarders in wood frame walls have been investigated in this study by the use of a hygrothermal simulation tool. A traditional wood frame wall usually has good drying possibilities to the exterior. If a <b>vapour</b> retarder should {{have an effect on the}} total drying, it must not be too <b>vapour</b> tight. The purpose of this study was to find some threshold value for the maximum <b>vapour</b> resistance of a <b>vapour</b> retarder—when a requirement is that it should have a relatively large effect of the total drying of the wall. The increased risk for condensation as the <b>vapour</b> resistance decreases has however not been investigated in this study. In general it was found that permeable <b>vapour</b> barriers have relatively little effect on the total drying of ordinary wood frame walls in a Nordic climate...|$|R

5|$|The Luftwaffe {{scored a}} notable {{success on the}} night of 2 December 1943 when 105 Ju 88 bombers struck the port of Bari. Skilfully using chaff to confuse the Allied radar operators, they found the port packed with brightly lit Allied shipping. The result was the most {{destructive}} air raid on Allied shipping since the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Hits were scored on two ammunition ships and a tanker. Burning oil and exploding ammunition spread over the harbour. Some 16 ships were sunk and eight damaged, and the port was put out of action for three weeks. Moreover, one of the ships sunk, SS John Harvey, had been carrying mustard gas, which enveloped the port in a cloud of poisonous <b>vapours.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the <b>vapours</b> from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{necessity}} for portable and relatively cheap device {{which could be used}} for rapid, reversible and in-situ volatile organic compound detection. We offer a polyisoprene-nanostructured carbon composite (PNCC) us a promising material for organic solvents <b>vapour</b> detection and identification in the environment. Previously obtained experimental results verify that PNCC can distinguish 10 different organic solvents saturated <b>vapour.</b> When PNCC is exposed to organic solvents <b>vapour,</b> molecules of <b>vapour</b> adsorbe {{on the surface of the}} composite and diffuse into matrix material. At the same time decreases the tunnelling currents between carbon aggregates in thin layers of matrix and the electrical resistance of the composite increases. In the presence of organic solvents <b>vapour</b> electric resistance changes remarkably in short time (30 s) and the effect is reversible. The largest electric resistance change velocity (vR) is observed for tetrahydrofuran (0, 19404 KΩ/min), benzene (0, 13082 KΩ/min) and ethylacetate (0, 10694 KΩ/min) <b>vapour.</b> But nearly no vR change is observed, when PNCC is exposed to propanol <b>vapour</b> (0, 004028 KΩ/min). We relate this variant electric resistance response of PNCC to organic solvents <b>vapour</b> variant compatibility with the composites matrix material (polyisoprene) and variant organic solvents <b>vapour</b> molecule dimensions. To evaluate <b>vapour</b> compatibility with the composite matrix material we compared dielectric permeability values of <b>vapour</b> (εv) and polyisoprene (εp). We observed that larger vR change is reached when εv value is close to εp (2, 68) value. PNCC organic solvents <b>vapour</b> sensitivity is selective. The composite does not respond or respond weakly to polar organic solvents <b>vapour</b> presence. Also in the electric resistance response evaluation of PNCC molecule dimensions of organic solvents <b>vapour</b> should be taken into account. As smaller the diameter of <b>vapour</b> and better compatibility with matrix material us greater electric resistance response of PNCC is observed...|$|R
