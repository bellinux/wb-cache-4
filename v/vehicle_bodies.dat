5|$|Holden's second {{full-scale}} car factory, {{located in}} Fishermans Bend (Port Melbourne), {{was completed in}} 1936, with construction beginning in 1939 on a new plant in Pagewood, New South Wales. However, World War II delayed car production with efforts shifted {{to the construction of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>bodies,</b> field guns, aircraft and engines. Before the war ended, the Australian Government took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry. Both GM and Ford provided studies to the Australian Government outlining the production of the first Australian-designed car. Ford's proposal was the government's first choice, but required substantial financial assistance. GM's study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention. After the war, Holden returned to producing <b>vehicle</b> <b>bodies,</b> this time for Buick, Chevrolet, Pontiac and Vauxhall. The Oldsmobile Ace was also produced from 1946 to 1948.|$|E

30|$|The heights at {{four corners}} of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> are {{adjusted}} by controlling the air mass flow rates flowing into or flowing out of the air springs for an EAS system. During off-road driving condition, the EAS system can lift the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> to prevent the suspension from hitting the position limiter [10], while for driving on an expressway with high speed, the air drag can be reduced and the driving safety can be enhanced by lowering the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body.</b> Meanwhile, in order to prevent the phenomenon of vehicle posture instability, i.e., the peak values of the roll and pitch angles of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> are too large, which is mainly caused by the different payloads at four corners and the system parameters difference between the front and rear air suspensions, the effective control of the vehicle leveling is also very essential for the EAS system dynamic performance [11].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Considering the {{efficient}} use of energy and environmental pollution, people’s lives tend to energy saving and environmental protection, and energy saving electric vehicles has gradually been widely used. Through combining theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, system design and experimental validation, based on studying electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> design principles, the experiment optimized electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> design, and reduced {{the weight of the}} vehicle effectively. Its performance becomes more advanced, and the application becomes more economical and safe. By using Solidworks software, lightweight electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> structure of two-dimensional design and three-dimensional modeling was built to reach practical requirements. The body structure design is original and simple, which has good practical value...|$|R

30|$|Mining {{vehicles}} {{are an important}} underground device for the transportation of minerals and staff. Recently, higher requirements on their isolation vibration performance have been demanded. However, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> often experiences continuous and excessive vibrations owing to harsh working conditions. This can lead to discomfort and seriously affect the {{physical and mental health}} of staff [1]. Moreover, the long longitudinal distance between the axles and large load change in mining vehicles can aggravate the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> pitch motion under continuous upslope and downslope roads in the mines. The severe pitch motion is the primary source of the longitudinal vibration to be experienced at points above the center of gravity (CG) of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body.</b> Simultaneously, it intensifies the load transfer between the front and rear wheels, resulting in a safety accident. To improve the carrying capacity and reduce the maintenance cost, leaf spring suspension has been used as the typical suspension system for mining vehicles, but it cannot effectively suppress the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> vibration.|$|R
