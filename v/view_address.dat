5000|$|At the Sorbonne, Jacques and Raïssa {{soon became}} disenchanted with scientism, which could not, in their <b>view,</b> <b>address</b> the larger existential issues of life. In 1901, {{in light of}} this disillusionment, they made a pact to commit suicide {{together}} if they could not discover some deeper meaning to life within a year. They were spared from following through on this because, at the urging of Charles Péguy, they attended the lectures of Henri Bergson at the Collège de France. Bergson's critique of scientism dissolved their intellectual despair and instilled in them [...] "the sense of the absolute." [...] Then, through the influence of Léon Bloy, they converted to the Roman Catholic faith in 1906.|$|E
40|$|Concern {{with the}} {{real-time}} nature of effective reasoning {{led us to}} develop a memory-based model of reasoning. Later efforts convinced us that a formal treatment of this approach would be fruitful. The current paper surveys the evolution of this work and discusses potential future research endeavors. 1 Motivation Traditional theoretical treatments of reasoning do not, in our <b>view,</b> <b>address</b> reasoning per se at all. Rather they seek to characterize the end results of reasoning. We have four complaints with this. First, {{it is not clear}} that reasoning has clearly identifiable end results, but rather goes on and on as part of the active history of an individual reasoner. Second, reasoning is a process or activity, and this is simply ignored in traditional studies. Third, as a consequence, crucial issues of temporal and spatial resources are not taken into account. Finally, if we are going to understand realizable intelligent systems, we must look at what they actually do, i. e., we must accep [...] ...|$|E

5000|$|Often, {{the models}} of an {{architecture}} description are organized into multiple views of the architecture such that [...] "each <b>view</b> <b>addresses</b> specific concerns of interest to different stakeholders of the system". An architecture viewpoint {{is a way of}} looking at a system (RM_ODP). Each view in an architecture description should have a viewpoint documenting the concerns and stakeholders it is addressed to, and the model kinds, notations and modeling conventions it utilizes (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010).|$|R

30|$|In particular, Views & Beyond (V&B) ([Clements et al. 2003]) is an {{appealing}} method for our work, since it proposes a role-based personalization of the SAD contents (a role {{here is a}} stakeholder type). The basic V&B principle states that documenting a software architecture involves documenting the relevant views, and then documenting information that applies {{to more than one}} view. A view is deemed as relevant if some stakeholder cares about it, or if the <b>view</b> <b>addresses</b> a key quality-attribute aspect of the system. Also, this method defines some documentation guidelines, such as the combination of views or the adjustment of the detail level for each view.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors discuss the most {{prominent}} <b>views</b> <b>addressing</b> {{the issue of how}} we imitate actions. It is argued that the existing theories lay along a continuum, with the direct mapping approach at one end (Butterworth, 1990; Gray, Neisser, Shapiro, & Kouns, 1991) the Active Intermodal Matching approach (Meltzoff & Moore, 1997) in the middle, and the goal-directed theory (Bekkering, Wohlschager, & Gattis, 2000) and the dual route theory (Rumiati & Tessari, 2002) at the opposite end. Interestingly the latter views can account for behaviors that cannot be explained by invoking the direct mapping or the Active Intermodal Matching approach. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|From a {{theoretical}} point of <b>view,</b> <b>addressing</b> {{the adoption of}} novelty and change in consumption is a topic of major interest since it challenges the axiomatic foundations of modern microeconomics. Starting from the “continuity hypothesis” which considers the evolution of culture {{to be based on}} biological evolution, an evolutionary approach is presented which highlights the role of consumer learning. By means of a case study on the complex consumption history of sweeteners, it is shown that this approach complements the Lancasterian characteristics approach to the adoption of novelty in consumption in a fruitful way.

50|$|Software {{architecture}} descriptions {{are commonly}} organized into views, which are {{analogous to the}} different types of blueprints made in building architecture. Each <b>view</b> <b>addresses</b> a set of system concerns, following the conventions of its viewpoint, where a viewpoint is a specification that describes the notations, modeling and analysis techniques to use in a view that express the architecture in question {{from the perspective of a}} given set of stakeholders and their concerns (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010). The viewpoint specifies not only the concerns framed (i.e., to be addressed) but the presentation, model kinds used, conventions used and any consistency (correspondence) rules to keep a view consistent with other views.|$|R

In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, {{there has to be a}} nonfictional element, but more often than not the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers.

This paper studies patterns supporting requirements analysis and, in particular, it discusses organizational patterns supporting the conceptual specification of business conversations among organizations within a virtual enterprise.

Organizational patterns are provided using three different concurrent views: an intentional view, a strategic view and a process <b>view.</b> Each <b>view</b> <b>addresses</b> a specific set of concerns of interest to different stakeholders in the system and, as a consequence, it has its own particular notation, rationale and constraints.
