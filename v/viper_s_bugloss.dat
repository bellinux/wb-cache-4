We investigated {{the role of}} vegetation cover, prey availability, and air temperature on {{the selection of a}} retreat site by the Chinese green tree <b>viper</b> (Trimeresurus <b>s.</b> stejnegeri), a nocturnal, arboreal sit-and-wait predator. We manipulated the vegetation structure and distance to the prey source, and monitored the microhabitat temperature within the test enclosures. The results indicated that the height of the daytime perch sites was influenced by the ambient temperature. Snakes perched on lower layers of vegetation seeking cooler conditions when the ambient temperature within the enclosure was high. In addition, when the ambient temperature rose above 25 °C, tree vipers retreated into denser vegetation, which provided significantly lower temperatures due to shading. In contrast, tree vipers in low-temperature environments exhibited no preference for vegetation structures in terms of density, except for an apparent avoidance of vegetation with bare branches and no leaves. The distance to the prey source did not appear to have any significant influence on th...|$|R

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of animal and human physiological processes owes much to {{over a century}} of study of natural toxins. The neurotoxins of kraits (bungarotoxins from Bungarus spp.) and cobras (Naja spp.) have helped define the acetylcholine receptor and neuromuscular transmission. Axonal trafficking and sodium channels have been studied using tetrodotoxin from the blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena spp.) and puffer fish (fugu). Unravelling {{the complexities of the}} human coagulation pathways (intrinsic and extrinsic) has involved studies using haemotoxins from various snakes, including Russell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>vipers</b> (Daboia russelii), the saw-scaled vipers (Echis spp.) and the Australian taipans (Oxyuranus spp.).

40|$|Person re-identification {{concerns}} the matching of pedestrians across disjoint camera views. Due {{to the changes}} of viewpoints, lighting condition-s and camera features, images of the same person from different views always appear differently, and thus feature representations across disjoint camera views of the same person follow different distribu-tions. In this work, we propose an effective, low cost and easy-to-apply schema called the Mirror Representation, which embeds the view-specific feature transformation and enables alignment of the feature distributions across disjoint views for the same person. The proposed Mirror Representation is also designed to explicitly model the relation be-tween different view-specific transformations and meanwhile control their discrepancy. With our Mir-ror Representation, we can enhance existing sub-space/metric learning models significantly, and we particularly show that kernel marginal fisher anal-ysis significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on <b>VIPeR,</b> PRID 450 <b>S</b> and CUHK 01. ...|$|R
40|$|Person re-identification is {{generally}} {{divided into two}} part: first how to represent a pedestrian by discriminative visual descriptors and second how to compare them by suitable distance metrics. Conventional methods isolate these two parts, the first part usually unsupervised {{and the second part}} supervised. The Bag-of-Words (BoW) model is a widely used image representing descriptor in part one. Its codebook is simply generated by clustering visual features in Euclidian space. In this paper, we propose to use part two metric learning techniques in the codebook generation phase of BoW. In particular, the proposed codebook is clustered under Mahalanobis distance which is learned supervised. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed method is effective. With several low level features extracted on superpixel and fused together, our method outperforms state-of-the-art on person re-identification benchmarks including <b>VIPeR,</b> PRID 450 <b>S,</b> and Market 1501...|$|R
40|$|Background:Snake bite {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{neglected}} public health issues in poor rural communities worldwide. In addition to the clinical effects of envenoming, treatment with antivenom frequently causes serious adverse reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and pyrogenic reactions. We aimed to investigate the immune responses to Sri Lankan snake envenoming (predominantly by Russell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>viper)</b> and antivenom treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings:Plasma concentrations of Interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), soluble TNF receptor I (sTNFRI), anaphylatoxins (C 3 a, C 4 a, C 5 a; markers of complement activation), mast cell tryptase (MCT), and histamine were measured in 120 Sri Lankan snakebite victims, both before and after treatment with antivenom. Immune mediator concentrations were correlated with envenoming features and the severity of antivenom-induced reactions including anaphylaxis. Envenoming was associated with complement activation and increased cytokine concentrations prior to antivenom administration, which correlated with non-specific systemic symptoms of envenoming but not with coagulopathy or neurotoxicity. Typical hypersensitivity reactions to antivenom occurred in 77 / 120 patients (64...|$|R
40|$|Color names based image {{representation}} is successfully used in person re-identification, {{due to the}} advantages of being compact, intuitively understandable {{as well as being}} robust to photometric variance. However, there exists the diversity between underlying distribution of color names' RGB values and that of image pixels' RGB values, which may lead to inaccuracy when directly comparing them in Euclidean space. In this paper, we propose a new method named soft Gaussian mapping (SGM) to address this problem. We model the discrepancies between color names and pixels using a Gaussian and utilize the inverse of covariance matrix {{to bridge the gap between}} them. Based on SGM, an image could be converted to several soft Gaussian maps. In each soft Gaussian map, we further seek to establish stable and robust descriptors within a local region through a max pooling operation. Then, a robust image representation based on color names is obtained by concatenating the statistical descriptors in each stripe. When labeled data are available, one discriminative subspace projection matrix is learned to build efficient representations of an image via cross-view coupling learning. Experiments on the public datasets - <b>VIPeR,</b> PRID 450 <b>S</b> and CUHK 03, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method...|$|R
