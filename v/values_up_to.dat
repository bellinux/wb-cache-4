5|$|The first twelve stamps, the low <b>values</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1 shilling, {{were issued}} during 1922–1923, while the three high values, 2/6, 5/- and 10/-, {{did not appear}} until 8 September 1937. Designs included: Sword of Light, Map of Ireland, Celtic Cross, Arms of the Four Provinces and St. Patrick. Watermark and extra values were made until new designs, known as the Gerl definitives, using early Irish art motifs, were {{produced}} in 1968. These were the first new designs in 31 years for the high values and 46 years for the low values. The Gerl series was denominated initially in pre-decimal Irish pounds and later in decimal currency (both watermarked issues). It latterly appeared as unwatermarked stamps.|$|E

25|$|Sorting is {{typically}} done in-place, by iterating up the array, growing the sorted list behind it. At each array-position, it checks the value there against the largest {{value in the}} sorted list (which happens to be next to it, in the previous array-position checked). If larger, it leaves the element in place {{and moves to the}} next. If smaller, it finds the correct position within the sorted list, shifts all the larger <b>values</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> make a space, and inserts into that correct position.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{there is}} some degree of {{empiricism}} and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes {{with the use of}} a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. For example, the Collatz conjecture has been verified for start <b>values</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> about 2.88×1018. The Riemann hypothesis has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the zeta function. Neither of these statements is considered proved.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors {{bridge the}} gap between {{conventional}} capacitors and rechargeable batteries. They have the highest available capacitance values per unit volume and the greatest energy density of all capacitors. They support up to 12,000 Farads/1.2 Volt, with capacitance <b>values</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10,000 times that of electrolytic capacitors. While existing supercapacitors have energy densities that are approximately 10% of a conventional battery, their power density is generally 10 to 100 times greater. Power density is defined as the product of energy density, multiplied by the speed at which the energy is delivered to the load. The greater power density results in much shorter charge/discharge cycles than a battery is capable, and a greater tolerance for numerous charge/discharge cycles. This makes them well-suited for parallel connection with batteries, and may improve battery performance in terms of power density.|$|E

25|$|On various occasions, {{commemorative}} coins are minted, {{often in}} gold and silver with face <b>values</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 100,000 yen. The first of these were silver ¥100 and ¥1000 Summer Olympic coins issued {{on the occasion of}} the 1964 games. Recently this practice is undertaken with the 500-yen coin, the first two types were issued in 1985, in commemoration of the science and technology exposition in Tsukuba and the 100th anniversary of the Governmental Cabinet system. The current commemorative 500- and 1000-yen coin series honouring the 47 prefectures of Japan commenced in 2008, with 47 unique designs planned for each denomination. Only one coin per customer is available from banks in each prefecture. 100,000 of each 1000-yen silver coin have been minted. Even though all commemorative coins can be spent like ordinary (non-commemorative) coins, they are not seen often in typical daily use and normally do not circulate.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{scattering}} {{is purely}} a microwave propagation mode and is best observed around 10GHz, but extends {{down to a}} few gigahertz—the limit being {{the size of the}} scattering particle size vs. wavelength. This mode scatters signals mostly forwards and backwards when using horizontal polarization and side-scattering with vertical polarization. Forward-scattering typically yields propagation ranges of 800km. Scattering from snowflakes and ice pellets also occurs, but scattering from ice without watery surface is less effective. The most common application for this phenomenon is microwave rain radar, but rain scatter propagation can be a nuisance causing unwanted signals to intermittently propagate where they are not anticipated or desired. Similar reflections may also occur from insects though at lower altitudes and shorter range. Rain also causes attenuation of point-to-point and satellite microwave links. Attenuation <b>values</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30dB have been observed on 30GHz during heavy tropical rain.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1885 the Malta Post Office was {{separated}} from the British Post Office after this had been consented back in 1883. The first definitives were issued with the <b>values</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1/-, with the colours reflecting Malta joining the UPU. The halfpenny {{was the same as}} the 1860 stamp except it was green. The stamps were designs of Queen Victoria like most British colonies, but also used the Maltese cross as a heraldic device. British stamps were no longer valid from this date except for mail from British military zones, where British stamps were used until 1979. A large format 5-shilling value complemented the set in 1886 and this was used until 1911. Also in 1886, the GPO moved to Palazzo Parisio in Merchants Street, Valletta. Police stations in several villages began to sell stamps around 1891. Bollo personale, or postmen's personal handstamps, were used to indicate which postman delivered a particular letter. The earliest recorded use is 16 August 1888 while the latest is 29 September 1949.|$|E

2500|$|In 1919 {{there were}} the Sette Giugno riots in Valletta, which led to Malta being given a new {{constitution}} in 1921 and being granted self-government. To commemorate this, various definitive stamps issued between 1899 and 1922 were overprinted [...] "SELF-GOVERNMENT". On 1 August 1922 {{a new set of}} stamps designed by Maltese artists Edward Caruana Dingli and Gianni Vella was issued. This featured an allegorical depiction of Melita on the Pound and pence values and a depiction of Melita leaning on Britannia on the shilling values. In 1926 it was decided that separate revenue stamps should be issued and the set was defaced with the word [...] "POSTAGE" [...] on all <b>values</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10/-.|$|E
2500|$|Metallized film {{capacitors}} {{are made}} of two metallized films with plastic film as the dielectric.
