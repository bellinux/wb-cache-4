Instead of using a Jeep engine and transmission, Zamboni decided to build the necessary parts directly onto a Jeep frame. Zamboni model C was also built on a Jeep frame but more design changes were applied. The driver's position was raised for better visibility, and {{the capacity of the}} snow-holding tank was increased. From the late 1950s to 1964, there were minimal changes in how the ice-resurfacers were designed; Model C to Model F changed only slightly. [...] The introduction of the HD series in 1964 saw a shift {{in the design of the}} Zamboni ice-resurfacers. Instead of relying on a conveyor belt system to move the ice shavings into the snow-holding tank, a <b>vertical</b> <b>screw</b> <b>conveyor</b> system was installed. Along with the <b>vertical</b> <b>screw</b> <b>conveyor,</b> a new hydraulic snow-dumping system was adopted. This meant that drivers no longer had to shovel the ice shavings out of the holding tank.

The stable helical vortex in TCP flow is beneficial to improve the transporting efficiency of granular materials.

40|$|AbstractVertical screw {{conveying}} {{bulk and}} powdered materials {{are an integral}} part of many production processes in various industries and agriculture. With a wide range of applications in various industries, <b>vertical</b> <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors,</b> along with such qualities as the ease of construction, the continuity of transportation, integrity, the ability to transport and dusty badly smelling goods, have a significant drawback - the material, in addition to the translational motion in the direction of the axis of the conveyor, makes a rotary movement towards the peripheral speed of the screw, which reduces the productivity and increases the power consumption of the conveyor. The use of a simplified model of the movement of the material leads to the creation of inefficient machines, the structure and parameters of working bodies of which differ significantly from optimal.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the use of DEM in the {{application}} of a screw conveyor for bulk materials. Utilisation of DEM anticipates input parameters which can be obtained only by experimental and laboratory activity {{in the area of the}} transport and properties of bulk materials.

With knowledge of the mechanical and physical properties of bulk materials and contact geometries, the use of DEM applies to the simulation of the real behaviour of the conveyed material. This state can only be achieved by verification of the concordance of the simulation and real state, alternatively by calibration.

Some of these options include conveyors such as belt <b>conveyors,</b> drag <b>conveyors,</b> <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors,</b> and pneumatic conveyors. Belt conveyors cause the least damage to grain {{due to the}} lack of contact forces, however, they cannot be used for steep inclines.

They are on many types of farm equipment, including combines and grain carts for example. Augers generally have a high power requirements, but are portable and low cost. In addition, augers tend to cause high levels of mechanical damage to the grain. Much research has been completed to quantify the amount of grain damage caused by various <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors.</b> The percentage of grain damage is decreased when the auger is operated at capacity because the grain cannot bounce around and strike surfaces as easily. In addition, grain damage increases with increased rotational speed. For this research with <b>screw</b> <b>conveyors,</b> the angle of the incline was found to have no significant effect on the grain damage.Pneumatic conveyors use a moving air-stream to propel grain, and are used in situations when the path of the grain is complex. Grain damage can occur especially at any changes in the tube path, but can be minimized when air speeds are kept below 25 meters per second. [...] It is shown that grain damage increases exponentially above air velociities of 20 meters per second.
