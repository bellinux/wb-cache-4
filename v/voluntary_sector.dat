The centre is credited with helping significantly improve Somalis' GCSE performance. The Camden and Tower Hamlets local authorities reported that the performance of their Somali pupils was comparable with the overall student population in those boroughs in the school year 2011–12.|$|E
25|$|In October 1987 the Guildford branch {{circulated}} {{an internal}} discussion document {{arguing that the}} growing socialist movement would have a profound economic impact on the operation of capitalism before {{the overthrow of the}} capitalist class and the formal establishment of socialism. They claimed that socialists would use their influence politically (through the legislature and local councils) to adjust patterns of state income and expenditure in ‘socialistic’ directions, including the provision of free services. Drawing inspiration from writers like André Gorz, they also claimed that socialists would be encouraging the growth of the non-monetary, <b>voluntary</b> <b>sector</b> of the economy and should be instrumental in developing support networks for co-operatives and LETS schemes. This critique of the Party's revolutionary strategy was vigorously rebutted in other circulars from branches and members and at Party conference. A small number of proponents of the Guildford perspective resigned. They went on to publish the journal Spanner, so-called because it aimed to ‘span’ opinion across the non-market socialist sector of political thought, and in recent years some have been instrumental in founding the small World In Common group.|$|E

40|$|The Purpose of {{this study}} is to clarify the {{contents}} and features of relations among sports actors, mainly at the local governmental level in the preparation process of 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan.

But at the same time, JAWOC has to build up cooperative relationships with its 10 Local Branches and has to value the intentions of private business sponsors such as the "" 16 official Partners"" and the "" 6 official Suppliers. "" JAWOC attaches greater importance to these actors than to <b>voluntary</b> <b>sectors.</b> In short, ""top-down"" is the governance style of JAWOC.

On their website the group said that the Government has so far taken on sixteen of the recommendations, and the Conservatives twenty-nine. Of those twenty-nine, ten were unanimously rejected by the European Court of Justice, as they deemed the proposals [...] "unfit for a modern democracy" [...] and [...] "verging on frighteningly authoritarian". The ECJ's comments were dismissed by IDS, stating that there had been [...] "no such talks" [...] between them, and provoked attacks on the European Union by some members of the party.|$|E

2500|$|An Amicus region {{typically}} contains {{several hundred}} branches, {{each of which}} represent a smaller group of members, running local campaigns on their behalf and providing a means for members to socialise {{with one another and}} increase their involvement in Amicus and the wider union movement. [...] Nationally, there are about 1900 branches. Branches are typically organised on a workplace, geographical or sectoral basis, and vary in size from a few dozen to several thousand members. [...] One reason for the wide variation in branch size and type is that, during the numerous union mergers which culminated in the formation of Amicus, branches were often not forced to merge. [...] For this reason many branches are still based on the structures that existed in long-disappeared unions such as TASS. Some branches are inactive, for example because the workplace they represented no longer exists. [...] In 2005, Amicus began a consultation on reorganisation of branches, primarily intended to close inactive branches or merge them with neighbouring ones which are more active. [...] Not surprisingly this reorganisation was of some concern to branch activists, and prompted a number of neighbouring branches to voluntarily merge in order to pre-empt any action from the centre. Other branches, for example those in the <b>voluntary</b> <b>sector,</b> are by their nature small, and have made representations to the NEC and the General Secretary in which they pointed out that a small branch is not necessarily an inactive one. As of October 2006 the results of the branch consultation have not been published.|$|E
