50|$|In recent years, {{sparked by}} the tiny Savoyard separatist movement, much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} questioning the validity of the 1860 annexation. The Ligue Savoisienne, for example, rejects the Treaty of Turin and subsequent plebiscite as null and void, arguing that the plebiscite did not meet the standards of a free and fair <b>vote.</b> <b>Today,</b> historians generally acknowledge that the plebiscite of 1860 did feature irregularities, but they also affirm that the annexation instrument was the Treaty of Turin and not the plebiscite, whose main purpose was to demonstrate favorable public opinion in Savoy for the annexation after the signature of the treaty. In an interview for the newspaper Le Dauphiné Libéré, Sylvain Milbach, a historian at the University of Savoy, qualifies the vote as Napoleonic, but also argues that a completely free and fair vote would not have dramatically changed the outcome, as the majority of Savoyards wished to become French. This is today the official stance of the General Council of Savoie.|$|E

The public unveiling followed earlier closed-door meetings presenting the concepts between Disney and {{city officials}}. Some of the representatives from 80 neighborhood associations and businesses objected to added traffic from tourists, and felt that public subsidies in the form of infrastructure improvements were not warranted for Disney, a very profitable private corporation.

After the Virginians took their leave, William Lander made these remarks upon the withdrawal of his delegation [...] "The South has heretofore relied upon the Northern Democracy to give us the rights which are justly due us, but the <b>vote</b> <b>today</b> has satisfied the majority of the North Carolina delegation that these rights are now refused and this being the case, we can no longer remain in this convention." [...] He supported Breckenridge in the presidential campaign that followed and during a debate with Zebulon B.

The women formed the Committee for Women's Suffrage (Komitée für das Frauenstimmrecht) to work towards gaining the vote. In 1971 and 1973, referenda failed with the majority blocking enfranchisement. Unable to make headway, in 1981, Marxer and other feminists formed Aktion Dornröschen, which technically means thorny rose, but was a play on words for the German name of the fairy tale [...] "Sleeping Beauty". The women brought a complaint to the Constitutional Court charging that their rights had been abridged. In 1982, the case was dismissed. The government refused to reevaluate the situation, forcing Marxer and 11 other Sleeping Beauty activists to take other action. They traveled throughout Europe speaking about their lack of rights. In 1983, they arrived in Strasbourg, France, where Marxer and the others brought their concerns before the Council of Europe. The move brought criticism at home, for putting the country in the international spotlight, but it was effective. On 2 July 1984, the male voters in Liechtenstein granted full voting rights to women.|$|E
