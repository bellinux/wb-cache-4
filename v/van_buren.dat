5|$|Harrison won 19 of the 26 states, {{including}} New York (home to <b>Van</b> <b>Buren),</b> Kentucky (to Johnson) and Tennessee (Jackson). <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> did win in Virginia, {{the state}} of birth of both Whig candidates, and in Illinois, with Lincoln defeated for elector. The electoral vote count was 234 for Harrison and 60 for <b>Van</b> <b>Buren,</b> with the popular vote closer at 1,275,390 for Harrison to 1,128,854 for <b>Van</b> <b>Buren.</b> Of the 60 <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> electors, 12 did not vote for Johnson, with 11 (all from South Carolina) choosing Littleton W. Tazewell for vice president, and one (from Virginia) favoring Governor James K. Polk of Tennessee. Turnout was 81 percent of eligible voters, setting a record since surpassed only in 1860 and 1876. The Whigs took both houses of Congress, {{and a majority of}} state governorships.|$|E
5|$|Following McLane's recall to the United States in 1831 {{to serve}} as Secretary of Treasury, Irving stayed on as the legation's chargé d'affaires until the arrival of Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren,</b> President Andrew Jackson's nominee for British Minister. With <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> in place, Irving {{resigned}} his post to concentrate on writing, eventually completing Tales of the Alhambra, which would be published concurrently in the United States and England in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{counties}} in Missouri are named after politicians. One such county, Cass, was originally named <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> County after President Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren,</b> and {{was changed to}} its present name in support of Van Buren's Democratic opponent Lewis Cass during the presidential election of 1848. Other counties are named after war heroes, natural resources, explorers, and former U.S. territories.|$|E
5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> lived {{quietly in}} Lancaster, Pennsylvania after his {{football}} career, where he ran an antiques shop with his son-in-law. He also owned a used-car lot and a dance hall. His wife, Grace, died in 1978. <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> died of pneumonia on August 23, 2012, in Lancaster {{at the age}} of 91.|$|E
5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> {{soon became}} a major target of {{criticism}} from the Whigs following the Panic of 1837. Seeking to run a non-controversial and less ideological war hero who could defeat <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> based on popularity, a unified Whig Party nominated Harrison over party founder Henry Clay and fellow general Winfield Scott. John Tyler of Virginia was selected as his running mate, and Harrison and Tyler defeated <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> in the 1840 election. At the time, he was the oldest president ever elected. However, Harrison died of pneumonia in April 1841, a month after taking office. Tyler then assumed the presidency, setting a major precedent.|$|E

5|$|Four {{men have}} become President of the United States {{after serving as}} Governor of New York: Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren,</b> Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and six were Vice President of the United States. (<b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> and Theodore Roosevelt held both offices.) Two {{governors}} have been Chief Justice of the United States: John Jay held that position {{when he was elected}} governor in 1795, and Charles Evans Hughes became chief justice in 1930, two decades after leaving the governorship.|$|E
5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> {{served as}} a coach for several seasons in minor league {{football}} after his playing career. After serving as a scout for the Eagles, he coached a minor league team in Bristol, Pennsylvania for three years. He then served as head coach for the Franklin Miners of Franklin, New Jersey and led them to a 27–5 win–loss record through 1958 and 1959. The Miners moved to Paterson, New Jersey and joined the Atlantic Coast Football League (ACFL), winning the league's championship in 1962. <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> then became head coach for the Newark Bears of the ACFL, which he led to a league championship in 1963. In 1965, the Bears franchise joined the Continental Football League, and in 1966 moved to Orlando, Florida and was renamed the Panthers. <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> was elevated to {{vice president and director}} of player personnel for the Panthers in 1966. He led the newly formed Hudson Valley Vikings of the North Atlantic Football League as head coach in 1967. In 1968, <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> became the offensive backfield coach for the Pottstown Firebirds of the ACFL. In 1969, he was the coach of the independent, semi-pro Jersey Senators, and in 1970, the Phoenix Steelers.|$|E
5|$|When Adam Eckfeldt {{retired in}} 1839, he {{recommended}} Peale as his successor. As the Senate was not sitting, Peale {{was given a}} recess appointment as Chief Coiner of the Philadelphia Mint by President Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> on March 27, 1839. On January 23, 1840, after the Senate reconvened, <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> nominated Peale; the Senate gave its approval on February 17. Despite his retirement, Eckfeldt continued {{to come to the}} mint every day until shortly before his death in February 1852, performing the function of Chief Coiner and leaving Peale with time on his hands.|$|E
5|$|Back, leg, {{and neck}} {{injuries}} {{began to take}} a toll on <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> in 1950, and his production dropped. He broke his toe in the 1950 off-season and suffered from bone spurs, which caused him to miss the team's four preseason exhibition games and regular season opener. He returned to lead the league in carries for the fourth straight season, but lost the rushing title {{for the first time}} in four years and had career-lows in touchdowns and yards per carry. The Eagles finished with a 6–6 regular season record. Greasy Neale was fired by the Eagles the following February and replaced by Bo McMillin. In 1951, <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> played alongside his brother, halfback and linebacker Ebert, whom the Eagles selected in that year's draft out of LSU. The elder <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> continued to play through injuries, taking several shots of Novocaine before each game. He had a career-low 327 rushing yards for the season, as the Eagles finished with a losing record for the first time since 1942.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the freeway}} south of its {{junction}} with Interstate 10 to <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> Street {{is to start}} in 2016. Eventually it will connect to proposed Route 30 and possibly Interstate 11.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, NY48 {{was assigned to}} a previously unnumbered roadway between downtown Syracuse and Oswego. From <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> north to Oswego, NY48 roughly followed its modern alignment; south of <b>Van</b> <b>Buren,</b> NY48 was routed on State Fair Boulevard and Geddes Street to terminate at NY5, then routed on Erie Boulevard. The route was realigned slightly within Syracuse between 1938 and 1940 to use portions of Hiawatha Boulevard and West Genesee Street (as well as a new portion of State Fair Boulevard) to meet NY5 at the modern intersection of Erie Boulevard and Genesee Street.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's successor, President Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren,</b> viewed Texas {{annexation}} as {{an immense}} political liability that would empower the anti-slavery northern Whig opposition – especially if annexation provoked {{a war with}} Mexico. Presented with a formal annexation proposal from Texas minister Memucan Hunt, Jr. in August 1837, <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> summarily rejected it. Annexation resolutions presented separately in each house of Congress were either soundly defeated or tabled through filibuster. After the election of 1838, new Texas president Mirabeau B. Lamar withdrew his republic's offer of annexation due to these failures. Texans were at an annexation impasse when John Tyler entered the White House in 1841.|$|E
5|$|Pro-Texas-annexation {{southern}} Democratic delegates denied their anti-annexation leader Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> {{the nomination}} at their party's convention in May 1844. In alliance with pro-expansion northern Democratic colleagues, they secured {{the nomination of}} James K. Polk, who ran on a pro-Texas Manifest Destiny platform.|$|E
5|$|The 1948 {{season was}} the second {{straight}} that <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> {{led the league in}} carries, rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, and yards from scrimmage. In Week 3, in the first quarter against the New York Giants <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> scored his 39th career rushing touchdown, surpassing Ernie Nevers as the all-time leader. That game—a 45–0 shutout win—was the first in an eight-game winning streak for the Eagles in which they scored 275 points total and allowed 49. The team finished the regular season with {{the best record in the}} Eastern Division and were to meet the Chicago Cardinals again for the league championship.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United States in 1840, Eaton refused to endorse incumbent Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> for reelection to the presidency, angering Jackson. In retirement, Eaton resided in Washington. He died there in 1856, and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|After {{his playing}} career, <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> coached in minor league football, winning an Atlantic Coast Football League (ACFL) {{championship}} with the Newark Bears in 1963. He {{was elected to}} the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965. <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> {{is a member of the}} NFL 1940s All-Decade Team and the National Football League 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. Considered one of the greatest players in Eagles franchise history, his number 15 jersey is retired by the team, and he is enshrined in the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame and the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame. For his college career, he was inducted into the Louisiana State University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1944 and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1961.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, State Street (anchored by Marshall Field's) in the {{downtown}} Loop, especially the Loop Retail Historic District, was the city's retailing center. The convenience of mass transit including streetcars and elevated trains, supported a retail corridor along State Street from Lake Street to <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> Street.|$|E
5|$|After the {{election}} of 1832, Johnson continued to campaign for the Vice Presidency which would be available in 1836; he was endorsed by the New York labor leader Ely Moore on March 13, 1833, nine days after Jackson and <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> were inaugurated. Moore praised his devotion to freedom of religion and his opposition to imprisonment for debt.|$|E
5|$|By 1946, <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> was {{considered}} one of {{the best players in the}} league. Before the season, he signed a three-year contract to remain with the Eagles, dispelling rumors that he planned to join the rival All-America Football Conference. He returned just five punts in the 1946 season, but ran one of them back fifty yards for a touchdown against the Boston Yanks in the final game of the year. It was the last punt <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> returned in his career. He finished the season with 529 rushing yards, third-most behind leader Bill Dudley of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rookie Pat Harder of the Chicago Cardinals. He was named a first-team All-Pro by the New York Daily News and a second-team All-Pro by the United Press.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren,</b> who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} {{political}} career, Crittenden {{served in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives and was chosen as speaker on several occasions. With {{the advent of the}} Second Party System, he allied with the National Republican (later Whig) Party and was a fervent supporter of Henry Clay and opponent of Democrats Andrew Jackson and Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fallout 3 was {{initially}} under development by Black Isle Studios, a studio owned by Interplay Entertainment, under the working title <b>Van</b> <b>Buren.</b> Black Isle Studios was the developer {{of the original}} Fallout and Fallout 2. When Interplay Entertainment went bankrupt and closed down Black Isle Studios before the game could be completed, the license to develop Fallout 3 was sold for a $1,175,000 minimum guaranteed advance against royalties to Bethesda Softworks, a studio primarily known as the developer of The Elder Scrolls series. Bethesda's Fallout 3, however, was developed from scratch, using neither <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> code nor any other materials created by Black Isle Studios. In May 2007, a playable technology demo of the canceled project was released to the public.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> was {{selected}} by the Associated Press for an all-time Southeastern Conference team, which honored the best eleven players in the conference's then seventeen-year existence. He {{was inducted into the}} Louisiana State University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1944 and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Johnson {{received}} only forty-eight electoral votes. One elector from Virginia and all eleven from South Carolina voted for <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> for president but selected {{someone other than}} Johnson for vice-president. Johnson lost {{his home state of}} Kentucky again and added to the embarrassment by losing his home district as well.|$|E
5|$|M-152 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan in Cass and <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> counties. The highway runs through the Sister Lakes area providing access to the lake cabins and adjoining farmlands. The highway has existed mostly unchanged since the designation was commissioned in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The south {{leg of the}} Chicago Transit Authority {{elevated}} rail loop runs next to the building on <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> Street; the CTA's Brown, Orange, Pink, and Purple Lines are served by the Library-State/Van Buren stop one block to the east. The Jackson street subway station, serving the Blue Line, is on the Dearborn Street side of the building.|$|E
5|$|Twombly {{was born}} to Samuel Twombly and Dorothy Twombly (nee Wilder) on February 21, 1842, near Farmington, <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> County, Iowa Territory. His father died in September 1842, leaving Twombly's mother {{responsible}} for raising him. While growing up, Twombly was educated at several common schools and at the Lane Academy of Keosauqua.|$|E
5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> {{played in}} nine games {{during his first}} season with the Eagles, rushing for 444 yards as a running back and {{recording}} five interceptions on defense as a defensive back. His first NFL return touchdown came in the third game of the season, on a 55-yard punt return {{in the second quarter}} of a 38–0 shutout win against the Boston Yanks. Three games later, he returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown against the New York Giants, which was the longest kickoff return by any player that season. His 15.3 yards per punt return also led the league. <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> was named to the Associated Press's All-Pro first team following the season, the only rookie so named for 1944.|$|E
5|$|Winning a close {{election}} on November 5, 1968, Nixon and Agnew were inaugurated as the 37th President of the United States and 39th Vice President of the United States, respectively, on January 20, 1969. He {{was the first}} Vice President elected President since Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> in 1836, {{and the only one}} to do so while not an incumbent.|$|E
5|$|After being mustered out {{of service}} in 1865, Twombly {{attended}} business school and entered {{into a number of}} business ventures. In 1880, he entered politics upon being selected to be the treasurer of <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> County, Iowa. He served as the mayor of Keosauqua, Iowa from 1884 to early 1885, and as the treasurer of Iowa from 1885 to 1891.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the death}} of Harrison, three Presidents served within a single {{calendar}} year (Martin <b>Van</b> <b>Buren,</b> Harrison, Tyler). This has happened on only one other occasion, 40 years later in 1881, when Rutherford B. Hayes was succeeded by James A. Garfield, who was assassinated later that year. With the death of Garfield, Chester A. Arthur stepped into the presidency.|$|E
5|$|M-140 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} Berrien and <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> counties of the US state of Michigan. The highway {{starts in the}} Niles area at M-139 and runs north through Watervliet to South Haven, ending at Interstate 196/US Highway31 (I-196/US31). In between, it runs through farm fields and past lakes in the southwestern part of the Lower Peninsula. The trunkline is used, on average, by between 1,500 and 10,200vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee's {{delegation}} did {{not attend}} the convention. Edward Rucker, a Tennessean who happened to be in Baltimore, was picked to cast its 15 votes, so that all the states would endorse <b>Van</b> <b>Buren.</b> Senator Silas Wright, of New York, prevailed upon Rucker to vote for Johnson, giving him just more than twice the votes cast for Rives, and the nomination.|$|E
5|$|The large Mexican Cession of {{land had}} divided the United States politically, with {{many in the}} North insisting that slavery not be allowed there (and {{offering}} the Wilmot Proviso to ensure it), while others wanted slavery barred north of the Missouri Compromise line of 36°30′ N. Both proposals were anathema to many Southerners, and the controversy divided the Democrats. At the 1848 Democratic National Convention, the majority nominated former Michigan senator Lewis Cass for president, while a minority broke off to become the Free Soil Party, backing former president <b>Van</b> <b>Buren.</b> The Whigs chose General Zachary Taylor, a Louisianan, whose views on most political issues were unknown. Despite his past support for <b>Van</b> <b>Buren,</b> Pierce supported Cass, turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil ticket, and was so effective that Taylor, who was elected president, was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state.|$|E
5|$|Twombly, who had {{consistently}} {{supported the}} Republican Party since reaching voting age, accepted {{the position of}} treasurer of <b>Van</b> <b>Buren</b> County in 1880. He served in that position until 1884, when Twombly became the Mayor of Keosauqua. In January 1885, Twombly was elected the Treasurer of Iowa. He served three terms in the position before stepping down in January 1891.|$|E
