50|$|An {{environmental}} impact statement for the Paseo del Volcan project was approved in August 2001 by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Phase 1 of the project, a 3.9 mi segment between Unser Blvd. and Iris Road was completed in October 2006. The road was designated as State Road 347 between I-40 and US 550 in August 2010. The Phase 2 extension 3.4 mi eastward to US 550 was opened to traffic in February 2011. Land acquisition is currently in progress for a further extension westward from Unser Blvd. to Rainbow Blvd. In July 2011, a street west of Albuquerque also known as Paseo del Volcan was renamed Atrisco <b>Vista</b> <b>Blvd.</b> to avoid a naming conflict. Atrisco <b>Vista</b> <b>Blvd.</b> intersects I-40 at Exit 149 only 1.5 mi east of the proposed interchange with NM 347. Interchange construction at I-40 will be Phase 3 {{of the project and}} awaits acquisition of individual private parcels along the Interstate.|$|E
