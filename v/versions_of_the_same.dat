5|$|Gundamma Katha was remade in Tamil as Manithan Maravillai (1962) by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Chakrapani {{directed}} the remake and Gemini Ganesan reprised Rama Rao from the original. M. S. Sundari Bai, K. Sarangkapani, and E. R. Sahadev reprised {{the roles of}} Suryakantam, Ramana Reddy and Kaleswara Rao respectively. Manithan Maravillai was Nageswara Rao's 100th film as an actor; Gundamma Katha became a notable film for both Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao as they completed 100 films as actors with two <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> film. Unlike the original film, Manithan Maravillai was a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} develops from a phallic outgrowth in {{the embryo}} called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or penis during {{development of the}} reproductive system depending on exposure to androgens (primarily male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the glans and upper shaft of the penis, and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs homologous (different <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> structure).|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot, {{especially}} in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly {{different times of}} life. Pleased with the effect he achieved {{with the return of}} Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in the first edition of Le Père Goriot that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> people. Rastignac's appearance shows, {{for the first time in}} Balzac's fiction, a novel-length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character.|$|E

5|$|Lukesh {{then returns}} to the {{alleyway}} where Doggett was shot and vanishes. Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because two <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens {{to talk to the}} FBI, Lukesh kills her.|$|E
5|$|Study of {{the decree}} was {{already under way}} when the first full {{translation}} of the Greek text appeared in 1803. It was 20 years, however, before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-François Champollion in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> text (1799); that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the demotic (Thomas Young, 1814); and that, {{in addition to being}} used for foreign names, phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (Champollion, 1822–1824).|$|E
5|$|The Cenotaph {{was opened}} by General John Seely {{at a public}} {{ceremony}} on 6 November 1920 that included the playing of the Last Post and a two-minute silence. Kimber was very pleased with both the project and Lutyens, and he hoped to build a second war memorial in Southampton using the architect, although this project never came to fruition. The Southampton Cenotaph was influential in later designs for war memorials both in England and abroad; {{it was the first}} such cenotaph to be built and simpler <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> design were widely used to commemorate the First World War, including famously at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London.|$|E

5|$|The tale {{was also}} {{apparently}} popular in later times, {{and became the}} subject of a number of independent poems; none appears to have been directly based on the surviving text, however, suggesting that other <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tale served as their inspiration. The first poem is appended to the old text in the Book of Leinster, Harley 5280 and H.3.18. Its author used the opportunity to display his knowledge of the names of Irish heroes in general, in which he does not confine himself to characters of the story. The second poem follows the first in Harley 5280, and appears also in three other manuscripts: the Book of Lecan, Laud 610 in the Bodelian Library and lastly in the Stowe manuscript collection.|$|E
5|$|Tinne bought {{multiple}} <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> item, often {{leaving them}} in the original tissue paper, with the original price labels and delivery dates. Many of the higher value items were never worn, possibly because Tinne did not attend functions which {{would allow them to}} be due to her husband's evening surgeries. Tinne's daughter, Alexine suggests that Emily may have purchased excess items or high value items that she did not want, to allow the shop assistants to gain commission. This view is backed up by the curator of the exhibition, Pauline Rushton, who describes Tinne's social work in organising widows' pensions or helping unmarried mothers. However, fashion author Linda Grant believes it was more likely that she just enjoyed shopping.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic amino group, its basicity is low to an extent {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E

5|$|For the box set release, Quatermass and the Pit was {{extensively}} restored. A {{process called}} VidFIRE {{was applied to}} all of the scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid interlaced video look they would have had on transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process. For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35mm film inserts still existed, as they had been spliced into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and in a few cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scholars}} such as Hazra and Rocher {{state that}} the Puranas are not a reliable source for dating Krishna or Indian history, because the content therein about kings, various peoples, sages, and kingdoms is highly inconsistent across the manuscripts. They state that these stories are probably {{based in part on}} real events, in part on hagiography, and in part embellished by expansive imagination. A high degree of inconsistency and manuscript corruption occurred particularly from the 12thcentury onwards, evidenced by cross referencing the texts; Matsya Purana, for example, stated that Kurma Purana has 18,000 verses, while Agni Purana asserts the same text has 8,000 verses, and Naradiya attests that the Kurma manuscript has 17,000 verses. The Puranic literature has gone through slow redaction and text corruption over time, as well as sudden deletion of numerous chapters and its replacement with new content to an extent that the currently circulating Puranas are completely different from those that existed before the 11thcentury, or 16thcentury. For example, a newly discovered palm-leaf manuscript in Nepal has been dated to be from 810CE, but is quite different from <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Purana text that have been circulating in South Asia since the colonial era.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} {{construction}} grammarians argue, for instance, that active and passive <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> proposition are not derived from an underlying structure, but are instances {{of two different}} constructions. As constructions are pairings of form and meaning, active and passive <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> proposition are not synonymous, but display differences in content: {{in this case the}} pragmatic content.|$|E
