That is to say the payer of the tax has no incentive to collect the tax. Under VAT, all sellers collect tax and pay it to the government. A purchaser has an incentive to deduct input VAT, but must prove it has the right to do so, which is usually achieved by holding an invoice quoting the VAT paid on the purchase, and indicating the <b>VAT</b> <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> of the supplier.|$|E

This paper seeks {{to examine the}} VAT refund {{approach}} of ZIMRA and tries to gauge {{the effectiveness of the}} approach and suggest a typical model of best practice that takes into consideration compliance issues faced mainly in developing and transitional countries during different stages of development of the VAT system. By administering an interview questionnaire to 150 respondents and obtaining data from various ZIMRA reports and statements and VAT legislation, the study finds out that most of the taxpayers or investors importing large items of capital equipment complained that the levying of VAT on their imports has a negative effect on their cash flow, lack of categorisation of clients into various classes for VAT refund process delayed refunds {{and the fact that the}} <b>VAT</b> <b>registration</b> threshold is way too low and thus tends to lead to registration of defaulters or fraudsters. The study therefore recommends more focus to be put on limiting pre-refund audits to high-risk cases, paying interest on refunds processed late and proper administration of statutes and education of clients on their rights and obligations with regards to the VAT system. taxpayers; value added tax; VAT refunds; Zimbabwe Revenue Authority; ZIMRA; revenue collection; refund claims; capital equipment; VAT refund delays; <b>VAT</b> <b>registration</b> threshold...|$|R

The aim is to determine whether vehicles with attractive <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> have a statistically significantly higher purchase price, which disproves random allocation. The second aim is to verify whether vehicles with attractive <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> statistically significantly use the left lane in the driving direction, which is the lane designated for overtaking. The data needed to verify these hypotheses was gained by two day measuring during which were captured more than 4, 000 vehicles. From footbridge over the Nuselský Bridge in Prague were recorded passing vehicles using the camera. From the entire sample were randomly generated 184 vehicles. For cars was estimated the purchase price in the time of allocation of <b>registration</b> <b>number.</b> The numerical combinations of <b>registration</b> <b>numbers</b> were divided into three categories according to attractiveness. These categories were compared with each other in the three models based on their average prices. According to measurement results we can at one percent significance level reject the null hypothesis and say that at this level of significance are not the <b>registration</b> <b>numbers</b> allocated randomly. The result of the fourth model is not statistically significant.
