25|$|Many large National Rail {{stations}} in London have Oystercard-compatible barriers. At other smaller stations, users must touch the card on a standalone <b>validator.</b>|$|E
25|$|Users must touch in and {{out even}} if the ticket {{barriers}} are open. At stations where Oyster is accepted but {{that do not have}} ticket barriers, an Oyster <b>validator</b> will be provided for the purposes of touching {{in and out}}. The maximum Oyster fare applies even if the daily price cap has been reached as this does not count towards the cap.|$|E
25|$|Whenever the pay {{as you go}} balance falls below £10, £20 or £40 {{is added}} to the balance {{automatically}} when the Oyster card is touched on an entry <b>validator.</b> A light on the Oyster reader flashes to indicate the Auto top-up has taken place and an email is sent to confirm the transaction. Payment is then taken from the registered debit or credit card.|$|E

25|$|On 12 November 2012, the TTA {{announced}} that the progressive removal of Metcard <b>validators</b> at railway stations had commenced on a station-by-station basis. All railway station <b>validators</b> were removed by mid-December.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of validators: dual-purpose and Metrocard only. Dual-purpose <b>validators</b> have been {{installed}} on all buses, trains and trams and will accept both Metrocards and Crouzet tickets. Metrocard only <b>validators</b> only accept Metrocards and have been installed alongside the dual purpose <b>validators</b> on the 3000 class railcars and the Citadis Trams. Both feature indicator lights and an LCD display to display information (such as ticket type and errors) to users.|$|R
25|$|The Gent tram is {{operated}} by De Lijn (the company which provides transport {{service in the}} whole of Flanders); the fare control system is the same as on all public transport in Flanders, and there are no turnstiles. A passenger should stamp a ticket in a <b>validator</b> in the tram (near the doors) {{at the start of a}} journey, and every time you take a connection tram or bus after that.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most other}} light rail {{services}} in the United States, the HBLR operates on a proof-of-payment system, in which riders must present their tickets upon request during random fare inspections. Passengers purchase tickets at NJ Transit ticket vending machines (TVMs). One-way and ten-trip tickets must be validated at automated Validators located near the TVMs. The <b>validator</b> will date and time stamp the ticket for 60 minutes of use. New Jersey Transit's fare inspectors perform random ticket inspections on vehicles and at stations. As of 2014, the fine for fare evasion was $100.|$|E
25|$|The Wayfarer SmartTGX150 Electronic Ticketing Machine (ETM) {{incorporates}} a smartcard processor {{that allows the}} driver to sign on and off, issue cash tickets and process SmartRider transactions. Passengers can use the unit to top up their SmartRider cards and the ETM/GPS interface also determines {{the exact location of}} a bus at all times and calculates fare zones automatically. The project also includes the Wayfarer SCP smartcard Platform processor for tagging on and off at all ‘open’ train station platforms, and the SCV, the Wayfarer smartcard bus and ferry <b>validator</b> for tagging on and off buses and ferries.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, TfL {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} Oyster card <b>validator,</b> distinguished from the standard yellow validators by having a pink-coloured reader. They do not deduct funds, but are used at peripheral interchange points to confirm journey details. Oyster pay-as-you-go users travelling between two points without passing through Zone 1 are eligible for a lower fare, and from 6 September 2009 can confirm their route by touching their Oyster cards on the pink validators when they change trains, allowing them to be charged the appropriate fare without paying for Zone 1 travel. The pink validators are located at 15 interchange stations.|$|E
25|$|Metcard {{tickets were}} credit-card in size which contain a {{magnetic}} stripe, {{and had to}} be inserted in a <b>validator</b> before each use. Only the busier stations have ticket-operated barrier gates. At other stations enforcement is based on honesty, with random checks. Metcards used to be available from machines at all stations, but those have recently been removed as part of the conversion to Myki. Metcards are also no longer available from machines on trams, from station ticket offices at staffed stations and from bus drivers as of 29 December 2012. As Metcards had to be validated before use (except when bought on trams, which were sold pre-validated), they had to be bought in advance and used when required.|$|E
25|$|At {{a number}} of Tube, DLR, London Overground and National Rail {{stations}} which lie in close proximity, or where interchange requires passengers to pass through ticket barriers, an Out-of-Station Interchange (OSI) is permitted. In such cases, the card holder touches out at one station and then touches in again before starting the next leg of the journey. The PAYG fares are then combined and charged as a single journey. Examples include transferring between the Jubilee line at Canary Wharf and the DLR where Oyster card holders must tap their card at the ticket barriers in the Tube station, and then touch in on the <b>validator</b> at the DLR station. Balham (National Rail) to/from Balham (Tube) is another OSI, as is Camden Town (Tube) to/from Camden Road (London Overground). Failure to touch in or out on the validators in these circumstances will incur a maximum fare which is deducted from PAYG funds. In some cases (e.g. at West Hampstead NR stations) the OSI replicates interchanges which have existed for several decades before {{the invention of the}} Oyster system but were generally used with season tickets rather than day tickets.|$|E

2500|$|Passengers {{not already}} in {{possession}} of a valid fare when boarding are required to purchase tickets from ticket vending machines on board each streetcar. Each vehicle also carries a ticket <b>validator</b> machine, for stamping [...] "unvalidated" [...] TriMet tickets purchased in advance. TriMet and Portland Streetcar have agreed to honor one another's fares, which means that TriMet passes, tickets and bus transfer receipts are accepted on the streetcar, and tickets purchased or validated on a streetcar are valid for travel on TriMet services (bus, MAX or WES Commuter Rail). To facilitate this, the ticket machines on board the streetcars and at streetcar stops sell TriMet tickets – covering both the streetcar fare and any TriMet rides the purchaser makes within the ticket's period of validity (2 hours or all day) – as well as streetcar-only tickets. For the same reason, prior to September 2012, the streetcar ticket machines offered all-zone (three-zone) and two-zone tickets, {{despite the fact that the}} streetcar system was located entirely within TriMet's Zone 1. TriMet tickets and transfers were valid all-day on the streetcar prior to that change, which also coincided with TriMet's elimination of the Free Rail Zone (Fareless Square). Since September 1, 2012, TriMet and Portland Streetcar tickets have an identical period of validity, of two hours (except for all-day tickets).|$|E

40|$|Modern {{cryptocurrency}} systems, such as Ethereum, permit complex {{financial transactions}} through scripts called smart contracts. These smart contracts are executed many, many times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart contracts are serially executed by miners before appending {{them to the}} blockchain. Later, those contracts are serially re-executed by <b>validators</b> to verify that the smart contracts were executed correctly by miners. Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's concurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless, serial execution appears to be required: contracts share state, and contract programming languages have a serial semantics. This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and <b>validators</b> to execute smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel, allowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and "discovering" a serializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions, This schedule is captured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by <b>validators</b> to re-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently. Smart contract benchmarks run on a JVM with ScalaSTM show that a speedup of of 1. 33 x can be obtained for miners and 1. 69 x for <b>validators</b> with just three concurrent threads...|$|R
