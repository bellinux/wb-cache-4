25|$|Two {{types of}} light offer {{potential}} decay to cultural heritage: ultraviolet (UV) light and <b>visual</b> <b>light</b> (light {{that can be}} perceived by the human eye). Although they can be affected simultaneously by removing light sources, reducing overall intensity, or increasing the distance between a light source and an object, best preventive practice treats these types of light separately due to their differences.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} <b>visual</b> <b>light</b> {{began to be}} studied by artists and color {{manufacturers}} {{as early as the}} 18th century, {{but it was not until}} the mid-20th century that the chemical damage caused by different lighting situations was researched in depth. In recent decades the cumulative nature of light degradation has become better understood by conservation science. Comprehensive studies began to emphasize long-term effects and allow for short-term variation in light levels depending on the specific situation: standard viewing, viewing by the aged, complex study or treatment, and observation of low contrast details all may have different requirements. Practical compromise between protection of cultural heritage and allowing the artifacts to fulfill their visual purpose means there is an allowance of some physical risk.|$|E

30|$|The {{modelling}} of PC-LED emission spectra requires {{considering the}} physical {{interactions between the}} constituting elements, the LED chip and the phosphor. The PC-LED’s emission spectra and their <b>visual</b> <b>lighting</b> quality properties are strongly influenced by phosphor characteristics, its chemical composition or synthesis method. In this article, phosphor particle size in {{narrow particle size distribution}} YAG and LuAG phosphors were first considered to optimize the PC-LED’s <b>visual</b> quality of <b>lighting.</b> The impact of YAG phosphor particle size on PC-LED light output[6 – 8] was reported in literature. However, these investigations were conducted on phosphors from different manufacturers hence it is difficult to compare them. Also, phosphor particle morphology in these previous studies was highly non-spherical.|$|R

25|$|Water absorbs {{light of}} long {{wavelengths}}, so less light from these wavelengths reflects back {{to reach the}} eye. Therefore, warm colors from the <b>visual</b> <b>light</b> spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the photic zone. Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense {{as it is on}} the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.|$|E
500|$|... color index, B−V, is the {{difference}} between the magnitude of the star in blue light, or B, and the magnitude in <b>visual</b> <b>light</b> (green-yellow), or V. Large positive values indicate a red star with a cool surface temperature, while negative values imply a blue star with a hotter surface.|$|E
500|$|The <b>visual</b> <b>light</b> {{curves of}} the {{different}} supernova types all depend at late times on radioactive heating, but they vary in shape and amplitude because of the underlying mechanisms, the way that visible radiation is produced, the epoch of its observation, and the transparency of the ejected material. [...] The light curves can be significantly different at other wavelengths. [...] For example, at ultraviolet wavelengths there is an early extremely luminous peak lasting {{only a few hours}} corresponding to the breakout of the shock launched by the initial event, but that breakout is hardly detectable optically.|$|E
30|$|Energy {{saving and}} {{environmental}} considerations have oriented {{the efforts of}} light source manufacturers towards alternative illumination solutions. The development of energy efficient lighting devices that also provide a high <b>visual</b> <b>lighting</b> quality for general lighting user constitutes an important challenge. In the last decades, {{research in the area}} of solid state lighting achieved considerable advances[1].

500|$|TypeIb and Ic light curves are {{basically}} similar to TypeIa although {{with a lower}} average peak luminosity. [...] The <b>visual</b> <b>light</b> output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation, {{but there is a}} much lower mass of the created nickel-56. The peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional Type Ib/c supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm. [...] The most luminous Type Ic supernovae are referred to as hypernovae and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity. [...] The source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole, which also produce gamma-ray bursts.|$|E
500|$|The light curves for TypeII supernovae are characterised by a {{much slower}} decline than TypeI, {{on the order}} of 0.05magnitudes per day, {{excluding}} the plateau phase. The <b>visual</b> <b>light</b> output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months, due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star. [...] In the initial destruction this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised. [...] The majority of TypeII supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines, emitting visible light and becoming more transparent. [...] This is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in TypeI supernovae, due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen.|$|E
500|$|The light curves for TypeIa {{are mostly}} very uniform, with a {{consistent}} maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity. [...] Their optical energy output {{is driven by}} radioactive decay of ejected nickel-56 (half life 6 days), which then decays to radioactive cobalt-56 (half life 77 days). These radioisotopes excite the surrounding material to incandescence. Studies of cosmology today rely on 56Ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of Type Ia, which are the [...] "standard candles" [...] of cosmology but whose diagnostic 847keV and 1238keV gamma rays were first detected only in 2014. The initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted. [...] The light curve continues to decline in the B band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days, but {{this is only a}} hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it. The <b>visual</b> <b>light</b> curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half life and controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation. [...] After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt-56, although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied.|$|E

However, on December 23, 2008, the Robsons and Fuentes were replaced due to unknown reasons by Jamie King, who previously collaborated with Spears in her Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour. He did the casting of the dancers and acrobats, and worked with Spears on the setlist and the choreography. King described the show saying it was [...] "sexy, fun, explosive, and full of surprises. While avoiding such traditional circus elements as live animals, we've created something innovative and exciting using contortionists, dancers, lighting, fire and other special effects". Simon Ellis was hired as the musical director. The production design was done by Road Rage, a formed alliance between Nick Whitehouse, Bryan Leitch, William Baker and Steve Dixon. Lightning design was done by <b>Visual</b> <b>Light,</b> conformed by Whitehouse and Leitch. The stage was designed by Road Rage and set in-the-round, with a big stage in the center painted to look like a target. There were also two satellite stages in the sides unified by small catwalks, to resemble an actual three-ring circus. The stage was built by Tait Towers and included nine lifts, which had a cost of $10million. It traveled in 3,000 rolling cases packed into 32 semis and a crew of 150 people was needed to set it up. There was a semi-transparent Element Labs Stealth cylinder screen above the stage, comprising 960 panels that Solotech built into custom frames. The backdrops were designed by Dirk Decooedt. There were three new film sequences shot exclusively for the tour: an opening video featuring Perez Hilton, a video of Spears set to Marilyn Manson's [...] "Sweet Dreams Are Made of This" [...] and a final montage. The three videos were created by Veneno. Props, including swings, couches, unicycles, stripper poles, a gold cage and giant picture frames, were designed by ShowFX Inc.; they also provided custom VIP couch seating that lined the perimeter of the stage. VYV provided the video control, which included two Photon Show media servers and two Photon Controllers. The servers took timecode for the show and wrapped the images around the Stealth screen. Emric Epstein of VYV explained, [...] "The servers and software permits us to control a large number of video layers on the 360˚ LED screen, composite the layers in realtime, and transform the final output so that everything look seamless after going through the LED controllers.
