This study aimed at developing alternative <b>loading</b> <b>solutions</b> composed of mixtures of glycerol and sucrose at various concentrations. Differential scanning calorimetry runs of <b>loading</b> <b>solutions</b> and of <b>loaded</b> and dehydrated explants were performed to assay thermal events occurring during cooling and warming. These <b>loading</b> <b>solutions</b> were applied to two model species, viz. garlic and chrysanthemum which were cryopreserved using a droplet-vitrification procedure. The loading treatment proved to be beneficial to both garlic and chrysanthemum and increased recovery of cryopreserved explants.

However, {{there are no}} limit <b>load</b> <b>solutions</b> exist for the single edge crack weldments in tension (SEC(T)), {{which is also a}} typical geometry in fracture analysis. The mis-matching limit load for thick plate with SEC(T) are investigated and the special limit <b>load</b> <b>solutions</b> are proposed based on the available mis-matching limit <b>load</b> <b>solutions</b> and systematic finite element analyses. The real weld configurations are simplified as a strip, and different weld strength mis-matching ratio M, crack depth/width ratio a/W and weld width 2 H are in consideration. As a result, it is found that there exists excellent agreement between the limit <b>load</b> <b>solutions</b> and the FE results for almost all the mis-matching ration M, a/W and ligament-to-weld width ratio (W-a) /H. Moreover, useful recommendations are given for evaluating the limit loads of the EBW structure with SEC(T). For the EBW joints with SEC(T), the mis-matching limit loads can be obtained assuming that the components are wholly made of base metal, when M changing from 1. 6 to 0. 6. When M decreasing to 0. 4, the mis-matching limit loads can be obtained assuming that the components are wholly made of base metal only for large value of (W-a) /H. The recommendations may be useful for evaluating the limit loads of the EBW structures with SEC(T).

40|$|In part I, {{accurate}} {{closed form}} solutions of mismatch yield loads were given {{in terms of}} strength mismatch levels, ligament-to-weld width ratios, and crack lengths, for a middle crack tension (M(T)) plate and a single edge cracked plate in pure bending (SE(PB)). The weld configurations were idealised as a simple strip model, and the crack was assumed to be located in the centre of the weld metal. Solutions were given for two limiting out-of-plane constraint conditions, plane strain and plane stress. This paper is a continuation of part I, providing similar solutions of mismatch yield loads when the crack is in the interface between the weld and base plate. As in part I, useful guidelines are given for assessing welded structures with heat affected zone (HAZ) cracks, in the form of windows where the plastic yield <b>load</b> <b>solutions</b> of mismatched components can be obtained assuming the component is wholly made of either base material or weld material properties. Such guidelines could be very useful when complex components with weldments are to be assessed, for which the plastic yield <b>load</b> <b>solutions</b> are not available or difficult to find.

The EQS approach for limit loads {{is based on an}} EQS collapse surface that is valid for generalized plane strain. This assumption is applicable for very thick plates but is known to be less reasonable for very thin plates where plane stress may be a better assumption. The limits of applicability of the generalized plane strain assumption are investigated by obtaining limit <b>load</b> <b>solutions</b> for perforated plates of various thicknesses that are subjected to in-plane and bending loads. Plastic limit <b>load</b> <b>solutions</b> obtained using three-dimensional EPP finite element analysis [FEA] of models which include each penetration explicitly are compared with solutions obtained using the EQS approximation. The penetration pattern chosen for this study has a ligament efficiency (ligament width-to-pitch ratio, h/P) of 0. 32. For plates thicker than the pitch, the limit load calculated using the EQS method for both in-plane and bending loads is shown to be very accurate (within 4 %) of the limit load calculated for the explicit model. On the other hand, for thin plates (t/P< 2), the EQS limit load is 5 % greater than the explicit limit load for bending and 8 % greater than the explicit limit load for in-plane loads. For thinner plates, the collapse surface is tied to the local geometry deformation and, hence, an equivalent solid plate representation of plastic collapse is a function of deformation mode and thickness...|$|R
