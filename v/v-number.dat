50|$|In optics and lens design, the Abbe number, {{also known}} as the <b>V-number</b> or {{constringence}} of a transparent material, {{is a measure of the}} material's dispersion (variation of refractive index versus wavelength), with high values of V indicating low dispersion. It is named after Ernst Abbe (1840-1905), the German physicist who defined it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{biconical}} {{tapered fiber}} sensor {{is applied to}} monitor the temperature of cement paste during curing process. A simple sensing principle of the proposed sensor is presented by analyzing the <b>V-number</b> of leaky rays. An experimental is carried out by tapering the plastic multi-mode step-index fiber to measure {{the temperature of the}} cement paste. The numerical result shows that the <b>V-number</b> of leaky ray is increasing with the raised in temperature. The experimental results are in agreement with the results from the theoretical analysis...|$|E
40|$|Previous work on {{efficiency}} of light injection {{into the core}} of a fiber from a thin film and a bulk distribution of sources in the cladding have used the fields of a weakly guiding fiber. This approximation simplifies the analysis of the power efficiency by introducing universal values for the eigenvalues of different fibers with the same <b>V-number,</b> but cannot predict accurately the behavior of the injected light into a fiber with arbitrary differences in indices of refraction. The exact field solution was used in the expressions of the power efficiency, p sub eff, and its behavior {{as a function of the}} fiber parameter was analyzed. Weakly guiding results obtained previously are confirmed. However, P sub eff does not always increase with the <b>V-number</b> but with the difference in the indices of refraction, eta sub core-eta sub clad. For the bulk distribution it was found that P sub eff increases with the wavelength, lambda, and decreases with the fiber core radius, a, i. e., it decreases with the <b>V-number.</b> However, for the thin film, the P sub eff remains almost constant with lambda and the fiber core radius...|$|E
40|$|The {{beam quality}} factor M^ 2 for the {{fundamental}} LP 01 mode of a step-index fiber is calculated {{in the presence}} of gain, in a closed form, {{as a function of the}} complex generalized <b>V-number.</b> It is shown that the M^ 2 value of a single-mode gain-guided fiber laser can be arbitrary large. The results are important for the interpretation of the beam quality measurements in recent experiments on single-mode gain-guided fiber lasers...|$|E
40|$|The {{beam quality}} factor $M^ 2 $ for the {{fundamental}} LP 01 mode of a step-index fiber with a finite cladding diameter is calculated {{in the presence}} of gain, in a closed form, {{as a function of the}} complex generalized <b>V-number.</b> It is shown that the conventional infinite cladding diameter approximation cannot be used for index-antiguided gain-guided fibers, and the rigorous analysis presented in this paper is required for accurate prediction of the beam quality factor, as reported in recent experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”The modal {{dispersion}} relation of electromagnetic waves in a Bragg fiber having plasma in the cladding regions is investigated analytically. The proposed Bragg fiber {{consists of a}} low index central region having air surrounded by {{a large number of}} periodic cladding layers of alternating high and low refractive indices of dielectric and plasma respectively. The {{modal dispersion}} relation is obtained by solving Maxwell wave equations using a simple boundary matching method. The analysis shows that the normalized frequency parameter (also called <b>V-number)</b> is frequency independent. This indicates that the proposed Bragg fiber may be used for single mode operation without high frequency limitation as well as with little loss of energy compared to the conventional dielectric waveguide. 1...|$|E
40|$|Fiber optic sensors {{are playing}} {{important}} role in the field of sensors. This is due to spontaneous response and ease in handling. Hence, it is proposed to study the Characterization of Intensity Modulated Fiber Optic Sensor. In the present paper, we have made use of a plastic optical fiber operated at 820 nm and 850 nm. A small portion of cladding has been removed {{in the middle of the}} optical fiber and the bare core is exposed in guiding liquid of various concentrations of common salt and sugar solutions. One end of the fiber is connected to the source and the other end to a power meter. The output power at the second end of the fiber is measured. The relation between refractive index of guiding liquid (which varies with concentration) and the output power, power loss, <b>V-number,</b> modal dispersion etc. are studied...|$|E
