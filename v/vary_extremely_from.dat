40|$|Constitutive cell surface {{expression}} of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I antigens <b>vary</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>from</b> tissue to tissue and individual antigens may differ widely in expression levels. Down-regulation of class I expression is a known immune evasive mechanism used by cancer cells and viruses. Moreover, recent observations suggest that even minor differences in expression levels {{may influence the}} course of viral infections {{and the frequency of}} complications to stem cell transplantation. We have shown that some human multipotent stem cells have high {{expression of}} HLA-A while HLA-B is only weakly expressed, and demonstrate here that this is also the case for the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293 T. Using quantitative flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction we found expression levels of endogenous HLA-A 3 (median 71, 204 molecules per cell) 9. 2 -fold higher than the expression of-B 7 (P = 0. 002). Transfection experiments with full-length HLA-A 2 and -B 8 encoding plasmids confirmed this (54, 031 molecules per cell vs. 2, 466, respectively, P = 0. 001) independently of transcript levels suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation. Using chimeric constructs we found that the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane region had no impact on the differential cell surface expression. In contrast, ~ 65 % of the difference could be mapped to the six C-terminal amino acids of the alpha 2 domain and the alpha 3 domain (amino acids 176 - 284), i. e. amino acids not previously shown to be of importance for differential expression levels of HLA class I molecules. We suggest that the differential cell surface expression of two common HLA-A and-B alleles is regulated by a post-translational mechanism that may involve hitherto unrecognized molecules...|$|E
30|$|In general, {{there are}} two {{idealized}} uses for the simulation in groundwater hydrology. The first is the prediction (or forecasting) of future events based on calibrated and validated model (Loague and Freeze 1985). The second object is to develop the conceptual methods for the designing of future experiments to improve {{the understanding of the}} process (Loague 1988). Remote sensing methods are the most assuring source of spatially distributed data for both calibration and model input parameters. Topography, channel positions, aquifer thickness, evapotranspiration and precipitation data are all based on remote sensing (Milzow et al. 2008). Numerous lumped-parameter models (e.g. HEC- 1, HEC- 2, MODFLOW, SHE and SWAT) have been linked to GIS in these ways to predict surface and groundwater flows. Orzol and McGrath (1992), for example, described how the structure of MODFLOW was altered to promote its integration with ArcInfo. They demonstrated that the results were the similar as if the model was run as a stand-alone product. Likewise, Hellweger and Maidment (1999) automated a procedure to illustrate and connect hydrologic elements in ArcInfo and ArcView and drafted the results to an ASCII file that is readable by the Hydrologic Engineering Center’s-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS). These lumped models simulate broad spectrum of processes (e.g. surface and subsurface water flow, sediment and pollutants transport) with continuous time simulation (e.g. SWAT-Arnold et al. 1993). These watershed-based models have been connected to GIS for many years and at present, several online versions are at hand (e.g. SWAT- Srinivasan and Arnold 1994 and L-THIA 2 - Lim et al. 1999). The methods used to hookup GIS and simulation models are also <b>vary</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>from</b> one application to another (Wilson and Gallant 2000). Watkins et al. (1996) compared {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} various GIS/Model interfaces and showed how the spatial analysis and visualization potential of GIS could be used to enhance parameter estimation/determination, scale effects, grid design, access the responsiveness of model outputs to parameter uncertainty and model discretization.|$|E

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the susceptibility to the teratogenic effect of drugs within human populations <b>varies</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>from</b> one individual to another, even after identical exposures. One of the factors that may explain these interindividual differences is the genetic makeup in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the respective drugs. In fact, both maternal and embryonic/fetal genotypes can affect placental transport, absorption, metabolism, distribution and receptor binding of an agent, influencing its teratogenicity. We have reviewed the literature and commented on the reported correlations between genetic factors and drug-induced birth defects. There is still a clear lack of knowledge regarding this issue and the available data are often conflicting. However, the identification of specific polymorphisms associated with predisposition to teratogenesis may allow in the future the development of personalized non-teratogenic therapies for pregnant women...|$|R
40|$|Animal health {{requires}} {{attention to}} many factors including biology, social interactions, behaviour, housing characteristics, genetics, reproduction, preventive {{medical care and}} nutrition. Nutrition in zoos is a special challenge, because {{there are hundreds of}} species to consider each representing another digestive strategy for a particular ecological niche. Feedstuffs in the wild <b>vary</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>from</b> region to region, from species to species and the animals have adapted their digestive system to the specific type of food. Under captive conditions, animals have to be fed with a substitute diet. In order to formulate such a diet in the zoo, many factors have to be taken into account. The first and most important aspect, however, is to consider the animal’s dietary habits in the wild. In most cases, the best alternative is to adapt the animals to diets designed for domestic livestock and pets with respect to their natural behaviour. However, seasonal variations of food intake of some species should also be kept in mind when designing a diet. Other important considerations are the possibilities given in the enclosure for natural behaviour during food intake, and the needs of related species, whose requirements are known. Finally, it is also essential to know what the animals really eat. Are they fed in-groups or individually? Is there a dominant animal that keeps the others from eating the amount they need? Many aspects in nutrition are linked to animal health. This is of great importance for the veterinarian, since it is possible to improve animal health by checking diets in reasonable intervals and observe the well-being of the animals. Factors like energy and protein requirements in reference to overnutrition and seasonality in many species are one of the great challenges in zoo animal nutrition. Obesity {{is one of the major}} problems found in zoo animal population. Many birds, like parrots are fed improperly with a diet high in energy, and therefore develop obesity. Already one peanut too much per day can change the weight of a parrot. Another problem of obesity is that it results in other diseases depending on the species and the actual overweight the animal has. These diseases are even more problematic and sometimes lead to damages that are irreversible e. g. diabetes mellitus, heart diseases and sometimes even foot problems are very difficult to heal. A body condition scoring, which is of course not available for every species needs to be established or adapted from other species. If a veterinarian or a nutritionist is able to control the animals regularly with a body condition scoring, many diseases can be prevented. Other health troubles closely associated with obesity are problems of reduced reproduction. It is also a financial problem depending on the species, since the visitor numbers rise and fall with the number of offspring a zoo can present. To solve these problems energy and nutrient requirements have to be established for the zoo population. In addition, behavioural enrichment needs to be supported, so that the animals increase their activity. Protein is another important component of the diet on which veterinarians need to have a closer look. Especially in the animal groups with a high variety in animal species like birds and reptiles little information about protein requirements can be found in the literature. It has been shown in some bird species that protein requirements are much lower than it was thought. Also a high correlation of high protein contents in diets of hoofstock and copper defiency has been found (Dierenfeld et al., 1997). Furthermore, high protein diets have been linked to diarrhea and other problems of the intestinal tract. These have also been associated to high protein in combination of low fiber diets. Many other factors like seasonality in diets is not really understood nor widely respected in zoo animal nutrition. Many other diseases in zoos are associated with dietary management. It is very difficult to give recommendations for zoo animals since little data are available for many species. Many recommendations are adapted from domestic livestock and pets. A very good example are the Vitamin A recommendations for exotic birds. The recommendations for laying hens are between 6000 - 8000 IU/kg DM, whereas the Vitamin A requirements for exotic birds are sufficient with 4000 IU/kg DM. Of course, many exceptions can be found e. g. the white canary which needs much more Vitamin A (10 ’ 000 IU/kg DM). Furthermore the minerals play an important role in neonatal development, clinical imbalances and maybe also sperm motility. Especially, clinical imbalances have long been recognized in carnivores and insectivores. It has been discussed in herbivores recently, that an overfeeding with minerals, especially calcium, leads to gastroliths, enteroliths and uroliths...|$|E

In this paper we present most recent and powerful techniques of single trial motor imagery classification of optimization the spatial and spectral filters simultaneously, and apply their multiclass extension to a 4 - class motor imagery data from BCI Competition III. Our results show a significant improvement in comparison with winner results of that competition. These are: Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) and its two extensions to the Common Spatio-Spectral Patterns (CSSP), Common Sparse Spectral Spatial Patterns (CSSSP), and also the frequency tuned version of CSP, i. e. the Sub Band CSP (SBCSP).

The results suggested a forest recover from the cultivated land, {{which is due to}} small scale of land clearance, long fallow periods, remnant trees in the cleared fields, as well as the land inheritance system.

On mating {{with a male}} sterile mutant, ms(3) K 81, gyn-F 9 females produced impaternate progeny {{at a rate of}} about 15 flies per female, which was almost 2000 times as frequent as that of the control. When the females were mated with normally fertile males, the number of offspring <b>varied</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>from</b> parent to parent, with average fertility being much lower than that of normal females. Nearly one-third of these bisexual progeny were either triploid females or intersexes. Among the rest of the progeny, some were diploid impaternates having developed without syngamy. The gynogenetic property of gyn-F 9 is primarily governed by a few genes, most likely two recessive genes, one each located on the second and third chromosomes. The impaternates were found to restore their diploidy by the fusion of two nonsister nuclei out of the four egg pronuclei which result from the second meiotic division (central fusion). Although nondisjunction occurs frequently in the meiosis of gyn-F 9, this is unlikely to bring about an appreciable number of diploid gametes developing into impaternates.
