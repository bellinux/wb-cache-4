50|$|Some of the {{techniques}} used by the inmates were ingenious and not too dissimilar {{to those in the}} war film The Great Escape about Allied POWs. Excavating the tunnels was not easy because of the heavy clay soil upon which the camp was built. Cans, meat tins, and even knives from the canteen were used as digging implements. The soil was hauled out of the tunnel on a makeshift skip and put into kit bags. At first, prisoners carried the soil in their pockets to the long-jump pit or garden plots. Others kneaded clay into balls and dropped them through a hole in a false wall they had constructed in an unused room in one of the huts. To support the tunnel roof, oak benches were stolen from the canteen and bed legs were cut down when supplies of wood were depleted. A <b>ventilation</b> <b>pipeline</b> was made from condensed milk tins; air was forced through by a hand-operated fan. The tunnel even had its own electric lights, tapped off the mains supply. Noise was concealed by chorus singing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{three-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} of the working face in mine {{was set up by}} using computational fluid dynamics, and the moving and heat exchange of the multiphase flow in <b>ventilation</b> <b>pipeline</b> in mine was simulated. The distribution of the wall temperature was simplified, and the gas and grain are included in this paper. The coupling effect between the phases were considered in this model to reflect their relations. The changing of one phase according to the other one can be stated. The distribution of the temperature of the air without vapor and that of multiphase flow were compared. An effective tool for simulating the system of ventilation in mine and efficient running of it were stated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{analyzes}} {{the problem in}} application the solar system was used in residential building, puts forward the requirements to use energy and choose {{the setting of the}} solar energy collector from two aspects of building and drainage design respectively. In addition, the article explicates andthe solar energy collector and building integrated design and the development of solar energy collector. At last, the article puts forward some Suggestions on the improvement and development of residential solar hot water system and the design of the hot water supply bath solution of practice to make solar energy and low power assisted by night combining. Solar Water Heating System Problem in Application The Solar Energy Water Heaterâ€™s Disorder Application and Lack of Design Management. When we consider to install solar energy water heateron biulding,we lack to the plan the architectural design. Tthe solar energy water heater is installed by the residents. All kinds of different forms, different brand, different specifications of solar energy water heater is installed {{in different parts of the}} house in the same building. Pipelines crisscross on roof and facade desultorily, it not only make the architectural form and the image of the city was destroyed, even cause architectural construction, <b>ventilation,</b> <b>pipelines,</b> etc. has been damaged, affect the overall effect of the building...|$|R
