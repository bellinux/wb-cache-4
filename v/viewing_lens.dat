2500|$|Thévenot {{invented the}} spirit level (or bubble level) {{some time before}} 2 February 1661, which he filled with alcohol and mounted on a stone ruler fitted with a <b>viewing</b> <b>lens.</b> [...] This date can be {{established}} from Thevenot's correspondence with scientist Christian Huygens. [...] Within a year of this date, the inventor circulated details of his invention to others, including Robert Hooke in London and Vincenzo Viviani in Florence. [...] It is occasionally argued that these bubble levels did not come into widespread use {{until the beginning of}} the 18th century—the earliest surviving examples being from that time—but Adrien Auzout had recommended that the Académie Royale des Sciences take [...] "levels of the Thévenot type" [...] on its expedition to Madagascar in 1666. [...] It is very likely that these levels were in use in France and elsewhere long {{before the start of the}} 18th century.|$|E

50|$|Most recently, Nemotek {{announced}} a one-element wider field of <b>view</b> <b>lens</b> for portable applications. The lens provides {{a field of}} view up to 65 degrees while traditional lenses tend {{to be limited to}} 60 degrees. The announcement is already making waves in the mobile camera market. The new lens narrows the gap with standalone digital cameras a bit more. The development is considered a milestone for Nemotek.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> {{is linked}} to the taking lens. Light rays {{entering}} the <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> are refracted by a prism and form a bright, life-size image on a piece of ground glass; the eyepiece is adjustable for sharp image. Unlike an ordinary twin lens reflex camera, the Goerz Minicord image is not only right side up, but also unreversed, due to the use of a prism instead of mirror. [...] Minicord is the only twin lens reflex camera in 16 mm subminiature photography.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{generally}} not possible to preview depth of field, as one can with most SLRs, since the TLR's <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> usually has no diaphragm. Exceptions to this are the Rolleiflex, the Mamiya 105 D and 105 DS lenses, which have a depth of field preview.|$|E
50|$|Stereoscopically fusing two {{separate}} images {{without the aid}} of mirrors or prisms while simultaneously keeping them in sharp focus {{without the aid of}} suitable <b>viewing</b> <b>lenses</b> inevitably requires an unnatural combination of eye vergence and accommodation. Simple freeviewing therefore cannot accurately reproduce the physiological depth cues of the real-world viewing experience. Different individuals may experience differing degrees of ease and comfort in achieving fusion and good focus, as well as differing tendencies to eye fatigue or strain.|$|R
5000|$|With wire- and radio-guided SACLOS, the {{sighting}} device can calculate the angular difference in {{direction from the}} missile position to the target location. It can then give electronic instructions to the missile that correct its flight path so it is flying along {{a straight line from}} the {{sighting device}} to the target. Most antitank SACLOS systems such as Milan and TOW use a strobe or flare (visible, infrared (IR) or ultraviolet (UV) light) in the tail of the missile with an appropriate sensor on the firing post, to track the missile's flight path. The launching station incorporates a tracking camera with two lenses. A wide field of <b>view</b> <b>lens</b> that locates and [...] "gathers" [...] the missile {{near the center of the}} gunners line of sight immediately after launch, and a narrow <b>view</b> <b>lens</b> with automatic zoom that accomplishes the fine tracking adjustments. In most configurations, the narrow field camera utilizes electronics that translate the brightest spot in the view - the flare or strobe of the missile - into an electrical impulse. This impulse changes as the missile leaves the center of the field of view, and the electronics automatically apply a correction instruction in the opposite direction of the change to re-center the missile.|$|R
50|$|When {{a bright}} light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of <b>view,</b> <b>lens</b> flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast. This can be avoided by shading the lens using a lens hoods. In a studio, a gobo or set of barn doors can be {{attached}} to the lighting to keep it from shining on the camera. Filters can {{be attached to the}} camera lens which will also minimise lens flare, which is especially useful for outdoor photographers.|$|R
50|$|However, a projector-like {{optical system}} (i.e., using {{condenser}} lenses for illumination, with a <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> {{in place of}} the projection lens), employing daylight (not direct sunlight) for the light source, can produce comparably excellent visual results—although for only one viewer at a time—without the unacceptable hazards of actual projection.|$|E
50|$|Twin-lens reflex cameras used a pair {{of nearly}} {{identical}} lenses, one to form the image and one as a viewfinder. The lenses were arranged with the <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> immediately above the taking lens. The <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> projects an image onto a viewing screen which {{can be seen from}} above. Some manufacturers such as Mamiya also provided a reflex head to attach to the viewing screen to allow the camera to be held to the eye when in use. The advantage of a TLR was that it could be easily focussed using the viewing screen and that under most circumstances the view seen in the viewing screen was identical to that recorded on film. At close distances however, parallax errors were encountered and some cameras also included an indicator to show what part of the composition would be excluded.|$|E

Woking) {{and uses a}} single optical <b>viewing</b> <b>lens,</b> instead of the binocular eyepieces of a conventional optical microscope.

50|$|A camera {{mounted on}} the lander's arm can capture black and white images of the {{instruments}} on the lander's deck and a 3-D view of the ground where the seismometer and heat flow probe will be placed. It will then {{be used to help}} engineers and scientists guide the deployment of the instruments to the ground. With a 45-degree field of view, the camera will also provide a panoramic view of the terrain surrounding the landing site. A second similar camera, with a wide-angle 120-degree field of <b>view</b> <b>lens</b> will be mounted under the edge of the lander's deck and will provide a complementary view of the instrument deployment area.|$|R
5000|$|Regular {{wide angle}} lenses (meaning lenses with focal length much {{shorter than the}} format {{diagonal}} and producing a wide field of view) need to be mounted close to the film. However, SLR cameras require that lenses be mounted far enough {{in front of the}} film to provide space for the movement of the mirror (the [...] "mirror box"); about 40 mm for a 35mm SLR compared to less than 10 mm in non-SLR 35mm cameras. This prompted the development of wide field of <b>view</b> <b>lenses</b> with more complex retrofocus optical designs. These use very large negative front elements to force back-focus distances long enough to ensure clearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{separate}} <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> is {{also very}} advantageous for long-exposure photographs. During exposure, an SLR's mirror must be retracted, blacking out the image in the viewfinder. A TLR's mirror is fixed and the taking lens remains open throughout the exposure, letting the photographer examine the image while the exposure is in progress. This can ease the creation of special lighting or transparency effects.|$|E

50|$|The older devices {{by their}} nature {{severely}} {{limit the number}} of images that can be included in a sequence without making the device very large or the images impractically small. The book format still imposes a physical limit, but many dozens of images of ample size can easily be accommodated. Inventors stretched even that limit with the mutoscope, patented in 1894 and sometimes still found in amusement arcades. It consists of a large circularly-bound flip book in a housing, with a <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> and a crank handle that drives a mechanism that slowly rotates the assembly of images past a catch, sized to match the running time of an entire reel of film.|$|E
5000|$|The box was {{attached}} to a concertina device allowing for adjustment. This had an eye-sized <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> at the end that was not attached to the box. The illustration card would be inserted {{at the back of}} the box, which would be held up to the light. It would then be viewed through the lens. Most cards would be designed to include small cut-out parts through which the light would pass. Other parts of the cards may be made of thinner material to create a glowing effect. The empty parts would typically represent windows or street lights, so that the card's scene would appear to be illuminated by light from these sources.|$|E
50|$|Integral imaging is an autostereoscopic and multiscopic {{three-dimensional}} imaging technique that captures and reproduces a light field {{by using a}} two-dimensional array of microlenses, sometimes called a fly's-eye lens, normally {{without the aid of}} a larger overall objective or <b>viewing</b> <b>lens.</b> In capture mode, each microlens allows an image of the subject as seen from the viewpoint of that lens's location to be acquired. In reproduction mode, each microlens allows each observing eye to see only the area of the associated micro-image containing the portion of the subject that would have been visible through that space from that eye's location. The optical geometry can perhaps be visualized more easily by substituting pinholes for the microlenses, as has actually been done for some demonstrations and special applications.|$|E

Variations of this design {{are said to have}} been used extensively by the US military for use in aerial photography on the T-11 camera.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of SLR, all cameras with viewfinders had two optical light paths: one path through the lens to the film, and another path positioned above (TLR or twin-lens reflex) or to the side (rangefinder). Because the viewfinder and the film lens cannot share the same optical path, the <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> is aimed to intersect with the film lens at a fixed point somewhere in front of the camera. This is not problematic for pictures taken at a middle or longer distance, but parallax causes framing errors in close-up shots. Moreover, focusing the lens of a fast reflex camera when it is opened to wider apertures (such as in low light or while using low-speed film) is not easy.|$|E
5000|$|In the single-lens reflex camera, the {{photographer}} sees the scene through the camera lens. This avoids {{the problem of}} parallax which occurs when the viewfinder or <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> is separated from the taking lens. Single-lens reflex cameras {{have been made in}} several formats including sheet film 5x7" [...] and 4x5", roll film 220/120 taking 8,10, 12 or 16 photographs on a 120 roll and twice that number of a 220 film. These correspond to 6x9, 6x7, 6x6 and 6x4.5 respectively (all dimensions in cm). Notable manufacturers of large format and roll film SLR cameras include Bronica, Graflex, Hasselblad, Mamiya, and Pentax. However the most common format of SLR cameras has been 35 mm and subsequently the migration to digital SLR cameras, using almost identical sized bodies and sometimes using the same lens systems.|$|E
50|$|The Ansco Panda was {{a simple}} child's box camera made by the Ansco camera {{corporation}} of Binghamton, New York in the 1950s. Its appearance is quite similar to the Kodak Baby Brownie and was designed to compete directly with it. The camera features a black plastic body with cream accents around the lenses, a cream colored wind knob and a TLR style <b>viewing</b> <b>lens</b> above the taking lens. Images are composed via a waist level viewfinder and taken {{by means of a}} traditional Ansco red shutter trigger button depressed by the right index finger.The camera produces 12 square photographs on a single roll of 620 format film (Ansco No. 20 film). Focal length of the camera is 60 mm and it has an f/16 lens. Focus is fixed and objects from about 6' to infinity are in focus.|$|E

25|$|Each of {{the block}} III Ranger {{spacecraft}} had six cameras on board. The cameras were fundamentally the same with differences in exposure times, fields of <b>view,</b> <b>lenses,</b> and scan rates. The camera system was divided into two channels, P (partial) and F (full). Each channel was self-contained with separate power supplies, timers, and transmitters. The F-channel had two cameras: the wide-angle A-camera and the narrow angle B-camera. The P-channel had four cameras: P1 and P2 (narrow angle) and P3 and P4 (wide angle). The final F-channel image was taken between 2.5 and 5 seconds before impact (altitude about 5km) and the last P-channel image 0.2 to 0.4 seconds before impact (altitude about 600 m). The images provided better resolution than was available from Earth-based views {{by a factor of}} 1000.|$|R
40|$|Fixation and a 180 Degree View Simplify Ego Motion Estimation Although moving human {{observers}} actively fixate {{their eyes}} on points in the world, computer vision algorithms designed for the estimation of structure-from-motion or egomotion typically do not make use of this constraint. The main contribution of this work is to precisely specify {{the form of the}} optical flow field for a fixating observer. In particular, we show theoretically that the use of a hemispherical (retinal) imaging surface generates an optical flow field of a particularly simple form. The predictions of this theory are tested using the first actual hemispherical lens-camera system in computer vision, involving a 180 degree field of <b>view</b> <b>lens.</b> A further contribution is the finding that the sign of flow at the retinal periphery can be used to predict collisions...|$|R
