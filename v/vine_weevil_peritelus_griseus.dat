40|$|Over the {{previous}} quarter century the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) {{has become a}} pest of horticultural and agricultural plants. The <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> is a polyphagous coleopteran insect {{and is able to}} attack over one hundred different plant species. Its spread has been limited by its lack of flight but modern world trade in live container grown plants has spread the insect to new habitats. Damage to plants caused by <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> is two fold, with the larvae destroying root balls while the adults attack the, leaves. The larval stage, in particular is difficult to treat with conventional insecticides unless environmentally undesirable soil treatments are used. The current lack of defence against the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> has opened the door for methods of crop protection through the generation of genetically modified plants. The design of an efficient GM approach to control the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> requires a sound knowledge of the insectâ€™s digestive enzymes, which may be used as potential targets for insecticidal proteins. This approach was achieved for the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> through analysis of active digestive proteases in the insects gut and the identification of suitable proteinase inhibitors which would reduce the overall level of protein hydrolysis. Using this method it was discovered that the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> contained both serine and cysteine proteases in addition to a range of other digestive hydrolases. This biochemical data was supported by a molecular approach to isolate cDNA clones associated with the insect's digestive tract. Using a gut specific cDNA library clones encoding a cathepsin B protease, two trypsin proteases, a pectinesterase, a lipase and a cellulase were isolated and characterised. The cellulase isolated from <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> has been shown to originate from the insect genome as shown through Southern Blot analysis and sequencing across several intronic regions. Evidence presented herein shows that the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> gut extract hydrolyses both cellulose and cellobiose. Similar results were observed with recombinant protein expressed in the eukaryotic yeast P. pastoris. Furthermore data presented here shows that the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> has the full complement of enzymes needed for the complete digestion of crystalline cellulose, which was until recently believed to be the sole domain of several species of bacteria and yeast. In addition a cDNA clone encoded a <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> endogenous chitinase was isolated from the cDNA library. This chitinase cDNA and one encoding the proteinase inhibitor Oryzacystatin-I were used to generate transgenic tobacco plants which have been shown to express the transgene. These transgenic plants are the first step in developing a strategy for plant protection against <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> based on genetic modification...|$|R

There is an urgent need to improve control of <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> and in particular to provide growers with effective Integrated Pest Management-compatible controls with which to target the adult stage of this pest. One approach would be to exploit the behaviour of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> to disseminate spores of an entomopathogenic fungus placed within the crop environment in artificial refuges.

40|$|Electroantennograms (EAGs) were {{recorded}} from the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus F. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) {{to a broad}} range of volatile plant compounds. The response profile is restricted to a small number of volatiles that evoke substantial EAGs. Large EAG responses were particularly found among green leaf volatiles (GLV) such as (E) - 2 -hexenol- 1, (Z) - 3 -hexenol- 1, hexanol- 1, hexanal, and heptanal. Other plant volatiles eliciting responses in the weevils' antenna are 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine, hexylamine, benzylalcohol, 1, 2 -dimethoxybenzene, o-cresol, myrtenol, 3 -methylcyclohexanol, Â¿-hexalactone, and Â¿-heptalactone.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between reproductive performance and preference for potential host plants of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> is investigated, {{as shown in}} tests on contact (or feeding) preference, presented herein, and tests on olfactory preference, published elsewhere. Assessment of reproductive performance shows that the host-plant range of the adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus in Europe is limited to one gymnosperm genus (Taxus sp.) and {{a broad range of}} angiosperm plants in two subclasses of the Dicotyledonae, namely Dilleniidae and Rosidae. The successful reproduction on very distantly related plant taxa suggests that the original weevil- and plant-habitat has mediated the current host-plant range of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil.</b> Contact-preference tests with equally suitable hosts, such as Aronia, Fragaria, Euonymus and Taxus, and one less suitable host, Humulus, indicate a mismatch between contact preference and performance and, as far as olfactory preferences are known, these match neither the contact preferences nor the performance. This mismatch may arise because (i) host plant species offered do not occur in weevil habitat in Europe (e. g. Aronia and the cultivated Fragaria come from North America) and (ii) predation (or disease) risks differ among host plants, thereby altering effective reproductive performance. With respect to performance on novel hosts (Thuja, Prunus) and bad hosts (Rhododendron), some between-individual variation is found within a single population, suggesting that local populations harbour (possibly genetic) variation for adaptation to new hosts. How this variation is maintained in the face of strong selection pressures on local populations of flightless and thelytokous weevils, is an important question for understanding the broad host plant range in the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil...</b>|$|R
40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are pathogens {{which require}} an insect host to fulfil their life cycle and {{are commonly used}} as biocontrol agents. Studies have shown {{that a combination of}} EPN and EPF can result in greater insect mortality when compared to the agents applied alone. This interaction could possibly reduce the cost and quantities of single dose applications, inferring a synergistic effect. However, combinations of these pathogens may also result in additive or antagonistic interactions which would be of no benefit to growers. Hylobius abietis (large pine weevil) and Otiorhynchus sulcatus (black <b>vine</b> <b>weevil)</b> cause economic damage to forestry and horticultural crops, respectively. Large pine weevil larvae develop in the tree stumps, emerge as adults and feed on the bark of newly planted saplings, causing extensive mortality. Black <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae kill plants by feeding on the roots and adults cause cosmetic damage. In this investigation, laboratory and field trials were conducted against large pine weevil larvae to determine whether interactions occur if EPN and EPF were applied simultaneously. EPN and EPF have already been shown to interact synergistically against the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> in laboratory conditions. These experiments were repeated to investigate if synergistic interactions could be reproduced. Synergistic interactions were found with EPN and EPF against the large pine weevil in some laboratory experiments. However, antagonism and additivity were also recorded and synergism could not be predictably achieved. The field trial against the large pine weevil resulted in additivity. This indicates that the combined application of EPN and EPF would not be a better option than single applications.

40|$|A Y-tube {{olfactometer}} and a still-air olfactometer {{were developed}} to determine the attractiveness of several host plants for the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.); Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Odours of weevil-damaged yew (Taxus baccata) and spindle trees (Euonymus fortunei) are attractive to the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil,</b> but Rhododendron and strawberry (Fragaria Ã— ananassa) are not. Undamaged Euonymus is attractive to the weevils in springtime but not in late summer. When clean air or undamaged Euonymus is the alternative, weevils strongly prefer weevil-damaged Euonymus foliage, and this preference is retained throughout the year. Hence, plant damage {{plays a role in}} attraction of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil.</b> In contrast to the permanent attractiveness of weevil-damaged Euonymus, mechanically damaged plants gradually lose the attractiveness that they have early in the growing season. This suggests that emission of volatiles, produced by the plants in response to weevil damage, is important for attraction of the weevils because the weevils may use these plant odours to find suitable food plants throughout the season. Apart from weevil-damage-related plant volatiles, green leaf volatiles must also play a significant role, as indicated by the fact that weevils prefer: early season, undamaged Euonymus over clean air; early season, mechanically damaged Euonymus over undamaged Euonymus; and, throughout the season, had no preference when mechanically damaged Euonymus is tested against weevil-damaged Euonymus. Thus, monitoring traps may be developed by the use of green leaf volatiles and/or herbivore-induced volatiles, as attractant...|$|R

OBJECTIVE:Use passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to study the movement of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> within crop environments. METHOD:A series of laboratory bioassays were completed in which the effect of attaching RFID tags using a thermoplastic or a cyanoacrylate adhesive on survival and movement, on both horizontal and vertical surfaces, of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> was determined. An outdoor field experiment was then completed at Harper Adams University in order to test the potential of this technique for studying <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> movement within crop environments. RESULTS:Attaching RFID tags using the thermoplastic adhesive did not result in any weevil deaths over a 21 day period. In contrast, just over half (53 %) of the weevils to which the RFID tag was attached using the cyanoacrylate adhesive died over the same period. The mean of weevil horizontal movement speed was significantly slower when an RFID tag was attached using a thermoplastic (1. 01 â€Šcm/s) or a cyanoacrylate (0. 29 â€Šcm/s) adhesive compared with untagged weevils (1. 83 â€Šcm/s). However, weevils that were tagged using the thermoplastic adhesive were significantly faster than weevils tagged using the cyanoacrylate adhesive. Mean vertical movement speed was also significantly slower when weevils were tagged using the thermoplastic adhesive (0. 18 â€Šcm/s) compared with untagged weevils (0. 37 â€Šcm/s). Weevils tagged using the cyanoacrylate adhesive were unable to climb vertical surfaces. In the field experiment, weevils moved away from their release points. Nine days after the start of the experiment weevils were on average 3. 38 â€Šm from their release points indicating a speed of movement of 0. 38 â€Šm/day. The mean distance of movement from their release points did not increase further {{during the rest of the}} experimental period, but remained relatively constant at between 2. 50 and 3. 28 â€Šm. As such, for weevils that remained within the crop environment, there is no evidence of dispersal behaviour,with movement behaviour observed more likely to be driven by resource utilisation. However, not all weevils remained within the crop area. Indeed, 15 (38 %) of released weevils and/or RFID tags left the crop area, indicating possible long range dispersal by these individuals or evidence of predation of the weevils. A total of 11 (28 %) of the RFID tagged weevils released into the crop were recovered alive and with the tag still attached after 35 days. These weevils were estimated to have moved a distances of between 2. 65 and 17. 30 â€Šm (average distance moved 7. 50 â€Šm) during this period. These distances are likely to underestimate the distance moved by each weevil as they assume that each weevil took the most direct route between each point and did not move other than this. In total eight of the RFID-tagged weevils moved both along and between rows of strawberry grow-bags. At the start of the experiment the 11 RFID tagged weevils occupied 11 (14 %) of the strawberry grow-bags. If these weevils took the most direct route between each position within the crop where they were detected these weevils would have crossed, and potentially laid eggs in, 44 (58 %) of the grow-bags during the 35 days of the experiment. If they had taken a more indirect route the weevils could have potentially laid eggs in a higher number of the grow-bags. CONCLUSIONS:Results presented here indicate that RFID tags can be used to study the movement of <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> adults within crop environments. However, the weight and size of currently available tags significantly slows the movement of weevils under laboratory conditions and frequency of detection may affect estimates of actual distance moved. Despite this, the rate at which <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> dispersed through the strawberry crop was comparable to the speed of movement recorded previously by others when weevils were released into an urban environment. Use of RFID tags also resulted in detection rates far higher than those reported in studies by others using traditional mark-release-recapture techniques. Use of RFID tags in the present study indicates that adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> have the potential to disperse spores of a suitable entomopathogenic fungus from artificial refuges throughout the crop environment.

40|$|Interactions between {{aboveground}} and root-feeding herbivores can {{be influenced}} by changes in plant traits, such as tissue chemistry and morphology. Environmental heterogeneity and perturbations also affect these plant-mediated interactions. Climate change is a multi-faceted phenomenon; increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations lead to increased global mean temperature and an associated higher frequency of extreme weather events. These factors can potentially perturb ecosystem function by altering both plantâ€“herbivore and herbivoreâ€“herbivore interactions. A detailed understanding of whether aboveâ€“belowground interactions are affected by climate change remains lacking. In an attempt to fill knowledge gaps in this understudied area of ecology, this thesis investigates, {{through a series of}} glasshouse experiments, the effects of elevated CO 2 and other aspects of climate change, such as altered phenology, on the interspecific interaction between the aboveground large raspberry aphid (Amphorophora idaei) and the root feeding larvae of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Otiorhynchus sulcatus), mediated by the shared raspberry (Rubus idaeus) host-plant. Under ambient climate conditions, reciprocal feeding facilitation was observed to occur between aphids and <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae feeding on raspberry, with the presence of one increasing the abundance of the other herbivore, and vice versa. This occurred regardless of plant cultivar and order of herbivore arrival on the plant. It is likely that this facilitative relationship is driven by over-compensatory plant growth in response to herbivory. Although tougher, adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevils</b> show a feeding preference for leaves grown in elevated CO 2. Herbivory may be more influential than CO 2 in determining plantâ€“herbivore interaction outcomes. Aphids affect plant intraspecific competition {{to a greater extent than}} elevated CO 2 by altering plant biomass of both infested and non-infested plants. In conclusion, this particular plantâ€“herbivore system would seem to be relatively robust in the face of possible future CO 2 concentration scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Susceptibility of late instar <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus larvae and pupae to four species entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} were tested. Bioassays {{on production}} and infectivity to larvae and pupae were compared for two steinernematids and two heterorhabditis such as Steinernema carpocapsae, S. feltiae, Heterorhabditis indica and H. bacteriophora. Nematodes production of all species {{was determined by}} the number infective juveniles (IJs) established in <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae and pupae O. sulcatus using sand and filter paper bioassay. S. feltiae produced the maximum number in larvae and pupae at 20 Â°C as compared to other nematodes but production of H. indica, was better at 25 Â°C in larvae and pupae followed by H. bacteriophora, S. carpocapsae and Infectivity test of larvae and pupae was also done in sand media. Infective juveniles recovered from larvae and pupae when infected with S. feltiae produced maximum infective juveniles at 20 Â°C temperatures than all other isolates. H. bacteriophora produced higher number of IJs in larvae and pupae than all other nematode isolates at 25 Â°C. This paper indicates the application of nematodes with the knowledge of insect pest biology represents a possible new strategy for O. sulcatus larvae and pupae...|$|R
40|$|Interactions between insect herbivores {{and host}} plants are fundamental, shaping both {{ecosystem}} functions and community structure. One aspect of insect-plant interactions {{that has received}} considerable attention recently is the indirect linkages between aboveground and belowground insect herbivores via a shared host plant. To date, {{the relationship between a}} maternal insect aboveground and her soil dwelling offspring has been largely overlooked. This study aimed to examine the interactions between the adult insect and soil dwelling larvae of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) with reference to the preferenceâ€“ performance hypothesis, using an agronomically important host plant, red raspberry (Rubus ideaus). A metaâ€“analysis of abovegroundâ€“belowground insect herbivore interactions highlighted that belowground Coleopteran herbivores positively impacted aboveground Homoptera and that general predictions from conceptual models in the literature regarding the direction of interactions between insects were correct, but not statistically significant. In addition it was found that aboveground insect herbivores negatively influenced the survival of belowground herbivores. The preferenceâ€“performance hypothesis was not supported in the findings for the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> on raspberry. Instead a conflict between larval development and adult egg laying behaviour was observed, with a significant reduction in larval mass recorded when maternal adults fed on the same host plant. Larval mass was decreased by 19...|$|R

40|$|Root weevils in {{the genus}} Otiorhynchus are cited {{as one of}} the most {{important}} pests in the major nursery and small fruit production areas throughout the United States, western Canada, and northern Europe. A major problem in combating weevil attack is monitoring and timing of control measures. Because of the night-activity of the adult weevils growers do not observe the emerging weevils in a timely manner and oviposition often starts before effective control measures are taken. Several <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> electroantennogram-active plant volatiles were identiÃžed from a preferred host plant, Euonymus fortunei. Main compounds evoking antennal responses on the weevilsÃ• antennae were (Z) - 2 -pentenol, (E) - 2 -hexenol, (Z) - 3 -hexenol, methyl benzoate, linalool, (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 - nonatriene, methyl eugenol, and (E, E) -_-farnesene. Several of these compounds were tested alone and in mixtures on attractiveness for the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.) in Ãželd-grown strawberry in Oregon.

40|$|Resistance to {{the black}} <b>vine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.) in in rhododendrons was {{examined}} {{on the basis of}} leaf type. Indumented (hairy) and lepitode (scaly) rhododendrons were compared to glabrous (clear leaf) rhododendrons for feeding damage and egg production. A screening study of Taxus cultivars for resistance to the weevil was also conducted. Weevil preference for rhododendrons was tested in an open bed by measuring leaf damage and by counting larvae on the roots {{at the end of the}} study. Weevils were also confined on individual plants and leaf damage, frass production, and egg production were measured each week. The preference study showed that indumented and lepitode rhododendrons had less feeding damage than glabrous rhododendrons. However, there were wide differences within groups. The confined study showed that indumented rhododendrons generally had less leaf surf ace removed than the lepidote and glabrous rhododendrons. The frass production results showed few differences by leaf group. The indumented cross R. smirnowii x R. yakusimanum supported the lowest egg production and was significantly different from all rhododendrons tested. The indumented rhododendrons R. smirnowii and R. yakusimanum were significantly different from the glabrous rhododendrons in the number of eggs produced by weevils confined to these hosts. All Taxus varieties had high mortality from feeding by the black <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> and no weevil resistance was demonstrated...|$|R

Enclosure walls were left untreated or were treated with substances known to reduce insect climbing ability: fluoropolymer, powdered talc and lithium grease. No BVW escapes were observed under dry conditions, but all treatments allowed some escapes under wet conditions, suggesting that moisture helps BVW adults scale treated surfaces.

40|$|Biological {{warfare in}} the soil is being {{encouraged}} through a product containing parasitic nematodes for the control of damaging soil pests such as weevils. The product, Nemasys, has just come onto the market in Britain. The nematode, Steinernema bibionis, is a species completely unrelated to those nematodes which infect plants or mammals. When applied to the soil, they seek out and enter {{the body of the}} target pest. The nematodes carry with them a bacterium which is deadly to many insects and their larvae and, once {{in the body of the}} prey the bacteria are quickly released. The nematode feeds on the bacteria and multiplies to produce many ok-spring, which in turn move out of the insect's body and seek out new victims. This product has been developed to control the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> which is a particular pest of ornamental plants in glasshouses. However the expertise developed by the Agricultural Genetics Company and the Institute of Horticultural Research will be used to identify other strains of nematodes which will be effective in the control of other pests, especially those of brassicas. In trials carried out over the last year, Nemasys was more effective than chemical insecticides in keeping soil free of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> over the four-six month growing season.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Two {{types of}} {{exogenous}} mortality factors, density-independent and density-dependent, were identified {{for the black}} <b>vine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus Fab., developing on container grown rhododendrons. The addition of the insecticide acephate, (O. S. - Dimethyl acetylphosphoramidothioate, OrtheneÂ®) 75 S) to the rhizosphere of rhododendrons in which larval O. sulcatus develop was categorized as a density-independent mortality factor. Acephate when applied as a drench, killed both early and late instar larvae. The mode of entry was primarily contact. Application of acephate drenches to control early instar (I-III) larvae prevents fatal injury (girdling) to container grown rhododendrons. A life table was constructed for the black <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> on container grown rhododendrons at three densities (beginning with 25, 75, and 150 eggs per plant) {{in the process of}} identifying mortality factors. The greatest mortality occurred during the first instar as the larvae become established on the root systems of host plants. At high larval densities (> 4 larvae per plant, in a 23 x 22 cm plastic container) the amount of available stem exoxylary tissue became a density-dependent mortality factor. This is because the larvae require exoxylary tissue to successfully complete development on rhododendron, although they do not feed on it prior to the fourth instar. Therefore, mortality increased with an increase in insect density because of competition for the limited amount of exoxylary tissue. The percent of stem exoxylary tissue removed (consumed) by larvae was dependent on the volume of rhododendron roots. Plants with large (1622 Â± 223 ml) root volumes had significantly less (P< 0. 01) stem exoxylary tissue removed than plants with small (360 Â± 265 ml) root volumes...|$|R
