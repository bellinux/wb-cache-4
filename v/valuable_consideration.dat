25|$|A {{legally binding}} {{contract}} occurs when one party makes an offer and receives an acceptance {{from the other}} party.

They must each receive a benefit and each suffers a detriment. The classic definition of consideration was given by the court in the case of Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the promisor, Lush J: “A <b>valuable</b> <b>consideration,</b> {{in the sense of the}} law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other".|$|E

Rudd therefore prepared a version of the document omitting mention of the Martini–Henrys, which was approved by Rhodes and Robinson, and published in the Cape Times and Cape Argus newspapers on 24 November 1888.

Design/methodology/approach – This commentary reviews some of the research around staffing, organisational hygiene and service management in countries that have already implemented deinstitutionalisation, and draws out some key considerations for countries and organisations that are planning the transition from institutions to community-based care. Findings – There is increasing evidence around approaches that are more likely to lead to positive service user and staff outcomes. Particularly person-centred active support and practice leadership have emerged as effective approaches in facilitating organisational change and high-quality services. Originality/value – Some of the experiences and practices in post-deinstitutionalisation countries around active support and practice leadership can provide <b>valuable</b> <b>considerations</b> for planning institutional closure programmes in countries currently implementing deinstitutionalisation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This work {{represents}} one of the first successful applications of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for interdisciplinary coastal research. A monitoring mission to study the shape and estimate the initial dilution of the S. Jacinto sewage outfall plume using an AUV was performed on July 2002. An efficient sampling strategy enabling greater improvements in spatial and temporal range of detection demonstrated that the sewage effluent plume can be clearly traced using naturally occurring tracers in the wastewater. The outfall plume was found at the surface highly influenced by the weak stratification and low currents. Dilution varying with distance downstream was estimated from the plume rise over the outfall diffuser until a nearly constant value of 130 : 1, 60 m from the diffuser, indicating the near field end. Our results demonstrate that AUVs can provide high-quality measurements of physical properties of effluent plumes in a very effective manner and <b>valuable</b> <b>considerations</b> about the initial mixing processes under real oceanic conditions can be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|Different FPR post-strengthening {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} and applied in existing structures aiming to increase their load capacity. Most of the FRP systems used nowadays consist of carbon fibers embedded in epoxy matrices (CFRP). Regardless of the advantages and the good results shown by the CFRP post-strengthen technique, experimental studies show that, in most cases, the failure of post-strengthened structures is premature. Aiming to better use the tensile strength of the carbon fiber strips used as post-strengthening material, the application of prestressed CFRP strips started to be investigated. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the effects of the composite prestressing in the performance of the CFRP post strengthening technique. The experimental program was based on flexural tests on post-strengthened reinforced concrete beams subjected to static - part 1 and cyclic - part 2 loading. Experimental results allowed the analysis of the quality and shortcomings of post-strengthen system studied, which resulted in <b>valuable</b> <b>considerations</b> about the analyzed post-strengthened beams...|$|R

Volunteers also discussed considerations for future research and services for older adults living alone.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} and discuss the main branding strategies used by Greek wine producers and to highlight the opportunities. An extensive literature review relative to the question under investigation is presented. Empirical data were collected by using secondary and primary data sources. Primary data sources include semi-structured interviews with 33 Greek wine producers. This study highlights several areas of opportunity for a holistic approach of branding strategies by Greek wine producers: (a) Producers try to take advantage of PDO/PGI quality signals, as well as International wine exhibitions awards either as promotional tool or as secure for their established reputation (b) Greek producers have to invest on a more professional and less passive attitude in terms of wine's brand image, its associations, the lifestyle and experiences it represents, improving all intangible elements those ultimate affect consumer choices. (c) Networks and clusters with tourism industry improve “brand loyalty” and “brand awareness” (d) Greek wine producers have to adopt new electronic forms of communication and distribution channels, very valuable for brand recognition, stimulating word of mouth and targeting of opinion leaders.
