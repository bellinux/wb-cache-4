5|$|This river {{valve system}} {{was one of}} the first parts of the dam to be built when the dam project started in 1961, because its initial purpose was to divert the river while the dam was under construction. After that, it served various purposes, {{including}} as a possible emergency release valve. Since the accident, DWR had implemented a standing order that prohibited the operation of the river outlet system and significantly limited access to the river <b>valve</b> <b>chamber.</b> Following the accident, DWR entered into a 2012 Agreement with CalOSHA to hire a third party expert to improve the safety of the River Valve Outlet System (RVOS) and make it operational again. In 2014, DWR embarked on an accelerated refurbishment program to respond to concerns about operational needs during the ongoing drought. The system was mostly refurbished and was used during 2014 and 2015 to meet Endangered Species Act temperature requirements for the Feather River. Some additional refurbishments were being made to portions of the RVOS and were expected to conclude in early 2017.|$|E

50|$|The largest <b>valve</b> <b>chamber</b> is in Van Cortlandt Park. It {{is built}} 250 ft below the park surface. When {{completed}} it will control {{the flow of}} water from the city's Catskill and Delaware systems. These systems provide 90 percent of the city's current drinking water. The Van Cortlandt Park <b>Valve</b> <b>Chamber</b> is 620 ft long, 43 ft wide and 41 ft high. The complex has nine vertical shafts; and two manifolds. Each manifold is 560 ft long and 24 ft in diameter and is projected to be finished in 2020.|$|E
50|$|The said type of {{gate valve}} {{is having a}} {{rotating}} member inside a rotating <b>valve</b> <b>chamber</b> wherein {{the center of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>chamber</b> is off-set with the center line of the pumping cylinder and the pumping cylinder and the delivery pipe are on the same axis. Further the value of the off-set decides the thickness of the rotating member's sealing portion as it is provided a cut section equivalent to the diameter of the pumping cylinder. This invention eliminates the through hole design of the rotary valve and also introduces a replaceable cutting edge for the rotating member. Further this valve ensures that it displaces minimum concrete during its operation and ensures elimination of dead zones. Further the symmetrical design of the rotating member & the <b>valve</b> <b>chamber</b> allow the end user to repair the valve by using conventional means of machining such as a normal lathe machine. This impossible with S-tube valve or rock valve. This valve has been invented by Amit and Anand Gokhale.|$|E

50|$|The rotary cam {{poppet valve}} gear {{consists}} of two admission valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder, operated by a camshaft arranged in a box fixed to each cylinder between the <b>valve</b> <b>chambers.</b> The cam boxes are self-contained and detachable, and replacement cam boxes can be fitted at running sheds within a few hours. The camshafts are driven from the return cranks on the driving wheels through worm wheels and universal propeller shafts, arranged so that the camshafts and the coupled wheels revolve at the same speed.|$|R
40|$|Analytical and {{experimental}} studies of the vibration response of a reciprocating compressor {{have led to the}} development of a procedure for the detection and diagnosis of valve faults. The procedure uses the Smoothed-Pseudo-Wigner Ville Distribution (SPWVD) to interpret monitored impact response vibration. Features of the monitored signals are correlated with pressures in the cylinder and in the <b>valve</b> <b>chambers.</b> The impact events caused by the operation of the suction and discharge valves are revealed to exhibit characteristic patterns on the time-frequency plane. Observation of the variation in these patterns facilitates the diagnosis of incipient valve faults such as leaking, accumulation of deposits and deterioration of valve springs...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} chamber {{geometry}} {{on the characteristics}} of turbulent steady flow through a newly designed artificial heart valve, "the jellyfish valve," has been investigated for flow rates matching those of peak systole. Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) was employed to determine the velocity and shear stress distributions at various locations downstream of the jellyfish valve. Three geometrically different aortic <b>valve</b> <b>chambers</b> have been investigated: namely, a chamber with sinuses of Valsalva, an ellipsoidal chamber, and a cylindrical chamber. The results of this investigation indicated that the aorta with sinuses of Valsalva model had the highest turbulent shear stresses whereas the ellipsoidal model gave the highest-pressure drops. However, for the various flow rates examined, including the systole peak value of 26 L/min, it appears that the ellipsoidal model displays better hydrodynamic characteristics in terms of shear stress and uniformity of axial velocity distributions downstream of the jellyfish valve...|$|R

A more aggressive camshaft was used, with higher lift and duration, and harder valve springs were installed. Compression ratio was increased to 10.2:1. The C2/1 2.7 made 210 bhp with 267 Nm of torque and was the fastest E30 {{available at the time}} (227 km/h top speed). 108 cars were built.|$|E
50|$|The four {{chambers}} in {{the pressure}} carburetor {{are all in}} a row and are referred to by letters. Chamber A contains impact air pressure at the carburetor inlet. Chamber B contains the lower air pressure from the throat of the venturi. The difference in pressure between the two air chambers creates {{what is known as the}} air metering force, which acts to open the servo <b>valve.</b> <b>Chamber</b> C contains metered fuel, and chamber D contains unmetered fuel. The difference in pressure between the two fuel chambers creates the fuel metering force, which acts to close the servo valve. Since the fuel pressures are naturally higher than air pressure, chamber A contains a spring which makes up the difference in force to create a balance.|$|E
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{determined the}} coefficients of thermal conductivity of some ultra thin liquid composite heat insulating coatings, for sample 1 [lambda]= 0. 086 W/(m [x] C), for sample 2 [lambda]= 0. 091 W/(m [x] C). We performed the measurement error calculation. The actual thermal conduction coefficient of the studied samples {{was higher than}} the declared one. The manufactures of liquid coatings might have used some "ideal" conditions when defining heat conductivity in the laboratory or the coefficient was obtained by means of theoretical solution of heat conduction problem in liquid composite insulating media. However, liquid insulating coatings are {{of great interest to}} builders, because they allow to warm objects of complex geometric shapes (<b>valve</b> <b>chambers,</b> complex assemblies, etc.), which makes them virtually irreplaceable. The proper accounting of heating qualities of paints will allow to avoid heat loss increase above the specified limits in insulated pipes with heat transfer materials or building structures, as well as protect them from possible thawing in the period of subzero weather...|$|R

50|$|Internally {{the fixed}} valve body is {{constructed}} as a cylinder, with the moving {{part of the}} valve within this as a piston. The conical valve {{is part of this}} piston. The piston is double-acting and splits the internal valve body in two, with water pressure on both sides. The upper side of the piston is larger, the full diameter of the piston, and is supplied with water through a throttling valve; normally adjusted and then left in position. The lower side of the piston is an annular space surrounding the moving valve body and maintained at the lower (Bernoulli) water pressure. The tip of the conical valve contains a small pilot valve, linking the upper chamber of the valve to the downstream drain below the valve. This pilot valve is controlled mechanically from outside the <b>valve</b> <b>chamber</b> and is the main control over the valve position.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{gridiron}} valves {{are used}} as secondary valves, they were commonly mounted on the inlet side of the <b>valve</b> <b>chamber</b> for the primary slide valve. They were driven by a separate valve gear, usually a separate eccentric set {{in advance of the}} main eccentric. When operating, the additional advance moves the gridiron valve to apply cut-off ahead of the main valve. To vary the expansion they provide, the stroke of the eccentric drive can be varied by an adjustable linkage. When this is adjusted to zero throw, the expansion valve remains fully open and the engine works without expansion. [...] Although the use of a secondary gridiron valve was an early technique, it also remained in service with increasingly sophisticated valves and actuation, throughout the history of stationary engines. McIntosh and Seymour engines used one driven by a cam and toggle arrangement that moved intermittently and stood still when open, giving precise timing, and independent adjustment of each valve movement.|$|E

50|$|The low-lying, {{rectangular}} and gable-roofed structures {{behind the}} Old Windmill Tower conceal Brisbane's first inground service reservoirs. The earlier smaller structure {{has a single}} gable roof, while the larger, later one is double-gabled. Excavated deep into {{the crest of the}} hill, the disused reservoirs comprise two box-form structures divided into compartments by high arched baffle walls, cast-iron inlet and outlet, <b>valve</b> <b>chambers</b> and pits, and main, outlet and scour pipes. Built of brick before the age of concrete, this type of construction was necessary to withstand external pressure, while the inside walls were rendered to obviate ground water infiltration. The corrugated iron roofs with ample ventilation right along the raised ridges, timber-louvered gables and doorways to descending iron ladders were added later, and evidently painted in contrasting coloured stripes as was the fashion. The service reservoirs, which were built to store water from the Enoggera Dam and improve pressure within the city, played a most important role in Brisbane's first reticulated gravity supply system for the best part of a century.|$|R
