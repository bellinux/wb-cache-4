2500|$|In {{separate}} incidents {{during the}} storm and flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy {{on the night of}} October 29, 2012, one Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid and 16 Fisker Karmas caught fire while being parked at Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal. The vehicles were partially submerged by flash floods caused by the hurricane. In the case of the Toyota's incident, a Prius PHV burned and two other Priuses, a conventional hybrid and a plug-in, just smoldered. A Toyota spokeswoman said the fire “likely started because saltwater got into the electrical system.” She also clarified that the incident affected only three cars out of the 4,000 Toyotas that were at the terminal during the storm, including more than 2,128 plug-in or hybrid models. Fisker Automotive spokesman said that the Karmas were not charging {{at the time of the}} fire and there were no injuries. After an investigation by Fisker engineers, witnessed by NHTSA representatives, the company said that the origin of the fire was [...] "residual salt damage inside a <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> submerged in seawater for several hours. Corrosion from the salt caused a short circuit in the unit, which led to a fire when the Karma's 12-Volt battery fed power into the circuit." [...] The company explained that Sandy's heavy winds spread that fire to other Karmas parked nearby, and also ruled out the vehicles' lithium-ion battery packs as a cause of, or a contributing factor to, the fire.|$|E

After a brief description of a worst-case predictor, the design of the optimzer is presented, which is the focus of the paper. The real-time ability is obbtained by an adapted modeling of the hybrid drive, which finally allows the application of linear optimizationin order to solve the optimal control problem.

The primary goal {{in the development of the}} software was conformity to EN 50128, the secondary goal is a cost-efficient process without sacrificing safety. To achieve these goals our method is based on formal techniques, but also designed to be easily applicable in our con-text (pragmatics). Central to our method are functional trees as a design specification mechanism. The outcome of employing this method was the successful certification of the locomotive G 6 without any software-related problems. ...|$|E
