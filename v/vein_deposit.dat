40|$|A {{case study}} on {{drainage}} from polymetallic <b>vein</b> <b>deposits</b> in the world-class Coeur d’Alene mining district in northern Idaho is presented. The initial discussion focuses on our conceptual geoenvironmental model for these deposits, and then proceeds to examine the composition of waters, particularly those draining from adits and tailings piles within the district. The relative importance {{of the amount of}} reacting pyrite and carbonate minerals on drainage composition is discussed from a theoretical viewpoint and then compared with observed compositions from the district. Comparisons of drainage composition and reacting pyrite to carbonate ratios are made with diverse types of ore <b>deposits,</b> including polymetallic <b>vein</b> <b>deposits,</b> in Colorado and with polymetallic <b>vein</b> <b>deposits</b> in Nevada. The results indicate that drainage from polymetallic <b>vein</b> <b>deposits</b> has highly variable pH (i. e., acidic to basic) and concentrations of sulfate, metals, and arsenic. These observations are largely due to variable amounts and types of sulfide minerals and predicted ratios of reacting pyrite to carbonate minerals that range from near zero to just under 20 / 1. The dominant dissolved base metal in these waters is zinc (Zn) ...|$|R

5000|$|Vein {{deposits}} play {{a special}} {{role in the}} history of uranium: the term [...] "pitchblende" [...] ("Pechblende") originates from German vein deposits when they were mined for silver in the 16th century. F.E. Brückmann made the first mineralogical description of the mineral in 1727 and the <b>vein</b> <b>deposit</b> Jachymov in the Czech Republic became the type locality for uraninite. In 1789 the German chemist M. H. Klaproth discovered the element of uranium in a sample of pitchblende from the Johanngeorgenstadt <b>vein</b> <b>deposit.</b> The first industrial production of uranium was made from the Jachymov deposit and Marie and Pierre Curie used the tailings of the mine for their discovery of polonium and radium.|$|E

5000|$|The Kupol Gold Mine is a {{combination}} open-pit and underground gold mine, {{as well as a}} milling processing operation in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, in an area originally mined in the 1930s by prisoners of the Gulag. Bema Gold Corporation financed the $425-million project through various international banks, agencies, and equipment companies, plus the Chukotka government. Kinross acquired the property (at the time 75% of the mine) through the acquisition of Bema Gold, and a subsidiary (Chukotka Mining & Geological Company) purchased the remaining 25% from the government (via the State Unitary Enterprise of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug) in 2011.

5000|$|When alacranite {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1970 by Clark, it {{was associated with}} barite and calcite veins in the Alacran silver mine. [...] They also assumed that the mineral was identical to the species occurring in the Ag-As-Sb <b>vein</b> <b>deposit</b> at Alacran due to the similarity of its X-ray diffraction powder pattern. [...] They discovered that alacranite {{was similar to the}} high-temperature α polymorph of As4S4 in X-ray characteristics. In addition, alacranite was considered as realgar-like mineral. After that, they reported the composition of alacranite as As8S9 when they noticed another occurrence of Alacranite in Uzon Caldera associated with realgar and uzonite as cement in sandy gravels. They reported the composition of alacranite to be As8S9 regarding to the electron-microprobe analyses. When they analyzed a mineral during seafloor sampling consisting of red and orange arsenic sulfides by X-ray diffraction, a mixture of realgar and alacranite was resulted and it was noticed that the mineral was identical to synthetic β-As4S4 supposed that the original chemical formula of alacranite (As8S9) was incorrect. They argued that it is identical to alacranite because of the similarity of the physical properties and the unit-cell dimensions but further studies argue that it is different with respect to chemical formula and unit-cell volume. [...] The chemistry of the average of four analyses in Uzon caldera, Russia corresponding to alacranite results in 67.35% arsenic and 32.61% sulfur resulting in a total of 99.96%, yielding the formula As7.98S9.02, ideally As8S9.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} composition of native gold and electrum from auriferous vein and gold-silver vein de-posits in Japan has been analyzed and summarized. The Ag/Au ratios of native gold and electrum {{from these two}} types of deposits are distinct, i. e., 10 - 20 Ag at % (auri-ferous vein) and 30 - 70 Ag at % (gold-silver vein). Thermo-chemical calculations uggest hat the Ag/Au ratio of native gold and electrum should decrease with increasing chloride concentration and temperature. This is consistent with analytical results of native gold and electrum and fluid inclusion studies. Based on the Ag content of native gold and electrum, the Fe content of sphalerite, and the estimated temperatures, it is deduced that the sulfur activity for auriferous vein-type systems was lower than that of gold-silver vein-type systems. The two types of gold <b>vein</b> <b>deposits</b> occurring in Japan are "auriferous veins in sedimentary terrain " and "gold-silver veins in volcanic terrain " according to the classification by Boyle (1979, 1984). In this paper these deposits are called auriferous vein and gold-silver <b>vein</b> <b>deposits,</b> respectively. There are distinct differences in the characteristics of these two deposit ypes. For instance, the gold-silver vein de-posits occur mainly in Tertiary/Quaternary volcanic re-gions while the auriferous <b>vein</b> <b>deposits</b> occur in sedimen-tary terrain associated with Cretaceous felsic plutonic activity or in regionally metamorphosed rocks (Fig. 1). Common opaque minerals from the gold-silver veins are electrum, argenitite, Ag sulfosalts (pyrargyrite, polybasite), sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and galena. Native gold...|$|R
40|$|A {{historic}} gold {{mining district}} in northeastern California {{has not been}} incorporated into the global knowledge base for precious metal <b>vein</b> <b>deposits.</b> This study collected various data types which are important characteristics in the classification and understanding of <b>vein</b> <b>deposits.</b> The High Grade District (HGD) is a gold mining site located in {{the northeast corner of}} Modoc County, California, in the Warner Mountains. The Warner Mountains are composed of Tertiary eruptive centers, cropping out between valleys formed through extensional tectonics. Mineralization of the HGD displays abundant silicification, adularia, and gold; these characteristics are sufficient to classify mineralization as low-sulfidation epithermal and warrants exploration activities to test models of this specific type. This study integrates local field mapping and hard-rock sampling with numerous laboratory methods to characterize the mineralizing system and test the classic epithermal model. ^ 390 rock samples were collected and geologic maps were constructed. Rock samples are analyzed for elemental abundances, fluid inclusion studies, thin/polished section microscopy, and electron microprobe analyses were performed. Geochemical results were processed statistically with JMP software, surfaces modeled in Golden Software 2 ̆ 7 s Surfer, and visually interpreted in ArcGIS. This study constrains the timing of mineralization with Ar 40 /Ar 39 dates and generates a data set of δ 18 O values in the HGD. This new knowledge base can be used to guide later economic and scientific endeavors to better understand the mineralization encountered in the HGD. The addition of data from this study to the global knowledge base, surrounding epithermal <b>vein</b> <b>deposits,</b> makes our collective scientific understanding of this topic more complete. ...|$|R

The Rea and Samatosum deposits occur within an overturned metasedimentary sequence of sericitized and silicified argillites structurally overlain by mafic volcaniclastic rocks and flows.

40|$|A {{group of}} {{minerals}} {{typical of the}} oxidation zone of copper deposits was studied using chemical thermodynamics, mineral stability relationships, and petrography. It has been concluded that many processes, such as alteration, can be explained using thermodynamics and are compatible with natural relationships. A mineral assemblage consisting of basic carbonates of copper and zinc was investigated with carbon isotopes and mineral stability relationships. The results obtained are consistent with processes resulting from oxidation and leaching of a sulfide deposit followed by redeposition of copper and zinc in the zone of oxidation. Four processes have been suggested by which copper could be introduced into a near-surface environment from depth. Reactions which would occur under these conditions may result in formation of mesogene or hypogene malachite and chrysocolla.

40|$|Abstract: The calcite of the {{hydrothermal}} Surneshko Kladenche copper <b>vein</b> <b>deposit</b> {{from the}} Rossen ore field, Bulgaria, sometimes encloses peculiar filamentary pyrite crystals. Three successive calcite generations were observed {{belonging to a}} low-temperature (< 235 °C) carbonate paragenesis formed in open cavities of the ore veins after the main chalcopyrite mineralisation. Three generations of pyrite crystals are associated with these calcite crystals: pyrite 1, with [001] elongated columnar crystals which crystallised in open space; pyrite 2, in groups of long (up to 10 mm) sub-parallel tortuous filaments of varying thickness (3 - 20 µm) which are oriented nearly perpendicular to the surfaces of a transient w{ 3145 } scalenohedral calcite crystal zone; and pyrite 3,made of slightly elongated small crystals, located in the outermost v{ 2131 } zone of the same scalenohedral calcite crystals.
