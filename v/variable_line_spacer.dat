This paper shows the results of investigation considering covered cable and <b>line</b> <b>spacers.</b> By testing the polymeric material, the behaviour of the leakage current {{and the evolution of}} degradation were analysed, aiming the on-line monitoring of the leakage current of <b>line</b> <b>spacers...</b>|$|R

40|$|We apply a {{principal}} component analysis (PCA) to the spectra {{of each of the}} 18 Seyfert 1 -like objects observed more than 15 times by the international ultraviolet explorer (IUE) from 1978 until the end of 1991. PCA allows us to decompose the Lyff and C iv 1549 emission-lines of each object into two components with uncorrelated variations. We find that the principal component describes correlated continuum and line variations, whereas the rest component reveals the line-parts that do not vary in tune with the continuum. A cross-correlation analysis in NGC 5548 reveals that <b>variable</b> <b>line</b> features in the rest component follow the continuum by about 25 days. The symmetry usually observed in the component's line profiles excludes that the velocity field of the lineemitting region is dominated by radial motion.

Therefore, developing new OCR techniques for warped images or developing dewarping techniques are the possible solutions for improving OCR accuracy camera-captured documents.

Experimental results show that OCR error rate, from warped to dewarped documents, has been reduced from 5. 15 % to 1. 92 % on the dataset of CBDAR 2007 document image dewarping contest.
