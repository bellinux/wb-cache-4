The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, S=0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, S is {{on the order of}} 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase. The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, diamagnetism, birefringence, Raman scattering, NMR and EPR can be used to determine S.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with a numerical prediction of uncertainties in the macroscopic mechanical properties of microheterogeneous materials with uncertain microstructure. As a model material, solid foams are employed. The stochastic information on the uncertainty is gained in multiple numerical homogenization analyses of small-scale testing <b>volume</b> <b>elements.</b> The local relative density, the cell size distribution, the cell geometry and the spatial orientation of the testing <b>volume</b> <b>elements</b> are assumed to form {{the set of the}} relevant stochastic variables. Selected microstructural cases are analyzed for their macroscopic material response. Based on the probability distributions for the stochastic variables defining the microstructures of the testing <b>volume</b> <b>elements,</b> the probability distributions for the mesoscopic material properties are obtained. For the numerical homogenization of the testing <b>volume</b> <b>elements,</b> an enhanced finite element technique is employed, where the components of the macroscopic deformation gradient are introduced as generalized degrees of freedom. Assuming periodic boundary conditions, the global degrees of freedom interact with the conventional displacement degrees of freedom of the discretized microstructure via special boundary coupling elements. The mesoscopic stresses are obtained in a rather efficient manner as the generalized reaction forces for the global degrees of freedom...|$|R

40|$|Nonparametric {{estimation}} of mutual information {{is used in}} a wide range of scientific problems to determine the dependence between variables. The k-nearest neighbor (knn) methods are consistent, and therefore expected to work well for large sample size. These methods use geometrically regular local <b>volume</b> <b>elements.</b> This practice allows maximum localization of the <b>volume</b> <b>elements,</b> but can also induce a bias due to a poor description of the local geometry of the underlying probability measure. We introduce a new class of knn estimators that we call geometric knn estimators (g-knn), which use more complex local <b>volume</b> <b>elements</b> to better model the local geometry of the probability measures. As an example of this class of estimators, we develop a g-knn estimator of entropy and mutual information based on elliptical <b>volume</b> <b>elements,</b> capturing the local stretching and compression common to a wide range of dynamical systems attractors. In a series of numerical examples, this g-knn estimator of mutual information outperforms the Kraskov-Stögbauer-Grassberger (KSG) estimator both when the joint distribution is thinly supported, and when sample sizes are small. In particular, the examples suggest that the g-knn estimators can be of particular relevance to applications in which the system is large but data size is limited...|$|R
