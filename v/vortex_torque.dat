40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the drift {{precision}} of air supported gyroscope, effects of surface roughness magnitude and direction on <b>vortex</b> <b>torque</b> of air supported gyroscope are studied. Based on Christensen's rough surface stochastic model and consistency transformation method, Reynolds equation of air supported gyroscope containing surface roughness information is established. Also effects of mathematical models of main machining errors on <b>vortex</b> <b>torque</b> are established. By using finite element method, the Reynolds equation is solved numerically and the <b>vortex</b> <b>torque</b> {{in the presence of}} machining errors and surface roughness is calculated. The results show that surface roughness of slit has a significant effect on <b>vortex</b> <b>torque.</b> Transverse surface roughness makes <b>vortex</b> <b>torque</b> greater, while longitudinal surface roughness makes <b>vortex</b> <b>torque</b> smaller. The maximal difference approaches 11. 4 % during the range analyzed in this article. However surface roughness of journal influences <b>vortex</b> <b>torque</b> insignificantly. The research is of great significance for designing and manufacturing air supported gyroscope and predicting its performance...|$|E

By relating the coefficients of some of the terms in the asymptotic expansion of the stream function to the force components and the torque on the combined system, together with the imposition of integral constraints, enable the boundary element method to provide a closed system of equations. Our numerical results agree with all the available analytical ones. Key–Words: boundary element method, creeping flow, elliptical cylinder, <b>vortex,</b> <b>torque.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|We {{investigate}} analytically and numerically nonlinear <b>vortex</b> spin <b>torque</b> oscillator {{dynamics in}} a circular magnetic nanodot induced by a spin-polarized current perpendicular to the dot plane. We use a generalized nonlinear Thiele equation including spin-torque term by Slonczewski for describing the nanosize vortex core transient and steady orbit motions and analyze nonlinear contributions to all forces in this equation. Blue shift of the nano-oscillator frequency increasing the current is explained {{by a combination of}} the exchange, magnetostatic, and Zeeman energy contributions to the frequency nonlinear coefficient. Applicability and limitations of the standard nonlinear nano-oscillator model are discussed.|$|R
40|$|Frequency {{modulation}} {{experiments were}} performed on a spin <b>torque</b> <b>vortex</b> oscillator {{for a wide range}} of modulation frequency, up to 10 % of the oscillator frequency. A thorough analysis of the intermodulation products shows that the key parameter that describes these experiments is the deviation sensitivity, which is the dynamical frequency-current dependence. It differs significantly from the oscillator tunability discussed so far in the context of spin-transfer oscillators. The essential difference between these two concepts is related to the response time of the vortex oscillator, driven either in quasi-steady state or in a transient regime.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 This work is an investigation, {{through direct}} {{numerical}} simulation, of the gas-phase dynamics of small circular pool fires. The objectives are: {{to determine the}} mechanisms that contribute to vortex formation and their relative magnitude as dependent upon the Froude and Reynolds number, the frequency response of the flame as dependent upon the Froude and Reynolds number; and to determine the diameter limit of the axisymmetric assumption by formulating a local Reynolds number. The parametric range investigated is 10 - 4 ≤ Fr ≤ 10 - 2 and 10 ≤ Re ≤ 10 2. The effect of heat release rate, flame temperature, fuel molecular weight and air-fuel ratio on the vortex formation mechanisms is also investigated. The vortical formation mechanisms include baroclinic torque, density gradient/gravity interaction, stratified shear layers, and density inversion. Stratified shear layers and density inversion are investigated by formulating a kinetic energy of fluctuation equation and evaluating the pertinent production terms. Time-averaged, as well as Favre-averaged, spatially integrated values are obtained {{as a function of}} elevation. The flow is modeled as axisymmetric, and an infinitely fast chemical reaction, thin-flame sheet model is used along with a low Mach number approximation. The time-dependent governing equations are solved in axisymmetric coordinates with an explicit, projection-based algorithm. The results indicate that radial density gradients interacting with gravity and unstable density stratification are the dominant mechanisms effecting <b>vortex</b> formation. Baroclinic <b>torque</b> is also significant. The net effect of shear is to provide stability, though local areas exist which are destabilizing. Local regions of stabilizing density stratification also occur. The Froude number, Reynolds number, heat release rate, flame temperature, fuel molecular weight and air-fuel ratio effect the investigated flame dynamics. The Froude number is the dominant parameter effecting the investigated vortex generation mechanisms. An approximate critical local Reynolds number can be identified for which an axisymmetric model is valid. Using available experimental evidence, this value as been found to be around 3000. It is concluded, for this range that an axisymmetric, single-step, irreversible, reaction model with finite rate chemistry is capable of capturing essential features of the gas-phase of small pool fires...|$|R
