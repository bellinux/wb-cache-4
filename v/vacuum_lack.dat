40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of nonperturbative fields on instantons in quantum chromodynamics is studied. Effective action for instanton is derived in bilocal approximation {{and it is}} demonstrated that stochastic background gluon fields are responsible for IR stabilization of instantons. It is shown that instanton size in QCD is of order of 0. 25 fm. Comparison of obtained instanton size distribution with lattice data is made. 1. Instantons were introduced in 1975 by Polyakov and coauthors [1]. These topologically nontrivial field configurations are essential for the solution of some problems of quantum chromodynamics. Instantons allow to explain anomalous breaking of U(1) A symmetry and the η ′ mass [2, 3], spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (SCSB) [4]. Taking into account instantons is of crucial importance for many phenomena of QCD (see [5] and references therein). At the same time, there is a number of serious problems in instanton physics. The first is IR inflation of instanton, i. e. divergence of integrals over instanton size ρ at big ρ. Second, quasiclassical instanton anti-instanton <b>vacuum</b> <b>lack...</b>|$|E
30|$|Construction of micro- and {{nanoscale}} semiconductor {{materials with}} special size, morphology, and hierarchy has attracted considerable attention for potential application {{due to their}} distinctive functions, novel properties, and potential applications in advanced devices and biotechnologies[1, 2]. Rational control over the experimental condition has become a hot topic in recent material research fields. ZnO is currently {{one of the most}} attractive semiconducting materials for optical and electronic applications because of its direct wide band gap (3.37 eV) and high exciton binding energy (60 meV)[3]. Since Yang observed the room temperature UV lasing from ZnO nanorod arrays[4], much effort has been devoted to tailor the morphology and size to optimize the optical properties. As a result, various ZnO nanostructures, including nanowires[5 – 7], nanotubes[8, 9], nanobelts[10], nanoflowers[11], nanospheres[12], nanobowls[13], dandelions[14], cages[15], and shells[16, 17] have been obtained by solid-vapor phase growth[18], microemulation[19], and hydrothermal methods[20, 21]. Hereunto, nanobowls, nanocups, or nanodishes have attracted much interest because they have been envisaged to further contain nanoparticles[22] and immobilize biomolecules[23, 24]. Although conventional methods can produce various ZnO micro-/nanostructures, these different synthesis methods often greatly suffer from problems of high temperature, need for high <b>vacuum,</b> <b>lack</b> of control, and high cost. To develop a simple, fast, and controllable synthetic route that can not only control the ZnO micro-/nanostructures with series of shapes under ambient condition, but also produce the hierarchical structure, remains an important topic of investigation.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 40 - 43). In many of {{the small}} communities of South Africa's West Coast, the economic driver has traditionally been the fishing industry. Employment opportunities were largely located either on board the vessels or in a fish-processing factory which in some smaller centres was a monopsonistic employer. The last two decades have seen this system under threat. Fish stocks have declined and fish populations have move southward, while the fishing industry has been restructured to meet BEE imperatives, meaning that old established firms found their quotas even further decreased. To cut costs, fishing companies shed jobs and in extreme cases shut down their smaller operations. As they left the smaller centres they took with them their managerial skills, as well as capital and employment. The fishermen and women in these towns, have {{found it difficult to}} fill the <b>vacuum,</b> <b>lacking</b> as they do, organisation, access to credit, administrative and marketing skills, and above all critical information related to the process of issuing fishing rights (Isaacs, 2006, 57), (Amason & Kashorte, 2006, 48). The decline of the West Coast fisheries was latterly accompanied by the extension of the permit process; access to the resource being restructured initially in a 'medium term' and then in a long term rights application process. Those fishermen who were unsuccessful in acquiring access rights were trapped in a cycle of poverty and increasingly forced to fish illegally or 'poach' to survive. The decline of the stock means that there are no simple answers to the problem, I argue however, that it would be beneficial for the South African Government to embark on a co-management programme with these fishing communities...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{provide an}} {{overview}} of issues raised by conducting {{research in the area of}} chronic childhood illness, using the example of childhood cancer. Methods: This literature review used informal methods. Results: Children with cancer and their families may participate in a wide variety of studies in different research traditions, including social science studies, epidemiological, biological and genetic research, and clinical trials. Different concerns about research participation have been raised in these different contexts. Sociological debate has tended to characterize exclusion from research as a manifestation of assumptions of poor competence on the part of children, and to see inclusion in research as a means of restoring proper balance in power relations and giving children a voice. The ethical imperative within clinical research, on the other hand, has been in favour of protection of individuals from risk or direct harm. Lack of consensus on issues such as the status of children’s consent for research participation persists, in part because debates have taken place within rather than across disciplinary boundaries, and in part because of a tendency to debate issues as ethical principles in an empirical <b>vacuum.</b> The <b>lack</b> of research on the experiences and views of those asked to take part in childhood cancer research is striking.

40|$|The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommission Commission (CRTC) is {{the body}} which regulates {{communications}} activity in Canada. It has become almost a cliche {{to say that in}} addition to simply formulating regulations, the Commission has also been the dominant policy-maker in the communications field. The allegation has been made that the CRTC is "out of control", usurping a policy-making role more properly exercised by elected government officials, while also defying their attempts to constrain its behaviour. It has further been argued that this Commission usurpation and defiance has meant that both the minister and Parliament have little or no influence to direct the agency. The study demonstrates that the Commission has often acted as a policy-maker but that this role has been in response to the existence of a policy <b>vacuum</b> and <b>lack</b> of leadership from elected government. Furthermore, the agency has assumed a policy-making role not through an act of usurpation but with the tacit consent of elected officials. For these officials, the CRTC performs a useful function "insulating" them from the need to make a decision (and accept responsibility) on policy issues which often involve difficult political choices. The study also shows that the agency's "political masters", Cabinet and Parliament, possess a variety of both formal and informal control mechanisms which effectively prevent the CRTC from maintaining a policy position independent from government...|$|R
40|$|Tribocharging of {{particles}} {{is common in}} many processes including fine powder handling and mixing, printer toner transport and dust extraction. In a lunar environment with its high <b>vacuum</b> and <b>lack</b> of water, electrostatic forces are an important factor to consider when designing and operating equipment. Dust mitigation and management is critical to safe and predictable performance of people and equipment. The extreme nature of lunar conditions makes it difficult and costly to carry out experiments on earth which are necessary to better understand how particles gather and transfer charge between {{each other and with}} equipment surfaces. DEM (Discrete Element Modeling) provides an excellent virtual laboratory for studying tribocharging {{of particles}} as well as for design of devices for dust mitigation and for other purposes related to handling and processing of lunar regolith. Theoretical and experimental work has been performed pursuant to incorporating screened Coulombic electrostatic forces into EDEM, a commercial DEM software package. The DEM software is used to model the trajectories of large numbers of particles for industrial particulate handling and processing applications and can be coupled with other solvers and numerical models to calculate particle interaction with surrounding media and force fields. While simple Coulombic force between two particles is well understood, its operation in an ensemble of particles is more complex. When the tribocharging of particles and surfaces due to frictional contact is also considered, it is necessary to consider longer range of interaction of particles in response to electrostatic charging. The standard DEM algorithm accounts for particle mechanical properties and inertia as a function of particle shape and mass. If fluid drag is neglected, then particle dynamics are governed by contact between particles, between particles and equipment surfaces and gravity forces. Consideration of particle charge and any tribocharging and electric field effects requires calculation of the forces due to these effects...|$|R
40|$|Strong {{evidence}} {{supports the idea}} that pure q, 4 field theory is trivial (non-interacting) in four dimensions. In the context of perturbation theory when gauge fields or fermions are present the combined theory may become non-trivial for a limited range of values of the renormalized coupling constants. Calculable upper bounds on the masses of elementary Higgs particles are implied by the restrictions on these coupling constants. Other constraints (on, e. g. the number of fermions in the theory) are also implied. 1. Prolegomena The concept of particle mass generation by spontaneous symmetry breaking [1] {{has become one of}} the most useful mechanisms in elementary particle physics. One way symmetries may be broken in a quantum field theory is by the introduction of elementary scalar fields (i. e., by coupling the gauge fields of the theory to a Ca field theory). At the classical level these fields interact with themselves in such a fashion as to produce a <b>vacuum</b> state which <b>lacks</b> certain symmetries of the lagrangian. Gauge particles propagating in this asymmetric vacuum may then appear to be massive. It is generally assumed that no significant changes occur in this picture du...|$|R
40|$|Strong {{evidence}} {{supports the idea}} that pure q~ 4 field theory is "trivial " or non-interacting. Should such a situation persist when gauge fields are present, {{it is fair to}} question the idea of symmetry breaking (and gauge boson mass generation) by elementary scalars. An alternative possibility, suggested by the consideration of toy models, is that a consistent non-trivial theory may exist for only a select range of parameters, implying for example that the standard model Higgs mass may be bounded or calculable. In principle the Monte Carlo renormalization group can be used to examine this possibility. Here the formalism is elucidated and the results of the first calculation for the standard model are presented. 1. Prolegomena Over two decades ago it was suggested [1] that gauge particles could be rendered massive in a theory if elementary scalar particles exist. These scalars supposedly interact with themselves in such a fashion [2] as to generate a <b>vacuum</b> state which <b>lacks</b> a symmetry of the action.

These molds, mostly milled out of solid blocks of al-uminium, take long to produce and come at a high cost.

The goal {{of this research is}} the development and the technical and economical validation of faster producible, cheaper, and material and energy efficient molds based on plastically deformed metal sheets. Design guide-lines have been developed to ensure that (a) appropriate sheet metal forming techniques can be used, (b) the required structural stiffness is obtained and (c) the desired thermal pattern can be achieved. One technique in particular is considered to produce the deformed metal sheets, namely Single Point Incre-mental Forming (SPIF). This technique can produce generic, freeform shapes using a standard, spherical, CNC controlled tool and is characterized by its short lead times.

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{observations}} suggesting that {{structures in the}} Universe appear to be concentrated {{on the walls of}} bubbles that surround giant voids, we examine the possibility that the observed structure may have resulted from a first order phase transition that occured after inflation and which proceeded by quantum tunnelling and the formation of bubbles of true <b>vacuum.</b> Since we <b>lack</b> a fundamental theory of particle physics that would define the scalar field responsible for the second phase change and predict the scale of the resulting structures, we instead examine two similar parametrised forms for the potential motivated by the standard Higgs model, and attempt to determine values of the parameters that can reproduce the kind of structures that are observed through bubble wall collisions. The method deployed is quite general and can be applied to any phase transition that occured after inflation. It is found that although the shape of the required potential and its coupling can be determined, the epoch of the proposed second phase transition is in general not specified by the observed structures. The full verification or otherwise of our proposal will require not only a more detailed consideration of its predictions for the large scale structure of the Universe and its compatibility with the cosmic microwave background radiation but also the embedding of our ideas in a credible theory of particle physics beyond the Standard Model...|$|R

This research also tried to identify the comprehensiveness of the United Nations in covering these rights. The issue of illegitimate children has social, economic and educational dimensions, besides the negligence of Libyan law in implying special articles for this category of children. The purpose of this research is to identify the illegitimate children from the perspective of Libyan law and determine the rights of illegitimate children in the scope of the personal status law as well as the civil and social legislation. The research approach adopted in this dissertation is the documentary research where the data is obtained from books. The findings from this research provide evidence that: 1. the personal status of Libyan law prohibits non-marital relationship between men and women, and wasting the lineage certainty of the illegitimate children. 2. Proven paternity of a father is not subjected to any time restrictions on the contrary, the denial of lineage is encompassed by restrictions and timelines to ensure proven lineage. 3.
