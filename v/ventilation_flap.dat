50|$|The DWV built 120,000 Class A2 {{goods wagons}} from 1910 to 1927. These flat-roofed wagons were {{produced}} {{with and without}} hand brakes and in two variants of loading door and <b>ventilation</b> <b>flap.</b> One had a loading door and <b>ventilation</b> <b>flap</b> on each side; the other variant had two loading doors and two ventilation flaps per side. Later, most of the four-door variants were converted to two-door wagons as the extra doors were deemed superfluous. Vans with two ventilators were mainly used for transporting fruit and vegetables. The new raised brakeman's cab was given a gabled roof with a pointed ridge and handrails {{were added to the}} outside of the steps.|$|E
50|$|Identified as {{standard}} type C/T2, Block C retains important fabric that identifies {{it as an}} early Department of Public Works design. It is a high-set, timber-framed building with a northern and southern verandah and a gable roof. Four sets of timber stairs provide access to the verandahs and the northern verandah is connected to Block D to the east. The walls are clad with weatherboards and the roof with corrugated metal sheeting. Both the gable end walls have a panel of ventilating weatherboards. The verandah walls are single-skin, lined internally, with chamfered stud framing exposed externally. The verandah walls have a <b>ventilation</b> <b>flap</b> at floor level and retain original double leaf doors with pivoting fanlights. The southern verandah retains a hat room enclosure at its southern end. The interior is partitioned into two rooms connected by a large opening; this partition is not of cultural heritage significance. The interior walls and ceiling are lined with v-jointed tongue and groove timber boards. The ceiling is coved and has a latticed ventilation panel. Timber tie beams at cornice level are exposed in the space. The fenestration pattern remains intact with windows only in the eastern and western walls sheltered by original timber hoods with timber brackets and battened cheeks. The northern verandah is enclosed at the western end. A small teacher's room projects from both verandahs. A small enclosure of the northern verandah accommodates a store room that is not of cultural heritage significance.|$|E
50|$|Control of {{building}} design {{was transferred to}} the Department of Public Works in 1893 and the department's architects trialled a number of technical innovations. Queensland's education architecture became markedly more advanced and the range of standard building types increased. The most noticeable change in Queensland school architecture was the introduction of high-set buildings. This provided better ventilation as well as further teaching space and a covered play space underneath. Also, windows were rearranged and enlarged and sills were lowered to approximately 1m above floor level. By 1909 windows were altered so that the maximum amount of light came from one direction and desks were rearranged so that this light fell onto the left hand side of students. Since students were forcedly right-handed, no shadow would be cast onto the page. The wall supporting the blackboard had no windows. This often meant a complete transformation of the fenestration of existing older buildings. Dormers were sometimes added to the roof to provide better light and ventilation and the larger classrooms favoured in earlier designs were partitioned to create smaller ones with better lighting. Interiors became lighter and airier and met with immediate approval from educationalists. A technical innovation developed at this time was a continuous <b>ventilation</b> <b>flap</b> on the wall at floor level. This hinged board could be opened to increase air flow into the space and, combined with a ceiling vent and large roof fleche, improved internal air quality and decreased internal temperatures effectively. This type was introduced around 1909 and was constructed until approximately 1920. Significantly, Dr Eleanor Bourne was appointed the first Medical Inspector of Schools in 1911 and under her instruction the relationship between classroom environment and child health was given prominence. Accordingly, school architecture evolved through iteration and experimentation to improve interior light and ventilation.Such design innovations were included in a new building for the Boys' School at Bowen, constructed in 1917 {{to the west of the}} 1884 boys' building. Called the Big Room, it was a high-set timber building with a gable roof and a northerly and southerly verandah. It had a large number of windows in the gable end walls with sill heights approximately 1m from floor level. It incorporated a hinged board, ceiling vent, and large roof fleche for ventilation. The roof fleche was removed at some time prior to 2006. This building survives and in 2012 is named Block C.In 1919 an Honour Board memorialising 70 past students who served in World War I was installed in the Big Room and unveiled by the mayor in the presence of a crowded audience. The board took the form of a Grecian temple facade decorated to represent marble. It was claimed to be the largest in a North Queensland school, measuring 5 ft 6in wide by 6 ft high (1.67m x 1.82m). This board was moved to the Bowen Historical Museum some time after its installation although no evidence has been discovered as to when or why it was moved.|$|E
50|$|The new {{vehicles}} were a {{steel frame construction}} with a rounded roof and four double sliding doors for passengers on each side. There were also doors for the driver and escape doors at the non-driving ends. Instead of <b>ventilation</b> <b>flaps</b> in the windows, pressure ventilation was used. Each car had four motors of 100 kW each, rheostatic brakes and electrically controlled pneumatic brakes. Scharfenberg couplers were used, and the vehicles were equipped with multiple unit traction control.|$|R
50|$|Small vacuum motors {{were also}} used to operate {{windscreen}} wipers in automobiles. In this case, the motors were powered by manifold vacuum. This arrangement was not very satisfactory because, if the throttle were wide open, the wipers would slow down, or even stop. Modern automobiles use electrically powered wipers. Modern automobiles still use a vacuum motor of a kind, however, the vacuum servo. Brakes are operated by a hydraulic system, but they use a ‘vacuum motor’ to amplify the force provided by the driver. Small vacuum motors {{were also used}} from the late 1960s to control servomechanisms such as door locks, heater controls or movable bonnet <b>ventilation</b> <b>flaps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unable to {{introduce}} desired {{improvements to the}} SZD-41 Jantar Standard, SZD, under Władysław Okarmus' guidance, developed the SZD-48 Jantar Standard 2. Using the SZD-41B Jantar Standard as a basis, the SZD-48 utilized the same wings mounted higher on a new fuselage and incorporated several detail refinements, such as an increase of water ballast capacity from 100 litres to 150 litres. Production of the initial production version the SZD-48 Jantar Standard followed the first flight piloted by January Roman totalling 44. Soon superseded by the SZD-48-1 Jantar Standard 2 with small refinements including replacing the <b>ventilation</b> <b>flaps</b> with a single flap on the underside {{in front of the}} launch hook. First flight of the SZD-48-1 took place at Bielsko on 18 September 1978 again flown by January Roman, production of 285 SZD-48-1s followed.|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} of an advanced food storage system for private households is proposed. The air humidity inside this container {{can be changed}} by opening and closing a <b>ventilation</b> <b>flap</b> actuator. A capacity sensor {{is used for the}} measurement of the air humidity. The measurement of the temperature by a thermistor (NTC) serves the compensation of the temperature dependence of this humidity sensor. The signals of both sensors are converted by a switched-capacitor, switched-resistor interface. The frequency signals produced this way, which are proportional to air humidity and to temperature respectively are fed back to a microcontroller. Using these signals, the exact humidity in the container is calculated and compared with the desired humidity. The difference signal operates a controller that positions the <b>ventilation</b> <b>flap</b> {{on the front of the}} container. The SMT (surface mounted technology) version of the power management and the sensor-actuator-interface as well as a MST (micro system technology) component, which includes the sensors and the signal processing hardware around the microcontroller, are closer regarded and explained in detail...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} of an advanced food storage system for private households {{has been developed}} and realized. It is used in order to validate experiments, which acknowledge the fact that food remain fresh, if it is stored at certain humidity values. The design, development, and realization of the food container took place in several steps: the fundamental studies at an experimental model with a PC development environment by the IMA, the upgrading in surface mounted technology (SMT) by the indatec GmbH, the upgrading in micro system technology (MST) by the infratec GmbH, and the test of the total system by the IMA. To make the system energy-autonomous, it is supplied by solar cells. Due {{to the fact that}} the system is dependent on light a special power management and an energy-saving control algorithm have been designed and low power consuming components have been used.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley 16 foot Transonic Tunnel and in the static test facility of that tunnel {{to determine the effects}} of divergent <b>flap</b> <b>ventilation</b> of an axisymmetric nozzle on nozzle internal (static) and wind on performance. Tests were conducted at 0 deg angle of attack at static conditions and at Mach numbers from 0. 6 to 1. 2. Ratios of jet total pressure to free stream static pressure were varied from 1. 0 (jet off) to approximately 14. 0 depending on Mach number. The results of this study indicate that divergent <b>flap</b> <b>ventilation</b> generally provided large performance benefits at overexpanded nozzle conditions and performance reductions at underexpanded nozzle conditions when compared to the baseline (unventilated) nozzles. Ventilation also reduced the peak static and wind on performance levels...|$|R
50|$|Smoke <b>flap</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{is used on}} tipi (teepee') housing of the Native America Plains Indians by tradition, both {{historically}} and on modern ceremonial tipis. The tipi smoke flap vent is attached in a continuous piece to the cured hides that cover {{the exterior of the}} large teepee housing structure. In the summer months the vent may remain open to a view of the night sky and to harmonize with the warm temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the extent and incidence of opaque bubble layer (OBL) using laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) flaps created with the Alcon/WaveLight ® FS 200 femtosecond laser as a result of a recent change in flap programming parameters aiming to reduce further the incidence and extent of OBL. Methods: Intraoperative digital images of flaps from 36 consecutive patients (72 eyes) subjected to bilateral femtosecond-assisted LASIK were analyzed using a proprietary computerized technique. The incidence and extent of OBL was measured and reported as a percentage of the entire flap area. Flap creation was performed with a 1. 7 mm wide canal, implemented as an updated design intended to reduce the extent of OBL (group A). The same OBL parameters were investigated and compared in an age-matched and procedure-matched patients in whom the previous standard setting of a 1. 3 mm wide canal was implemented (group B). Results: In group A, the average extent of OBL was 3. 69 % of the flap area (range 0 %– 11. 34 %). In group B, the respective values were 6. 06 % (range 0 %– 20. 24 %). We found the difference to be statistically significant (one-tailed P = 0. 00452). Conclusion: This study suggests that there is a significant reduction in the incidence and extent of OBL when novel LASIK <b>flap</b> <b>ventilation</b> canal parameters of width and spot line separation are used...|$|R
