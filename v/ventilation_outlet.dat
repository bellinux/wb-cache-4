2500|$|Poor {{construction}} {{quality was}} apparent {{even in the}} company's press department fleet. The British magazine Motor published a road test of an automatic 3500 in January 1977, and while keen to highlight the Rover's general excellence, they also reported that the test car suffered from poor door seals, with daylight visible from inside past the rear door window frame's edge {{on the left side}} of the car, and a curious steering vibration at speed which might (or might not) have resulted from the car's front wheels not having been correctly balanced. Disappointment was recorded that the <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet</b> directly in front of the driver appeared to be blocked, delivering barely a breeze even when fully open; the writer had encountered this problem on one other Rover 3500, although he had also driven other cars of the same type with an abundant output of fresh air through the vent in question. Nevertheless, in March 1977, Britain's Autocar was able to publish an article by Raymond Mays – a famous racing driver and team manager during (in particular) the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s – in which Mays explained why, after driving it for 12,000miles, he considered his Rover 3500 was [...] "the best car he [...] ever had", both for its many qualities as a driver's car and for its excellent fuel economy even when driven hard. Similar ventilation problems persisted until 1980 and were reported in tests of the V8-S version.|$|E

This display featured digital trip functions such as distance to destination, average speed, estimated arrival time and adjustable speed warning settings, cycled through and set by pressing several buttons and retaining the R (reset) and INFO button for the instrument cluster. When fitted, the automatic climate control (as opposed to simple air conditioning) showed the selected temperature on green LEDs on the ACC unit fitted in the centre console in degrees C or F, selected by a nearby slide switch. Heated rear window (repeated on the main instrument cluster), heated door mirrors, <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet</b> selections (including rear side window demist) and ACC mode were also indicated on the ACC unit by green LEDs next to the selector buttons (orange for the electrically heated items). Audio functions were displayed on the head unit, also in the centre console, such as FM Radio Station Name where RDS was available (otherwise just the Radio Frequency) on a green LCD. CD track info was similarly displayed on the console mounted single CD player, where fitted, on its own green LCD. The 9000 SID was not noted for pixel failures since it appears not to be LCD based.

40|$|Correct {{definition}} of boundary conditions {{is crucial for}} the appropriate simulation of a flow. It is a common practice that simulation of sufficiently long upstream entrance section is performed instead of experimental investigation of the actual conditions at the boundary of the examined area, in {{the case that the}} measurement is either impossible or extremely demanding. We focused on the case of a benchmark channel with <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet,</b> which models a regular automotive ventilation system. At first, measurements of air velocity and turbulence intensity were performed at the boundary of the examined area, i. e. in the rectangular channel 272. 5 mm upstream the <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet.</b> Then, the experimentally acquired results were compared with results obtained by numerical simulation of further upstream entrance section defined according to generally approved theoretical suggestions. The comparison showed that despite the simple geometry and general agreement of average axial velocity, certain difference was found {{in the shape of the}} velocity profile.

30|$|The {{generated}} {{pure water}} is exhausted with the residual air {{and a small}} fraction of formation heat through the “air outlet” pipe. The formation heat of the PEMFC power module is so large that the cooling subsystem is necessary to reject the redundant heat {{in order to maintain the}} optimal operating temperature of the PEMFC stack. The cooling subsystem consists of the primary and secondary radiators which reside in the lower left and lower middle sections of the power plant, respectively. The secondary radiator is applied for heat transfer of the stack condenser that is used to insure that enough process water be made available at all time for air humidification. The primary radiator will suck air and exhaust it through the shutter of the locomotive framework. Under normal conditions, the leaked hydrogen will be exhausted through the <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet</b> of the PEMFC stack module, and the ventilation fans located on the upper side of the locomotive will assist in precluding confinement of any accidentally leaked hydrogen.|$|E

The second approach rests on the experimental measurement of the section closer to the area of interest. The experimental measurement provides velocity profile and in addition turbulent intensity compared to the first approach where only a velocity profile can be computed according to known volumetric flow rate. A simplified model of car <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet</b> was chosen as a test case. The model consists of circular and rectangular duct, area of interest (closing flap, vertical slats and horizontal slats) and outlet box. We have compared the two mentioned inlet boundary approaches for two distinct values of volumetric flow rate for which the experimental data of the section upstream of the area of interest are available. The velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy profiles downstream of the area of interest were chosen as comparative characteristics...|$|E
40|$|At {{the outlet}} of the HVCA systems, {{whistling}} can occur, due to self-sustained oscillations. In this study, the <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet</b> is modelled by a free plane subsonic jet impinging on a slotted plate, leading to self-sustained tones production; this configuration {{is known as}} the jet-slot oscillator. The tone's frequency can be predicted through the vortex dynamics within the flow. For jet velocities higher than 16 m/s, the tones couple with the flow-supply-duct’s resonances. These resonances control the vortex dynamics and reinforce the sound production, of about 20 dB. Moreover, when the distance from the jet exit to the plate is increased and reaches 4. 5 times the jet height, the fundamental frequency of the tones is suddenly halved due to some vortex pairing occurring {{at the end of the}} potential core of the jet. In this paper, the vortex pairing is observed with three different experimental techniques. Firstly, comparison between the radiated and the in-duct acoustic fields is conducted. Then the energy transfer from the fundamental to the sub-harmonics of the shear layer's velocity fluctuations is observed with anemometric measurements. Finally high speed flow visualizations are performed and allow to link the vortex impingement on the plate to the sound production...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiological}} {{impact of}} emissions of radioactive substances from accelerator facilities {{is characterized by}} a dominant contribution of the external exposure from short-lived radionuclides in the plume. <b>Ventilation</b> <b>outlets</b> of accelerator facilities are often at low emission heights and receptors reside very close to stacks. Simplified exposure models are not appropriate and integration of the dose kernel over the radioactive plume is required. By using Monte Carlo integration with certain biasing, the integrand can be simplified substantially and an optimum spatial resolution can be achieved. Moreover, long-term releases can be modeled by sampling real weather situations. The mathematical formulation does not depend on any particular atmospheric dispersion model and the applicable code parts can be designed separately, which is another advantage. The obtained results agree within ± 10 % with results calculated for the semi-infinite cloud model by using detailed particle transport codes and human phantoms...|$|R

30|$|Soiling {{outdoors}} is popularly {{associated with}} black stains on faades, while soiling indoors is mostly {{associated with the}} deposition of household dust, i.e. coarse particles. In effect, experimental and observational studies are markedly biased towards outdoor blackening and indoor dust, perhaps due to the experimental difficulties of discerning different particle sizes of indoor deposits, especially the smallest. However, {{it is not difficult}} to find examples of well visible deposition of fine combustion particles. Some notable examples are found at induction and <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlets</b> [117] or on the murals of a palace in Padova, where inconveniently placed radiators were causing heavy soiling by dust and soot [118]. The darkening in the centre of the murals in Michelozzo’s Courtyard, Florence, Italy, has been attributed to deposition of traffic-generated particles, since measurements of P M 2.5 display a high proportion of organic and elemental carbon [18]. In some occasions, the damage layers related to the deposition of combustion particles are related to the past use of the building, and not to modern traffic emissions e.g. in the Buddhist statues of the Yunguang Grottoes, China [119].|$|R
40|$|Passenger {{comfort in}} a {{personal}} vehicle cabin strongly depends on the appropriate function of the cabin ventilation system. Great attention is therefore paid to the effective functioning of the automotive vents. Various techniques can be employed to evaluate the proper formation of the flow behind the <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet.</b> Constant Temperature Anemometry (CTA) was used in our case for accurate measurement of the velocity field and consequent assessment of jet boundaries and jet axis. A novel methodology has been developed for the simulation of realistic conditions when using just a single vent under laboratory conditions instead of the complete vehicle ventilation system. A special technique has also been developed for determination of the terminal inclination angles of vent vanes for the particular vent type, which can be completely closed by the adjustable horizontal vanes. A two wire CTA probe was used for measurement of the actual velocity over predefined planes, which were specified according to smoke visualization. Mean velocities and the turbulence intensity were evaluated {{on the basis of}} the obtained data and are presented in a form of charts. Both jet boundary and orientation of the jet for a given setup of the vent are important characteristics of particular vent type.

40|$|In {{ventilation}} systems, disturbing whistlings {{can occur}} at outlets. This whistling phenomenon {{belongs to the}} self-sustained tones class which can be produced when a low velocity flow impinges on a downstream obstacle. The coupling of the tones with acoustic resonances (so-called indirect feedback path) can promote high-level harmonic noises. This experimental study deals with the coupling of a jet-slot oscillator, modelling a <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet,</b> with the flow supply duct resonances. The flow supply duct is damped by using various amounts of acoustic damping foam, {{and the effect of}} this damping on the sound production is studied. It is shown that for a jet exit/obstacle distance higher than 2. 5 jet height (L/H> 2. 5), the tone’s frequency matches satisfactorily with frequencies predicted by a model describing favourable phase relationships for the occurrence of tones along the feedback loop. When the flow supply duct is resonant, it is noticeable that the tone’s frequency occurs at a duct resonance frequency which is close to the frequency described by this model. For lower values of L/H (slot closer to the jet exit), a better knowledge of the convection velocity behaviour along the vortices path could improve the tone’s frequency prediction. The use of damping foam within the flow supply duct prevents the occurrence of the tones’ coupling with a duct resonance, especially with high amounts of damping material, and dramatically reduces the emitted acoustic levels. For moderate amounts of damping material, the suppression of coupling occurs only for higher flow speeds, as the tone’s frequencies are higher and the damping material is then more efficient...|$|E
40|$|Ventilation is {{important}} because it affects indoor environmental conditions, including air pollutant concentrations that may modify the health of the occupants of a building, or their perceptions and comfort. This paper reports, first of all, on field studies monitoring indoor overnight CO 2 levels and outdoor ventilation rates in bedrooms employing room air conditioners (RACs), so the current situation of ventilation in actual high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong can be appreciated. This is followed by a report of the results of laboratory experiments where two typical RACs were used in an examination of outdoor air ventilation characteristics in rooms employing RACs. The results of field studies showed that the outdoor ventilation rates in the measured bedrooms equipped with RACs in high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong could not meet the ventilation requirement specified in the ASHRAE standard 62 - 2001 even if there was only one occupant in a bedroom. Although the use ofa window-type air conditioner (WRAC) may provide a higher outdoor ventilation rate than the use of a split-type air conditioner (SARC), this may be ascribed to the fact there is more natural infiltration when a WRAC is used. The ventilation damper currently available in a WRAC does not significantly affect the outdoor ventilation rate. Therefore, such a damper cannot be expected to provide the ventilation rate as required by a ventilation code and its intended function of controlling ventilation is limited. In addition, the air exhausted from indoors to outdoors through the <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet</b> in a WRAC is air that has just been cooled by the cooling coil (evaporator). This is unreasonable, because exhausting just-cooled and dehumidified air is a waste of energy. Therefore, an improved design for a WRAC has been suggested. Finally, the outdoor ventilation requirement for bedrooms at nighttime, when occupants are asleep, is discussed. A new ventilation rate of 3. 0 l/s per person for the sleeping environment in high-rise residential buildings is proposed. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

A split plot experimental design was used to evaluate the effect of outlet shape, outlet size, and distance from the fan on discharge coefficient.

Discharge coefficient values measured ranged from 0. 19 to 1. 25 depending on the aperture ratio and distance from the fan. Outlet shape had no significant effect. The apparent effects of aperture ratio and size are due to the effects of head ratio.

Induction was with fentanyl/propofol and maintenance was with sevoflurane 2. 5 % in oxygen/air. The airway device was removed when the patients were awake and the patients were transferred to the postanaesthesia care unit 10 min later. Air was sampled from a point 1. 5 m above the floor at a location remote from the <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet</b> and analysed using a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer capable of continuous trace gas analysis at the parts per billion volume (ppbv) level. The concentration of sevoflurane was recorded every minute during three consecutive phases: for 5 min before the introduction of sevoflurane (background); after introduction of sevoflurane until removal of the airway device (intra-operative); and every minute after removal until the concentration returned to background levels. Median (interquartile range [range]) intra-operative sevoflurane concentrations were 200 - 400 times higher than background values for the laryngeal mask airway 1 (1 - 2 [0 - 3]) ppbv vs. 404 (278 - 523 [83 - 983]) ppbv, respectively, and the tracheal tube 2 (1 - 3 [0 - 5]) ppbv vs. 396 (204 - 589 [107 - 1735]) ppbv (both p < 0. 0001), and returned to background values within 5 min of removal. There were no differences in sevoflurane concentration between devices intra-operatively or after removal. The performance of the proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer was identical at the start {{and end of the}} 30 -day study. We conclude that peri-operative sevoflurane concentration in a modern operating theatre is similar for the laryngeal mask airway and the uncuffed tracheal tube in paediatric patients receiving intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Intra-operative sevoflurane concentrations are five times lower than occupational safety limit requirements, and 1000 times lower 5 min after removal of the airway device with the patient awake.

40|$|A {{review on}} {{nosocomial}} infection {{has shown that}} there are various compelling {{evidence to suggest that}} the role of the airborne route to infection in a multi-bed environment cannot be ignored. Expiratory activities such as coughing, sneezes, talking and patient-centric activities such as bed-making has been shown in literature to generate significant quantity of infectious quanta that may become airborne and pose an infection threat to vulnerable patients. In this study, an airborne infection route of MRSA in the health care environment has been investigated using both the large-eddy simulation (LES) technique and an infection modeling. From analyzing flow field regimes in both a single room (typically found in isolation wards) and multi-bed ward environments, it was observed that the supply air delivered into the ventilated space produces pockets of recirculation areas near the walls and midway of the room {{in the wake of the}} advancing <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlet</b> bound flows, after impinging on internal surfaces such as beds. These recirculation areas have been identified as hot spots for possible airborne infection. Furthermore, the results suggests that the further the outlet vent is away from the inlet vent, the more likely will be the generation of recirculation regions, which directly translate to poor ventilation spots and that the use of curtains within the vicinity of the aerosol generating activities increases the number of recirculation areas. The overall airflow analysis suggest that any engineering solution designed to limit or remove the recirculation regions from the flow regime will be an effective way of fighting cross infections within the hospital ward environment, and as such ventilation schemes that are optimally designed to achieve this should be encouraged and investigated. This study has also predicted the possibility of a secondary infection in a multiward environment using various modeling approaches. The results obtained indicated that the posture of an infected person involved in the release of pathogens in relation to cohorts can have a profound effect on infection rates within the ward environment. The study of the coughing episode with the patient lying on the side generated a unit secondary infection, whilst the same simulated episode with an adjacent curtain in position failed to generate a secondary infection within the exposure period. The activity of bed making was also found to generate a secondary infection over the duration of the simulation, suggesting that bed-making can be a potential source of infection. The particle concentration decay curves examined in this work equally suggest that patients are at their most vulnerable state at the initial stages of coughing/sneezes, and talking episodes where the infecting patient assumes a directly facing posture to the susceptible...|$|E
40|$|This paper elaborates {{on how to}} use {{statistics}} to calculate optimal parameters (including duct diameters) of energy-efficient industrial ventilation systems. Based on the fan-law, on-demand ventilation can save up to 80 % of electricity compared to classical systems.

There are multiple design and operational challenges to successfully implementing an on-demand system. Several of these challenges and their solutions are described in this paper. The basic idea behind on-demand ventilation is to close <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlets</b> at workstations that are not producing dust (or fumes or mist) and adjust the fan speed accordingly. It is easy to implement such a system if there is no requirement for minimum transport velocities in the ducting, {{as is the case in}} fume collection systems (such as welding shops).

Similar bioaerosol size distributions were observed between <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlets</b> and subway platform air. During off-peak hours, subway bioaerosols had similar size distributions with the outside air. Sequence results revealed {{a vast array of}} airborne microbial species which varied from one station to another, but with Aspergillus spp. as dominant fungal species, and Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas as primary bacterial genera including human opportunistic ones. Our results provide direct online observations of human contributions to subway size-resolved bioaerosols, and enhancing ventilation system might help for controlling the exposure especially during the peak-hours...|$|R
50|$|In March 1983 the Alfetta {{received}} its last facelift; the exterior was modernised with newly designed bumpers (integrating a front spoiler and extending {{to the wheel}} openings), a new grille, lower body plastic cladding, silver hubcaps and, at the rear, a full width grey plastic fascia supporting rectangular tail lights with ribbed lenses and the number plate. The C-pillar <b>ventilation</b> <b>outlets</b> were moved to {{each side of the}} rear screen. Inside there were a redesigned dashboard and instrumentation, new door panels and the check control panel from the Quadrifoglio Oro on all models. Top of the range models adopted an overhead console, which extended for the full length of the roof and housed three reading spot lamps, a central ceiling light, and controls for the electric windows. Alongside the facelift two new models were introduced: the 2.4 Turbo Diesel, which in most markets gradually replaced the previous 2.0-litre which was instead installed in the marginally smaller Giulietta. There was also a renewed two-liter Quadrifoglio Oro, equipped with electronic fuel injection. Thanks to the Bosch Motronic integrated electronic fuel injection and ignition the QO had the same 130 PS output of the carburetted 2.0, while developing more torque and being more fuel efficient.|$|R
