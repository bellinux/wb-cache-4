5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens.</b> An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|In males, the semen {{is forming}} in the testis. The sperm {{structure}} of Theodoxus fluviatilis was examined by Gustaf Retzius. Then semen travels through the prostate, where it mixes with prostatic fluid. Finally {{it goes through}} the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> to the penis. The penis {{is located on the}} inner side of the right tentacle.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Each vesicle {{forms as}} an outpocketing {{of the wall}} of the ampulla of one <b>vas</b> <b>deferens.</b> The seminal vesicles develop as one of three {{structures}} of the male reproductive system that develops at the junction between the urethra and <b>vas</b> <b>deferens.</b> The <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> is derived from the mesonephric duct, a structure that develops from mesoderm.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive surgery, {{treating}} e.g. {{fallopian tube}} obstruction and <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> obstruction, or reversing a vasectomy by a reverse vasectomy.|$|E
25|$|It {{differs from}} Marstonia ogmorhaphe by its smaller size, broader shell, smaller {{prostate}} gland, straight anterior <b>vas</b> <b>deferens,</b> and smaller bursa copulatrix.|$|E
25|$|In {{surgical}} sperm retrieval (SSR) {{the reproductive}} urologist obtains sperm from the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens,</b> epididymis or {{directly from the}} testis in a short outpatient procedure.|$|E
25|$|If {{differs from}} Marstonia lustrica by its smaller {{prostate}} gland, smaller penial lobe, narrower penial filament, straight anterior <b>vas</b> <b>deferens,</b> partly imbedded (in albumen gland) bursal duct, and larger seminal receptacle.|$|E
25|$|In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this {{duct system}} to regress. Next, androgens cause the {{development}} of the Wolffian duct system, which develops into the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens,</b> seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts.|$|E
25|$|The {{excretory}} duct of each seminal gland unites {{with the}} corresponding <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> {{to form the}} two ejaculatory ducts, which immediately pass through {{the substance of the}} prostate gland before opening separately into the verumontanum of the prostatic urethra.|$|E
25|$|The {{seminal vesicles}} are {{a pair of}} glands that are {{positioned}} below the urinary bladder and lateral to the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens.</b> Each vesicle consists of a single tube folded and coiled on itself, with occasional diverticula in its wall.|$|E
25|$|Infertility affects {{both men}} and women. At least 97% of men with cystic {{fibrosis}} are infertile, but not sterile and can have children with assisted reproductive techniques. The main cause of infertility in men with CF is congenital absence of the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> (which normally connects the testes to the ejaculatory ducts of the penis), but potentially also by other mechanisms such as causing no sperm, abnormally shaped sperm, and few sperm with poor motility. Many men found to have congenital absence of the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> during evaluation for infertility have a mild, previously undiagnosed form of CF. Around 20% of women with CF have fertility difficulties due to thickened cervical mucus or malnutrition. In severe cases, malnutrition disrupts ovulation and causes a lack of menstruation.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{bilateral}} {{absence of}} vas deferens: Males with congenital bilateral {{absence of the}} <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> most often have a mild mutation (a change that allows partial function of the gene) in one copy of the CFTR gene and a cystic fibrosis-causing mutation in the other copy of CFTR.|$|E
25|$|During male seminal emission, sperm is {{transmitted}} from the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> into the male urethra via the ejaculatory ducts, which lie within the prostate gland. Ejaculation is the expulsion of semen from the urethra. It is possible for some men to achieve orgasm solely through stimulation of the prostate gland, such as prostate massage or anal intercourse.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{variations}} to this basic cycle occur. In North America, the females of some species store sperm in their oviducts {{for at least}} eight months, and the males (all species of which undergo spermatogenesis during the summer) store sperm in the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> {{for at least a}} year. Thus, species that store sperm for a shorter duration mate in the spring and store sperm in the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens,</b> while those that do so for a longer duration mate in the fall and store sperm in the oviduct over the winter, after which fertilization occurs the following spring. In addition, species that occur further north, where it is colder during much of the year and the feeding and growing season is short, may reproduce only every other year or less. Those found in central and southern Mexico or the tropics have reproductive cycles that correspond mostly with the rainy season.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} system is remarkable for extreme reduction of male organs {{and the absence}} of receptaculum seminis (spermatheca). The male organ (penis) is a short tube, and exhibits little difference from the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens,</b> except that it is slightly wider; the latter is a short tube not sharply marked off from the verge. The albumen gland is large.|$|E
25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with urinary dysfunction as the prostate gland surrounds the prostatic urethra. Changes within the gland, therefore, directly affect urinary function. Because the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> deposits seminal fluid into the prostatic urethra, and secretions from the prostate gland itself are included in semen content, prostate cancer may also cause problems with sexual function and performance, such as difficulty achieving erection or painful ejaculation.|$|E
25|$|Male {{sheep and}} pigs – Wireless Microvalve. Using a {{piezoelectric}} polymer that will deform {{when exposed to}} a specific electric field broadcast from a key fob (like a car alarm) the valve will open or close, preventing the passage of sperm, but not seminal fluid. Located in {{a section of the}} <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> that occurs just after the epididymis, the implantation can be carried out by use of a hypodermic needle.|$|E
25|$|Female {{infertility}} may {{be overcome}} by assisted reproduction technology, particularly embryo transfer techniques. Male infertility caused by absence of the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> may be overcome with testicular sperm extraction, collecting sperm cells directly from the testicles. If the collected sample contains too few sperm cells to likely have a spontaneous fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection can be performed. Third party reproduction is also a possibility for women with CF. Whether taking antioxidants affects outcomes is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: The penis is rounded, {{wider than}} and {{approximately}} {{as long as}} the epiphallus. The <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> opening is clearly asymmetrically at the posterior end of epiphallus. Therer is a small simple papilla inside the penis. The spermatheca duct is usually thick; the vagina and atrium are short, the vagina accessory glands are two lobe-like objects connected to the vagina by thin ducts. The spermatophore is thin, 16mm long, covered almost entirely with short spines.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina {{is short}} to very short. Oviduct is {{measuring}} about 2/3 {{of the length}} of the proximal part of the pedunculus, which is clearly shorter than its much narrower distal segment. Proximal part of the pedunculus about as broad as the proximal half of the oviduct, which is twice as broad as the distal half; the much narrower diverticulum reaches somewhat further than the bursa of the bursa copulatrix, which is separate from the spermoviduct. Male part of the genitalia forming a loop because the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> and a short, most proximal part of the penis are united by a common sheath; with a single retractor muscle, inserting rather close {{to the beginning of the}} <b>vas</b> <b>deferens,</b> without a flagellum or caecum. The luminal structure, as far as visible in the transparent genital slides, enables the distinction of three segments: (1) a short broadest part with a relatively simple, longitudinal, luminal structure, (2) a much longer part, with a more complicated luminal surface of many protuberances that very gradually decrease in size towards segment (3), which has a wall structure with very small, irregular protuberances and changes into the epiphallus near the insertion site of the retractor muscle, without an obvious boundary.|$|E
25|$|The androgens {{function}} as paracrine hormones {{required by the}} Sertoli cells to support sperm production. They are also required for masculinization of the developing male fetus (including penis and scrotum formation). Under the influence of androgens, remnants of the mesonephron, the Wolffian ducts, develop into the epididymis, <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> and seminal vesicles. This action of androgens {{is supported by a}} hormone from Sertoli cells, Müllerian inhibitory hormone (MIH), which prevents the embryonic Müllerian ducts from developing into fallopian tubes and other female reproductive tract tissues in male embryos. MIH and androgens cooperate to allow for movement of testes into the scrotum.|$|E
25|$|The male’s main {{reproductive}} {{function is}} to produce and store spermatozoa and provide transport to the reproductive tract of the female. Sperm development is usually completed {{by the time the}} insect reaches adulthood. The male has two testes, which contain follicles in which the spermatozoa are produced. These open separately into the sperm duct or <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> and this stores the sperm. The vas deferentia then unite posteriorally to form a central ejaculatory duct, this opens to the outside on an aedeagus or a penis. Accessory glands secrete fluids that comprise the spermatophore. This becomes a package that surrounds and carries the spermatozoa, forming a sperm-containing capsule.|$|E
25|$|Most {{nematode}} {{species are}} dioecious, with separate {{male and female}} individuals, though some, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, are androdioecious, consisting of hermaphrodites and rare males. Both sexes possess one or two tubular gonads. In males, the sperm are produced {{at the end of}} the gonad and migrate along its length as they mature. The testis opens into a relatively wide seminal vesicle and then during intercourse into a glandular and muscular ejaculatory duct associated with the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> and cloaca. In females, the ovaries each open into an oviduct (in hermaphrodites, the eggs enter a spermatheca first) and then a glandular uterus. The uteri both open into a common vulva/ vagina, usually located in the middle of the morphologically ventral surface.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: The {{hermaphrodite}} gland (HG) is elongated and large, and {{is connected}} with spermoviduct (SO) {{by means of the}} hermaphrodite duct (HD) which takes its course through a portion of the albumen gland (AG). The spermoviduct is thick and well convoluted, and separates further down into a <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> or sperm-duct (VD) and an oviduct (OV). The former opens into the upper end of a very long penis (P), to which a strong retractor muscle (PRM) is attached. The lower portion of the penis unites with that of the oviduct at the genital orifice, so that there is no vestibule. The receptaculum seminis (RS) opens into {{the lower end of the}} penis near the junction of the two ducts.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Testis {{is large}} (1.75 whorls), {{composed}} of compound lobes, broadly overlapping stomach anteriorly. Seminal vesicle is opening near anterior edge of testis, {{composed of a}} few thickened coils, positioned along ventral side of anterior 33% of testis. Prostate gland is small, pea-shaped, with about 50% of length in pallial roof. Anterior <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> opening from antero-ventral edge of prostate gland, section of duct on columellar muscle straight. Penis is large, base rectangular, inner edge without folds. Penial filament is short, narrow, tapering, oblique. Lobe is rather medium-sized, squarish, oblique. Terminal gland is narrow, usually transversely positioned along outer edge of lobe, less frequently horizontal, sometimes borne on short stalk. Penial duct is narrow, near outer edge, almost straight. Penial filament has black internal pigment core along most of length.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of vertebrates, the mesonephros persists into the adult, albeit usually fused with the more advanced metanephros; only in amniotes is the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying {{a significant portion of}} the trunk. The collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an archinephric duct, which is homologous with the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> of amniotes. However, the situation is not always so simple; in cartilaginous fish and some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter, which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with the archinephric duct at the bladder or cloaca. Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult.|$|E
25|$|Other {{anomalies}} of {{the classic}} Potter sequence infant include a parrot beak nose, redundant skin, and the most common characteristic of infants with BRA which is a skin fold of tissue extending from the medial canthus across the cheek. The ears are slightly low and pressed against the head making them appear large. The adrenal glands often appear as small oval discs pressed against the posterior abdomen due {{to the absence of}} upward renal pressure. The bladder is often small, nondistensible and may be filled with a minute amount of fluid. In males the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> and seminal vesicles may be absent, while in females the uterus and upper vagina may be absent. Other abnormalities include anal atresia, absence of the rectum and sigmoid colon, esophageal and duodenal atresia, and a single umbilical artery. Presence of a diaphragmatic hernia is also common in these fetuses/infants. Additionally, the alveolar sacs of the lungs fail to properly develop {{as a result of the}} reduced volume of amniotic fluid. Labor is often induced between 22 and 36 weeks of gestation (however, some of these pregnancies may go to term) and unaborted infants typically survive for only a few minutes to a few hours. These infants will eventually die as either a result of pulmonary hypoplasia or renal failure.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina is {{more than}} twice the length of the oviduct. Oviduct about half as long as the {{proximal}} part of the pedunculus, which is longer than the distal part. Basally the pedunculus is much broader than the adjoining oviduct. The bursa of the bursa copulatrix is separate from the spermoviduct; it reaches hardly further than the diverticulum. Male part of the genitalia with a single retractor muscle, without flagellum or caecum. Penis is tripartite as far as can be judged {{on the basis of the}} transparent genital slides, forming a loop with a sharp curvature about halfway. Proximal half formed by (1) a short segment with a relatively simple luminal surface, followed by (2) a clearly broader and about three times longer part with some longitudinal ridges with zigzag borders. Distal half, with the insertion of the retractor muscle slightly distal from halfway, about as broad or little broader than the narrow part of the proximal half; penial segment (3) with a relatively simple luminal surface; epiphallus (4) with a vague pattern of small pustulae, most clearly seen at its distal end. <b>Vas</b> <b>deferens,</b> a short part of the penis and nearly as much as the proximal half of the vagina united by a common sheath.|$|E
500|$|Most male birds lack a phallus {{and instead}} have erectile genital papilla at the {{terminus}} of their <b>vas</b> <b>deferens.</b> When {{male and female}} birds copulate, they each evert and then press together, or [...] "kiss" [...] their respective proctodeum (the lip of the cloaca). Upon the clocal kiss, the male's sperm spurts into the female's urodoeum (a compartment inside the [...] ), which then {{make their way into}} the oviduct.|$|E

2500|$|The CFTR gene {{codes for}} an ABC transporter-class ion channel protein that conducts {{chloride}} [...] and thiocyanate ions across epithelial cell membranes. Mutations of the CFTR gene affecting chloride ion channel function lead to dysregulation of epithelial fluid transport in the lung, pancreas and other organs, resulting in cystic fibrosis. Complications include thickened mucus {{in the lungs}} with frequent respiratory infections, and pancreatic insufficiency giving rise to malnutrition and diabetes. These conditions lead to chronic disability and reduced life expectancy. [...] In male patients, the progressive obstruction and destruction of the developing <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> (spermatic cord) and epididymis appear to result from abnormal intraluminal secretions, causing congenital absence of the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> and male infertility.|$|E
2500|$|... phallosoma or theca. In {{some species}} the phallotheca {{contains}} a space, called the endosoma (internal holding pouch), {{into which the}} tip end of the aedeagus may be withdrawn (retracted). The <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> is sometimes drawn into (folded into) the phallotheca together with a seminal vesicle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{seminal vesicles}} secrete a {{significant}} proportion of the fluid that ultimately becomes semen. Lipofuscin granules from dead epithelial cells give the secretion its yellowish color. [...] About 70-85% of the seminal fluid in humans originates from the seminal vesicles, but is not expelled in the first ejaculate fractions which are dominated by spermatozoa and zinc-rich prostatic fluid. The excretory duct of each seminal gland opens into the corresponding <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> as it enters the prostate gland.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{component}} of the male reproductive system is the testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. The more primitive apterygote insects have a single testis, and in some lepidopterans the two maturing testes are secondarily fused into one structure during the later stages of larval development, although the ducts leading from them remain separate. However, most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens</b> by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside.

2500|$|The testes {{are covered}} by a tough {{membranous}} shell called the tunica albuginea. Within the testes are very fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. The tubules are lined {{with a layer of}} cells (germ cells) that develop from puberty through old age into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes). The developing sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the epididymis where newly created sperm cells mature (see spermatogenesis). [...] The sperm move into the <b>vas</b> <b>deferens,</b> and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the urethral orifice through muscular contractions.|$|E
