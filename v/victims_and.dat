5|$|Death from {{pneumothorax}} is very uncommon (except {{in tension}} pneumothoraces). British statistics show an annual mortality rate of 1.26 and 0.62 deaths per million person-years {{in men and}} women, respectively. A significantly increased risk of death is seen in older <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> in those with secondary pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|In {{remembrance of}} the September 11 attacks' <b>victims,</b> <b>and</b> in {{a desire to}} avoid {{criticism}} for holding the German 500 so soon afterward, CART changed the race's name to the American Memorial. The series also held tributes {{on the day of}} the race, and made a $500,000 donation to the World Trade Center Relief Fund, matching the event's prize fund.|$|E

5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their <b>victims,</b> <b>and</b> ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E
5|$|One {{problem with}} {{counting}} attacks on humans {{is that the}} copper shark is so similar to other requiem sharks. <b>Victims</b> <b>and</b> witnesses are unlikely to correctly identify which type of genus Carcharhinus shark {{is responsible for the}} attack. Experts trying to confirm shark attacks by species warn that their statistics undercount the number of attacks by requiem sharks like the copper.|$|E
5|$|Some dances that abound at Carnival and Corpus Christi fiestas {{go back to}} pre-Conquest ritual combat dances of the Aztecs. For example, {{during the}} 15th month of the Aztec calendar, Huitzilopochtli, god {{of the sun and}} war was honored by real duels between slave <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> mimed battles among masked boy votaries.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{expectations}} about <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> offender behaviours during stranger rape. These expectations were compared with the empirically derived data of actual <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> offender behaviours. Furthermore, three attitudes/beliefs were assessed in relation to these expectations: rape myth acceptance, gender role attitudes and belief in a just world (BJW). Seven hundred and fifty-eight undergraduates took part in the study. The results show that participants significantly overestimated the frequency of 29 out of the 30 <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> offender behaviours examined (one behaviour was underestimated). An inconsistent relationship was found in predicting the expectancies via rape myth acceptance, gender role attitudes and BJW. These findings are examined in the context of the criminal justice system and how expectancy violation may affect the perception of rape <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> offenders' behaviours...|$|R

5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the 9/11 attack resulted in immediate responses to the event, including domestic reactions, hate crimes, Muslim American responses to the event, international responses to the attack, and military responses to the events. An extensive compensation program was quickly established by Congress in the aftermath to compensate the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> families of victims of the 9/11 attack as well.|$|E

5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E

Also, Ronald R. Fogleman, the USAF's new Chief of Staff, conducted his own review of the actions taken by the USAF against the officers involved in the incident.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E
