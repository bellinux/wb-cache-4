60|$|Before {{concluding}} {{these observations}} upon the deceptions of the senses, we must remark that {{the eye is}} the organ most essential {{to the purpose of}} realizing to our mind the appearance of external objects, and that when the <b>visual</b> <b>organ</b> becomes depraved for a greater or less time, and to a farther or more limited extent, its misrepresentation of the objects of sight is peculiarly apt to terminate in such hallucinations as those we have been detailing. Yet the other senses or organs, in their turn, and to the extent of their power, are as ready, in their various departments, as the sight itself, to retain false or doubtful impressions, which mislead, instead of informing, the party to whom they are addressed.|$|E
60|$|Reference {{has already}} been made to Purkenje, who has the honour of being the person who first {{described}} the inner scrolls (as distinguished from {{the outlines of the}} patterns) formed by the ridges. He did so in a University Thesis delivered at Breslau in 1823, entitled Commentatio de examine physiologico organi visus et systematis cutanei (a physiological examination of the <b>visual</b> <b>organ</b> and of the cutaneous system). The thesis is an ill-printed small 8vo pamphlet of fifty-eight pages, written in a form of Latin that is difficult to translate accurately into free English. It is, however, of great historical interest and reputation, having been referred to by nearly all subsequent writers, some of whom there is reason to suspect never saw it, but contented themselves with quoting a very small portion at second-hand. No copy of the pamphlet existed in any public medical library in England, nor in any private one so far as I could learn; neither could I get a sight of it at some important continental libraries. One copy was known of it in America. The very zealous Librarian of the Royal College of Surgeons was so good as to take much pains at my instance, to procure one: his zeal was happily and unexpectedly rewarded by success, and the copy is now securely lodged in the library of the College.|$|E

6000|$|I {{should tell}} him {{the thing that was}} {{becoming}} more and more apparent in my own mind. Here, I should say, is a world, obviously {{on the face of it}} well organised. Compared with our world, it is like a well-oiled engine beside a scrap-heap. It has even got this confounded <b>visual</b> <b>organ</b> swivelling about in the most alert and lively fashion. But that's by the way.... You have only to look at all these houses below. (We should be sitting on a seat on the Gutsch and looking down on the Lucerne of Utopia, a Lucerne that would, I insist, quite arbitrarily, still keep the Wasserthurm and the Kapellbrucke.) You have only to mark the beauty, the simple cleanliness and balance of this world, you have only to see the free carriage, the unaffected graciousness of even the common people, to understand how fine and complete the arrangements of this world must be. How are they made so? We of the twentieth century are not going to accept the sweetish, faintly nasty slops of Rousseauism that so gratified our great-great-grandparents in the eighteenth. We know that order and justice do not come by Nature--"if only the policeman would go away." [...] These things mean intention, will, carried to a scale that our poor vacillating, hot and cold earth has never known. What I am really seeing more and more clearly is the will beneath this visible Utopia. Convenient houses, admirable engineering that is no offence amidst natural beauties, beautiful bodies, and a universally gracious carriage, these are only the outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace. Such an order means discipline. It means triumph over the petty egotisms and vanities that keep men on our earth apart; it means devotion and a nobler hope; it cannot exist without a gigantic process of inquiry, trial, forethought and patience in an atmosphere of mutual trust and concession. Such a world as this Utopia is not made by the chance occasional co-operations of self-indulgent men, by autocratic rulers or by the bawling wisdom of the democratic leader. And an unrestricted competition for gain, an enlightened selfishness, that too fails us....|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} is to implement a visual impairment prevention program into a vocational school’s academic process for the risk group students and to determine its effectiveness based on the dynamics of comprehensive scoring assessment {{of the degree of}} visual pathology risk. Materials and methods. Observed were 91 students (35 boys and 56 girls). For the formative experiment purposes, a study group (SG) consisting of 10  persons (4 boys and 6 girls with a <b>visual</b> <b>organ</b> pathology who performed the designed preventive program) and a reference group (RG) consisting of 10 persons (5 boys and 5 girls with a <b>visual</b> <b>organ</b> pathology who studied under the usual program) were selected The program effectiveness was evaluated by changes in the students’ subjective evaluation of their visual comfort. The Relative Risk Index (RR) was used to perform a rough evatuation of the cause-effect relations between the acting factor and the effect appearance. The output characteristics were compared between the groups using χ 2 tests (binary variables), t-tests (continuous variables), Mann-Whitney test for comparing the distribution of ordinal variables, and Wilcoxon test (related sampling). Results. The dynamics in the RG over the academic year showed an increase in the scoring assessment of the visual fatigue, which constituted 90. 6 ± 10. 3 %. At the same time, the students in the SG demonstrated a reduced intensity and number of complaints about the visual analyzer fatigue. In the SG, the complex scoring assessment reliably decreased from 9. 8 ± 0. 8 to 7. 2 ± 0. 9 c. u. The implemented preventive program had a positive effect on the complaints: “the desire to bring the text closer to the eyes” (relative risk (RR) = 6. 0, χ 2 = 5. 6, p < 0. 05), “the feeling of existence of certain periods of change in the visual acuity” (relative risk (RR) = 3. 5; χ 2 = 5. 1; p < 0. 05), and the overall assessment of the questionnaire (relative risk (RR) = 7. 0; χ 2 = 7. 5; p < 0. 01). The implementation of the proposed program, by the results of the interview of the students with a <b>visual</b> <b>organ</b> pathology, produced a reliable (p < 0. 05) increase in the level of the visual analyzer performance. Conclusions. The implementation of the proposed program for the vocational school students with a <b>visual</b> <b>organ</b> pathology had a positve effect on their subjective evaluation of their visual analyzer performance...|$|E

Adequate interpretation of results seems to be crucial to establish scheme and timing of treatment in case of co-occurrence of the abovementioned disorders. In the presented case early implementation of steroid therapy resulted in improvement of blood flow parameters and the regression of ophthalmological complaints.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty samples were fabricated simulating {{ocular prostheses}}. each sample was constituted by one disc of acrylic resin N 1 and one disc of colorless acrylic resin with the iris interposed between the discs.
