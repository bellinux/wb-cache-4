These include personal sapper gear, <b>vehicle-mounted</b> <b>mine</b> plows and mine rollers {{which can be}} attached to engineering vehicles and tanks, CARPET air-fuel rockets and the [...] "Tzefa Shiryon" [...] (Hebrew for [...] "Armor's Viper") which is extremely powerful and can clear large mine fields.|$|R
5000|$|To {{enable the}} mines {{to be found}} by {{friendly}} forces, the mines were painted with a black sandy substance called [...] (camouflage sand). Allied forces found that although the mines were undetectable by Allied <b>mine</b> <b>detectors,</b> German <b>mine</b> <b>detectors</b> could find the mines when they had been marked with Tarnsand. [...] The secret of Tarnsand was maintained until {{after the end of}} the war, when it was discovered that it was a mildly radioactive substance and the German <b>mine</b> <b>detectors</b> incorporated a simple Geiger counter.|$|R

5000|$|Vallon Man is a {{term used}} by the British Army waging war in Afghanistan to denote the soldier in a patrol who carries the <b>mine</b> <b>detector.</b> The term {{originated}} from [...] "Vallon Machine", another word used for <b>mine</b> <b>detector</b> (the Vallon <b>mine</b> <b>detector</b> VMR3 was widely used in Afghanistan because of its unique ground penetrating radar (GPR). Using a GPR {{is the only way}} to find metal free mines and improvised explosive devices (IED). The role of Vallon Man is one of the most dangerous in the fighting in Afghanistan, as Vallon men are often killed in their work.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe used {{anisotropic}} magnetoresistors (AMR's) {{to build}} an advanced <b>mine</b> <b>detector.</b> The sensing head involves gradiometric pair of AMR sensors and a continuous-wave driven excitation coil, so the gradiometer is capable of detection ferromagnetic materials as well as diamagnetic metals. The sensors are specially arranged to suppress the large AC-excitation field, so the <b>mine</b> <b>detector</b> senses both DC and AC field gradient response of the object of interest. Being limited by the sensor noise of 214 pTrms/√Hz at 1 kHz, {{we were able to}} detect an 50 x 50 x 1. 5 mm 3 aluminum test object in a 20 cm-depth using a 300 μT, 1 kHz excitation field...|$|R
