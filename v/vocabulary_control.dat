An international committee published recommendations for genetic symbols and nomenclature in 1957.

Several other genus-specific research communities (e.g., Drosophila fruit flies, Mus mice) have adopted nomenclature standards, as well, and have published them on the relevant model organism websites and in scientific journals, including the Trends in Genetics Genetic Nomenclature Guide.

Standardization of nomenclature thus tries to achieve the benefits of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>control</b> and bibliographic control, although adherence is voluntary. The advent {{of the information age}} has brought gene ontology, which in some ways is a next step of gene nomenclature, because it aims to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This Standard {{presents}} {{guidelines and}} conventions for the contents, display, construction, testing, maintenance, {{and management of}} monolingual controlled vocabularies. This Standard focuses on controlled vocabularies that are used for the representation of content objects in knowledge organization systems including lists, synonym rings, taxonomies, and thesauri. This Standard {{should be regarded as}} a set of recommendations based on preferred techniques and procedures. Optional procedures are, however, sometimes described, e. g., for the display of terms in a controlled vocabulary. The primary purpose of <b>vocabulary</b> <b>control</b> is to achieve consistency in the description of content objects and to facilitate retrieval. <b>Vocabulary</b> <b>control</b> is accomplished by three principal methods: defining the scope, or meaning, of terms; using the equivalence relationship to link synonymous and nearly synonymous terms; and distinguishing among homographs...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{computational}} grammatical complexity (CGC) hypothesis {{claims that}} children with G(rammatical) -specific language impairment (SLI) have a domain-specific deficit in the computational system affecting syntactic dependencies involving 'movement'. One type of such syntactic dependencies is filler-gap dependencies. In contrast, the Generalized Slowing Hypothesis claims that SLI children have a domain-general deficit affecting processing speed and capacity. Aims: To test contrasting accounts of SLI we investigate processing of syntactic (filler-gap) dependencies in wh-questions. Methods & Procedures: Fourteen 10; 2 - 17; 2 G-SLI children, 14 age- matched and 17 vocabulary-matched controls were studied using the cross- modal picturepriming paradigm. Outcomes & Results: G-SLI children's processing speed was significantly slower than the age controls, but not younger <b>vocabulary</b> <b>controls.</b> The G- SLI children and <b>vocabulary</b> <b>controls</b> did not differ on memory span. However, the typically developing and G-SLI children showed a qualitatively different processing pattern. The age and <b>vocabulary</b> <b>controls</b> showed priming at the gap, indicating that they process wh-questions through syntactic filler-gap dependencies. In contrast, G-SLI children showed priming only at the verb. Conclusions: The findings indicate that G-SLI children fail to establish reliably a syntactic filler- gap dependency and instead interpret wh-questions via lexical thematic information. These data challenge the Generalized Slowing Hypothesis account, but support the CGC hypothesis, according to which G-SLI children have a particular deficit in the computational system affecting syntactic dependencies involving 'movement'. As effective remediation often depends on aetiological insight, {{the discovery of the}} nature of the syntactic deficit, along side a possible compensatory use of semantics to facilitate sentence processing, can be used to direct therapy. However, the therapeutic strategy to be used, and whether such similar strengths and weaknesses within the language system are found in other SLI subgroups are empirical issues that warrant further research...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is {{intended}} as a part of a comparison of English education in Japan with that in South Korea.

40|$|Background: With {{the growing}} amount of {{biomedical}} data available in public databases {{it has become}} increasingly important to annotate data in a consistent way in order to allow easy access to this rich source of information. Annotating the data using <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> terms and ontologies makes it much easier to compare and analyze data from different sources. However, finding the correct <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> terms can sometimes be a difficult task for the end user annotating these data. Results: In order to facilitate the location of the correct term in the correct <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> or ontology, the Ontology Lookup Service was created. However, using the Ontology Lookup Service as a web service is not always feasible, especially for researchers without bioinformatics support. We have therefore created a Java front end to the Ontology Lookup Service, called the OLS Dialog, which can be plugged into any application requiring the annotation of data using <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> terms, making it possible to find and use <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> terms without requiring any additional knowledge about web services or ontology formats. Conclusions: As a user-friendly open source front end to the Ontology Lookup Service, the OLS Dialog makes it straightforward to include <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> support in third-party tools, which ultimately makes the data even more valuable to the biomedical community...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} steps in the software development process is moving from requirements written in natural, uncontrolled language, to the formalisms required by the design modelling languages. To solve this issue, practitioners should pay attention to the possibility of applying <b>vocabulary</b> <b>control</b> and knowledge representation techniques to produce better specifications. The use of controlled vocabularies and the modelling of the conceptual relationships between concepts in a specific domain are expected {{to improve the quality of}} the specifications. <b>Vocabulary</b> <b>control</b> and semantic modelling are promising tools to avoid the most frequent problems in the requirements specification process: lack of consistency and ambiguity. This paper provides a detailed description of the development process of an ontology used for requirements modelling in the area of satellite control systems. The process applied is based on wellestablished practices and guidelines applied for the construction of controlled vocabularies and faceted classifications schemas. Engineers can use the ontology when writing system specifications using predefined templates. The use of this ontology ensures the consistency of the specifications written by different engineers improves the communication with other parties involved in the system construction activities and sets the foundations for a semi-automated generation of models for subsequent design activities. 1...|$|E
