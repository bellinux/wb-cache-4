25|$|When the {{observer}} {{is on the}} terrestrial Arctic Circle and the radius of the circumpolar stars is 66° the celestial Arctic Circle {{is identical to the}} celestial Tropic of Cancer. That is what Pytheas means when he says that Thule is located at the place where the Arctic Circle is identical to the Tropic of Cancer. At that point, {{on the day of the}} Summer Solstice, the <b>vertical</b> <b>rod</b> of the gnōmōn casts a shadow extending in theory to the horizon over 360° as the sun does not set. Under the pole the Arctic Circle is identical to the Equator and the sun never sets but rises and falls on the horizon. The shadow of the gnōmōn winds perpetually around it.|$|E
25|$|At noon on {{the longest}} day {{the plane of}} {{longitude}} passing through Marseilles is exactly on edge to the sun. If the Earth's axis were not tilted toward the sun, a <b>vertical</b> <b>rod</b> at the equator would have no shadow. Arod further north would have a north-south shadow, and as an elevation of 90° would be a zero latitude, the complement of the elevation gives the latitude. The sun is even higher in the sky due to the tilt. The angle added to the elevation by the tilt {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic and at that time was 23°44′40″. The complement of the elevation less the obliquity is 43°13′, only 5′ in error from Marseilles's latitude, 43°18′.|$|E

Fischer agrees that the appear to be names, and Guy (2001) identifies the garland as a determinative of royalty.|$|E

2500|$|The shadow cast by a <b>vertical</b> <b>rod</b> at noon was {{the basis}} for {{defining}} zonation. The intersection of the northernmost or southernmost points of the ecliptic defined the axial circles passing through those points as the two tropics (tropikoi kukloi, [...] "circles at the turning points") later named for the zodiacal constellations found there, Cancer and Capricorn. During noon of the summer solstice (therinē tropē) rods there cast no shadow. The latitudes between the tropics were called the torrid zone (diakekaumenē, [...] "burned up").|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the devices}} used for {{astronomy}} was gnomon, known as Sanku, {{in which the}} shadow of a <b>vertical</b> <b>rod</b> is applied on a horizontal plane in order to ascertain the cardinal directions, the latitude of the point of observation, and the time of observation. This device finds mention in the works of Varāhamihira, Āryabhata, Bhāskara, Brahmagupta, among others. The Cross-staff, known as Yasti-yantra, was used by the time of Bhaskara II (1114–1185 CE). This device could vary from a simple stick to V-shaped staffs designed specifically for determining angles {{with the help of a}} calibrated scale. The clepsydra (Ghatī-yantra) was used in India for astronomical purposes until recent times.

2500|$|Fiat's {{interest}} in Diesel engines dated from 1907, initially focused on slow turning factory engines then moving to higher speed marine and railway motors. [...] The AN.1 {{was their first}} foray into Diesel aero-engines. To shorten its development time and {{to concentrate on the}} higher combustion chamber pressures, different burning temperatures and fuel supply systems of the Diesel cycle, they based its design on the Fiat A.12. [...] This was a petrol engine first run in 1916 and produced in large numbers during World War I, a water-cooled, upright, overhead camshaft straight six. The AN.1 kept the external dimensions and the lower section, crankshaft, crankcase, sump, plus the lubrication and water-cooling supplies of the older engine but required new cylinders, pistons, valve gear and fuel delivery systems to replace carburettors and magnetos. The cylinder barrels had to be stronger to withstand the greater combustion pressures (2-300 atmospheres) required by the compression ignition Diesel. The swept volume of the Diesel engine was reduced by 23.4% as the cylinders had a bore of 140mm (5.51in), compared with the A.12's 160mm (6.30in). Two camshafts were fitted to operate the four valves per cylinder, though they were driven via the same tall <b>vertical</b> <b>rod</b> used for the single camshaft of the A.12, at its top, and the water pump of both models at its bottom.|$|E

60|$|The entrance-gate {{was open}} now, {{and under the}} archway the outer ward was visible, {{a great part of}} it being laid out as a flower-garden. This was in process of {{clearing}} from weeds and rubbish by a set of gardeners, and the soil was so encumbered that in rooting out the weeds such few hardy flowers as still remained in the beds were mostly brought up with them.

60|$|My {{friend was}} right, as he {{occasionally}} {{is in our}} discussions, especially upon points of fact. We had crossed the pine forest by one of its paths which happened to follow the wires of the provincial telegraphy; and though the poles occurred at long intervals they made a difference when they came. The instant {{we came to the}} straight pole we could see that the pines were not really straight. It was like a hundred straight lines drawn with schoolboy pencils all brought to judgment suddenly by one straight line drawn with a ruler. All the amateur lines seemed to reel to right and left. A moment before I could have sworn they stood as straight as lances; now I could see them curve and waver everywhere, like scimitars and yataghans. Compared with the telegraph post the pines were crooked--and alive. That lonely <b>vertical</b> <b>rod</b> at once deformed and enfranchised the forest. It tangled it all together and yet made it free, like any grotesque undergrowth of oak or holly.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{experimental}} observation of novel vortex patterns in vertically vibrated granular rods. Above a critical packing fraction, moving ordered domains of nearly <b>vertical</b> <b>rods</b> spontaneously form and coexist with horizontal rods. The domains of <b>vertical</b> <b>rods</b> coarsen {{in time to}} form large vortices. We investigate {{the conditions under which}} the vortices occur by varying the number of rods, vibration amplitude and frequency. The size of the vortices increases with the number of rods. We characterize the growth of the ordered domains by measuring the area fraction of the ordered regions as a function of time. A void filling model is presented to describe the nucleation and growth of the vertical domains. We track the ends of the <b>vertical</b> <b>rods</b> and obtain the velocity fields of the vortices. The rotation speed of the rods is observed to depend on the vibration velocity of the container and on the packing. To investigate the impact of the direction of driving on the observed phenomena, we performed experiments with the container vibrated horizontally. Although vertical domains form, vortices are not observed. We therefore argue that the motion is generated due to the interaction of the inclination of the rods with the bottom of a vertically vibrated container. We also perform simple experiments with a single row of rods in an annulus. These experiments directly demonstrate that the rod motion is generated when the rods are inclined from the vertical, and is always {{in the direction of the}} inclination.

40|$|William Howe’s 1840 patent truss was {{intended}} to be posttensioned by tightening nuts on iron rods. Since the wood diagonals simply bear on node blocks, the two diagonals in a panel are both functional only if precompressed. To properly rehabilitate Howe bridges and to guide new designs, {{it is important to understand}} the prestress forces that are induced initially and how they change with time. Results of linear elastic analyses for the actions of tensioning <b>vertical</b> <b>rods</b> and temperature changes are reported. Tensioning <b>vertical</b> <b>rods</b> at one location induces forces primarily in the two adjacent panels and causes very small upward vertical displacements. An increase in temperature decreases prestress forces; therefore, prestressing should not be done at low temperatures. A linear viscoelastic analysis is formulated using a standard-linear-solid constitutive model. The formulation is used to predict the time-dependent behavior of the Pine Bluff Bridge in Indiana. Time histories of forces and displacements are computed. Displacements increase and prestress forces decrease over time because of the viscous behavior of wood. Prestress losses decrease as the relative axial stiffness of the metal rods decreases...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{assembly}} of systems and structures on the micro-scale can be inefficient as pthesiss of sub-millimeter dimensions {{are difficult to}} manipulate. Cutting edge manufacturing methods implement self-assembly as an approach to ordering micro and nano-sized parts into a desired arrangement. This thesis studies a technique utilizing surface tension {{as a method of}} actuating microparts on a liquid-liquid interface via lateral capillary interactions. Preliminary experimentation is conducted to investigate the feasibility of developing a new method for self-alignment of microparts by observing the influence of interfacial geometry on the movement of silicon tiles along a hexadecane-water interface. Different surface geometries are created by implementing <b>vertical</b> <b>rods</b> of different wetting properties that alter the curvature of the interface. Results demonstrate that the microparts attain an equilibrium separation distance from the <b>vertical</b> <b>rods.</b> It is indicated that this equilibrium distance is determined by the dimensions of the micropart and the curvature of the interface. With further investigation, these results may be used to cultivate a method for self-alignment of microparts into rings of a desired radius...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the backflashover {{phenomenon}} in HV overhead transmission lines (TLs) with towers grounded by means of long counterpoises, typically used in high resistivity soils. Although long counterpoises are effective in reducing the grounding impedance at power frequency, their impulse response may affect negatively the TL backflashover rate. The study {{is focused on the}} enhancement of TL lightning performance obtainable by adding a small number of <b>vertical</b> grounding <b>rods</b> to horizontal counterpoises. An extensive ATP-EMTP parametric analysis, based on a detailed 161 kVTL model including the leader progression model (LPM) of line insulations and the non-linear transient behaviour of grounding systems, has been carried out taking into account several different values of soil resistivity as well as varying numbers, locations and lengths of additional <b>vertical</b> <b>rods.</b> Critical lightning current ranges causing backflashover have been then predicted for several lightning waveforms, of different severity. The paper shows that the addition of a few <b>vertical</b> grounding <b>rods</b> significantly improves TL lightning performance by increasing critical lightning current values. even if their influence is negligible at power frequency. The authors have ascertained an increment of average critical backflashover current up to similar to 55 % for some typical TL grounding system configurations and lightning waveshapes.
