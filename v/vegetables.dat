5|$|Originally, <b>vegetables</b> were {{collected}} from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed.

Nowadays, most <b>vegetables</b> are grown {{all over the world}} as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of <b>vegetables</b> and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase <b>vegetables</b> grown in faraway countries.

Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, <b>vegetables</b> and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, <b>vegetables</b> and nuts.
