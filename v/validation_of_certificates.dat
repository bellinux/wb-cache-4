40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} components in e-commerce systems is the validation of digital signatures, which implies the <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> in order to check the validity status of the certificates used to create a signature. Nowadays, several mechanisms to accomplish this process exist, but there is no agreement with which particular mechanism should be used in every scenario. On the other hand, in-frastructures based on web services are widely spread due to their several advantages, so it is neces-sary to adapt the existing services to the new frameworks. There already exists a proposal for a digital signature web service, but there is not any for certificate validation. In this paper we propose a valida-tion service which considers the existing validation certificate mechanisms, that is, it is not restricted to use only a particular protocol, with the aim of satisfying different domains in a homogeneous way, keeping the validation process under client control. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{security}} {{guarantees provided}} by SSL/TLS {{depend on the}} correct authentication of servers through certificates signed by a trusted authority. How-ever, as recent incidents have demonstrated, trust in these authorities is not well placed. Increasingly, certificate authorities (by coercion or compromise) have been creating forged certificates {{for a range of}} adversaries, allowing seemingly secure communications to be intercepted via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. A variety of solutions have been proposed, but their complexity and deployment costs have hindered their adoption. In this paper, we propose Direct <b>Validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Certificates</b> (DVCert), a novel protocol that, instead of relying on third-parties for certificate validation, allows domains to directly and securely vouch for their certificates using previously established user authentication credentials. By rely-ing on a robust cryptographic construction, this relatively simple means of en-hancing server identity validation is not only efficient and comparatively easy to deploy, but it also solves other limitations of third-party solutions. Our extensive experimental analysis in both desktop and mobile platforms shows that DVCert transactions require little computation time on the server (e. g., less than 1 ms) and are unlikely to degrade server performance or user experience. In short, we provide a robust and practical mechanism to enhance server authentication and protect web applications from MITM attacks against SSL/TLS. ...|$|E

40|$|Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are {{emerging}} as a promising approach to improving traffic safety and providing {{a wide range of}} wireless applications for drivers and passengers. To perform reliable and trusted vehicular communications, one prerequisite is to ensure a peer vehicle’s credibility by means of digital certificates validation from messages that are sent out by other vehicles. However, in vehicular communication systems, certificates validation is more time consuming than in traditional networks, {{due to the fact that}} each vehicle receives a large number of messages in a short period of time. Another issue that needs to be addressed is the unsuccessful delivery of information between vehicles and other entities on the road as a result of their high mobility rate. For these reasons, we need new solutions to accelerate the process of certificates validation. In this thesis, we propose a certificate revocation status validation scheme using the concept of clustering; based on data mining practices, which can meet the aforementioned requirements. We employ the technique of k -means clustering to boost the efficiency of certificates validation, thereby enhancing the security of a vehicular ad hoc network. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the security of the proposed scheme is presented. The analytical results demonstrate that this scheme can effectively improve the <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> and thus secure the vehicular communication in vehicular networks...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn modern {{information}} service architectures, security {{is one of}} the most critical criteria. Almost every standard on information security is concerned with internal control of an organization, and particularly with authentication. If an RP (relying party) has valuable information assets, and requires a high level to authentication for accepting access to the valuable assets, then a strong mechanism is required. Here, we focus on a trust model <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> authentication. Conventionally, a trust model <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> is defined as a <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> chains <b>of</b> <b>certificates.</b> However, today, this trust model does not function well because of complexity of paths and of requirement of security levels. In this paper, we propose "dynamic path validation," together with another trust model of PKI for controlling this situation. First, we propose Policy Authority. Policy Authority assigns a level of compliance (LoC) to CAs in its domain. LoC is evaluated in terms of a common criteria of Policy Authority. Moreover, it controls the path building with considerations of LoC. Therefore, we can flexibly evaluate levels of CP/CPS's in one server. In a typical bridge model, we need as many bridge CAs as the number of required levels of CP/CPS's. In our framework, instead, we can do the same task in a single server, by which we can save the cost of maintaining lists of trust anchors of multiple levels...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For many {{applications}} of secure multiparty computation {{it is natural}} to demand that {{the output of the}} protocol is verifiable. Verifi-ability should ensure that incorrect outputs are always rejected, even if all parties executing the secure computation collude. Since the inputs to a secure computation are private, and potentially the outputs are private as well, adding verifiability is in general hard and costly. In this paper we focus on privacy-preserving linear programming as a typical and practically relevant case for verifiable secure multiparty com-putation. We introduce certificate validation as an effective technique for achieving verifiable linear programming. Rather than verifying the com-putation proper, which involves many iterations of the simplex algorithm, we extend the output of the secure computation with a certificate. The certificate allows for efficient and direct <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> the correctness of the output. The overhead incurred by the computation <b>of</b> the <b>certificate</b> is marginal. For the <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>certificate</b> we design particularly effi-cient distributed-prover zero-knowledge proofs, fully exploiting the fact that we can use ElGamal encryption for this purpose, hence avoiding the use of more elaborate cryptosystems such as Paillier encryption. We also formulate appropriate security definitions for our approach, and prove security for our protocols in this model, paying special attention to ensuring properties such as input independence. By means of sev-eral experiments performed in a real multi-cloud-provider environment, we show that the overall performance for verifiable linear programming is very competitive, incurring minimal overhead compared to protocols providing no correctness guarantees at all. ...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to their}} massive user base and request load, {{large-scale}} Internet applications have mainly focused on goals such as performance and scalability. As a result, {{many of these}} applications rely on weaker but more efficient and simpler authentication mechanisms. However, as recent incidents have demonstrated, powerful adversaries are exploiting the weaknesses in such mechanisms. While more robust authentication mechanisms exist, most of them fail to address the scale and security needs of these large-scale systems. In this dissertation we demonstrate that by {{taking into account the}} specific requirements and threat model of large-scale Internet applications, we can design authentication protocols for such applications that are not only more robust but also have low impact on performance, scalability and existing infrastructure. In particular, we show that there is no inherent conflict between stronger authentication and other system goals. For this purpose, we have designed, implemented and experimentally evaluated three robust authentication protocols: Proxychain, for SIP-based VoIP authentication; One-Time Cookies (OTC), for Web session authentication; and Direct <b>Validation</b> <b>of</b> SSL/TLS <b>Certificates</b> (DVCert), for server-side SSL/TLS authentication. These protocols not only offer better security guarantees, but they also have low performance overheads and do not require additional infrastructure. In so doing, we provide robust and practical authentication mechanisms that can improve the overall security of large-scale VoIP and Web applications.
