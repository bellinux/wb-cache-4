5|$|On December 18, 2007, a 44-year-old guest {{was found}} {{unconscious}} after the train {{returned to the}} station. He {{was taken to a}} hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A preliminary autopsy by the Orange County medical examiner's office concluded that the <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> died of dilated cardiomyopathy.|$|E
5|$|Booth had {{free access}} to {{all parts of the}} theater as a famous and popular actor who had {{frequently}} performed at Ford's Theatre and who was well known to its owner John T. Ford, even having his mail sent there. He bored a spyhole into the door of the presidential box earlier that day so that he could check that his intended <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> made it to the play and observe the box's occupants.|$|E
5|$|Nicholls, {{the oldest}} <b>victim,</b> <b>had</b> been {{a drug addict}} since the early 2000s, shortly after {{completing}} a beautician's course at Suffolk College. Soon afterwards, she had started working as a prostitute to fund her addiction. After moving to a housing association home from her council house, Nicholls asked her mother to look after her son. She {{was thought to be}} staying with a man in Ipswich {{at the time of her}} death.|$|E

50|$|If the <b>victim</b> <b>has</b> no {{suspected}} cervical spine trauma, {{open the}} airway using the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver; if the <b>victim</b> <b>has</b> suspected neck trauma, the airway should be opened with the jaw-thrust technique. If the jaw-thrust is ineffective at opening/maintaining the airway, a very careful head-tilt/chin-lift should be performed.|$|R
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) later {{encounters}} {{the stranger}} {{as she walks}} into an elevator. Both ride in silence up to the fourth floor, with Scully somewhat unsettled by the experience. At Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) apartment, Mulder and Scully begin discussing a case the pair are working on, wherein {{the heart of the}} <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> been removed with the absence of any significant physical evidence. Mulder believes the heart was removed with a technique known as psychic surgery. Meanwhile, Padgett, who is Mulder's neighbor, stands on a chair with his ear to an air vent, listening to the conversation.|$|E
5|$|Tillman as {{governor}} initially took a strong stand against lynching. The Shell Manifesto, in reciting {{the ills of}} Conservative government, had blamed the Bourbons for encouraging lynching through bad laws and poor administration. Although Governor Richardson, Tillman's predecessor, had taken action to prevent such murders, they still occurred, with no one being prosecuted for them. In {{about half of the}} lynchings in South Carolina between 1881 and 1895, there were claims that the black <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> raped or tried to rape a white woman, though studies have shown that lynchings were tied to economic and social issues. More lynchings took place in South Carolina in the 1890s than in any other decade, and in Edgefield and several other counties, such killings outnumbered lawful executions.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{tells her}} {{version of the story}} via a {{flashback}} to the previous day. She arrives at work and Mulder tells her about a murder in Texas, which he believes to be the work of vampires. In her version, Mulder is exuberant, insensitive, and irritating, while she is calm and mindful of her thoughts. The agents travel to the small town of Chaney, Texas where they meet Sheriff Hartwell (Luke Wilson), whom Scully finds highly charming. Mulder and Hartwell leave to investigate further while Scully autopsies the body. She discovers that the victim, whose last meal had been pizza, was incapacitated with chloral hydrate. She returns to the motel room and orders a pizza, but Mulder soon appears and sends her back to autopsy another body. She leaves him just as her food is delivered. When she finds that the second <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> also ingested chloral hydrate in a pizza, she realizes Mulder is in danger and returns to the motel room. She finds him about to be attacked by the pizza delivery boy, Ronnie Strickland (Patrick Renna). She shoots at Ronnie, who runs off into the woods. When she catches up to him, Mulder has gotten there first and hammered a stake into Ronnie's heart.|$|E
25|$|All of Haarmann's {{victims were}} dismembered before {{their bodies were}} discarded, usually in the Leine River, {{although}} the dismembered body of his first known <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> simply been buried, and the body of his last <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> been thrown into a lake located {{at the entrance to}} the Herrenhausen Gardens.|$|E
25|$|By 2009, {{the alleged}} <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> filed {{a civil suit}} against Jim Gibbons, {{specifically}} alleging battery, false imprisonment and second-degree kidnapping as well as deceit about the episode. The lawsuit was settled in July 2013 for $50,000.|$|E

25|$|In total, the <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> {{been stabbed}} over 150 {{times in the}} neck, chest and torso with a common pen knife; some of these wounds had severed her carotid artery. Defensive wounds were also {{discovered}} upon her hands. It is also believed she had been transported to the location where her body was discarded in an upright position, and that her murderer was a right-handed individual. She had not {{been the victim of}} a robbery or any form of sexual assault prior to her murder, and had no drugs or alcohol in her system when she died. Furthermore, the <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> been killed approximately two hours after having eaten a meal.|$|E

She had also testified that she spat the ejaculate from her mouth onto the ground, and that her jeans were underneath her body, not near her face.|$|E
25|$|October: Unidentified. Nilsen's sixth {{victim was}} {{described}} by his murderer as a slender male prostitute, approximately 5ft. 10 in height, who was aged between 20 and 30, and of either Filipino or Mexican descent. To Nilsen, this <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> gypsy-like features. Nilsen met this victim in the Salisbury Arms in October 1980.|$|E
25|$|On 13 September 2006, Malina {{announced}} that she was maintaining her initial claims, saying {{she was willing to}} take a polygraph test, and that she and her lawyer, Gábor Gál were considering reporting the case to public prosecutors because the <b>victim</b> <b>had</b> been interrogated for six hours during which officers tried to persuade her to withdraw her claims.|$|E

25|$|Rodger {{began his}} attacks at his {{apartment}} on Seville Road, where three men were found dead inside.

They were identified as Rodger's roommates, Weihan Wang and Cheng Hong, and a friend named George Chen.|$|E
25|$|During 1982, the {{skeletal}} remains of two unidentified women were unearthed near property owned by Wilder in Loxahatchee, Florida.
