The malleus receives <b>vibrations</b> from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits <b>vibrations</b> to the incus, which in turn transmits the <b>vibrations</b> to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window. As the stapes vibrates, <b>vibrations</b> are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The larva is a {{voracious}} predator. Within a {{few minutes}} of seizing its prey with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes, it begins to suck out the digestion products. The larva is extremely sensitive to ground <b>vibrations,</b> the low-frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground; the larva locates the source of the <b>vibrations</b> by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors, tufts of hairs {{on the sides of the}} two hindmost thoracic segments.|$|E
5|$|The mysticete ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound {{frequencies}} as low as 7 Hz and as high as 22 kHz. It is largely unknown how sound is received by baleen whales. Unlike in toothed whales, sound does not pass through the lower jaw. The auditory meatus is blocked by connective tissue and an ear plug, which connects to the eardrum. The inner-ear bones are contained in the tympanic bulla, a bony capsule. However, this {{is attached to the}} skull, suggesting that <b>vibrations</b> passing through the bone is important. Sinuses may reflect <b>vibrations</b> towards the cochlea. It is known that when the fluid inside the cochlea is disturbed by <b>vibrations,</b> it triggers sensory hairs which send electrical current to the brain, where <b>vibrations</b> are processed into sound.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>vibration</b> {{characteristics}} of inertial <b>vibration</b> feeders were analyzed. Combining active with passive <b>vibration</b> isolation, the hybrid <b>vibration</b> isolation of inertial <b>vibration</b> feeders was researched. Adopting the passive <b>vibration</b> isolation, the <b>vibration</b> transmissibility {{can be reduced}} effectively, but the work efficiency of the inertial <b>vibration</b> feeder is reduced too. By choosing right feedback variables and appropriate feedback gain, the <b>vibration</b> transmissibility and the work efficiency of the inertial <b>vibration</b> feeder can be improved markedly by the hybrid <b>vibration</b> isolation. When the velocity feedback gain {{is equal to the}} upper damping coefficient and the displacement feedback gain is equal to the upper spring stiffness, the inertial <b>vibration</b> feeder has the best work efficiency and the <b>vibration</b> transmissibility approximates zero. The fuzzy PID control approach was used to design the active <b>vibration</b> control system.

The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the <b>vibrations</b> caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough <b>vibrations</b> to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board.

Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical <b>vibrations</b> horizontally under pressure.

The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression; the death's-head hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity.|$|E
