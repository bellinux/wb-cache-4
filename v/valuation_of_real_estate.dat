5000|$|In the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> {{there are}} three {{traditional}} forms of obsolescence which affect property values: physical, functional, and aesthetic. Physical obsolescence occurs when the physical material of the property deteriorates {{to the point where}} it needs to be replaced or renovated. Functional obsolescence occurs when the property is no longer capable of serving the intended use or function. Aesthetic obsolescence occurs when fashions change, when something is no longer in style. A potential fourth form has emerged as well: sustainable obsolescence. Sustainable obsolescence proposes to be a combination of the above forms in many ways. Sustainable obsolescence occurs when a property no longer meets one or more sustainable design goals. [...] Obsolescence is an important characteristic of future-proofing a property because it emphasizes the need for the property to continue to be viable. Though not explicitly stated, the shocks and stresses to a property in the future are one potential way in which a property may become not future-proof. It is also important to note that each form of obsolescence can be either curable or incurable. The separation of curable and incurable obsolescence is ill defined because the amount of effort one is willing to put into correcting it varies depending on several factors: people, time, budget, availability, etc.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{traditional}} net present value (NPV) approach fails to take account of the multiple effects arising from the interactions of the operating and strategic flexibility {{during the course of a}} project. Option pricing theory (OPT) has been successfully applied in the valuation of both financial and real investments in the last two decades. However, it is still a relatively new approach in the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investments. This paper thus attempts to extend the application of OPT to the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> development projects, providing insights into rectifying the limitations of traditional approaches. The paper starts with an overview of the development of OPT relating to real estate investments. It then examines the appraisal method adopted by the Government for Hong Kong Disneyland and explores the real options that may create added value to the project. A binomial option pricing model is proposed that estimates the potential values of the project with those options available. The study concludes that OPT is superior to NPV approach on the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investments in that it enhances upside potential as well as reducing downside risk.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critically}} review the German mortgage lending value (MLV) and to adapt it in order to find a new concept that could serve as the basis for an internationally accepted standard for valuations for lending purposes. Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on a critical review of existing practices and literature and applies developments in the area of risk management tools, modern valuation techniques as well as the results of the consultation for Basel II in order to find an improved method. Findings – It was found that a value-at-risk approach and the implementation of simulation helps to understand the concept of MLV. The results also indicate that the German system of calculating the MLV has to be improved. Practical implications – Banks are in need of tools, reliable instruments and a strong theoretical basis when evaluating their collateral. The <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> for long-term loans has always been a problem. This paper indicates a strong basis for the implementation of tools in every day business.
