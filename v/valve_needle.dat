5000|$|Expansion valves are flow-restricting {{devices that}} cause a {{pressure}} drop {{of the working}} fluid. The <b>valve</b> <b>needle</b> remains open during steady state operation. The size of the opening or {{the position of the}} needle is related to the pressure and temperature of the evaporator. There are three main parts of the expansion valve that regulate the position of the needle. A sensor bulb, {{at the end of the}} evaporator, monitors the temperature change of the evaporator. This change in temperature creates a change in pressure on the diaphragm.|$|E
50|$|A V port {{ball valve}} has either a 'v' shaped ball or a 'v' shaped seat. This allows for linear and even equal {{percentage}} flow characteristics. When the valve {{is in the}} closed position and opening is commenced the small end of the 'v' is opened first allowing stable flow control during this stage. This type of design requires a generally more robust construction due to higher velocities of the fluids, which might damage a standard valve. These {{can be referred to}} as a type of control valve but are typically not as accurate as a balancing <b>valve,</b> <b>needle</b> valve, globe valve, or pressure regulating valve.|$|E
5000|$|For example, if the {{temperature}} in the evaporator increases, the pressure in the diaphragm increases causing the needle to lower. Lowering the needle allows more of the working fluid into the evaporator to absorb heat. The pressure at the inlet of the evaporator affects the position of the needle and prevents the working fluid from flowing back into the compressor. Since the pressure before the valve is higher than the pressure after the valve, the working fluid naturally flows into the evaporator. The pressure at the inlet of the evaporator acts on the diaphragm. There is also a spring providing a constant pressure closing the <b>valve</b> <b>needle.</b> The spring constantly restricts the amount of working fluid entering the evaporator.|$|E

40|$|Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) are {{characterized}} by a continuous variation {{in the composition of}} parent materials through the work piece volume. This gradual change in material composition is aimed at improving mechanical, thermal and/or electrical properties of the material. FGMs are being increasingly used in a variety of applications including aerospace, biomedical and nuclear. FGMs have been produced using additive manufacturing processes such as laser engineered net shaping (LENS) and 30 printing. A relatively new process category called direct write (OW) printing has evolved over the past decade. OW techniques such as multi-material micro-extrusion are capable of producing FGMs. To fully utilize the capabilities of multi-material micro-extrusion, experimentation and modeling is needed to determine the factors that significantly affect the mass flow rate and proportion of each nanoink being dispensed. The objectives of this study were to develop a parametric model for multi-material pneumatic microextrusion and to develop equations to determine the parameter values to achieve the desired ink proportions during ink deposition. Experiments were conducted using red, blue and yellow acrylic inks that were printed using a commercially available three material pneumatic micro-extruder from nScrypt. Preliminary experiments determined that air pressure and <b>valve</b> <b>needle</b> position were significant parameters affecting the mass flow rate of the inks. A 26 experiment was then designed and carried out. Parametric equations thus developed provided relationships between the parameter values and the proportions of inks dispensed. The equations were validated by solving them using an AMPL linear program. For a given desired proportion of inks to be dispensed, the AMPL program suggests process parameter values needed to produce the desired multi-material output...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{definition}} of an accurate mathematical model of a production common-rail-type injector for automotive diesel engines. The mathematical model defined in a previous work was refined, accounting for {{a broader range of}} effects on injector performance, thus allowing a more strict validation of the model predictions against experimental data. The geometry of the control-valve holes, crucial in determining the actual discharge coefficient, was accurately evaluated by means of silicone molds. The moving mechanical components of the injector, such as control <b>valve,</b> <b>needle,</b> and pressure rod were modeled using the mass-spring-damper scheme. The axial deformation under pressure of needle, pressure rod, nozzle and injector body was modeled. This effect was found to also affect the control valve device operation, and was properly accounted for. The model obtained was implemented in Simulink; the ordinary differential equations were solved by means of the numerical differentiation formulas implicit scheme of second-order accuracy, while the partial differential equations were integrated using the finite-difference Lax-Friedrichs method. In order to obtain sufficient data for validating the model in its entire operation field, two separate sets of tests were carried out. In the first analysis, a constant reference pressure was imposed in the rail, and the injector energizing time was progressively increased from values relative to small pilot injections to values characteristic of large main injections. The injected volume per stroke was measured by means of a mean delivery meter (EMI) device. During the second set of tests, the injector was mounted on a flow rate meter (EVI) device so as to measure the injection law. Electric current flowing through the injector solenoid, oil pressure in the common rail, and at the injector inlet, needle, and control valve lift were also gauged and recorded. The good agreement between numerical and experimental results allowed the use of the model to gain greater insight into the mechanisms and phenomena that regulate injector behavior. The nozzle hole discharge coefficient dependence upon time and needle lift was discussed, and the trends were presented in several working conditions. The flow in the control volume holes was studied, in order to determine whether cavitation occurs or not, giving an answer to a long disputed topic. Finally, the effects of injector deformation caused by fuel pressure on performance were investigate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Needle</b> <b>valve</b> {{is the key}} {{component}} of diesel engine cylinder. Changing the nozzle Orifice chamferinging will influence the flow coefficient and spray performance. Firstly, we proposed a physical model of abrasive flow field inside the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> based on computational fluid dynamics technology. Then, we set the computing method and boundary type. Finally, we simulated the abrasive flow field using fluent software. The result is useful for guidance in the actual grinding process. Intrudction As the highest thermal efficiency power machinery, diesel engine has been widely used in transportation, engineering machinery, mining machinery and agricultural machinery, and so on. Diesel performance primarily depends {{on the merits of}} its injection system performance. <b>Needle</b> <b>valve</b> {{as one of the most}} important components in injection system, it will directly affect the performance of the injection system 0. Chamferinging on the orifice can greatly improve the flow coefficient and the flow velocity of diesel in grinding 0. But, the relationship between the size of chamferinging and the increment of orifice flow coefficient is not clear. Besides, it is difficult to measure the size of orifice chamferinging because it is inside the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> and the diameter of <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> is small. As a result, this dissertation utilizes the software fluent to simulate and analyze the flow field in <b>needle</b> <b>valve,</b> and confirms the impact of orifice chamfering on the injection performance. It is significant to guide the actual grinding.

40|$|The inline {{filtration}} {{characteristics of}} freshly blended and degraded antimisting fuels (AMK) at low temperature are examined. A <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> degrader was modified to include partial recirculation of degraded fuel and heat addition in the bypass loop. A pressure drop across the <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> {{of up to}} 4, 000 psi was used.

30|$|A {{custom-made}} particle seeder, {{which included}} a particle container, inlet and outlet tubes, was used to seed the flow with various nanoenergetic materials. Mass measurements, before and after each run, were used to estimate the particle flow rates. Usually about 5  g of aluminum or iron nanoenergetics (nominal diameters of 70  nm, purchased from NanoAmor Inc., Houston, USA, without further treatment) were placed along the flow path inside the particle container. The particle seeder inlet tube was submerged {{below the surface of}} the piles to generate particle suspensions inside the container. The height of the inlet and outlet were offset to ensure roughly uniform seeding in the flow through the discharge tube. Standard breathing dry air was used as the gas supply. A flow controller (FMA 5400, Omega, Stamford, USA) regulated the flow rate in the system to 1 [*]±[*] 0.1 standard liters per minute (slpm). A three-way valve allowed the flow to be switched between the nanoparticle seeder and a bypass line. If particle seeding was desired, the three-way <b>valve</b> and <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> were opened to allow flow through the seeder. Otherwise, the three-way <b>valve</b> and <b>needle</b> <b>valve</b> were closed to isolate the particle seeder.
