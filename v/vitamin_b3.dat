5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, <b>vitamin</b> <b>B3</b> (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B3)</b> {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote wound healing. Topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B3</b> (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E

It can also interfere with niacin (<b>vitamin</b> <b>B3),</b> resulting in at least one case to pellagra and fatal medullary aplasia. It has also been reported to cause vitamin B12 deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Pellagra {{can develop}} {{according}} to several mechanisms, classically {{as a result of}} niacin (<b>vitamin</b> <b>B3)</b> deficiency, which results in decreased NAD production leading to most of the pathology (since NAD and its phosphorylated NADP form are cofactors required in many body processes, the pathological impact of pellagra is broad and results in death if not treated).|$|E

25|$|Several {{pyridine}} derivatives play {{important roles}} in biological systems. While its biosynthesis is not fully understood, nicotinic acid (<b>vitamin</b> <b>B3)</b> occurs in some bacteria, fungi, and mammals. Mammals synthesize nicotinic acid through oxidation of the amino acid tryptophan, where an intermediate product, aniline, creates a pyridine derivative, kynurenine. On the contrary, the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli produce nicotinic acid by condensation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and aspartic acid.|$|E
25|$|Since heroin {{is one of}} {{a series}} of 3,6 diesters of morphine, it is {{possible}} to convert morphine to nicomorphine (Vilan) using nicotinic anhydride, dipropanoylmorphine with propionic anhydride, dibutanoylmorphine and disalicyloylmorphine with the respective acid anhydrides. Glacial acetic acid can be used to obtain a mixture high in 6-monoacetylmorphine, niacin (<b>vitamin</b> <b>B3)</b> in some form would be precursor to 6-nicotinylmorphine, salicylic acid may yield the salicyoyl analogue of 6-MAM, and so on.|$|E

500|$|In 1910, {{the first}} vitamin complex was {{isolated}} by Japanese scientist Umetaro Suzuki, who succeeded in extracting a water-soluble complex of micronutrients from rice bran and named it aberic acid (later Orizanin). He published this discovery in a Japanese scientific journal. When {{the article was}} translated into German, the translation failed to state {{that it was a}} newly discovered nutrient, a claim made in the original Japanese article, and hence his discovery failed to gain publicity. In 1912 Polish-born biochemist Casimir Funk, working in London, isolated the same complex of micronutrients and proposed the complex be named [...] "vitamine". It was later to be known as <b>vitamin</b> <b>B3</b> (niacin), though he described it as [...] "anti-beri-beri-factor" [...] (which would today be called thiamine or vitamin B1). Funk proposed the hypothesis that other diseases, such as rickets, pellagra, coeliac disease, and scurvy could also be cured by vitamins. Max Nierenstein a friend and reader of Biochemistry at Bristol University reportedly suggested the [...] "vitamine" [...] name (from [...] "vital amine").). The name soon became synonymous with Hopkins' [...] "accessory factors", and, {{by the time it was}} shown that not all vitamins are amines, the word was already ubiquitous. In 1920, Jack Cecil Drummond proposed that the final [...] "e" [...] be dropped to deemphasize the [...] "amine" [...] reference, after researchers began to suspect that not all [...] "vitamines" [...] (in particular, vitamin A) have an amine component.|$|E

5000|$|The above {{observations}} {{could also}} {{be explained by the}} rendered, highly processed source of meat being less rich in taurine and by {{the fact that some of}} the taurine is denatured during extrusion. Cats are obligate carnivores and their natural diet would consist of high amounts of whole meat - thus what has been termed [...] "taurine deficiency" [...] causing dilated cardiomyopathy in cats, is more likely to be a deficiency in the production of commercial feed diets. Taurine is now artificially supplemented back into the diet after processing in the production of most commercial pet food. A similar dynamic occurred in the first half of the twentieth century with an epidemic of Pellagra in humans living in the Southern United States. The cause was determined to be a deficiency of the essential <b>vitamin</b> niacin (<b>B3),</b> which was being destroyed in the mass processing of corn. Niacin was supplemented back into Southern diets and the disease was eradicated.|$|R

A sample of 17 197 subjects participated in the study. Participants completed I 136 -item validated semi-quantitative FFQ. Principal component analysis was used to define dietary patterns. Individuals were classified according to quintiles of adherence based on dietary pattern scores. Non-dietary variables, such as smoking and physical activity habits, were also taken into account. The probability approach was used to assess nutrient intake adequacy of certain vitamins (<b>vitamins</b> B(12), B(6), <b>B(3),</b> B(2), B(1), A, C, D and E) and minerals (Na, Zn, iodine, Se, folic acid, P, Mg, K, Fe and Ca).
