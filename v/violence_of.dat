5|$|A {{social control}} program was {{implemented}} whereby local unions took on responsibility for ensuring that this quota was not exceeded; in doing so, {{they hoped to}} remove the need for military and police intervention, and thus stem the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> previous decades. Measures were implemented to ensure the industrialization of coca production, with Morales inaugurating the first coca industrialization plant in Chulumani, which produced and packaged coca and trimate tea; the project was primarily funded through a $125,000 donation from Venezuela under the PTA scheme.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association {{and other}} {{business}} leaders petitioned Governor Ralston {{to call out}} the Indiana National Guard. Members of both parties accused the union leaders of trying to prevent their voters from reaching the polls. The riots made national news and public leaders began to consider them an embarrassment to the state. Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E

5|$|The new government's {{hostility to}} the wartime Polish Government in Exile and its World War II {{underground}} resistance – accused {{by the media}} of being nationalist, reactionary and antisemitic, and persecuted by Berman – further strengthened Żydokomuna sentiment {{to the point where}} in the popular consciousness Jewish Bolshevism was seen as having conquered Poland. It was in this context, reinforced by the immediate post-war lawlessness, that Poland experienced an unprecedented wave of anti-Jewish <b>violence</b> (<b>of</b> which most notable was the Kielce pogrom).|$|E
5|$|The reason Byzantine Greek merchants {{have often}} been {{neglected}} in historiography {{is not that they}} were any less able than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade.

The fact that they were eventually surpassed by their Italian rivals is attributable to the privileges sought and acquired by the Crusader States within the Levant and the dominant maritime <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> the Italians.|$|E

5|$|When Nazi Germany conquered Poland in September 1939, it {{was faced}} with the {{disposition}} of the large Jewish population. In view of the German populace's tepid response to the orchestrated <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> Kristallnacht, the Nazis perceived an urgent need for films that would move German popular sentiment {{in favor of the}} Nazi Final Solution to the 'Jewish question'.

5|$|All five {{versions}} of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars. All versions, except that in the Gesta Francorum, generally agree that Urban talked about the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> European society {{and the necessity of}} maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking. They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, {{it has been argued that}} Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along. According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of Deus vult! ("God wills it!"). However, other {{versions of}} the speech do not include this detail.|$|E
5|$|As a {{manufacturing}} center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, {{known as the}} Pittsburgh Railway Riots. Militia and federal troops were called {{to the city to}} suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> any affected by the strikes.|$|E
5|$|By 1896, the {{government}} planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provincial authorities and ultimately close the force. With {{the discovery of}} gold in the Klondike, however, the force was redeployed to protect Canada's sovereignty over the region and to manage the influx of prospectors. The mounted police sent volunteers {{to fight in the}} Second Boer War, and in recognition were retitled the Royal North-West Mounted Police in 1904. The plans for closure were abandoned in the face of opposition from regional politicians. Large numbers of the police volunteered for military service during the First World War, {{and the future of the}} badly depleted force was once again in doubt. Towards the end of the war, however, fears grew about a potential Bolshevik conspiracy and the authorities tasked the mounted police to investigate the threat. In the aftermath of the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> the Winnipeg General Strike, {{the government}} decided to amalgamate the force with the Dominion Police, to form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1920.|$|E

5|$|Colonial {{rule in the}} Congo {{began in}} the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, {{frustrated}} by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. By the turn of the century, however, the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> the suppression, the {{government}} and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued {{to be worried about}} fresh revolts for several decades.

In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
