40|$|Abstract — Cost and {{competitive}} pressures are forcing business organizations to reuse assets from repositories, rather than develop them from scratch. But {{this has been}} hampered by some issues {{that have not been}} addressed so far. First, {{there is a lack of}} a mechanism for the representation of business process assets as <b>variants</b> <b>and</b> <b>versions</b> in repositories. Second, there is no formal means to compare between different <b>variants</b> <b>and</b> <b>versions</b> of an asset and determine which is the best to select for reuse. Third, there is a lack of a technique to determine the extent to which a business process asset could be customized for reuse. In this paper, we address the above research issues by presenting an integrated approach for modeling, analyzing, and searching business process assets in a repository for enhancing reuse. We demonstrate our approach on a large repository of business process assets in the insurance domain...|$|R

In both cases, hypersensitivity associated with women has led in recent times to movements of avoidance and rejection or, by contrast, of integration. This can be seen either in the form of critical reinterpretations, which give an interpretive spin on the values implicit in the narrative, or through literary adaptations with ironic and transgressive tone, realized by social groups that claim identification and self-affirmation based on the legendary reference...|$|R

Various engineering approaches including cloning, product or component platforms, product lines, production lines, and configurable systems are followed in practice to cope with the product variation in space and time. Unfortunately, there is no silver-bullet approach, and companies have to choose and adopt respective approaches in a deliberate way, but there is often only limited understanding of how to do so. Adoption problems, unexploited potential, wasted investments, frustration and disapproval are typical symptoms, which can be seen in consequence in the wild...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Business-driven {{development}} {{favors the}} construction of process mod-els at different abstraction levels and by different people. As a consequence, there is a demand for consolidating different versions of process models by detecting and resolving differences. Existing approaches rely {{on the existence of}} a change log which logs the changes when changing a process model. However, in sev-eral scenarios such a change log does not exist and differences must be identified by comparing process models before and after changes have been made. In this paper, we present our approach to detecting and resolving differences between process models, {{in the absence of a}} change log. It is based on computing differ-ences and deriving change operations for resolving differences, thereby providing a foundation for <b>variant</b> <b>and</b> <b>version</b> management in these cases...|$|R
40|$|Embedded {{software}} {{systems are}} highly configurable and consist of many software components in different <b>variants</b> <b>and</b> <b>versions.</b> However, component updates or upgrades often result in unpredictable incompatibilities with its environment. Existing research addresses this challenge by employing formal methods with a fixed set of encoded static compatibility checks, making {{it nearly impossible}} for engineers to add new or modify existing ones. This paper presents a highly adaptable infrastructure to define constraints for compatibility checks. The underlying approach transforms software components into instances of a C&C meta-model, enriched with OCL compatibility constraints at runtime, then evaluated by a solver. The result is transformed back into a C&C model showing compatibility or incompatibility. The easy to integrate infrastructure is based on industrial requirements and allows to add, modify or delete constraints without restarting the tool infrastructure...|$|R

Successive <b>variants</b> <b>and</b> <b>versions</b> aimed at different readership have been found. Egyptians lists for good and bad moments, three times each day, have also been found. Many of these prognostics were connected with celestial events.The flooding of the Nile valley, a most important event in ancient Egypt, was expected to occur at the summer solstice but as the civil calendar had exactly 365 days, over the centuries the date was drifting in the calendar.

40|$|Abstract: The real {{values and}} {{benefits}} of Information Technologies are difficult to quantify and frequently even to identify accurately. Existing financial models such as Net Present Value have proven insufficient for complex products, for longterm corporate goals. IS projects and software-rich products are decided upon while ignoring critical financial aspects, as {{the distance between the}} corporate product vision and the reality that engineers see may be very large. This paper maps between economics vis-à-vis IS-based product management via an inter-disciplinary approach, looking at the needs and exigencies of corporate management, IS project, products and software engineering. The basis for the article is a discussion of the difficulties in evaluation of the economic desirability of complex, softwarerich products. It presents a dynamic corporate-level model for economic profit evaluation designed to deal with the unique characteristics of such products, over many <b>variants</b> <b>and</b> <b>versions,</b> <b>and</b> the entire lifecycle. Given the extreme uncertainty of costs, benefits, risks and timeframes projections, the model facilitates real time reporting via an information system designed for management of Products, Portfolios and Projects. Whereas existing project management techniques such as Earned Value Management provide a general basis for managing project level activity, our model provides a longer-term view to assess economic affects of corporate strategies over time. This is provided by a dynamic, Management Information System based aggregation of all product information, over an entire product lifecycle, with the objective to provide a knowledge base for corporate dynamic decision-making. Concomitantly, the model fulfil...|$|R

It has been found that both a new model and brand-name reputation may allow the innovative firms to get some market power and recoup their investments. Competition is, however, not localized within a market segment and the class of new or old models, i. e., products from different market segments, new and old products compete with each other (coexisting and not eliminating each other) and do not constitute separate market niches. On the other hand, new (old) models are perceived to be closer substitutes than old (new) models. Consumer preferences towards brand and new products vary depending on their age.
