Electrochemical pretreatment of the electrode greatly enhanced the reduction peak current (Ip) of CAP. CAP shows an irreversible reduction peak at- 0. 674 V vs. Ag/AgCl at the GCE in 0. 05 M acetate buffer of pH 5.

Two different methods were used to obtain desired nano-structured conducting polymers. In the first method, a homogeneous polypyrrole (PPy) nano-network structure was produced. Optimization results indicated that mole ratios of oxidant to monomer should be kept as 4 : 1 and surfactant to monomer as 3 : 1, 4 : 1 and 5 : 1 {{for the production of}} PPy nanofibers in networks. The average size of fibers and beads were measured as ca. 150 and 300 nm, respectively. The electrical conductivity measurements and electrochemical studies with cyclic voltammetry resulted in reasonable electroactivity of these PPy nano-networks. BET analyses resulted in a surface area greater than 500 m 2 /g. In the latter method, conductive nano-arrays of polypyrrole (PPy) (1), poly(Nmethylpyrrole) (P(NMPy)) (2), poly(thiophene) (PTh) (3) and poly(3, 4 - ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) (4) were aligned in one dimension (1 D).

The mercuric ion became covalently bonded to the sulfur from the polymer. The comparison of the bare platinum electrode in a solution of 0. 005 M pyrocatechol to the modified poly(2, 22 ̆ 7 -bithiophene) polymer was ran at a scan rate of 100 mVs- 1. This gave a direct comparison of oxidation/reduction peak potentials. As seen, the modified poly(2, 22 ̆ 7 -bithiophene) polymer with the mercuric ion did not give a response when {{compared to that of}} both the modified and bare platinum electrodes in 0. 005 M pyrocatechol. Both Scanning Electron Microscopy and micro-Raman Spectrometry were employed {{in order to determine the}} morphology of the polymer as well as the binding ability to the metal mercury ion.

Recently, {{interest in the}} electrode material has steadily increased the performance of MFCs. Electrode-based materials should have good electrical conduction, chemical stability and biocompatibility, and should guarantee efficient electrons transfer between the bacteria and electrode surface. Additionally, to render MFCs a cost-effective and energy sustainable technology, low-cost packing materials can be employed as support for bacteria growth and proliferation. In the present work, we used ceramic berl saddles, which is extensively used in Unit Operation of Chemical Engineering {{as well as in}} biotechnology processes to favor biomass adhesion. Considering that microbial fuel cells combine biological process with traditional fuel cell one, it is necessary to render conductive the packing material. Therefore, in this work, deposition of a conductive carbon layer on ceramic berl saddles was performed to obtain a novel low cost anode material necessary for the direct recovery of electrons by bacteria metabolisms. α-D-glucose was used as carbon layer source on the berl saddles. The impregnation processes with glucose solution (500 g/L) underwent the following consecutive sequence: (i) drying, (ii) caramelization, and (iii) pyrolysis. The phase composition of the samples was determined by Raman Spectrometer (Renishaw) with laser excitation wavelength 514 nm. The Raman spectra obtained were typical of polycrystalline graphitic carbon, with a certain disorder arising from nanostructuring of clusters indicated by the presence of D peak. The position of G peak was shifted respect to that of pure graphite (1581 cm- 1) to 1593 cm- 1, indicating some degree of nanostructuring of graphitic clusters. The surface area and pore size distribution were determined by a Tristar II 3020 gas adsorption (BET). After deposition of carbon on the berl saddles was obtained an increase in surface area and porosimetry, both keys points for the overall anode performance. The carbon-coated berl saddles were used as anode material in a two-compartments laboratory prototype of MFC, in batch mode, using Saccaromyces cerevisiae as active microorganism.

Based on the single crystal X-ray analysis most of the synthesized ferrocenyl guanidine have been stabilized by intermolecular as well as intramolecular hydrogen bonding and possesses interesting supramolecular chemistry having cylindrical cavities and empty spaces. In addition, a tetra substituted ferrocenyl guanidine (N-isopropyl-N-(4 -ferrocenylphenyl) -N'-(2, 6 -diethylphenyl) -N''-benzoyl guanidine) has also been synthesized and fully characterized. The preliminary investigation of the anticancer potency of the synthesized ferrocenyl guanidines has been carried out by determining their ability to bind with DNA and by the free radical scavenging activity. The DNA interaction studies performed by cyclic voltammetry and UV-Visible spectroscopy are in close agreement with the binding constants K (0. 79 - 5. 4) Ã— 105 M- 1 (CV) and (0. 72 - 5. 1) Ã— 105 M- 1 (UV-Visible). The results reveal that the ferrocenyl guanidines have strong binding ability with DNA as compared to the guanidines having no ferrocene. The presence of ferrocene is concluded to enhance the DNA binding activity of guanidines. This {{may be due to the}} fact that in the presence of ferrocene the delocalization of lone pair of nitrogen extended to Cp ring of ferrocene due to which the nitrogen become more polarized, stable and favorable for electrostatically bind with negatively charged DNA. The binding constants results show that the compounds having ferrocene at para position have slightly larger binding constants values as compared to the meta-ferrocenyl guanidines. This may be due to more delocalization of electron when the Cp ring of ferrocene is at para position. The compounds having electron withdrawing groups on the phenyl ring also have higher binding constant values as compared to those compounds having electron donating groups. This may also be due to the delocalization of lone pair of nitrogen on phenyl ring and making the nitrogen more polar. The free radical scavenging potentials of the selected synthesizes compounds was determined on a UV-Visible spectrophotometer by using DPPH as a free radical. The activity of ferrocene incorporated guanidines was found to be higher than guanidines without ferrocene. The compounds which have electron withdrawing groups showed an increase in the free radical scavenging potency. This might be due to the stabilization of resulting guanidine free radical in the presence of electronegative groups. Antimicrobial activities of the selective synthesized compounds were tested against five representatives, gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aerugnosa and Bacillus subtilis) and gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherchia coli) bacterial strains by disc diffusion method. Three fungal strains, fusarium moniliforme, aspergillus fumigates, aspergillus flavus were tested by using well diffusion method. The results revealed that the compounds having ferrocene and electron withdrawing groups showed moderate to good antibacterial activity as compared to the standard drug penicillin used. Significant antifungal activity was observed against aspergillus flavus and good against fusarium moniliforme and aspergillus fumigatus. The antifungal activity of these compounds was found comparable with the standard drug used (Terbinafin). Other compounds having electron donating groups were found to have a moderate or less activity against the tested bacteria and fungi. Exact mechanism of the structure-activity relationship was not yet developed but this might be due to a decrease in basicity, in turn an increase in the lipophilicity of the compounds in the presence of ferrocene and electron withdrawing substituents. Lipophilic compounds have more penetrating power across the cell membrane...|$|E
