50|$|To {{ensure that}} only valid {{initiators}} connect to storage arrays, administrators most commonly run iSCSI only over logically isolated backchannel networks. In this deployment architecture, only the management ports of storage arrays {{are exposed to}} the general-purpose internal network, and the iSCSI protocol itself is run over dedicated network segments or <b>virtual</b> <b>LANs</b> (<b>VLAN).</b> This mitigates authentication concerns; unauthorized users are not physically provisioned for iSCSI, and thus cannot talk to storage arrays. However, it also creates a transitive trust problem, in that a single compromised host with an iSCSI disk can be used to attack storage resources for other hosts.|$|R

50|$|VLAN hopping is a {{computer}} security exploit, a method of attacking networked resources on a <b>virtual</b> <b>LAN</b> (<b>VLAN).</b> The basic concept behind all VLAN hopping attacks is for an attacking host on a VLAN {{to gain access to}} traffic on other VLANs that would normally not be accessible. There are two primary methods of VLAN hopping: switch spoofing and double tagging. Both attack vectors can be easily mitigated with proper switch port configuration.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Navy's IT- 21 philosophy {{when applied to}} the Navy-wide Internet poses a significant problem: how to best adapt {{to the requirements of}} the new standard and still {{make the most of the}} currently installed network. The integration of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) backbone and desktop networks with legacy equipment and applications is considered in this thesis. The most current solution to this dilemma is the use of Local Area Network Emulation (LANE). The focus of this thesis is the implementation of LANE over a simulated ship-to-shore satellite link. Data throughput is monitored and analyzed to determine the optimum configuration. Testing is conducted to examine the advantages of routed Emulated Local Area Networks (ELANs) and non-routed ELANs.

5000|$|With a {{sufficiently}} sophisticated switch, {{it is possible}} to create a network in which the normal notion of a broadcast domain is strictly controlled. One implementation of this concept is termed a [...] "private VLAN". Another implementation is possible with Linux and iptables. One helpful analogy is that by creating multiple VLANs, the number of broadcast domains increases, but the size of each broadcast domain decreases. This is because a <b>virtual</b> <b>LAN</b> (or <b>VLAN)</b> is technically a broadcast domain.|$|R

50|$|The Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) and algorithm, {{provides}} both, {{simple and}} full, connectivity assigned to any given <b>Virtual</b> <b>LAN</b> (<b>VLAN)</b> throughout a Bridged Local Area Network. MSTP uses BPDUs to exchange information between spanning-tree compatible devices, to prevent loops in each MSTI (Multiple Spanning Tree Instances) {{and in the}} CIST (Common and Internal Spanning Tree), by selecting active and blocked paths. This is done {{as well as in}} STP without the need of manually enabling backup links and getting rid of bridge loops danger.|$|E
5000|$|Network administrators can see {{networks}} {{from both}} physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., routers, bridges and application layer gateways) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, subnets, map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings {{is to make a}} set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using [...] <b>virtual</b> <b>LAN</b> (<b>VLAN)</b> technology.|$|E
40|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>LANs</b> (<b>VLANs)</b> permit hosts {{connected}} to a LAN switch to be grouped together into logical groups {{as a function of}} some management policy rather than simply of their physical location. Commercial LAN switches support a variety of policies based on either physical or logical addresses, protocol types, tagged frames, or user defined rules. The objective of these policies is the same: {{to reduce the amount of}} traffic that needs to be routed by grouping together hosts which are likely to communicate with each other into the same <b>virtual</b> <b>LAN.</b> This paper proposes a novel and more direct approach, it shows how VLANs can be created and removed dynamically as a function of the measured traffic patterns across the network. This is both simpler than configuring many static rules and permits the VLAN configuration to adapt to the evolution in the traffic patterns. The latter point is especially important in future LANs supporting peer-to-peer continuous media services, such as IP telephony or video-conferencing, in which clusters of hosts come together to communicate with each other intensively for relatively short periods of time and then form into new clusters. ...|$|R

50|$|While AoE bears a {{resemblance}} to voice over IP (VoIP) and audio over IP (AoIP), AoE {{is intended for}} high-fidelity, low-latency professional audio. Because of the fidelity and latency constraints, audio over Ethernet systems generally do not utilize audio data compression. AoE systems use a much higher bit rate (typically 1 Mbit per channel) and much lower latency (typically less than 10 milliseconds) than VoIP. Audio over Ethernet requires a high-performance network. Performance requirements may be met through use of a dedicated local-area network (LAN) or <b>virtual</b> <b>LAN</b> (<b>VLAN),</b> overprovisioning or quality of service features.|$|E

50|$|A <b>virtual</b> <b>LAN</b> (<b>VLAN)</b> is any {{broadcast}} domain that is partitioned {{and isolated}} {{in a computer}} network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). LAN is the abbreviation for local area network and in this context virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic. VLANs work by applying tags to network packets and handling these tags in networking systems - creating the appearance and functionality of network traffic that is physically on a single network but acts {{as if it is}} split between separate networks. In this way, VLANs can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling and networking devices to be deployed.|$|E

The {{information}} that handles the companies nowadays is very sensitive, {{so that any}} type of person can enter them, even in the same company. For that reason different levels from security for users of a same network and much more strict levels of security for external users exist authorized and non authorized. The local area network of a company must maintain strict levels of security, so that the different users within the same company {{do not have access}} to servers and {{information that}} is there and that it is not incumbent on to the work that they make. For that reason, when a logical segmentation of a network is designed is necessary to as much define profiles of user as of servers, to identify exactly as entrance they make the users to the servers and who type of information get in. In order to solve this problem the present equipment of network allows to make <b>virtual</b> designs of <b>LAN</b> (<b>VLAN),</b> that allows to create a network within a same equipment of network with no need to spend more resources, but increasing the security and efficient use of the network. But when making this design is due to know clearly as the network is structured, is due to analyze aspects of physical design of the building, technical characteristics of the equipment, routing protocols, structured wiring, among others, to really know if that change is necessary and as soon as it can hit that change to the network for his correct operation. Soon of the analysis of all these variables, it is necessary to make a plan of migration adapted to the time and dedication of the personnel in charge of the area of data, considering that stops the east user change must be transparent and to assure the monitoring and correct operation once made the change.

5000|$|Internally, Ethernet-based {{out-of-band}} management {{can either}} utilize a dedicated separate Ethernet connection, {{or some kind}} of traffic multiplexing can be performed on the system's regular Ethernet connection.
