When the album was released 1991 on Narrowpath Records the band did not tour <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> album. In 1992 the band was broken up, but 1993 is when the band announced their breakup. In 1995 the band reunited and played their final show at Cornerstone Festival. The members all went on to join new projects including, Stavesacre, Neon Horse, The Blamed, CHATTERbOX, and Applehead.|$|E
25|$|A year {{afterwards}} his situation, {{which had}} {{for some time}} been decidedly flourishing, showed signs of changing <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> worse. The duchess of Orléans died, and he apparently {{had to give up}} his rangership, probably selling it to pay debts. But there was always a providence for La Fontaine. Madame de la Sablière, a woman of great beauty, of considerable intellectual power and of high character, invited him to make his home in her house, where he lived for some twenty years. He seems to have had no trouble whatever about his affairs thenceforward; and could devote himself to his two different lines of poetry, as well as to that of theatrical composition.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1880s Burne-Jones {{had begun}} hyphenating his name, merely - {{as he wrote}} later - to avoid [...] "annihilation" [...] in the mass of Joneses, and thus Georgiana became Lady Burne-Jones when her husband reluctantly {{accepted}} a baronetcy in 1894, partially at least as the title would descend to his son Philip, who ran with the smart set around the Prince of Wales and cared <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> honour. Jane Morris wrote {{that her husband had}} commented [...] "Well, a man can be an ass {{for the sake of his}} children", but in general the Socialists of their circle and Georgiana herself were appalled.|$|E

2500|$|Sarbajeet [...] "Saby" [...] Singh and Kashmira Singh are a young Punjabi couple; {{they are}} about to marry. In a {{departure}} from the arranged marriages, they have chosen each other independently. They invite their parents to a joint dinner and inform them of their choice. The parents are cheerful to oblige, and they gladly arrange the wedding ceremony. Once married, however, Saby and Kashmira discover their varying interests and aspirations. The main conflict is around cricket: Saby is a great fan of cricket, and Kashmira does not care <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sport. Saby watches every India match with unfailing zeal. Kashmira however is left alone and unattended, and she gradually feels abandoned and unloved.|$|E
2500|$|Yet, {{adoption}} of the common law in the newly-independent nation was not a foregone conclusion, and was controversial. Immediately after the American Revolution, there was widespread distrust and hostility to anything British, and the common law was no exception. Jeffersonians decried lawyers and their common law tradition as threats to the new republic. The Jeffersonians preferred a legislatively-enacted civil law {{under the control of}} the political process, rather than the common law developed by judges that—by design—were insulated from the political process. The Federalists believed that the common law was the birthright of Independence: after all, the natural rights to [...] "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" [...] were the rights protected by common law. Even advocates for the common law approach noted that it was not an ideal fit for the newly-independent colonies: judges and lawyers alike were severely hindered by a lack of printed legal materials. Before Independence, the most comprehensive law libraries had been maintained by Tory lawyers, and those libraries vanished with the loyalist expatriation, and the ability to print books was limited. Lawyer (later president) John Adams complained that he [...] "suffered <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> want of books." [...] To bootstrap this most basic need of a common law system—knowable, written law—in 1803, lawyers in Massachusetts donated their books to found a law library. A Jeffersonian newspaper criticized the library, as it would carry forward [...] "all the old authorities practiced in England for centuries back ... whereby a new system of jurisprudence [...] on the high monarchical system [...] become the Common Law of this Commonwealth... may hereafter have a very unsocial purpose." ...|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to the {{opinions}} {{of some of his}} enemies, who never tire to credit Leitner's poetry with supposed incomprehensibility, other commentators – such as the Süddeutsche Zeitung – have given quite different assessments of his work. With respect to his poetry collection The Truth about Uncle Spam (German: Die Wahrheit über Uncle Spam), critics from that newspaper wrote: [...] " [...] is playfully light and aerial [...] because he does not trust in false claims to intellectual depth, his miniatures are wonderful reads." [...] While earlier in his career, he was called [...] "pessimistic," [...] critics such as [...] have recently honored him with the title of Jokester: [...] "Leitner wants to unearth the madness and idiocy that surrounds us every day, but he does so playfully, without any kind of moralistic resentment or invectives." [...] Numerous critics have remarked on Leitner's enlightened irony. In a review of Der digitale Hai ist high (German for The Digital Shark is High), Peter Kapp wrote in the Rheinische Post: [...] "by means of hearty verbal wit and twisted word play, Leitner incites a lust for poetry." [...] Leitner does not hide behind fictions of seriousness: [...] "the publisher and publicist [...] does not care <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> widely held notion that poetry is something for quiet retreats. He thinks that poetry is part of everyday life and should be fun." [...] In his preface to Der digitale Hai ist high Günter Kunert wrote, [...] "It's rare that a poet brings together three special qualities in his personality, {{as in the case of}} Anton G. Leitner. That guy has a feeling for the language; he has a lust for the language; he's obsessed with sex—where else do these three qualities come together? Humor, wit, and common sense. This is a mixture that can rarely be found in German poetry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The IRA {{claimed a}} total {{strength}} of 70,000, {{but only about}} 3,000 were actively engaged in fighting against the Crown. The IRA distrusted those Irishmen who had fought in the British Army during the First World War as potential informers, {{but there were a}} number of exceptions such as Emmet Dalton, Tom Barry and Martin Doyle. The IRA divided its members into three classes, namely [...] "unreliable", [...] "reliable" [...] and [...] "active". The [...] "unreliable" [...] members were those who were nominally IRA members, but did not do <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> struggle, [...] "reliable" [...] members played a supporting role in the war while occasionally fighting and the [...] "active" [...] men those who were engaged in full-time fighting. Of the IRA brigades only about one to two thirds were considered to be [...] "reliable" [...] while those considered [...] "active" [...] were even smaller. A disproportionate number of the [...] "active" [...] IRA men were teachers; medical students; shoe-makers and boot-makers; those engaged in building trades like painters, carpenters, bricklayers, etc.; draper's assistants; and creamery workers. The Canadian historian Peter Hart wrote [...] "...the guerrillas were disproportionately skilled, trained and urban". Farmers and fishermen tended to be underrepresented in the IRA. Those Irishmen engaged in white-collar trades or working as skilled labourers were much more likely to be involved in cultural nationalist groups like the Gaelic League than farmers or fishermen, and thus to have a stronger sense of Irish nationalism. Furthermore, the authority of the Crown tended to be stronger in towns and cities than in the countryside and as such those engaged in Irish nationalist activities in urban areas were much more likely to come into conflict with the Crown, thus leading to a greater chance of radicalisation. Finally, the British tactic of blowing up the homes of IRA members had the effect of discouraging many farmers from joining the struggle as the destruction of the family farm could easily reduce a farmer and his family to destitution. Of the [...] "active" [...] IRA members, three-quarters were in their late teens or early 20s and only 5% of the [...] "active" [...] men were in the age range of 40 or older. The [...] "active" [...] members were overwhelmingly single men with only 4% being married or engaged in a relationship. The life of an [...] "active" [...] IRA man with its stress of living on the run and constantly being in hiding tended to attract single men who could adjust to this lifestyle far more easily than a man in a relationship. Furthermore, the IRA preferred to recruit single men as it was found that singles could devote themselves more wholeheartedly to the struggle.|$|E
