This diploma thesis inspects the Eduroam {{wireless network}} that is known to be very safe; however, it still shows some security vulnerabilities. The aim of the thesis was to eliminate these vulnerabilities by making use of low-cost access points. The first part of the thesis describes the Eduroam network, its structure, advantages, and disadvantages that we could overcome in order to provide the users with greater security when using the network. We describe the idea of separating users into <b>virtual</b> <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks,</b> thereby preventing the attackers to carry out the ARP table poisoning attack. The user isolation makes the attackers use their own network.
