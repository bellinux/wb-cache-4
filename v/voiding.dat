5|$|Lesnar's next {{opponent}} was Big Show and Heyman {{was convinced}} {{more than anyone}} that Lesnar could not win, trying {{to talk him out}} of defending the title. Lesnar refused and defended the title against Show at Survivor Series on November 17, Lesnar performed an F-5 on Show, but Heyman pulled the referee out of the ring, <b>voiding</b> the pinfall. This allowed Show to chokeslam Lesnar on a steel chair to win the title. This loss was Lesnar's first pinfall loss in WWE and led Lesnar to turn into a fan favorite. Following Survivor Series, Heyman made it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch, and had snuck a special clause saying so into his contract. In order to gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman, Lesnar interfered in his first title defense, which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon on December 15, where Lesnar executed the F-5 on Big Show, which enabled Angle to pin him and win the title. On the following episode of SmackDown!, however, Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and, despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening, declared that Lesnar still would not get it. Lesnar's rivalry with Heyman and Big Show resumed, which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2003 with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble later in the evening. On January 19, Lesnar would defeat Show and entered the Royal Rumble match as the No. 29 entry, the second to last competitor to enter the match. He eliminated Matt Hardy and The World's Greatest Tag Team, which was composed of Charlie Haas and his former OVW teammate Shelton Benjamin, who were mentored by Angle. Lesnar would then eliminate The Undertaker last and win the Royal Rumble, which guaranteed him a title match at WrestleMania XIX. After the Royal Rumble, Lesnar and Chris Benoit defeated Angle, Haas and Benjamin at No Way Out on February 23. During the match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, Lesnar botched a shooting star press, a move he had done numerous times in developmental matches, and jammed his head and neck. This stunned Lesnar and forced Angle and Lesnar to improvise the finish of the match – a pinfall by Lesnar that allowed him to win his second WWE Championship. Lesnar was diagnosed with a concussion from the botched shooting star press.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{possible}} magnetization of cosmic <b>voids</b> by <b>void</b> galaxies. Recently, observations revealed isolated starforming galaxies within the <b>voids.</b> Furthermore, a major {{fraction of a}} <b>voids</b> volume {{is expected to be}} filled with magnetic fields of a minimum strength of about $ 10 ^{- 15 }$ G on Mpc scales. We estimate the transport of magnetic energy by cosmic rays (CR) from the <b>void</b> galaxies into the <b>voids.</b> We assume that CRs and winds are able to leave small isolated <b>void</b> galaxies shortly after they assembled, and then propagate within the <b>voids.</b> For a typical <b>void,</b> we estimate the magnetic field strength and volume filling factor depending on its <b>void</b> galaxy population and possible contributions of strong active galactic nuclei (AGN) which border the <b>voids.</b> We argue that the lower limit on the <b>void</b> magnetic field can be recovered, if {{a small fraction of the}} magnetic energy contained in the <b>void</b> galaxies or <b>void</b> bordering AGNs is distributed within the <b>voids.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, accepted to MNRAS Letters after moderate revisio...|$|R

Over the range 30 - 200 Mpc/h the <b>void</b> auto-correlation is detected at 5 -sigma significance for <b>voids</b> of radius 15 - 20 Mpc/h. We also measure the void-galaxy cross-correlation at higher signal-to-noise and compare the inferred <b>void</b> bias with the autocorrelation results. <b>Void</b> bias is constant with scale for <b>voids</b> of a given size, but its value falls from 5. 6 +/- 1. 0 to below zero as the <b>void</b> radius increases from 15 to 30 Mpc/h.

25|$|The bladder {{can be made}} to {{contract}} by voluntary facilitation of the spinal <b>voiding</b> reflex when it contains only a few milliliters of urine.

This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder. The reflex hyperactivity is made worse, and may be caused, by infection in the bladder wall.|$|E

30|$|<b>Voids</b> {{are crucial}} point defects that are {{inevitable}} during fabrication and deformation of materials. Nanocrystals with <b>voids</b> have many unique properties, including lattice orientation sensitivity [6 – 8], size-dependent yielding stresses [6, 9, 10], <b>void</b> volume fraction-dependent elastic modulus [11], and <b>void</b> shape effect on stress concentration [11]. Considerable {{efforts have been}} devoted to investigate the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of <b>voids.</b> Specifically, <b>void</b> growth has been proven to be governed by a dislocation-emission-based mechanism [12]. It is found that dislocation loops carrying outward flux of matters are nucleated at <b>void</b> surfaces [9, 13]. Simulations performed by Seppala et al. are focused on <b>void</b> coalescence, involving both single and double <b>voids</b> cases [14]. It is revealed that the onset of <b>void</b> coalescence occurs when the intervoid ligament distance reaches approximately one <b>void</b> radius.

40|$|Nucleation of <b>voids</b> via the {{stochastic}} {{accumulation of}} vacancies is considered when one-dimensionally migrating self-interstitials are present. A system instability signaling a non-equilibrium phase transition {{is found to}} occur when the mean free path of the one-dimensionally moving self-interstitials becomes comparable with the average distance between the <b>voids</b> at a sufficiently high void-number density. At this point, due to the exponential dependence of <b>void</b> nucleation probability on the net vacancy flux, the nucleation of <b>voids</b> is much more favored at the <b>void</b> lattice positions. At the same time, <b>voids</b> initially nucleated at positions where neighboring <b>voids</b> are non-aligned will shrink away. The shrinkage of non-aligned <b>voids</b> is caused entirely by the stochastic fluctuations in point-defect fluxes received by the <b>voids.</b> These two processes leave the aligned <b>voids</b> to form a regular lattice.

40|$|CONTEXT: Cosmic <b>voids</b> are {{observed}} {{in the distribution of}} galaxies and, to some extent, in the dark matter distribution. If these distributions have fractal geometry, it must be reflected in the geometry of voids; in particular, we expect scaling sizes of <b>voids.</b> However, this scaling is not well demonstrated in galaxy surveys yet. AIMS: Our objective is to understand the geometry of cosmic <b>voids</b> in relation to a fractal structure of matter. We intend to distinguish monofractal <b>voids</b> from multifractal <b>voids,</b> regarding their scaling properties. We plan to analyse <b>voids</b> in the distributions of mass concentrations (halos) in a multifractal and their relation to galaxy <b>voids.</b> METHODS: We make a statistical analysis of point distributions based on the <b>void</b> probability function and correlation functions. We assume that <b>voids</b> are spherical and devise a simple spherical <b>void</b> finder. For continuous mass distributions, we employ the methods of fractal geometry. We confirm the analytical predictions with numerical simulations. Smoothed mass distributions are suitable for the method of excursion sets. RESULTS: <b>Voids</b> are very nonlinear and non-perturbative structures. <b>Voids</b> reflect the fractal geometry of the matter distribution but not always directly: scaling sizes of <b>voids</b> imply fractal geometry, but fractal <b>voids</b> may have a complicated geometry and may not have scaling sizes. Proper multifractal <b>voids</b> are of this type. A natural multifractal biasing model implies that the <b>voids</b> in the galaxy distribution inherit the same complicated geometry. CONCLUSIONS: Current galaxy surveys as well as cosmological N-body simulations indicate that cosmic <b>voids</b> are proper multifractal <b>voids.</b> This implies the presence in the <b>voids</b> of galaxies or, at least, small dark matter halos.
