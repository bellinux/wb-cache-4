40|$|The next {{generation}} of combustor technology {{will be required to}} meet the demands of a world more focused on greenhouse gases and global warming. Due to this new focus on emission control, combustors must produce less NO x, while operating in a higher pressure environment that is more prone to combustion instabilities. ^ This work focuses on the development of a lab and combustor that will be used for the {{next generation}} combustor development. The lab development includes layout and organization, facilities, measurement and instrumentation, automation of the testing process, and an imaging tool for diagnostics. ^ A Lean Direction Injection (LDI) single element combustor has been designed, built, and tested. Results included chemiluminescence imaging and measurements of combustion instabilities. Initial results are promising for future controls and combustion development. ^ A three axis translation table has been developed to support diagnostic efforts. Initial performance measurements indicate the table will be capable of fast scanning of flames compared to other translation options. In addition to achieving the desired performance, the size of the table was kept compact without sacrificing travel, allowing more access to the burners, and more burners to be mounted onto the table. ^ One of the first projects will be the application of the Laser-induced Fluorescence Triple-integration Method (LIFTIME) method to the LDI to assist combustion controls development. After the experience gained with the charge coupled device (CCD) camera, we see potential to use this in parallel with the LIFTIME system to better map the flame. The image processing capabilities of the LabVIEW software have been briefly explored, and look promising as a method for automated flame geometry analysis to improve the flame mapping. ^ In addition to the application of LIFTIME to the LDI, the exploration of the combustion control using the <b>variable</b> <b>injector</b> position, and the variable impedance exit area will begin. ^ Due to the work presented in this thesis, a fully-functional combustion lab is available for current and future students, and more in-depth combustion research can now begin. In addition to providing resources for the students of our research group, this lab will continue to support Senior Design students as well as those in graduate level combustion courses. ...|$|E

These components {{are intended for}} use on a Variable Cycle Engine. The forward <b>Variable</b> Area Bypass <b>Injector</b> test demonstrated the mode shifting capability between single and double bypass operation with less than predicted aerodynamic losses in the bypass duct. The acoustic nozzle test demonstrated that coannular noise suppression was between 4 and 6 PNdB in the aft quadrant.

40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on a new type of injector which can be used very advantageously in rocket engines designed for throttling applications. The aim is to keep the drop size constant for varying chamber pressures. The injector uses very small quantities of a gas to atomize a straight liquid jet before discharging into the combustion chamber. The concept is demonstrated over an eightfold variation of injector pressure drop. A feedback control system, which can regulate the air pressure with respect to the sensed chamber pressure, based on the input transfer function, so as to keep the drop size constant, is suggested. The transfer function is obtained from the experimental data. The major advantage of this injector is that it uses a very small quantity of gas, thereby limiting the weight penalty to a minimum. This system is much less complicated compared to <b>variable</b> area <b>injector</b> and cavitating venturi valves used for this purpose...|$|R

40|$|This thesis evaluates a <b>variable</b> {{blockage}} low-swirl <b>injector</b> {{operated on}} digester gas in a simulated boiler environment {{to understand how}} such a device can impact combustion performance as fuel composition varies. California, like many other states, is requiring a reduction in emissions from primary sources of electricity generation. As emission regulations become stricter, novel strategies for achieving the reductions required are required. The current energy policy in California specifically promotes the use of renewable and carbon neutral fuels such as digester gas. The future generations of burners must be fuel flexible {{in order to meet}} these emission laws while providing continual operation. To address this, a <b>variable</b> geometry low-swirl <b>injector</b> was developed and its emissions and stability performance assessed using a variety of diagnostics. It was found that a fiber optic probe, integrated into the injector head, was able to provide a reliable measure of emissions and stability. One key result from the optical probe is that the recorded radiation emitted by the reaction corresponding to the lean blow off limits of any composition of digester gas remains constant, implying it could serve as a robust stability sensor with minimal signal processing. Evaluating the role of the variable geometry found that (1) variable center blockage in a low-swirl injector has no effect on the lean blow off limits, (2) as the center blockage becomes less restrictive the NOx emissions will increase, and (3) incorporation of a quarl expansion rather than a sudden expansion increased the lean blow off limits and gave a 50 % reduction in NOx emissions. Utilizing a low-swirl injector with high blockage in the central flow, high swirl number, can reduce the NOx emissions across the range of lean operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Revolutionary Turbine Accelerator (RTA) /Turbine Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) {{project is}} {{investigating}} turbine-based propulsion systems {{for access to}} space. NASA Glenn Research Center and GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE) planned to develop a ground demonstrator engine for validation testing. The demonstrator (RTA- 1) is a variable cycle, turbofan ramjet designed to transition from an augmented turbofan to a ramjet that produces the thrust required to accelerate the vehicle from Sea Level Static (SLS) to Mach 4. The RTA- 1 is designed to accommodate a large variation in bypass ratios from sea level static to Mach 4 conditions.

40|$|NASA's Propulsion and Cryogenic Advanced Development (PCAD) {{project is}} {{currently}} developing enabling propulsion technologies {{in support of}} future lander missions. To meet lander requirements, several technical challenges need to be overcome, {{one of which is}} the ability for the descent engine(s) to operate over a deep throttle range with cryogenic propellants. To address this need, PCAD has enlisted Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems (NGAS) in a technology development effort associated with the TR 202 engine. The TR 202 is a LOX/LH 2 expander cycle engine driven by independent turbopump assemblies and featuring a <b>variable</b> area pintle <b>injector</b> similar to the injector used on the TR 200 Apollo Lunar Module Descent Engine (LMDE). Since the Apollo missions, NGAS has continued to mature deep throttling pintle injector technology. The TR 202 program has completed two series of pintle injector testing. The first series of testing used ablative thrust chambers and demonstrated igniter operation as well as stable performance at discrete points throughout the designed 10 : 1 throttle range. The second series was conducted with calorimeter chambers and demonstrated injector performance at discrete points throughout the throttle range as well as chamber heat flow adequate to power an expander cycle design across the throttle range. This paper provides an overview of the TR 202 program, describing the different phases and key milestones. It describes how test data was correlated to the engine conceptual design. The test data obtained has created a valuable database for deep throttling cryogenic pintle technology, a technology that is readily scalable in thrust level...|$|R
40|$|A new-generation common feeding (CF) fuel {{injection}} system without rail has been compared with the standard common rail (CR) apparatus for diesel engine passenger cars. The high-pressure pump in the CF apparatus is connected directly to the injectors, and a volume of about 2. 5 cm 3 is integrated at the pump delivery. Experimental tests on solenoid injectors {{have been carried out}} for the CF and CR apparatus at a hydraulic test rig. The dependence of the injected volumes and total injector leakages on the energizing time (ET) of the two systems has been investigated for different rail pressure levels. Furthermore, the measured injected flow-rates of the CF and CR systems have been compared for single and pilot-main injection events. In general, the injection performance of the two systems is very similar, even though the differences occur in the high-pressure transients. The dynamics of the pressure waves changes because the high-pressure hydraulic layouts of the two systems are different, and the propagation and reflection of the rarefaction waves, triggered by the injection events, occur in different ways. A previously developed one-dimensional (1 D) code for the CF high-pressure layout has been further validated by means of a comparison with the experimental data. The effects of either a calibrated orifice installed at the pump delivery or an injector-integrated Minirail on the CF performance have been investigated by means of the model. Numerical parametrical tests have also been conducted on the pump-to-injector pipe length. The additional orifices that can be installed in the high-pressure circuit of the CF are effective, provided their diameter is smaller than the diameter of any other orifice inserted in the injector. Furthermore, the presence of a Minirail within the injector has an impact on the injected flow-rates of small injections, such as pilot, pre, after, and post, and also induces a reduction in the energy stored in the pressure waves. Another relevant active damping strategy of the pressure waves for the CF involves shortening the pump-to-injector pipe as much as possible. Finally, the fluid dynamical transients within the solenoid injector have been discussed for the CF and CR systems. The numerical time distributions of the main <b>variables</b> within the <b>injector</b> are shown to be independent of the presence of the rail in the layou...|$|R
