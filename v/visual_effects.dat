5|$|The <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> {{supervisor}} {{for the season}} was Mark Kolpack, with Los Angeles-based <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> company FuseFX the main <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> vendor. Kevin Lingenfelser started the season focused on 2D supervising, but took over as lead in-house <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> supervisor after episode eight from David Altenau. Two separate production management and creative teams were established {{to work on the}} show, with most of the episodes being worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time.|$|E
5|$|Chris Townsend {{served as}} <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> {{supervisor}} for the film, which featured over 2,000 <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> shots and was worked on by 17 studios, including Weta Digital, Digital Domain, Scanline VFX, Trixter, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Fuel VFX, Cantina Creative, Cinesite, The Embassy <b>Visual</b> <b>Effects,</b> Lola, Capital T, Prologue and Rise FX. Townsend said that from January 2013 {{through the end}} of filming in April, the collective crew had one day of downtime, otherwise working seven days a week and 14 to 18 hours a day.|$|E

Musical <b>Effect</b> and <b>Visual</b> <b>Effect</b> are scored separately, {{each with a}} {{repertoire}} and show score, added together to get a total Musical <b>Effect</b> and <b>Visual</b> <b>Effect</b> score. The sum of these two total scores is the corps' overall Effect Score.|$|R
5|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 was {{nominated}} for Best Art Direction and Best <b>Visual</b> <b>Effects</b> at the 83rd Academy Awards. It is the second film in the Harry Potter film series to be nominated for a <b>Visual</b> <b>Effects</b> Oscar (the previous one being Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban). The film was long-listed for eight different categories, including Best Cinematography, Production Design, and Original Score, at the 64th BAFTA awards, and ultimately {{was nominated}} for Best Special <b>Visual</b> <b>Effects</b> and Make-up.|$|E
5|$|Impressed {{with the}} film's script, V. Srinivas Mohan became the <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> {{supervisor}} in December2007. He asked Shankar {{to increase the}} filming schedules by six months to include pre-production requirements. Both Mohan and Shankar visited several <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> companies, including the New Zealand-based Weta Digital and the United States-based Industrial Light & Magic, Cafe FX and Tippett Studio before partnering with Legacy Effects. The original Eros-Ayngaran <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> budget was 700million, but after Sun Pictures took over production, it was significantly reduced to 200million. As a result, the <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> team had to omit and alter some sequences, making Chitti wear sunglasses {{for most of the}} film to reduce the cost and difficultly of animating his eyes.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> in {{the film}} were {{nominated}} for an Oscar. The film also won the BAFTA Award for Best Special <b>Visual</b> <b>Effects</b> at the 65th BAFTA Awards in 2012.|$|E

Also in April {{it was reported}} that Warner Bros. raised the <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> budget by $9 million and hired additional <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> studios to bolster the ranks of the team that had been working overtime to meet the film's June 17 launch.|$|E
5|$|John Dykstra, {{who won the}} Academy Award for <b>Visual</b> <b>Effects</b> for {{his work}} on Spider-Man 2, {{declined}} to work on the third film as <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> supervisor. Dykstra's colleague, Scott Stokdyk, took his place as supervisor, leading two hundred programmers at Sony Pictures Imageworks. This group designed specific computer programs that did not exist when Spider-Man 3 began production, creating nine hundred <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> shots.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Visual</b> <b>Effects</b> Society {{nominated}} it for Best <b>Visual</b> <b>Effects</b> and Best Compositing.

5|$|The <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> for Doomsday {{stemmed from}} the 1980s stunt-based films, {{involving}} approximately 275 <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> shots. While filmmakers did not seek innovative <b>visual</b> <b>effects,</b> they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions. With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved matte paint and 2D and 3D solutions. The <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds. Several challenges for the <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> crew included the illustration of cow overpopulation in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances. The most challenging <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> shot in Doomsday was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive. The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning pigskin, and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.|$|E
5|$|The <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> for The Revenant were {{produced}} primarily by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). Other companies, such as Moving Picture Company (MPC) and Cinesite, also created <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> for the film.|$|E

5|$|At the 79th Academy Awards, <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> {{supervisors}} John Knoll, Hal Hickel, Charles Gibson, and Allen Hall won an Oscar for Best <b>Visual</b> <b>Effects,</b> {{which was}} also the first time since 1994's Forrest Gump that Industrial Light & Magic had received that particular Academy Award. The film was also nominated for Best Art Direction, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing.|$|E
5|$|Camera crews spent 10 {{days from}} November 5–18, 2005 to film {{sequences}} that would involve intense <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin {{work on the}} shots early in the project.

5|$|Cuarón {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} {{with his son}} Jonás and attempted to develop the film at Universal Pictures. Later, the distribution rights were acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures. David Heyman, who previously worked with Cuarón on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), produced the film with him. Gravity was produced entirely in the United Kingdom, where British <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> company Framestore spent {{more than three years}} creating most of the film's <b>visual</b> <b>effects,</b> which make up over 80 of its 91 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Muren and Industrial Light & Magic's <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> {{department}} won the Academy Award for Best <b>Visual</b> <b>Effects</b> at the 57th Academy Awards. Soundtrack composer John Williams was, as he {{had been}} for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, again nominated for Original Music Score. The <b>visual</b> <b>effects</b> crew won the same category at the 38th British Academy Film Awards. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, editor Michael Kahn, Ben Burtt and other sound designers at Skywalker Sound received nominations. Spielberg, the writers, Harrison Ford, Jonathan Ke Quan, Anthony Powell and makeup designer Tom Smith were nominated for their work at the Saturn Awards.
