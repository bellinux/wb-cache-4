25|$|These {{assumptions}} might not, {{and probably}} do not, reflect the actual {{conditions of the}} market in which the subject business might be sold.

25|$|For many {{classes of}} options, {{traditional}} <b>valuation</b> <b>techniques</b> are intractable {{because of the}} complexity of the instrument. In these cases, a Monte Carlo approach may often be useful. Rather than attempt to solve the differential equations of motion that describe the option's value in relation to the underlying security's price, a Monte Carlo model uses simulation to generate random price paths of the underlying asset, each of which results in a payoff for the option. The average of these payoffs can be discounted to yield an expectation value for the option. Note though, that despite its flexibility, using simulation for American styled options is somewhat more complex than for lattice based models.|$|E

This study examined the relevance of contemporary <b>valuation</b> <b>technique</b> in the {{determination of}} buy-out value of leasehold properties in Uyo, Nigeria. Data for the study were collected from 348 residential investment properties and 18 registered valuers in the city through field survey, using multi- stage sampling technique. Results of data analysis show evidence of periodic rental reviews in the residential property market, the expected rent review pattern being 2. 9366 years (say 3 years). In the market valuation of leasehold residential properties in the city, {{it was found that the}} buy-out value of leasehold interest obtained using contemporary technique was 7. 31 % higher than that obtained using the conventional <b>valuation</b> <b>technique.</b> The study recommends the adoption of contemporary <b>valuation</b> <b>technique</b> in the determination of buy-out value of leasehold properties in the city as the conventional <b>valuation</b> <b>technique</b> used by valuers in the city for such valuation is not sensitive enough to interpret the realities of the property market due to its inability to incorporate rental growth and rent review frequency in its computation...|$|R
5000|$|For instance, {{the price}} of an option based on Black-Scholes and market implied volatility. Within this level, fair value is {{estimated}} using a <b>valuation</b> <b>technique.</b> Significant assumptions or inputs used in the <b>valuation</b> <b>technique</b> {{requires the use of}} inputs that are observable in the market. Examples of observable market inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets, interest rates, yield curve, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, etc. In addition, assumptions used in estimating fair value must be assumptions that an unrelated party would use in estimating fair value. Notably, FASB indicates that assumptions enter into models that use Level 2 inputs, a condition that reduces the precision of the outputs (estimated fair values), but nonetheless produces reliable numbers that are representationally faithful, verifiable and neutral.|$|R

2500|$|Corporate finance {{deals with}} the sources funding and the capital {{structure}} of corporations, the actions that managers take to increase {{the value of the}} firm to the shareholders, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources. [...] Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms. [...] Corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability, while attempting to maximize an entity's assets, net incoming cash flow and the value of its stock, and generically entails three primary areas of capital resource allocation. In the first, [...] "capital budgeting", management must choose which [...] "projects" [...] (if any) to undertake. The discipline of capital budgeting may employ standard business <b>valuation</b> <b>techniques</b> or even extend to real options valuation; see Financial modeling. [...] The second, [...] "sources of capital" [...] relates to how these investments are to be funded: investment capital can be provided through different sources, such as by shareholders, in the form of equity (privately or via an initial public offering), creditors, often in the form of bonds, and the firm's operations (cash flow). Short-term funding or working capital is mostly provided by banks extending a line of credit. The balance between these elements forms the company's capital structure. [...] The third, [...] "the dividend policy", requires management to determine whether any unappropriated profit (excess cash) is to be retained for future investment / operational requirements, or instead to be distributed to shareholders, and if so, in what form. [...] Short term financial management is often termed [...] "working capital management", and relates to cash-, inventory- and debtors management.|$|E

Some further computational results are included for completeness. A proof of the basic analytical theorem is given, as is the analysis needed to solve the inverse problem of determining local (one-factor) volatility from market data. The ideas behind a fast accurate revised simplex method, whose performance is linear {{in time and space}} discretizations, are described and the practicalities of fitting the volatility smile are discussed. Numerical results are presented which show the LP <b>valuation</b> <b>technique</b> to be extremely fast-lattice speed with PDE accuracy.

40|$|Many large {{projects}} {{held over}} the last few decades in Europe have been based on the enhancement of community goods as a strategy to put in place sustainable urban regeneration. The inclusive nature of these goods and the social importance of the related decision-making processes suggests the need to involve the relevant community and to take into account its intentions and wishes regarding planning and organization. Therefore, before even starting to plan possible interventions, it is crucial to know what the members of the community think about the good in terms of social appreciation, in order to achieve socially sustainable choices. This paper offers a method to measure the social appreciation of community goods and describes the following: (a) deliberative esteem value technology to measure the social appreciation based on a combination between stated preference techniques and deliberative methods; (b) the criterion and methodology of the <b>valuation</b> <b>technique</b> proposed; and (c) an experimental application of the <b>valuation</b> <b>technique</b> pertinent to the specific case of the East Elevated Expressway of Rome...|$|R

A suitable methodology for accurately estimating the current financial standing of each project in a portfolio of IT projects over the full project lifecycle is useful for IT managers to understand IT value creation and manage the IT projects across the portfolio. In line with this perspective, we propose a Mark-to-Market <b>valuation</b> <b>technique</b> that enables a standardized approach across diverse IT projects that comprise the IT portfolio. Three main contributions may be drawn from this study: 1) the Mark-to-Market approach is a useful <b>valuation</b> <b>technique</b> in the context of IT projects; 2) practitioners may leverage the technique to assess project value and the performance of the IT portfolio over the lifecycle of such projects; and 3) the consistent treatment of each project allows aggregation and applications of standard portfolio management techniques to the practice of IT portfolio management...|$|R
