5|$|Because of {{the viewer}} {{backlash}} Animal Planet received for allowing meerkats from the Meerkat Manor series to die, the producers of the film debated including the filmed death of a young meerkat who was bitten by a snake. They questioned whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the research area under a strictly enforced agreement not {{to interfere with the}} meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it lay dying were edited out. Other meerkat deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform {{on the side of a}} truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially out of the truck to hold the camera steady, giving the <b>visual</b> <b>impression</b> of a truck bearing down on a meerkat. To provide bird and snake footage, professional handlers were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a <b>visual</b> <b>impression</b> of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E

Design-patterns produced by "the dynamical system defined by iterations of discrete Laplacians on the plane lattice" were adopted as stimuli because they were not only complex, but also defined mathematically. In the experiment, 21 graduate and undergraduate students sorted 102 design-patterns into several groups by <b>visual</b> <b>impressions.</b> Those 102 patterns were classified into 12 categories by the cluster analysis. The results showed that the regularity of pattern was a most efficient factor for determining <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> of design-pattern, and there were some correspondence between <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> and mathematical variables of design-pattern.

40|$|Abstract: We have {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> of black fabrics and their image features {{from the viewpoint of}} Kansei engineering. The term "Kansei " means "human sensibility", and Kansei engineering is an approach to connect the human sensibility to engineering applications. This study aims to present some basic information to connect the <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> for the texture characteristics of fabrics arisen from Kansei with features obtained by image processing. In this paper, some techniques of image analysis in order to analyze some of the <b>visual</b> <b>impressions,</b> such as blackness, formality and warmth of the black fabrics are discussed. We carry out a sensory vision test on various and typical black fabrics and derive texture characteristics from image features by digital image processing. Mechanical properties of the fabrics were also measured, since <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> of fabrics often correspond to mechanical characteristics caused not only from yarn structures but also from fibrous features. We unify these results using a statistical analysis to find relationships between the human <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> measured by the sensory test and the texture characteristics obtained by the image processing techniques as well as the measurement of mechanical properties. It is found by this study that differences in the <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> of texture characteristics are derived better using the image features by the digital image processing than using the mechanical properties, and it is realized to classif...|$|R

Roman civil engineers developed the design and constructed highly refined structures using only simple materials, equipment, and mathematics. This type is still used in canal viaducts and roadways as it has a pleasing shape, particularly when spanning water, as the reflections of the arches form a <b>visual</b> <b>impression</b> of circles or ellipses.|$|E

30|$|To {{demonstrate}} the psychophysical effects of edge-grain patterns on <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> received by human observers, we used sensory evaluation {{to assess the}} <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> of various edge-grain patterns using printed images, which were well regulated by image processing. We computed contrast values as the image characteristics of each pattern {{on the basis of}} a one-dimensional MRCA and determined the optimal filter size in MRCA that was congenial to each impression. Although a few impressions such as Close were almost independent of the contrast values, the contrast values and other impressions, such as Varied and Elegant, were highly correlated (positively or negatively). In addition, these relations were robust, and they were rarely influenced by the color information. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed contrast value can provide a good numerical index that not only expresses image characteristics of the edge-grain patterns but also estimates some of their <b>visual</b> <b>impressions.</b>|$|R

30|$|The unique {{appearance}} of wood, which {{is characterized by}} warm colors, varied grain patterns, mellow gloss, and so on, has various psychological effects on observers. Nyrud and Bringslimark [1] pointed out in their review article that the affective responses of human observers to wood provided psychologically beneficial effects. To determine more precisely {{the nature of these}} desirable effects, relationships between the surface properties of wood and <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> of the surfaces have been examined. In some reports [2 – 6], the surface properties were assessed on the basis of subjective evaluations by human graders, the <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> were reported by human observers, and the relationships between them were investigated using various multivariate analyses. In other reports [7 – 13], the surface properties were converted into numerical characteristics by image analyses and were compared with the <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> that were evaluated subjectively. However, there have not been many systematic investigations considering those properties of the surfaces that brought about visual effects. In other studies, the authors developed a multi-resolution contrast analysis (MRCA) to describe the change in the {{appearance of}} lumber surfaces numerically [14, 15]. MRCA employs a computation algorithm that considers the human vision system and derives characteristic values that correspond to the surface attributes. However, our verification of how well the image characteristics derived by MRCA corresponds with the <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> has not been satisfactory.|$|R

The team wanted the audio drama to be the [...] "direct opposite" [...] to the upbeat feel and happy ending of X-2. This wish for a more melancholy atmosphere resulted in them bringing Sin, the main antagonistic force in X, back into the story, as the team wanted to keep it involved in a similar fashion to Sephiroth, the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. The drama's open ending was also intentional, as Kitase [...] "wanted to leave something up to the player's imagination." ...|$|E

30|$|To {{demonstrate}} the psychophysical effect of edge-grain patterns on <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> received by human observers, printed {{images of the}} edge-grain patterns of 16 species were prepared as well-regulated <b>visual</b> stimuli, and <b>impressions</b> of the patterns on 32 subjects were evaluated using six categories. Image characteristics of the patterns were expressed numerically using contrast values that were derived by multi-resolution contrast analysis (MRCA) proposed by the authors, and relationships between the image characteristics and the <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> were examined. The difference in lightness between local areas with a certain size in the image {{was used as the}} contrast value, which could be used to detect the change in lightness due to the particular feature in the edge-grain pattern. While some impressions were almost independent of the contrast values, other impressions showed highly positive or negative linear relationships to the contrast values, derived at the optimal filter size in MRCA. Moreover, these optimal sizes were rarely affected by color information. The contrast value proposed in this paper would be a good numerical index that could be used not only to describe image characteristics of the edge-grain patterns but also to estimate some of their <b>visual</b> <b>impressions.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to demonstrate the psychophysical effects of the grain patterns on the <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> received by human observers. To approach this issue as systematically as possible, it is necessary that the shape, color, and gloss of the grain patterns be controlled using prepared photographic specimens. To simplify the shape-related problem, edge-grain patterns were preferred because these were considered as relatively simple stripes. To reduce the color-related problem, all patterns were converted to digital images, and their color attributes were regulated by image processing. To avoid the gloss-related problem, all images were printed on the same photographic paper. Image characteristics of the edge-grain patterns were calculated by MRCA, and the <b>visual</b> <b>impressions</b> of the patterns were assessed by sensory evaluation.|$|R

In addition, Takahara designed the outfit along the same lines as the asymmetric designs common to Roen's clothing lines. His outfit was designed to make Noctis look like someone who went to a high-class pub. Unlike previous protagonists, a real set of Noctis' clothes was created by Roen and kept in the office for reference by the development staff: this was due to previous experiences when Nomura had been constantly asked what materials his characters' outfits were made of by the graphics teams. An aspect of his design central to the story was a ring he wore on his right hand, while the gloves he wore were simply for [...] "design purposes". Noctis' original design when the game was first revealed was a temporary one used while his final look was being created. It was based on the game's script to give a <b>visual</b> <b>impression</b> in trailers. Takahara also designed a formal suit worn by the character in the opening section of the game. All Roen designs, including Noctis' suit, were retained when Versus XIII was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV as the team felt wrong about removing them despite the other changes.|$|E
