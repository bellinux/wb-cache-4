5|$|The Brooksville Tunnel is {{the most}} {{difficult}} work of the kind, I have seen any record of: at the Western entrance, the pressure of the big slides actually causes the bottom to surge up, as is sometime the case in coal mines; in view of the sliding tendency and immense pressure of this ground, it will be advisable to enter on that side with an invested arch to prevent a collapse...This work is <b>vastly</b> <b>more</b> difficult than the Greenwood Tunnel was, though it was not, by any means, an easy safe job.|$|E
5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, {{the brightest star}} in the night sky as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being <b>vastly</b> <b>more</b> luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} {{of both the}} car and Webber, who had certainly worked well to out-qualify his <b>vastly</b> <b>more</b> experienced teammate, was highlighted by the closeness they had to other teams which ran the Renault engine and although the Adrian Newey-designed car had flaws which contributed to Webber's scoreless season to that point. Though {{the pace of the}} car seemed to be picking up, with Coulthard qualifying in the top-10 for the , Webber was unable to convert his early weekend pace into a competitive grid position due to hydraulic problems. His race was much the same with a similar hydraulic problem leading to him retiring early in the race whilst teammate Coulthard notched up the team's first points with a fifth-place finish.|$|E

5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the <b>vastly</b> <b>more</b> heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E

25|$|Classical economists, {{beginning}} with Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus, argued that high wages in the West stimulated labor-saving technological advancements.

25|$|Certain critiques {{have pointed}} out that the data from individual, {{established}} language families that is cited in Nostratic comparisons often involves a high degree of errors; Campbell (1998) demonstrates this for Uralic data. Defenders of the Nostratic theory argue that were this to be true, it would remain that in classifying languages genetically, positives count for <b>vastly</b> <b>more</b> than negatives (Ruhlen 1994). The reason for this is that, above a certain threshold, resemblances in sound/meaning correspondences are highly improbable mathematically.|$|E
