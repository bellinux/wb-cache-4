5000|$|According to French law, {{banks are}} liable for any {{transaction}} {{made with a}} copy of the original card and for any transaction made without a card (on the phone or on the Internet), so banks have to pay back any fraudulent transaction to the card holder if the previous criteria are met. Fighting card fraud is therefore more interesting for banks. As a consequence, French banks websites usually propose an [...] "e-card" [...] service ("electronic (bank) card"), where a new <b>virtual</b> <b>card</b> is created and linked to a physical card. Such <b>virtual</b> <b>card</b> can be used only once and for the maximum amount given by the card holder.

50|$|In 2003, {{the company}} {{launched}} the Neteller Card {{and a few}} years later in 2008 the card product line was later rebranded as Net+. Under the Net+ name the company offers MasterCard prepaid debit cards and merchant-brandable card programs, and formerly offered virtual cards. The Net+ <b>virtual</b> <b>card</b> generated a different <b>virtual</b> <b>card</b> number for each transaction instead of having a fixed card number, preventing some forms of fraud. If unauthorised users obtain and try to use card numbers, or if an otherwise legitimate merchant tries to take additional, unauthorised, payments, the transaction fails as the card number cannot be re-used. In November 2016, the company cancelled Net+ cards service without refunding the card fees.|$|E

Those rules are configured from the switching controller application using OpenFlow. As each <b>virtual</b> WLAN <b>card</b> is associated to one AP, choosing a <b>virtual</b> WLAN <b>card</b> for transmission results in a transmission to a specific AP. Rewriting of the source MAC address is required, since MAC frames generated by the operating system carry the MAC address of the super virtual WLAN device as source. To be transparent to the underlying network, the MAC address of the respective <b>virtual</b> WLAN <b>card</b> is used instead.|$|R

40|$|Performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in {{clinical}} populations {{can be interpreted}} only in relation to established base line performance in normal populations. As in all comparisons of assessment tools, the normal base line must reflect performance under conditions in which subjects can function at their best levels. In this review, we show {{that a number of}} variables enhance IGT performance in non-clinical participants. First, optimal performance is produced by having participants turn over real <b>cards</b> while viewing <b>virtual</b> <b>cards</b> on a computer screen. The use of only <b>virtual</b> <b>cards</b> results in significantly lower performance than the combination of real + <b>virtual</b> <b>cards.</b> Secondly, administration of more than 100 trials also enhances performance. When using the real/virtual card procedure, performance is shown to significantly increase from early adolescence through young adulthood. Under these conditions young (mean age 19 years) and older (mean age 59 years) adults perform equally. Females, as a group, score lower than males because females tend to choose cards from high-frequency-of-gain Deck B. Groups of females with high or low gonadal hormones perform equally. Concurrent tasks, e. g., presentation of aromas, decrease performance in males. Age and gender effects are discussed in terms of a dynamic between testosterone and orbital prefrontal cortex...|$|R
