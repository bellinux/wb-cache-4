[...] The {{children}} born of thee are sword and fire, [...] Red ruin, and the breaking up of laws, [...] The craft of kindred and the Godless hosts [...] Of heathen swarming o'er the Northern Sea; [...] Whom I, while yet Sir Lancelot, my right arm, [...] The mightiest of my knights, abode with me, [...] Have everywhere about this land of Christ [...] In twelve great battles ruining overthrown. [...] And knowest thou now from whence I come--from him [...] From waging bitter war with him: and he, [...] That did not shun to smite me in worse way, [...] Had yet that grace of courtesy in him left, [...] He spared to lift his hand against the King [...] Who made him knight: but many a knight was slain; [...] And many more, and all his kith and kin [...] Clave to him, and abode in his own land. [...] And many more when Modred raised revolt, [...] Forgetful of their troth and fealty, clave [...] To Modred, and a remnant stays with me. [...] And of this remnant will I leave a part, [...] True men who love me still, for whom I live, [...] To guard thee in the wild hour coming on, [...] Lest but a hair of this low head be harmed. [...] Fear not: thou shalt be guarded till my death. [...] Howbeit I know, if ancient prophecies [...] Have erred not, that I march to meet my doom. [...] Thou hast not made my life so sweet to me, [...] That I the King should greatly care to live; [...] For thou hast spoilt the purpose of my life. [...] Bear {{with me for the}} last time while I show, [...] Even for thy sake, the sin which thou hast sinned. [...] For when the Roman left us, and their law [...] Relaxed its hold upon us, and the ways [...] Were filled with rapine, here and there a deed [...] Of prowess done redressed a random wrong. [...] But I was first of all the kings who drew [...] The knighthood-errant of this realm and all [...] The realms together under me, their Head, [...] In that fair Order of my Table Round, [...] A glorious company, the flower of men, [...] To serve as model for the mighty world, [...] And be the fair beginning of a time. [...] I made them lay their hands in mine and swear [...] To reverence the King, as if he were [...] Their conscience, and their conscience as their King, [...] To break the heathen and uphold the Christ, [...] To ride abroad redressing human wrongs, [...] To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it, [...] To honour his own word as if his God's, [...] To lead sweet lives in purest chastity, [...] To love one maiden only, cleave to her, [...] And worship her by years of noble deeds, [...] Until they won her; for indeed I knew [...] Of no more subtle master under heaven [...] Than is the maiden passion for a maid, [...] Not only to keep down the base in man, [...] But teach high thought, and amiable words [...] And courtliness, and the desire of fame, [...] And love of truth, and all that makes a man. [...] And all this throve before I wedded thee, [...] Believing, [...] "lo mine helpmate, one to feel [...] My purpose and rejoicing in my joy." [...] Then came thy shameful sin with Lancelot; [...] Then came the sin of Tristram and Isolt; [...] Then others, following these my mightiest knights, [...] And drawing foul ensample from fair names, [...] Sinned also, till the loathsome opposite [...] Of all my heart had destined did obtain, [...] And all through thee! so that this life of mine [...] I guard as God's high gift from scathe and wrong, [...] Not greatly care to lose; but rather think [...] How sad it were for Arthur, should he live, [...] To sit once more within his lonely hall, [...] And miss the wonted number of my knights, [...] And miss to hear high talk of noble deeds [...] As in the golden days before thy sin. [...] For which of us, who might be left, could speak [...] Of the pure heart, nor seem to glance at thee? [...] And in thy bowers of Camelot or of Usk [...] Thy shadow still would glide from room to room, [...] And I should evermore be vext with thee [...] In hanging robe or <b>vacant</b> <b>ornament,</b> [...] Or ghostly footfall echoing on the stair. [...] For think not, though thou wouldst not love thy lord, [...] Thy lord hast wholly lost his love for thee. [...] I am not made of so slight elements. [...] Yet must I leave thee, woman, to thy shame. [...] I hold that man the worst of public foes [...] Who either for his own or children's sake, [...] To save his blood from scandal, lets the wife [...] Whom he knows false, abide and rule the house: [...] For being through his cowardice allowed [...] Her station, taken everywhere for pure, [...] She like a new disease, unknown to men, [...] Creeps, no precaution used, among the crowd, [...] Makes wicked lightnings of her eyes, and saps [...] The fealty of our friends, and stirs the pulse [...] With devil's leaps, and poisons half the young. [...] Worst of the worst were that man he that reigns! [...] Better the King's waste hearth and aching heart [...] Than thou reseated in thy place of light, [...] The mockery of my people, and their bane.' ...|$|E
