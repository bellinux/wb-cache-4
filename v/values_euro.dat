40|$|In {{this paper}} we present three empirically {{testable}} {{versions of the}} common p-star model and evaluate their forecasting performance using conventional techniques. We try {{to answer the question}} if the p-star approach is preferable to achieve a reliable short-run inflation forecast and with regard to the latter we incur the need for a stable demand for money function. Our findings indicate the recurrence of the relevance of the monetary pillar of the ECB's two-pillar framework. In addition, we check for the effects of the current financial and economic crisis that started in 2007 on the forecasting performance, using two sub-sample periods, one excluding and one including the latter, and analyze the impact of the applied filter technique to compute the required equilibrium <b>values.</b> <b>Euro</b> area Forecast Inflation Money demand P-star...|$|E
40|$|Ecofin and Oecd {{methodology}} is used {{to reconstruct}} the historical evolution of public current health care expenditure for Italy and Lazio (an Italian Region). The reconstructed evolutions allow to detect what have been the per-capita expenditures per age brackets in absolute <b>values</b> (<b>Euro)</b> in 1990, {{as well as their}} rate of growth over the period 1990 - 2010. The comparison Italy vs. Lazio allows to underline two main evidence: (1) the higher level of expenditure of Lazio with respect to the national average; (2) the much higher trend of the expenditure of Lazio with respect to the national average. The outsider position of Lazio cannot be attributed to different strength of the ageing process, neither to different evolution of health care needs or health care supply (simulations deal with essential levels of assistance that should be equally provided across Regions). The outsider position of Lazio is to be attributed to inefficiency and in a broad sense. Nicola C. Salerno (nicola. salerno@tin. it) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{weakness}} of the euro has been surprising given the widely-held expectation {{that it would be}} a strong currency. This paper critically examines explanations for the slide in the euro, finding that many are questionable on conceptual or empirical grounds. Two explanations are instead advanced that appear to be consistent both with theory and data. The first originates in the global surge in equity prices since the mid- 1990 s, which created a demand shock that disproportionately affected the U. S. economy. Model simulations indicate that this can explain the strength of the dollar against other currencies in recent years, accounting for about half of the decline in the effective value of the euro. The other component of euro weakness can be attributed to a mismatch between the demand and supply of euro-denominated assets that arose with the creation of the single currency in 1999. The effect of both these factors should fade over time, although near-term market volatility could be exacerbated by uncertainties about the fundamentals driving currency values.
