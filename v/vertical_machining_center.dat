Chatter is undesirable due to its adverse effects on product quality, operation cost, machining accuracy, tool life, and productivity. This paper presents an innovative approach to chatter control during end milling of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V using ferrite permanent magnets to reduce the unwanted vibrations. A special fixture was fabricated and mounted on a <b>Vertical</b> <b>Machining</b> <b>Center‘s</b> spindle for holding the permanent magnet bars, used in suppressing the vibration amplitudes. DASY Lab 5. 6 was used for signal analysis and processing to compare the intensity of chatter under normal and magnet application conditions.

The experiments focused on monitoring the vibration amplitudes and analysis of chip formation process during metal cutting.

It was apparent that a reduction of chatter amplitude would result in improved surface finish of the work-piece and lead to uniform chip formation...|$|R

The tool-workpiece compliance of a <b>vertical</b> type <b>machining</b> <b>center</b> was measured. The direction dependency of the compliance magnitude was discussed using the polar plot. The compliance in the Z (vertical) direction was smaller than that in the XY (horizontal) directions.

The experimental work was carried out on a <b>vertical</b> CNC <b>machining</b> <b>center</b> with 7, 500 rpm spindle rotation and 7. 5 kW power. Hardened steels ASTM H 13 (50 HRC) were machined at conventional cutting speed and high-speed cutting (HSC).

A special milling tool holder with only one cutting edge was developed and the machining forces needed to calculate the specific cutting energy were recorded using a piezoelectric 4 -component dynamometer. Workpiece roughness and chip formation process were also evaluated. The results showed that the specific cutting energy decreased 15. 5 % when cutting speed was increased up to 700 %. An increase of 1 ° in tool chip breaker chamfer angle lead to a reduction in the specific cutting energy about 13. 7 % and 28. 6 % when machining at HSC and conventional cutting speed respectively.

40|$|Purpose - Therefore, {{the purpose}} of this study is to {{understand}} the relationships between the processing parameters and the geometric form of the produced single tracks, in order to control dimensional quality in future experimentations. The quality of the deposited single track and layer is of prime importance in the selective laser melting (SLM) process, as it affects the product quality in terms of dimensional precision and product performance. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a <b>vertical</b> milling <b>machining</b> <b>center</b> equipped with an Ytterbium-fiber laser was used in the SLM experimentation to form single cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (CoCrMo) tracks. The different geometric features and the influence of the scanning parameters on these morphologic characteristics were studied statistically by means of ANOVA. Findings - Evidently, track height (h 1) inaccuracy reduced in layer thicknesses between 100 and 200 μm. The re-melt depth (h 2) was determined by the energy parameters, with laser power of 325 - 350 W and scanning speed (SS) of 66. 6 - 83. 3 mm/s being the most favorable parameters to obtain the required anchoring. Moreover, a contact angle of 117 ° was proposed as optimal, as it permitted an adequate overlapping region and a full densification, and, finally, an SS of 50 mm/s and a layer thickness of 250 were suggested for its development. Originality/value - The comprehension of the phenomena inherent to the process is related to the single track geometrical characteristics, which allow the definition of an optimal value for each factor for a further proposal of processing conditions that can finally derive a higher precision, wetting, density and mechanical propertiesThe authors gratefully appreciate the financial supports from the Spanish Government (project DPI 2009 - 09852) and the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 -PEOPLE- 2009) under the grant agreement IRSES n° 247476 that lead to these research result...|$|R
