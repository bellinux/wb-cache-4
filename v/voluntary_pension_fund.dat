The primary objective of supervision is to protect insured persons and insurance beneficiaries by providing conditions for unhindered and solvent operation of <b>voluntary</b> <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> management companies. There are three models of supervision in the theory and practice of voluntary pension insurance: integrated, partially integrated, and specialized models of supervision. This paper analyzes the integrated model of supervision, which implies the existence of an institution in charge of the supervision of {{the functioning of}} the whole financial sector, including the sectors of banking, insurance, voluntary pension insurance, etc. Some of the variables specific to countries with integrated supervision are presented statistically. The system of voluntary pension insurance in Serbia is still in an early stage, with the integrated model of supervision, implemented by the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) ...|$|E

This objective incorporates the goal of creating a dynamic model that will sufficiently informative and includes the key aspects, both the current and the future form of the pension system (PS) in Czech Republic. The results of the current form of PS conclude that under the presumption of slightly unfavourable demographic development and constancy of PS is the system unsustainable. The model also points out the fact that the problem of PS could be solved through its partial adjustment. Under the assumption of gradually increasing pension tax rate, opposed with the real value of pension benefit and gradual pension age postponement up to 71 years. The results of the pension form post reformed analysis pension form are based on the assumption of intergenerational schism. That means different attitudes to the pension system reform. Pension system post reformed analysis results coincidently work with the fact that all people under 30 years (year 2009) will join the <b>voluntary</b> <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> system. The current scenarios consider that the coming generation of working population will without exception enter this voluntary system.

Stress tests indicate that they would absorb sizable macroeconomic shocks with only a moderate impact on their solvency.

2500|$|An {{initiative}} by Juan Atilio Bramuglia, {{chief counsel}} for the Unión Ferroviaria (at the time the most important union in the CGT), and by Labor Secretary Juan Perón, promoted the Labor Department to a cabinet-level post and, in 1944, established the National Institute for Social Insurance (INPS). The INPS converted the <b>voluntary</b> <b>pension</b> <b>funds,</b> which covered 3% of the total population, into a compulsory system for all employees, effective January 1, 1945, and thus became the first universal social insurance system in Argentina. Perón, elected President in 1946, had retirement and disability benefits included in the Workers' Bill of Rights, enacted on February 24, 1947; this Bill of Rights was subsequently incorporated into the 1949 Constitution as Article 14-b. The self-employed, who account for a fourth of the nation's work force, were incorporated into the Independent Workers' Scheme in 1955. The INPS replaced the former guild funds' capitalization financing for a PAYGO system, and by 1955, would cover 80% of the population. Participation rates in social security among the self-employed would remain among the lowest, however, and the majority evaded the system in subsequent decades.|$|R

40|$|Putting {{the pension}} system on a {{sustainable}} footing arguably remains {{the biggest challenge}} in Russia''s economic policies. The debate about the policy options was hitherto constrained {{by the absence of}} general equilibrium analysis. This paper fills this gap by simulating their macroeconomic effects in a DSGE model calibrated to Russia''s economy-the first of its kind {{to the best of our}} knowledge. The results suggest that a minimum benefit level in the public system should optimally be financed through lower government consumption, while higher taxation of labor and capital should be avoided. Reducing public investment spending is superior to increasing consumption taxes unless investment generates high rates of return.

40|$|Despite {{the limited}} scope {{resulting}} from the high payroll taxes for the compulsory, unfunded public pillar in Hungary's pensions system, the early <b>voluntary</b> private <b>pensions</b> <b>fund</b> performance has been encouraging. Investment returns have been well above the inflation rate and participation has expanded rapidly. However, the sector is highly fragmented and regulatory weaknesses exist: no compulsory use of custodian and licensed asset managers; use of book values and cashflow accounting rather than market values; costly tax treatment, benefiting high income earners while not providing incentives to non-taxpayers; infrequent statements and inadequate information fund performance disclosure; no minimum relative profitability levels guarantees; and a need for strengthened and more effective supervision. Without systemic reform the private <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> potential will remain limited. Hungary's pension system suffers from the same problems that afflict most pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems in Eastern Europe: high system dependency rations, low retirement ages, lax disability pension criteria, increasing evasion, heavy pension costs, and large deficits. In May 1996, Hungarian authorities decided to create a mixed system of two mandatory pillars and one or more voluntary pillars. The first pillar will offer all eligible Hungarian workers a basic PAYG pension, while the second pillar will be a fully funded, privately managed, decentralized system based on individual capitalization accounts. The private pillars should boost economic growth by developing capital markets and removing labor market distortions. Systemic reform faces two challenges: whether to impose the mandate on individual workers or their employers, and {{how to build a}} mandatory pillar on to existing voluntary pillar institutions. The author suggests the use of a hybrid mandate combining an employer mandate with the right for workers to opt out and join an independent fund as a compromise. Most other regulatory issues would apply with as much severity under a compulsory private funded pillar as under a voluntary one.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the costs of}} third-pillar individual pension plans currently available in Italy, namely pension insurance policies and open <b>pension</b> <b>funds,</b> which are new products in the Italian savings market. For lack of data on annuities, the analysis {{is limited to the}} accumulation phase. To evaluate costs, we use different simulation scenarios, changing the length of the contribution period and the gross returns attainable on financial markets; we also consider participants with different life income and contribution profiles. Following international literature, we present cost measures which reflect the reduction in both the final accumulated pension wealth and the annual rate of return. The main result of our analysis is the existence of a substantial dichotomy in the market. On one side, open <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> have moderate costs, close to those of <b>voluntary</b> <b>pension</b> plans in other countries and also to those of the Italian occupational <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> (i. e. the second pillar). On the other, individual insurance policies are burdened by significantly higher charges. We consider different possible rationales for these costs, including the fact that the market is at a very early stage of development, without reaching a completely satisfactory explanation. Finally, we also study the possible regressive feature of the fee structure and the unfavourable treatment of early withdrawals of private pension assets; we conclude that both are indeed present in the majority of products, but that their impact is fairly limited. <b>Pension</b> <b>funds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Executive summary <b>Pension</b> <b>fund</b> {{assets in}} OECD {{countries}} have increased rapidly {{over the past}} decades (OECD 2007 a), and {{it is evident that}} such trend will continue. Against this background the issue of how to invest such a large amount of assets has become increasingly important, and also has policy implications. Broadly speaking <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> around the globe have been subject to two approaches, i. e. quantitative asset restrictions (QAR) and the prudent person rule (PPR). In this paper we first review how <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> are regulated in both OECD and non-OECD countries. Next, the existing regulatory framework of <b>funded</b> <b>pensions</b> in China is reviewed (consisting of the mandatory personal account and Enterprise Annuities- i. e. <b>voluntary</b> occupational <b>pensions).</b> Finally, we conduct a simple empirical study, investigating quantitatively the extent to which potential benefits could be achieved if the current QAR approach in China is shifted towards a more liberalised regulatory approach. Given our empirical results which support the PPR in China, a number of policy recommendations are proposed in order to strengthen the existing pension regulations. They include a removal of lower limits on certain asset classes, consideration of allowing pension assets to be invested abroad etc...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe {{industry}} of <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> {{has become one}} of the drivers of today’s economic activity by its important volume of contribution in the financial market and by creating wealth. The increasing importance that <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> have acquired in today’s economy and financial market, raises special attention from investors, financial actors and pundits in the sector. Regarding this economic weight of <b>pension</b> <b>funds,</b> a thorough analysis of the performance of different <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> plans in order to optimise benefits need to be undertaken. The research explores criteria and invariants that make it possible to compare the performance of different <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> products. <b>Pension</b> <b>fund</b> companies currently do measure their performances with those of others. Likewise, the individual investing in a pension plan compares different products available in the market. There exist different ways of measuring the performance of a <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> according to their different schemes. Generally, there exist two main <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> plans. The defined benefit (DB) <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> plan which is mostly preferred by pension members due to his ability to hold the risk to the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> manager. The defined contributions (DC) <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> plan on the other hand, is more popularly preferred by the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> managers due to its ability to transfer the risk to the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members. One of the reasons that motivate <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members’ choices of entering into a certain programme is that their expectations of maintaining their living lifestyle after retirement are met by the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> strategies. This dissertation investigates the various properties and characteristics of the defined contribution <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> plan with a minimum guarantee and benchmark in order to mitigate the risk that <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members are subject to. For the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> manager the aim is to find the optimal asset allocation strategy which optimises its retribution which is in fact a part of the surplus (the difference between the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> value and the guarantee) (2004) [19] and to analyse the effect of sharing between the contributor and the <b>pension</b> <b>fund.</b> From the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members’ perspective it is to define a optimal guarantee as a solution to the contributor’s optimisation programme. In particular, we consider a case of a <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> company which invests in a bond, stocks and a money market account. The uncertainty in the financial market is driven by Brownian motions. Numerical simulations were performed to compare the different models...|$|R

40|$|With asset values falling {{sharply in}} recent years, many {{companies}} {{around the world}} are under pressure to restore the solvency of their defined-benefit pension plans. Will this lead to higher contributions? Will higher contributions increase labor costs and reduce employment? Does this mechanism exacerbate economic downturns? What are the economic effects of <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> regulation? This paper develops a theoretical model to address these questions. Although its scope is more general, the model captures the main institutional features of the pension system in the Netherlands, a country where the economic effects of the pension shock are widely debated.

40|$|Sweden {{offers a}} unique natural {{experiment}} {{to analyze the}} microeconomic effects of institutionalized saving on ownership structure, corporate governance and performance of listed companies. First, the Swedish pension reform increased the participation of <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> in the domestic stock market and caused a significant reshuffling in the ownership of the existing <b>pension</b> <b>funds.</b> Second, the availability of detailed data on firm ownership allows us to document {{the effects of the}} pension reform. We show that the effects of institutional investment on firm performance depend on the industry structure of <b>pension</b> <b>funds.</b> In particular, we find that firm performance improves if large independent private <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> and public <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> increase their equity stakes in the firm, but not if smaller <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> and <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> related to financial institutions and industrial groups increase their shareholdings.

Weak herding occurs if <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> have similar rebalancing strategies.

Finally, strong herding means that <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> intentionally replicate {{changes in the}} strategic asset allocation of other <b>pension</b> <b>funds.</b> Without an economic reason.
