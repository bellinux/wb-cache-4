40|$|The primary aim {{of present}} {{investigation}} was to develop and formulate room temperature stable formulation of formoterol fumarate and beclomethasone dipropionate with extra fine part size of hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered dose inhalers. Particle size distribution of hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered dose inhalers was evaluated using Twin Stage Glass Impinger and Anderson Cascade Impactor. A tetrafluoroethane and/or heptafluoropropane were evaluated for preparation of hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered dose inhalers. The fine particle fractions delivered from hydrofluoroalkane propellant suspension pressurized metered dose inhalers can be predicted {{on the basis of}} formulation parameters and is dependent of metering chamber of valve and orifice size of actuators. The results presented in investigation showed the importance of formulation excipients with formulation of pressurized metered dose inhalers viz, <b>canister,</b> <b>valve</b> and actuators used in formulations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{importance}} of regular medication {{in order to}} control asthma symptoms is recognized. However, there is no accurate mechanism for assessing the fullness of aerosol inhalers. The contribution to asthma morbidity of unexpectedly running out of inhaled medication is unknown. AIM. A study was undertaken to determine how patients assess inhaler fullness and the accuracy of their assessments, and to evaluate the floatation method of assessing inhaler fullness. METHOD. An interview survey of 98 patients (51 % of those invited to take part), using 289 inhalers, was completed at one general practice in Hampshire. RESULTS. One third of participants said they had difficulty assessing aerosol inhaler fullness and those aged 60 years and over were found to be more inaccurate in assessing fullness than younger participants. Shaking the inhaler to feel the contents move was the commonest method of assessment. When placed in water, an inhaler canister floating on its side with a corner of the <b>canister</b> <b>valve</b> exposed to air indicates that the canister is less than 15 % full (sensitivity 90 %, specificity 99 %). CONCLUSION. Floating a canister in water provides an objective measurement of aerosol inhaler fullness. Providing the method is recommended by the aerosol inhaler manufacturer, general practitioners should demonstrate the floatation method to patients experiencing difficulty in assessing inhaler fullness...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the health and environmental risk factors of air contaminants that influence environmental and respiratory diseases in Gyeongju, Pohang and Ulsan in South Korea, with a focus on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Methods: Samples were collected by instantaneous negative pressure by opening the injection <b>valve</b> in the <b>canister</b> at a fixed height of 1 to 1. 5 m. The sample that was condensed in- 150 ℃was heated to 180 ℃ in sample pre-concentration trap using a 6 -port switching valve and it was injected to a gas chromatography column. The injection quantity of samples was precisely controlled using an electronic flow controller equipped in the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. Results: The quantity of the VOC emissions in the industrial area was 1. 5 to 2 times higher than that in the non-industrial area. With regards to the aromatic hydrocarbons, toluene was detected at the highest level of 22. 01 ppb in Ulsan, and chloroform was the halogenated hydrocarbons with the highest level of 10. 19 ppb in Pohang. The emission of toluene was shown to be very important, as it accounted for more than 30 % of the total aromatic hydrocarbon concentration. Conclusions: It was considered that benzene in terms of the cancer-causing grade standard, toluene in terms of the emission quantity, and chloroform and styrene in terms of their grades and emission quantities should be selected for priority measurement substances...|$|R
40|$|Data Quality Objectives (DQOS) for gas {{and liquid}} {{sampling}} from the sealed canisters in K West Basin {{have been developed}} and are presented in this document. The {{scope of this document}} is limited primarily to the initial sampling effort. This sampling campaign either supports the selection of canisters to provide fuel for hotcell examinations, supports the demonstration of sampling equipment capabilities or provides an initial assessment of gas/liquid chemistry for comparison to the results of fuel element hotcell examinations. No sampling of canisters has occurred since 1983. It is proposed here that samples of gas and water be analyzed for constituents such as cesium, fission gases, and hydrogen which are markers for corrosion of uranium in a water environment. These data will allow an assessment of the risks involved when particular canisters are opened to retrieve fuel. This sampling campaign will also ensure that canisters with some failed fuel elements are included in the population that is opened for retrieval of fuel for hotcell examinations. Additionally, valuable correlations between the macroscopic visible condition of fuel, hotcell examinations, and the gases generated in canisters will be possible. The analysis of other chemical species in the gas and liquid will allow assessments of the performance of the previously added corrosion inhibitor and possibly assessments of radiolysis. Sampling of canisters will be performed with equipment that opens the <b>valves</b> in the <b>canister</b> lid and draws a 15 ml sample of either gas or water. This work will most likely be performed in one of the pits-associated with the K West Basin...|$|R
40|$|Under a {{cooperative}} agreement with NASA, Hamilton Sundstrand has successfully designed, fabricated, tested and delivered three, state-of-the-art, solid amine prototype systems capable of continuous CO 2 and humidity removal from a closed, habitable atmosphere. Two prototype systems (CAMRAS # 1 and # 2) incorporated a linear spool valve design for process flow control through the sorbent beds, {{with the third}} system (CAMRAS # 3) employing a rotary valve assembly that improves system fluid interfaces and regeneration capabilities. The operational performance of CAMRAS # 1 and # 2 has been validated in a relevant environment, through both simulated human metabolic loads in a closed chamber and through human subject testing in a closed environment. Performance testing at Hamilton Sundstrand on CAMRAS # 3, which incorporates a new <b>valve</b> and modified <b>canister</b> design, showed similar CO 2 and humidity removal performance as CAMRAS # 1 and # 2, demonstrating that the system form can be modified within certain bounds with little to no effect in system function or performance. Demonstration of solid amine based CO 2 and humidity control is an important milestone in developing this technology for human spaceflight. The systems have low power requirements; with power for air flow and periodic valve actuation and indication the sole requirements. Each system occupies the same space as roughly four shuttle non-regenerative LiOH canisters, but have essentially indefinite CO 2 removal endurance provided a regeneration pathway is available. Using the solid amine based systems to control cabin humidity also eliminates the latent heat burden on cabin thermal control systems {{and the need for}} gas/liquid phase separation in a low gravity environment, resulting in additional simplification of vehicle environmental control and life support system process requirements...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Coalbed {{gas content}} {{measurements}} are normally carried to estimate methane emission rates into mine workings and for coalbed methane gas recovery applications. Techniques of gas content determination are broadly {{divided into two}} categories, viz. direct methods which actually measure the volume of gasreleased from a coal sample sealed into a desorption canister and indirect methods based onempirical correlations, or laboratory derived sorption isotherm gas storage capacity data. Direct gas content determination techniques are sub-categorised into quick-crushing and extendeddesorption methods. In quick-crushingmethods the coal sample is crushed soon after collection to release all the desorbablegas. Extended desorptiontechniques are most commonly used for recovery applications and resource assessment whereinformation on desorption rates is usefulfor fundamental coalbedmethane research, andfor reservoir modelling. CBM in India India, having the fourth largest proven coal reserves in the world, holds significant prospects for exploration and exploitation of CBM. India {{has one of the}} most investor friendly CBM policies in the world. In our country a totally transparent and fair bid evaluation criteriahas been evolved and is in place. There is, therefore, a huge opportunity for potential CBM investors in India. Commercial production of CBM has already commenced in Raniganj (South) CBM block in West Bengal. Efforts are also being made in Shoagpur blocks in Madhya Pradesh and Jharia block in Jharkhand for commencement of commercial production at the earliest. It is expected that CBM production in India will go up to 7. 4 MMSCMD by the year 2013 - 14. Experimental Investigation The freshly blasted coal samples were immediately sealed in a container then brought to the laboratory for experimentation. The samples were crushed and put into the desorption canister. The sample was heated at a very low heating rate to allow desorption of gas. The pressure developed inside the canister was noted down and then the <b>valve</b> of the <b>canister</b> was opened and gas was collected by downward displacement of water. The sample was allowed to desorb until a low desorption rate cut-off point was reached. Results As a part of the project work, extended desorption method was followed to find out the gas content of block samples brought from 10 different mines of MCL. The results are shown below in table 1. Table 1 : Gas Content of Coal Samples Sample no. 	Colliery/Mine	Gas content(in m 3 /tonne) 1 	Lakhanpur	 0. 050 2 	Basundhara	 0. 248 3 	Kulda	 0. 206 4 	Nadira colliery	 0. 325 5 	Lingaraj	 0. 130 6 	Bhubaneshwari	 0. 104 7 	Dera colliery	 0. 352 8 	Jagannath	 0. 204 9 	Ananta	 0. 101 10 	Bharatpur	 0. 152 Discussions and Conclusion It could be observed from the experimental investigation that the gas content of coal samples varied from 0. 05 m 3 /tonne to 0. 352 m 3 /tonne. Coal samples collected from underground mines had greater amount of residual gas content as compared to the rest this corroborates the fact that gas content of coal increases with depth. If the gas content is found to be very high then vertical bore holes may be put up to extract methane for a variety of commercial applications, starting from domestic heating to generation of electricity References 1.
