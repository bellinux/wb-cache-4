40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this three-group {{double-blind}} clinical trial {{study was to investigate}} the effect of acupressure (指壓 zhǐ yā) with valerian (纈草 xié cǎo) oil 2. 5 % on {{the quality and quantity of}} sleep in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in a coronary intensive care unit (CCU). This study was conducted on 90 patients with ACS in Mazandaran Heart Center (Sari, Iran) during 2013. The patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Patients in the acupressure with <b>valerian</b> <b>oil</b> 2. 5 % group (i. e., valerian acupressure group) received bilateral acupoint (穴位 xué wèi) massage with two drops of <b>valerian</b> <b>oil</b> for 2 minutes for three nights; including every point this treatment lasted in total 18 minutes. Patients in the acupressure group received massage at the same points with the same technique but without <b>valerian</b> <b>oil.</b> Patients in the control group received massage at points that were 1 – 1. 5  cm from the main points using the same technique and for the same length of time. The quality and quantity of the patients' sleep was measured by the St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire (SMHSQ). After the intervention, there was a significant difference between sleep quality and sleep quantity in the patients in the valerian acupressure group and the acupressure group, compared to the control group (p <  0. 05). Patients that received acupressure with <b>valerian</b> <b>oil</b> experienced improved sleep quality; however, this difference was not statistically significant in comparison to the acupressure only group. Acupressure at the ear spirit gate (神門 shén mén), hand Shenmen, glabella (印堂 yìn táng), Wind Pool (風池 fēng chí), and Gushing Spring (湧泉 yǒng quán) acupoints can have therapeutic effects and may improve the quality and quantity of sleep in patients with ACS. Using these techniques in combination with herbal medicines such <b>valerian</b> <b>oil</b> can have a greater impact on improving sleep and reducing waking during the night...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the fumigant toxicity of oriental sweetgum (Liquidambar orientalis) and valerian (Valeriana wallichii) essential oils and their components against the Japanese termite (Reticulitermes speratus). The fumigant toxicity of oriental sweetgum and <b>valerian</b> <b>oil</b> differed significantly according to exposure time. Oriental sweetgum showed toxicity at short exposure times (2 days), and the toxicity of <b>valerian</b> <b>oil</b> was high 7 days after treatment. The main constituents of oriental sweetgum and valerian oils were tested individually for their fumigant toxicity against Japanese termites. Among the test compounds, benzyl alcohol, acetophenone, 1 -phenyl- 1 -ethanol, hydrocinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamyl aldehyde, trans-cinnamyl alcohol, cis-asarone, styrene, and cis-ocimene showed toxicity against Japanese termites 7 days after treatment. Hydrocinnamyl alcohol and trans-cinnamyl alcohol {{were found to be}} the major contributors to the fumigant antitermitic toxicity of oriental sweetgum oil. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition activity of two oils and their constituents was tested to determine their mode of action. Only cis-ocimene showed strong AChE inhibition activity with an IC 50 value of 0. 131 mg/mL. Further studies are warranted to determine the potential of these essential oils and their constituents as fumigants for termite control...|$|E
40|$|The sesquiterpenoid valerianol 2 is a {{constituent}} of <b>valerian</b> <b>oil</b> (Jommi, Krepinsky, Herout & Sorm, 1969) {{and it may}} be prepared by the oxy-mercuration of commercially available valencene 1 (Fontes Arantes, Hanson & Hitchcock, 1999). Valerianol is identical to kusenol which was obtained (Hikino, Suzuki & Takemoto, 1968) from the higher boiling fraction of camphor blue oil. More highly hydroxylated sesquiterpenoids possessing the eremophilane carbon skeleton are of interest (Fraga, 1998 and previous reports) because of their biological activity as phytoalexins (Katsui, Yagihashi & Murai, 1982) and as toxic fungal metabolites (Moreau et al., 1980). Although there is a report (Paknikar & Dhavlikar, 1975) of the bacterial conversion of valencene to dihydro-α-agarofuran, there have not been any reports (Lamare & Furstoss, 1990) on the microbiological hydroxylation of valerianol. We have therefore examined the biotransformation of valerianol and that of some derivatives by the fungus, Mucor plumbeus...|$|E
40|$|Environmental Health Sciences for {{comprehensive}} toxicological characterization {{based on its}} widespread use in dietary supplements, the lack of adequate toxicological data, and concerns regarding potential adverse developmental and reproductive effects, particularly for women of child-bearing age. Valerian most commonly refers to extracts of the underground rhizomes and roots, including tinctures, essential oils, terpenes, terpene-free fractions, and residues from the species V. officinalis [CAS No. 8057 - 49 - 6] and its subspecies, which sometimes exclude officinalis from the name. <b>Valerian</b> <b>oil</b> [CAS No. 8008 - 88 - 6], as used in the U. S. and European official pharmacopoeias, also refers to V. officinalis. Valerian is an herbaceous perennial plant that is native to Europe and parts of Asia. Valerian products are sold as valerian alone or {{in combination with other}} herbs and supplements. Valerian is classified as a "dietary supplement" under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. Constituents. Valerian is readily available as a powder, tea, tincture, essential oil and root extracts. More than 150 compounds {{have been reported in the}} essential oil. It has several components that have some pharmacological actions. Constituents of valerian...|$|E
40|$|Developing a {{protocol}} {{for the use}} of non-invasive genetic sampling to monitor UK red fox abundance Abstract The red fox is an important UK predator and is widely managed, due to its impact on species of economic and conservation concern. However, UK fox populations are currently poorly monitored, and population size estimates are almost exclusively from index counts such as the national game bag census. Estimates of true abundance could improve the monitoring and management of UK foxes by reducing the levels of uncertainty in population estimates. Non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) has a lot of potential as a method for estimating the true abundance of foxes, and this study trialled hair collection and analysis techniques for use in NGS studies of UK foxes. Several trap designs, incorporating different baits and hair collection structures, were set up in Durham City woodland and trialled for their effectiveness in attracting foxes and collecting hair samples. The traps differed in their effectiveness at collecting hair, but neither food baits nor <b>valerian</b> <b>oil</b> were successful in attracting foxes to traps. Further {{research is needed to determine}} a reliable method for collecting hair samples. The Chelex extraction method was tested for its reliability for extracting DNA from single-hair samples, and was found to be extremely reliable for this purpose. A range of microsatellite markers were then tested for use identifying individual red foxes from hair samples, and a useable set of primers was identified, and optimised. A sex-linked marker (SRY) was also tested and optimised, to provide additional information at from samples. The resulting protocol was also tested with domestic dog samples, and the results of the analysis were found to be genetically distinct, showing that mistakenly included samples from closely-related species could be identified. The developed laboratory methods could be reliably used for individual recognition and sex identification from remotely-collected hair samples from red fox populations in the UK, and could form a basis for future capture-mark-recapture and population analysis of red fox samples, improving red fox monitoring in the UK. ...|$|E
