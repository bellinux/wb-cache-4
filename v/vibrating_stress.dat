40|$|It {{has been}} known that {{applying}} a mechanical <b>vibrating</b> <b>stress</b> perpendicularly to p-Se/n-CdSe heterojunction, then the piezo-electromotive force with the same frequency of the mechanical <b>vibrating</b> <b>stress</b> was generated. We infered that this piezo-electromotive force was created by variations of the width of heterojunction barrier caused by the vibrating piezo-electric polarization of both CdSe and Se due to stress-strain. Using Gauss' theorem and solving Poisson's equation for the p-Se/n-CdSe heterojuntcion, the piezo-electromotive force can be deduced theoretically. The theoretical results of the piezo-electromotive force agree well with experimental values...|$|E

That is，cylindrical sand specimens 	of high degree of saturation were made.

As the result，effective stress pass on 45 degrees stress plane to principal 	stress axis is returned around at number of cyc 1 eN = 3 ，which shows an initial 	liquefaction. And，t he stress pass arrived gradual 1 y to a constant stress pass 	after N= 10 ，which shows the soi 1 structure to be stabilized. Because of occurring 	of phase difference between <b>vibrating</b> <b>stress</b> and pore pressure，the unsaturated 	sandy soi 1 does not go to perfect liquefaction. The phase difference approaches 	to a constant value as the increase of number of cyc 1 es，and {{it shows that the}} 	variation corresponds to the change of soi 1 structure...|$|E

40|$|Support is {{requested}} {{from the}} Science Research Council for {{an extension of}} the research facilities available for the investigation of flexural vibrations of crankshafts at the Advanced School of Automobile Engineering. Sufficient evidence exists to indicate that flexural vibrations of crankshafts are significant at certain running conditions and critical speeds of an engine. It is also possible that unaccountable failures of crankshafts in service may be explained by fatigue as a consequence of large <b>vibrating</b> <b>stresses</b> due to resonance of the bending mode. Lack of knowledge of these vibrations is such that the criteria used for the design of devices that reduce the amplitudes of vibration and noise at the critical speeds are not well founded. The results of the theoretical and experimental studies already carried out at the school are promising but they are restricted to a particular crankshaft. To fully establish the methods of analysis, to extend the analyses and to test a significant number of crankshafts of various types, it is the proposal that a Senior Research Fellow and a Research Engineer will be employed for three years. Additional test facilities and instrumentation are requested for the extension of the work in progress...|$|R

A new instrument has been arranged to apply the methodology to large pieces in situ; it is provided with 16 piezotite sensors (Murata pads, Piezotite non-resonant type, 6 CC- 10 - 3 R 9 - 1000), while another instrument is being prepared to test the vibrations of small stones, using a triggered tweeter as source and a small laser remote sensor to measure the vibrations of the stones...|$|R

5000|$|QuietRock uses a damping {{technique}} called constrained-layer damping (CLD). This technology {{had been used}} for at least 20 years to reduce vibrations in mechanical objects from disk drive heads to bridges, but had not been applied to architectural acoustics prior to 2003. QuietRock panels use several tuned constrained-layer systems to create a higher ability to damp vibrational (and therefore acoustic) energy. In essence, the panel does not [...] "want" [...] to <b>vibrate</b> due to <b>stress</b> and strain caused by the damping method. Acoustic energy ends up dissipating as small amounts of heat.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{locking nuts}} exist {{to prevent this}} problem, but {{sometimes}} it is sufficient to add a second nut. For this technique to be reliable, each nut must be tightened to the correct torque. The inner nut is tightened to about a quarter to a half of the torque of the outer nut. It is then {{held in place by}} a wrench while the outer nut is tightened on top using the full torque. This arrangement causes the two nuts to push on each other, creating a tensile stress in the short section of the bolt that lies between them. Even when the main joint is <b>vibrated,</b> the <b>stress</b> between the two nuts remains constant, thus holding the nut threads in constant contact with the bolt threads and preventing self-loosening. When the joint is assembled correctly, the outer nut bears the full tension of the joint. The inner nut functions merely to add a small additional force to the outer nut and {{does not need to be}} as strong, so a thin nut (also called a jam nut) can be used.|$|R

Here a visualization technique of flow induced birefringence was used to {{study the effects of}} the vibration parameters of screw on the extensional stress in contraction die. It is shown that, the extensional <b>stress</b> <b>vibrate</b> with the screw vibration at the same frequency; the amplitude of the extensional stress increases with the amplitude of the screw increasing; the average extensional stress at dynamic extrusion is less than that without vibration force, and it decreases with the screw vibration frequency or amplitude increasing...|$|R
40|$|Damping {{characterizes the}} energy {{dissipation}} capacity {{of materials and}} structures, and it is affected by several external factors such as <b>vibrating</b> frequency, <b>stress</b> history, temperature, and stress amplitude. This study investigates {{the relationship between the}} damping and the stress amplitude of environment-friendly recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). First, a function model of a member’s loss factor and stress amplitude was derived based on Lazan’s damping-stress function. Then, the influence of stress amplitude on the loss tangent of RAC was experimentally investigated. Finally, parameters used to determine the newly derived function were obtained by numerical fitting. It is shown that the member’s loss factor is affected not only by the stress amplitude but also by factors such as the cross section shapes, boundary conditions, load types, and loading positions. The loss tangent of RAC increases with the stress amplitude, even at low stress amplitude. The damping energy exponent of RAC is not identically equal to 2. 0, indicating that the damping is nonlinear. It is also found that the energy dissipation capacity of RAC is superior to that of natural aggregate concrete (NAC), and the energy dissipation capacity can be further improved by adding modified admixtures...|$|R
40|$|Key Words: {{the beam}} of liner <b>vibrating</b> screen; low <b>stress</b> failure; model analysis; {{response}} analysis Abstract: Aiming at the frequently fracture happening in the large-scale liner vibrating screen beams, the software of finite-element analysis, ANSYS is {{used to analyze the}} modal and harmonic response of the beam structure. The analysis result suggests the danger area where beam is prone to fracture because of fatigue. The improvement scheme of the beam structure is proposed and a theoretical basis is provided for the same type of product design in the future. The failure form of the beam is fatigue failure. The maximum equivalent stress value of the improved beam structure comparing to the original design is decreased obviously, improving the stress state and the fatigue life and reliability of the liner vibrating screen. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on soil dynamics and machine foundations {{has revealed that}} there are correct design principles for vibrating foundations {{which can be used}} without dependence on empirical methods. The most important discovery has been that any ground can oscillate at its own particular natural frequency, and machines and ground quite often <b>vibrate</b> in resonance. <b>Stress</b> waves, some with similar properties to light and sound waves, are of considerable and often of paramount importance, for their interaction can lead to structural failure. The authors have considered only steadily running machines and have merely indicated the mathematics, the designer being advised to consult the proper engineering text-books for a fuller account. They hope that the problem has not been over-simplified and that their conclusions may form a sound basis for future design practice...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: CSIRO {{has been}} {{conducting}} a five-year research project under the sponsorship of JCOAL and Ulan Mine to develop a real-time roof monitoring and roof fall warning system for underground coal mines. A preliminary system has been developed and successfully trialled twice in the gateroads at Ulan Mine during 2004 and 2005. The system integrates the displacement monitoring, stress monitoring and seismic monitoring in one package. It includes: • GEL multi-anchor extensometers • <b>Vibrating</b> wire uniaxial <b>stress</b> meters • ESG seismic monitoring system with microseismic sensors and high frequency AE sensors. The monitoring system has been automated and the data are automatically collected by a central computer located in an underground non-hazardous area. The data are then transferred to surface via an optical fibre cable. The real-time data can be accessed at any location with internet connections. The trials of the system in two tailgates at Ulan Mine have demonstrated {{that the system is}} effective for monitoring the behaviour and stability of roadways during longwall mining. The continuous roof displacement/stress data have showed clear precursors of roof falls. The seismic data (event count and locations) have provided insights into the roof failure process during roof fall...|$|R
