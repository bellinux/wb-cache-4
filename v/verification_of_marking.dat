40|$|Abstract—With more {{integration}} in VLSI technology, Intellectual Property (IP) cores are reused {{to meet the}} customer’s specifications in time. For intellectual property protection (IPP), various kinds <b>of</b> IP <b>marks,</b> such as watermarks, fingerprints, are embedded into the design for establishing the veracity of a legal IP owner. However, convincing public <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> such <b>marks</b> is not leakageproof. Attackers not only manage to obtain potential clues to tamper public marks rendering public verification invalid, but can also suitably override the marks to include own signature, resulting in wrong public identification of IP vendor and IP buyer. Furthermore, current technique includes a sufficiently large set <b>of</b> public <b>marks</b> containing a header and a message body in addition to private ones to facilitate only public verification {{at the cost of}} significant increase in design overhead. We propose a zero-knowledge protocol to ensure robust and leakage proof convincing public verification with a smaller set <b>of</b> public <b>marks</b> consisting <b>of</b> only header part. We have tested our protocol for FPGA benchmarks and the results on robustness and overhead are encouraging.

Redrafting of laws to use metric equivalents had already been accomplished but conversion of the land registries required until 31 March 1966 to accomplish. Industry transitioned gradually at its own expense, with compliance sometimes being nominal, {{as in the case of}} ¼-inch screws becoming [...] "¼ screws". Since the original fines for noncompliance were around $140 and governmental agencies mostly preferred to wait for voluntary conversion, metric use by December 1959 was reckoned at only 85%. Since research showed that individual Japanese did not intend to actually use the metric units when given other options, however, sale and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> devices <b>marked</b> with non-metric units (such as rulers and tape measures noting shaku and sun) were criminalised after 1961.|$|R
40|$|AbstractApplication of {{classical}} fractographic method of fatigue crack growth reconstitution {{based on the}} striation spacing measurement is conditioned by ability to distinguish and measure striations on the fracture surfaces. Other methods for crack growth curve reconstitution such as fractographic marking or textural fractography enable the reconstitution even if the striations are arduously detectable or wholly missing {{and also in the}} case of fractured bodies loaded with complex loading spectrum. A research program was focused on design and experimental <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> fracture <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> integrally stiffened panels during the fatigue tests under flight-by-flight spectrum loading and testing the effectiveness of various fractographic methods. The panels represent complex testing models of aircraft wing parts. Three kinds of cyclic loading were used: constant amplitude loading (CAL), flightby-flight type spectrum loading without marking and flight-by-flight spectrum with marking. Different methods were applied for fractographic reconstitution of fatigue crack growth: (a) measurement of striation spacing, (b) identification <b>of</b> beach <b>marks,</b> (c) image textural analysis of SEM images of fatigue fracture surfaces (textural fractography) aimed at morphological features oriented in the direction of crack growth. The obtained crack growth curves enable the study of the influence of loading spectrum on crack growth kinetics and comparison of the different fractographic methods...|$|R

As the additions to the stack-room are still representing an uncertain and long-lasting project Experts of the National Library of Serbia were forced to find a solution which will, in relatively short time, give more free space available within the stack-room. The expert working group has prepared the Project for solving this problem of storage capacity of Funds of the National Library of Serbia. At the meetings of the Expert-Scientific Council of the NLS, several decisions were made regarding the solving of this problem. This Paper gives the analysis of the current state and the overview of the project realization through several phases: 1. The <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> signature <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> the primary fund of monographic publications at the level one of the main stack-room; 2. The decision about the rectification of the current way of allotting the shelf-marks to the coherent application of the numerus currens storage system; 3. The decision about decreasing the number of needed publications copies within the Holdings; 4. The decision about automatic allotting of the call-numbers within the electronic catalogue of the National Library of Serbia; 5. The decision about the "compression" of the primary fund of monographic publications at the level one of the main stack-room; 6. The decision about borrowing publications to employees of the National Library of Serbia for internal purposes; 7 The decision about managing the topographic catalogue in the future; 8. The analysis of the reference fund at the third level of the stack-room. The experts evaluation is that after the realization of this Project and due to the "compression" of the fund, will be obtained about 30 % of free storage space. In addition to this Paper are given the "Rules for allotting call-numbers and the organization of the Fund of monographic publications within the National Library of Serbia", which were adopted at the Expert-Scientific Council of the NLS, in May 2005...|$|R
