5|$|On September 3, 2016, {{hours after}} the Broncos {{released}} him, Sanchez signed a one-year $2 million contract with the Dallas Cowboys, who were looking to have a veteran presence behind rookie Dak Prescott, who was named the starter at quarterback while Tony Romo recovered from a <b>vertebral</b> <b>compression</b> fracture he suffered {{during the first quarter}} of the Cowboys' Week 3 preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks. In Week 17, with the Cowboys already having clinched the NFC's #1 seed, Sanchez split time with starter Prescott and backup Romo. Prescott played the first two series of the game, Romo played the third and Sanchez played the rest. Sanchez completed 9 of 17 passes for 85 yards with two interceptions as the Cowboys lost to the Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 27–13.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} prospectively {{the effectiveness}} of kyphoplasty with SKY bone expander system in treatment of compression fracture of thoracic/lumbar vertebrae and correction of the deformity. MethodsTwenty-five patients with thoracic/lumbar <b>vertebral</b> osteoporotic <b>compression</b> fracture were admitted to our hospital between March 2007 and March 2008, and treated by kyphoplasty with SKY bone expander system. Patient's pain status was rated with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score system 1 day before and 1 hour, 48 hours, 6 months, 12 months after surgery. In addition, Rolland-Morris and Oswestry disability questionnaires (RDQ and ODI) were used for survey 1 day before and 1, 6, 12 months after surgery. Pre- and post-operative vertebral heights and Cobb's angles were measured based on the X-ray films and statistically analyzed. ResultsThere were 27 fractured vertebrae in these 25 patients. After SKY kyphoplasty, the Cobb's angles (9. 8 °± 9. 76 °) were significantly reduced compared with preoperative angles (17. 18 °± 9. 35 °, P< 0. 05), and the average improvement rate was 39 %. Patients' pain VAS scores were also greatly improved after operation (P< 0. 05). Moreover, postoperative RDQ and ODI scores were significantly smaller than preoperative values (P< 0. 05). ConclusionKyphoplasty with SKY bone expander system provides an effective method for treating thoracic/lumbar <b>vertebral</b> osteoporotic <b>compression</b> fracture, with the advantages of small surgical wound and short duration. It can effectively recover the anterior and medial heights of fractured vertebrae (33 % and 50 %, respectively), reduce the Cobb's angle, quickly alleviate pain and improve patients' {{quality of life in}} a relatively short time period...|$|R

50|$|Evaluating soft-tissue {{involvement}} {{is the most}} important aspect of the clinical examination because of its association with patient outcome. Skin blisters may become infected if medical attention is delayed, which can lead to necrotizing fasciitis or osteomyelitis, causing permanent damage to muscle or bone. Ligament and tendon involvement should also be explored. Achilles tendon injury can be seen with posterior (Type C) fractures. Since calcaneal fractures are related to falls from height, other concomitant injuries should be evaluated. <b>Vertebral</b> <b>compression</b> fractures occur in approximately 10% of these patients. A trauma-focused clinical approach should be implemented; tibial, knee, femur, hip, and head injuries should be ruled out by means of history and physical exam.|$|E
