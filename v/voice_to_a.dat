25|$|In 1916, Stere {{strongly}} supported Romania's {{alliance with the}} Central Powers, arguing {{in favor of a}} policy focused on Bessarabia's recovery and against what he saw as Russian expansionism - ultimately, this led him to split with the pro-Entente PNL upon the outbreak of World War I. The socialist Ioan Nădejde commented on the fact that Stere had become rivals with members of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party who had joined the PNL in 1899, and especially with their leader Vasile Morțun. He joined his <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> diverse intellectual opposition which also included the Conservative Party's Petre P. Carp and Alexandru Marghiloman, the left-leaning writers Tudor Arghezi, Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu, and Gala Galaction, as well as the revolutionary socialist Christian Rakovsky.|$|E
500|$|Text is {{frequently}} incorporated into comics via speech balloons, captions, and sound effects. [...] Speech balloons indicate dialogue (or thought, {{in the case}} of thought balloons), with tails pointing at their respective speakers. [...] Captions can give <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> narrator, convey characters' dialogue or thoughts, or indicate place or time. [...] Speech balloons themselves are strongly associated with comics, such that the addition of one to an image is sufficient to turn the image into comics. [...] Sound effects mimic non-vocal sounds textually using onomatopoeia sound-words.|$|E

500|$|According to Jockie, one of {{the main}} reasons that Chrisye was chosen to record [...] "Lilin-Lilin Kecil" [...] was that he had a unique voice with a soft timbre, which went well with the {{keyboards}} used; Jockie, however, felt that Chrisye's voice lost its dynamics when mixed with mellow music, which led him to give their collaboration Jurang Pemisah more of a rock feel. Gutawa compared Chrisye's <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> blank sheet of paper, able to be applied to anything. Sys NS wrote in 2007 that he had been looking for [...] "someone with the voice of an angel" [...] to sing [...] "Lilin-Lilin Kecil", and in his opinion Chrisye fitted the role perfectly.|$|E
500|$|Bach did {{not give}} a direct {{indication}} of how many singers he envisaged in the choir. [...] The cantata can be performed with only four singers, as in the recording by Joshua Rifkin, who {{is well known in}} the world of Bach performance for his [...] "one <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> part" [...] approach. However, most recordings feature a choir with multiple voices to a part. [...] Another choice to be made is whether to use women singers: Bach's original singers were probably all male. [...] Most recordings of the cantata, however, feature mixed choirs: an exception is the version conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, which deploys boys' voices as the top lines of the choir.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from music}} critics. In the Rolling Stone Magazine {{review of the}} album, critic Kelefa Sanneh wrote: [...] "One of the best is 'Fix You', an unabashedly sentimental song where Martin delivers words of encouragement in a gentle falsetto [...] Proving once more that no band can deliver a stately rock ballad like this one." [...] Paul McNamee of NME magazine wrote: [...] "It’s a wonderful song that shifts from simple stark piano and <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ringing, clattering burst of intent and proto-prog four-part harmony." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters in his review of the album, noted the song as the [...] "best ballad" [...] off X. In 2005, the song appeared at number two on Q magazine's [...] "100 Greatest Tracks of the Year", and was listed {{as one of the}} [...] "Tracks of the Year" [...] by NME in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Producer Richard Gordon cast American actors Clarke and Ashley {{while on}} {{business}} in Hollywood. Prior to Inseminoid, Ashley had starred in minor films of such independent studios as Crown International Pictures, while Clarke {{had just completed}} filming on the 1980 film The Formula. Warren recalls that although Ashley [...] "was not the greatest actress, she was very enthusiastic and very easy to work with." [...] The professional relationship between Warren and Clarke broke down during the filming of sequences such as Dean's incapacitation inside the caves, when the director and actor disagreed {{about the extent to}} which Clarke needed to respond to the script when his character raises his <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> shout. Warren asserts that Clarke's [...] "high opinion of himself" [...] made the actor [...] "a nightmare to work with", and adds that he [...] "could be extremely difficult, making every scene with him an uphill struggle." ...|$|E

500|$|The ending, {{in which}} the pirates are each {{shot to death by}} American snipers, {{reflects}} the resolution of the pirate hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama in April 2009, where U.S. Navy SEALs rescued the captain after three snipers simultaneously killed three pirates with one shot each. They are portrayed in a particularly sympathetic light when they are killed during the ending. Travis Fickett of IGN said, [...] "It's one of those moments where South Park feels the need to give <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> side the media is ignoring—and points out that things aren't quite as cut and dry [...] as we might like." [...] The episode has also been described as a commentary on the way in which Americans tend to take their relative wealth and comfort for granted. A U.S. Navy SEAL ordering another to [...] "not hit the white ones" [...] has also been described as an indictment of the American approach to foreign policy.|$|E
500|$|Jane Campion's {{psychological}} drama Holy Smoke! (1999) featured Winslet as an Australian {{woman who}} joins an Indian religious cult. She found the script to be [...] "really brave" [...] and was {{challenged by the}} idea of portraying an unlikable, manipulative woman. She learnt an Australian accent and worked closely with Campion to justify her character's vileness. The film required her to perform explicit sex scenes with her co-star Harvey Keitel, and featured a scene in which her character appears stark naked and urinates on herself. David Rooney of Variety wrote, [...] "Showing the kind of courage few young thesps would be capable of and an extraordinary range [...] from animal cunning to unhinged desperation, [...] holds nothing back." [...] That same year, she provided her <b>voice</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fairy for the animated film Faeries, and won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for narrating the short story [...] "The Face in the Lake" [...] for the children's audiobook Listen to the Storyteller.|$|E

Chaney thought the [...] "quick edits actually gave the song a nice energy, but also prevented us from seeing more of Tina and Mike dancing", which she said [...] "was a shame". Flandez and Lynch both praised Mike's singing; Lynch said his [...] "voice sounded great", and Flandez declared that [...] "Mike has really come into his own as a singer".
