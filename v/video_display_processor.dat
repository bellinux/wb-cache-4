5|$|Development of the Saturn {{began in}} 1992, {{the same year}} Sega's {{groundbreaking}} 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted. Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi, another <b>video</b> <b>display</b> <b>processor</b> was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation. The Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, known in development as Sonic X-treme, has been considered {{a factor in the}} console's poor performance.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Sega and Japanese {{electronics}} company Hitachi {{formed a}} joint venture {{to develop a new}} CPU for the Saturn, which resulted {{in the creation of the}} [...] "SuperH RISC Engine" [...] (or SH-2) later that year. The Saturn was ultimately designed around a dual-SH2 configuration. According to Kazuhiro Hamada, Sega's section chief for Saturn development during the system's conception, [...] "the SH-2 was chosen for reasons of cost and efficiency. The chip has a calculation system similar to a DSP , but we realized that a single CPU would not be enough to calculate a 3D world." [...] Although the Saturn's design was largely finished before the end of 1993, reports in early 1994 of the technical capabilities of Sony's upcoming PlayStation console prompted Sega to include another <b>video</b> <b>display</b> <b>processor</b> (VDP) to improve the system's 2D performance and texture-mapping. CD-ROM-based and cartridge-only versions of the Saturn hardware were considered for simultaneous release at one point during the system's development, but this idea was discarded due to concerns over the lower quality and higher price of cartridge-based games.|$|E

5000|$|Felsenstein was {{influenced}} in his philosophy by {{the works of}} Ivan Illich, particularly Tools for Conviviality (Harper and Row, 1973). This book advocated a [...] "convivial" [...] approach to design which allowed users of technologies {{to learn about the}} technology by encouraging exploration, tinkering, and modification. Felsenstein had learned about electronics in much the same fashion, and summarized his conclusions in several aphorisms, to wit - [...] "In order to survive in a public-access environment, a computer must grow a computer club around itself." [...] Others were - [...] "To change the rules, change the tools," [...] and [...] "If work is to become play, then tools must become toys."Felsenstein was one of the original members of the Homebrew Computer Club, which formed in 1975 in response to the appearance of the Altair 8800 computer kit.
