2500|$|Style in men's and women's {{footwear}} was {{the same}} in this period. Shoes {{for men and women}} were flat, and often slashed and fastened with a strap across the instep. They were made of soft <b>leather,</b> <b>velvet,</b> or silk. Broad, squared toes were worn early, and were replaced by rounded toes in the 1530s. Toward the middle of the century, shoes became narrower and were shaped naturally to the foot. [...] Soft boots for riding fitted to mid-calf.|$|R
50|$|Although it was William Steward Halsted1 (chief {{surgeon at}} Johns Hopkins Hospital), in 1889, who first invented rubber gloves for {{preventative}} measures, {{the history of}} fitness gloves {{date back to the}} early Greeks and Romans. These type of gloves are usually fingerless gloves, used primarily to carry weighted objects, and were made using fine <b>leather,</b> <b>velvet,</b> or silk. With time, fitness gloves have evolved and now a special kind of padding is also incorporated to protect hands from various injuries.|$|R
50|$|Women wear a calf-length longyi {{in solid}} colors, flower prints or patterns. They are often red-based with stripes or small checks, similar to Mon styles. Royal women wore a long dress called a thin-dai, which was {{decorated}} with many threads. Blouses were highly ornamented with silver and were colorful. Women tie a shawl over their shoulders and wear hair bands with flowers in them. Like the men, women carry umbrellas made from bamboo and wear slippers called hnyat-phanat made of <b>velvet</b> or <b>leather.</b> Women pierced their ears and wore kajorn, or earrings, made from silver. Kajorn were worn in pairs, while regular earrings were worn only on the left earlobe. All of these clothes were exchanged for bright colored clothing during celebrations. The clothing {{is very similar to}} what is worn by the Shan in Burma.|$|R
25|$|In the 1994 refit {{almost all}} of the {{remaining}} original decor was replaced, with Cunard opting to reverse the original design direction of QE2s designers and use the line's traditional ocean liners as inspiration. The green <b>velvet</b> and <b>leather</b> Midships Bar became the Art Deco inspired Chart Room, receiving an original, custom designed piano from Queen Mary. The (by now) blue dominated Theatre Bar was transformed into the Golden Lion Pub, which mimics a traditional Edwardian pub. Some original elements were retained including the flared columns in the Queens Room and Mid-Ships Lobby which were incorporated into the reworked designs. Unfortunately the Queen's Room's indirect lighting from above was replaced with uplighters which reversed the original light airy effect by illuminating the lowered ceiling and leaving shadows in the ceiling's slot; and the furniture and carpet which replaced Michael Inchbald's designs were incongruous next to the flared columns and slotted ceiling.|$|R
5000|$|The 20-minute {{film has}} been {{extremely}} controversial. Although in post-production by November 2015, a release was unclear due to legal issues. The situation was reported in The Guardian newspaper, {{as well as a}} column by Sebastian Shakespeare in the mass circulation (1.7 million readers) Daily Mail newspaper. The Mail reported that a [...] "row" [...] had developed: [...] "Trouser Bar, which is set in a menswear shop, features unlikely roles for Eighties heart-throb Nigel Havers, 63, camp comedian Julian Clary, 56, and veteran comic Barry Cryer, 80. ‘It’s very light-hearted,’ Havers tells me." [...] The Mail column also quotes David McGillivray as saying, [...] "Pornography is still a stigma in this country but author loved porn and, in his letters, he talks about visiting gay cinemas. He had a fetish for fabric: Corduroy was his favourite, but he also liked <b>velvet,</b> flannel, <b>leather</b> and denim. He was very particular about the type of clothes he liked. Trouser Bar is a film of enormous historical interest." ...|$|R
50|$|Sportswear in streetwear designs {{also change}} {{according}} to season. For example, with {{the drop of}} temperature, sports silhouette tends to turn slouchier, volumes become more exaggerated. Solid fabrics such as fur, <b>velvet,</b> wool and <b>leather</b> would become predominant, and quilted detailing on windbreakers, sporty skirts and vests may sometimes be seen in winter. Typical winter look can be voluminous sweatshirt with satin boxer shorts, or a brocade bomber worn {{on top of a}} laid-back dress featuring mesh detailing. In contrast, sportswear in summer usually look more light-weighted and simple. The summer look can be a combination of easy crop tops, sleek dresses and gym-shorts.|$|R
50|$|Lady Dior is a handbag that adopts Dior's graphic {{codes and}} is {{generally}} {{decorated with a}} cannage (caning) motif inspired by two items of furniture found in Dior's private mansion on Avenue Montaigne since 19473: the Napoléon III chairs on which the couturier seated the guests at his runway shows, {{and the back of}} a neo-Louis XVI medallion armchair Louis XV. The bag is composed of one hundred and forty four pieces in total and is rectangular and rigid, with the four gold- or silver-tone D-I-O-R letters and the Dior logo suspended from the handle as charms. It is available in different materials featuring various techniques (<b>leather,</b> <b>velvet,</b> microfiber, satin, denim, python, crocodile, tweed, jacquard,etc.), and in several sizes.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{important}} {{changes were made}} to the front and rear of the body where the designers reinterpreted the styling in a more modern idiom. In particular, the tail was squared and simplified, and the nose lost its separate air intake and headlamp nacelles. The mechanics retained most of the Flavia's specifications including the front-wheel drive, boxer engine, independent suspension and disc brakes all around, with vacuum-assist and split-circuits (called [...] "Superduplex" [...] by Lancia).The 2000 used the 1991 cc 4-cylinder boxer engine, available in either carbureted form (115 hp) or with fuel-injection (126 hp). The latter abandoned the previously used Kugelfisher mechanical system in favor of a more reliable Bosch D-type electronic system. The transmission (produced by ZF) was a 4-speed manual-type for the 2000 equipped with a carburetor, and a manual 5-speed for the fuel-injected 2000. Since the 2000 was given a flagship role for Lancia (following in the footsteps of the prestigious Flaminia), the 2000 was given a high standard of finishes (fine wood for the dashboard and <b>velvet</b> or <b>leather</b> upholstery) and standard or optional equipment including hydraulically operated power steering (also manufactured by ZF), air conditioning, electric windows and sun blinds.|$|R
5000|$|De la Gardie, at {{this time}} {{one of the most}} {{influential}} men in Sweden, had Jean de la Vallée (1620-1696) develop the palace into one of the grandest in Sweden. The new palace, H-shaped in plan in accordance to the style of the day, featured two wings and a terrace facing the waterfront, while wings facing north formed an enclosed courtyard. Additionally, a church was created in the eastern wing. Some of the red festoon stucco ornaments from this era are preserved in the façade, as are the curved cornices facing the garden, and the sumptuous stucco ceilings of Carlo Carove together with other exclusive interior details, including walls covered in <b>leather,</b> <b>velvet,</b> and boiseries.

2500|$|Fashionable {{shoes for}} men and women were similar, with a flat {{one-piece}} sole and rounded toes. Shoes were fastened with ribbons, laces or simply slipped on. Shoes and boots became narrower, followed the contours of the foot, and covered more of the foot, in some cases up to the ankle, than they had previously. As {{in the first half of}} the century, shoes were made from soft <b>leather,</b> <b>velvet,</b> or silk. In Spain, Italy, and Germany the slashing of shoes also persisted into the latter half of the century. In France however, slashing slowly went out of fashion and coloring the soles of footwear red began. Aside from slashing, shoes in this period could be adorned with all sorts of cord, quilting, and frills. [...] Thick-soled pattens were worn over delicate indoor shoes to protect them from the muck of the streets. [...] A variant on the patten popular in Venice was the chopine – a platform-soled mule that raised the wearer sometimes as high as two feet off the ground.|$|R
50|$|A {{treasure}} binding, or jewelled bookbinding / jeweled bookbinding is {{a luxurious}} book cover using metalwork in gold or silver, jewels and ivory, perhaps {{in addition to}} more usual bookbinding material for book-covers such as <b>leather,</b> <b>velvet,</b> or other cloth. The actual bookbinding technique {{is the same as}} for other medieval books, with the folios, normally of vellum, stitched together and bound to wooden cover boards. The metal framework of the treasure binding is then fixed, normally by tacks, onto these boards. Treasure bindings appear to have existed from at least Late Antiquity, though there are no surviving examples from so early, and Early Medieval examples are very rare. They were less used {{by the end of the}} Middle Ages, but a few continued to be produced in the West even up to the present day, and many more in areas where Eastern Orthodoxy predominated. The bindings were mainly used on grand illuminated manuscripts, especially Gospel books designed for the altar and use in church services, rather than study in the library.|$|R
