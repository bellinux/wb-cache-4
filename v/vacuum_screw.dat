40|$|Abstract. Al-rich sludge {{produced}} from industrial anodising and surface treatment processes had {{been tested in}} the fabrication of alumina-based materials, by using plastic extrusion as shaping technique. Long rods were produced using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>screw</b> extruder, by a careful control of all relevant processing parameters. Then, thick discs were obtained by cutting dried selected rods, to be tested as probes for sintering-dependent electrical properties. The sintering process was followed by common dilatometric/thermal analyses and results were interrelated with the evolution of electrical conductivity, estimated by impedance spectroscopy technique (IS). Results show that sintering-dependent morphological evolution up to 1300 ºC strongly affects the electrical behaviour of samples, {{and as a consequence}} IS seems to be a useful method to follow the firing process...|$|E
40|$|This {{review of}} {{literature}} citations relates how mixing affects the heat transfer rates to solids {{in a variety of}} processing units. These units will include pan, horizontal (rotary <b>vacuum),</b> <b>screw</b> conveyor and paddle dryers and/or processors. The data presented will show that, in all cases, the investigators found that by increasing the speed of mixing the heat transfer rate is enhanced except when the agitator speed produces mechanical fluidization and/or during the constant rate period of a drying cycle. Some recent work {{in the area of the}} paddle processor design will be reported. It shows that agitator shape and the density of the heat transfer surface to process volume improves the heat transfer rate along with the speed of rotation of the processor’s agitator...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Twin <b>screw</b> <b>vacuum</b> pump is an {{important}} kind of dry vacuum pump, which is widely used in the oil-free vacuum system. The design of the screw rotor profile directly influences the working performance and manufacture cost of the screw pumps. In this paper, a new rotor profile for twin <b>screw</b> <b>vacuum</b> pump is introduced which is comprised of the cycloid curve, the dedendum circle arc, the involute curve and the addendum circle arc. The processes of three-dimensional modeling, motion simulation, interference checking and structural optimization for twin <b>screw</b> <b>vacuum</b> pumps are studied by means of Solidworks software. The works provide theoretical basis for optimal designing and reference for test prototype manufacturing. The results showed {{the performance of the}} vacuum pump according with the designer’s intention...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{wastewater}} treatment plants are producing huge amount of sludge. The water content of the traditionally dewatered sludge, resulting from drying beds, centrifuges, <b>vacuum</b> filters, <b>screw</b> press filters and pressure filters, remains a critical factor affecting the choice of transportation vehicles, transportation costs, and suitability of sludge for incineration. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the role of polyacrylamide dose and constant current density on the electroforced sedimentation of sludge dewatering process. Zinc Oxide slurry was used as model sludge. Electroforced sedimentation experiments of zinc oxide suspended in aqueous media with and without polyacrylamide were carried out under various constant electric current densities. It was observed that at the same constant electric current density, the voltage difference was decreasing with the increase of polyacrylamide dose. Moreover, the highest sedimentation rate was attributed at 1. 5 % polyacrylamide in electroforced sedimentation of zinc oxide slurry under different constant current densities...|$|R
50|$|A vacuum {{variable}} capacitor uses {{a set of}} plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid {{in or out of}} an opposing set of cylinders (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the <b>vacuum.</b> A <b>screw</b> shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio as well as high powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient since the elements are under a vacuum the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced.|$|R
5000|$|The Ford car was {{thoroughly}} updated in 1941, {{in preparation for}} a time of unpredictability surrounding World War II. The 1941 design would continue in an aborted 1942 model year and would be restarted in 1946 and produced until the more modern 1949 Fords were ready. During the initial year of this car, it evolved considerably. The front fenders came in three pieces, the theory being that small damage could be replaced easily. During the year, it evolved into two pieces with the lower front and back sections being joined. The hood risers changed, the early ones being the same as 1940 Fords, changing during the year to the better later version. The 1941 Convertible had no rear side windows, the only side windows being in the doors; in 1942, quarter windows were added so the rear occupants could see out.Five different coil/distributor arrangements were used during 1941, causing confusion for mechanics. Other variations were: two different positions for the generator, and three for the cooling fan — front of the crankshaft, front of the generator (rare) and on a bracket. This is thought to be the first Ford to offer an oil filter. The two interior heaters were a [...] "Southwind" [...] gasoline burner, which had the advantage of keeping one warm in winter at drive-in movies (provided a small electric fuel pump was used), and a more ordinary hot-water type. Both had window defrosters. It had an excellent radio, which could consume the battery in about two hours. Electric windshield wipers were available in addition to the vacuum-powered wipers. Three different convertible power top mechanisms (<b>vacuum,</b> electric <b>screw,</b> and hydraulic) and two different header bar latching systems were used. Rear suspensions sometimes had a sway bar, most did not. It had excellent brakes for the time, and the best handling of an ordinary car at the time. It was a very transitional car.|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} type of twin screw {{machines}} are twin screw compressors. These normally contain rotors of uniform pitch and profile along the rotor length. However, in some cases such as in twin <b>screw</b> <b>vacuum</b> pumps with very large pressure ratios, the variable pitch rotors are often used to improve efficiency. The limited use of rotors with variable pitch and/or section profile is mainly due to manufacturing constraints. In order to analyse the performance of such machines by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), it is necessary to produce a numerical mesh capable of calculating 3 D transient fluid flows within their working domains. An algebraic grid generation algorithm applicable to unstructured grid, Finite Volume Method (FVM) for variable pitch and variable profile screw machines is described in this paper. The grid generation technique has been evaluated for an oil free air compressor with “N” profile rotors of 3 / 5 lobe configuration. The performance was obtained by calculations with commercial CFD code. The grid generation procedure provides mesh of the required quality and results from CFD calculations are presented to compare performance of constant pitch rotors, variable pitch rotors and variable profile rotors. The variable pitch and variable profile rotors achieve steeper internal pressure rise and a larger discharge area for the same pressure ratio. Variable pitch rotors achieve reduced sealing line length in high pressure domains...|$|R
40|$|For {{dry running}} {{displacement}} vacuum pumps {{the abolition of}} cooling, sealing and lubricating fluids causes the problem of an increased thermal load. The thermodynamics of this process differ fundamentally from the thermodynamics of an air compressor. The former are characterised by a - usually - unadjusted pressure ratio, the oscillation of the working fluid and the periodic mixing process of the working gas (that has already been expelled) and the gas in the working chamber. This process results in adiabatic outlet temperatures that are distinctly higher than the outlet temperatures of an adjusted isentropic process. Lower suction pressure results in a discrepancy between the adiabatic model and reality, which {{is the reason why}} a calculation of the diabatic process is necessary. In support of a isothermal model the dependence of the working behaviour on both the speed and the gap height of the <b>screw</b> <b>vacuum</b> pump can be demonstrated, but it does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the thermal load of the gas and the pump. This work describes additional modules of the simulation program Kasim that has been developed as a solution to this problem. The lack of Nußelt equations for rotating systems in vacuum results in the application of heat transfer models of the overpressure range in order to calculate the heat transfer of those systems. Pressure-dependent substance properties have been based on gas cinematic models. Apart from these further models were investigated {{in order to determine the}} flow velocity and state variables of the working gas at the heat transferring areas. Initially, the simulation program was applied to a cold model machine which consisted of a srew vacuum pump with constant pitch. Compared with the steady state machine, the cold machine had the advantage of known boundary conditions. The large differences between simulation and experiment cannot be explained either by the sensitivity of the heat transfer models or the property models, or by the polytropic exponents of the expansion flow in the gap. Measurement technique appears to be the most likely explanation. That is the reason why a further investigation was carried out on the steady state machine. This included also body temperatures and an energy balance. In order to find out about body temperatures, a module was developed which allowed the surface elements of the finite element mesh of the pump to be allocated to the capacities and connections of the thermodynamic simulation system. After the boundary conditions had been defined, this assignment formed the basis for the calculation of the heat fluxes, based on a homogenous, isothermal machine whose temperature was to be re-determined by the thermal FE-calculations of its parts. This allowed a calculation of the steady state heat balance to be carried out iteratively. The verification was successful. The calculated heat flows of the machine parts were acceptably close to the experimental energy balance. Moreover, both the body temperatures and the maximum gas temperatures during the working process displayed a high degree of concordance. The present study proves that both the adaptation of heat transfer models of the overpressure range in the rotating system of a vacuum pump and the implementation of gas cinematic property models results in a good representation of the working behaviour. At the same time, it offers the possibility of further improvements. Moreover, it opens up the perspective of a completely closed simulation of rotating displacement vacuum pumps...|$|R
