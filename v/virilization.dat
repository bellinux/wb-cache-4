25|$|All of {{the issues}} related to <b>virilization,</b> {{neonatal}} assignment, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} genital surgery, childhood and adult <b>virilization,</b> gender identity and sexual orientation {{are similar to those of}} 21-hydroxylase CAH and elaborated in more detail in Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.|$|E
25|$|No <b>virilization</b> (acne, voice changes, hirsutism) of {{the adult}} female.|$|E
25|$|In an XX (genetically female) fetus, {{elevated}} {{amounts of}} DHEA can produce moderate <b>virilization</b> by conversion {{in the liver}} to testosterone. <b>Virilization</b> of genetic females is partial, often mild, and rarely raises assignment questions. The issues surrounding corrective surgery of the virilized female genitalia {{are the same as}} for moderate 21-hydroxylase deficiency but surgery is rarely considered desirable.|$|E
25|$|Adrenal glands {{of female}} fetuses with CAH begin {{producing}} excess testosterone by the 9th week of gestation. The most {{important aspects of}} <b>virilization</b> (urogenital closure and phallic urethra) occur between 8 and 12 weeks. Theoretically, if enough glucocorticoid could be supplied to the fetus to reduce adrenal testosterone production by the 9th week, <b>virilization</b> could be prevented and the difficult decision about timing of surgery avoided.|$|E
25|$|Doses of 19-nortestosterones {{required}} for <b>virilization</b> are 10–20mg/day, far {{in excess of}} that associated with inadvertent contraceptive exposure during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The only sex steroid {{currently}} {{utilized in}} women {{that can cause}} <b>virilization</b> of female fetuses when administered in usually administered doses is the androgen danazol, a derivative of ethisterone (17α-ethinyl-testosterone).|$|E
25|$|Stages 2 and 3 {{represent}} {{progressively more}} severe degrees of <b>virilization.</b> The genitalia are obviously abnormal to the eye, with a phallus intermediate {{in size and}} a small vaginal opening.|$|E
25|$|Fetal masculinization {{of female}} {{external}} genitalia due to maternal use of androgenic steroids is generally less advanced than {{that due to}} CAH, and unlike CAH, does not cause progressive <b>virilization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{challenge}} of preventing severe <b>virilization</b> of girls is twofold: detection of CAH {{at the beginning}} of the pregnancy, and delivery of an effective amount of glucocorticoid to the fetus without causing harm to the mother.|$|E
25|$|The {{androgen}} excess is mild {{enough that}} <b>virilization</b> is not apparent or goes unrecognized at birth and in early childhood. However, androgen levels are above normal and slowly rise during childhood, producing noticeable effects between 2 and 9 years of age.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} serious {{neonatal}} consequences of 21-hydroxylase deficiency occur {{when there is}} minimal measurable hydroxylase activity from prenatal life: life-threatening salt-wasting crises {{in the first month}} of life for XX and XY infants alike and severe <b>virilization</b> of female infants.|$|E
25|$|Adipose tissue {{possesses}} aromatase, {{an enzyme}} that converts androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol. The excess of adipose tissue in obese women creates {{the paradox of}} having both excess androgens (which are responsible for hirsutism and <b>virilization)</b> and estrogens (which inhibits FSH via negative feedback).|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} from {{testosterone}} medication include acne, swelling, and breast enlargement in males. Serious side effects may include liver toxicity, heart disease, and behavioral changes. Women {{and children who}} are exposed may develop <b>virilization.</b> It is recommended that individuals with prostate cancer not use the medication. It can cause harm if used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|A large {{clinical}} study of high to very high oral dosages of NET (10 to 40mg/day) administered for prolonged {{periods of time}} (4 to 35 weeks) to prevent miscarriage in pregnant women found that 5.5% of the women experienced mild androgenic side effects such as mild voice changes (hoarseness), acne, and hirsutism and that 18.3% of female infants born to the mothers showed, in most cases only slight, <b>virilization</b> of the genitals. Maternal androgenic symptoms occurred most often in women who received a dosage of NET of 30mg/day or more {{for a period of}} 15weeks or longer. In the female infants who experienced <b>virilization</b> of the genitals, the sole manifestation in 86.7% of the cases was varied but almost always slight enlargement of the clitoris. In the remaining 13.3% of the affected cases, marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds occurred. The dosages used in these cases were 20 to 40mg/day.|$|E
25|$|If the {{condition}} has not already been diagnosed, it usually becomes apparent at puberty around age twelve with primary amenorrhoea and <b>virilization.</b> This may include descending of the testes, hirsutism (facial/body hair considered normal in males - {{not to be}} confused with hypertrichosis), deepening of the voice, and enlargement of the clitoris into what would then be classed as a penis.|$|E
25|$|Since CAH is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease, most children with CAH {{are born to}} parents unaware of the risk and with no family history. Each child will have a 25% chance of being born with the disease. Families typically wish to minimize the degree of <b>virilization</b> of a girl. There is no known prenatal harm to a male fetus from CAH, so treatment can begin at birth.|$|E
25|$|On January 12, 1989, after {{determining}} that progestogens {{did not cause}} non-genital birth defects, the FDA published a notice revising the black box warning on all progestogen drugs (except contraceptives) to warn against their use during {{the first four months}} of pregnancy because of past reports of genital birth defects (an increased risk of hypospadias in male fetuses and mild <b>virilization</b> of the external genitalia in female fetuses).|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{with mild}} (or minimal) {{androgen}} insensitivity syndrome (grade 1 on the Quigley scale) are born phenotypically male, with fully masculinized genitalia; this category of androgen insensitivity is diagnosed when {{the degree of}} androgen insensitivity in an individual with a 46,XY karyotype is great enough to impair <b>virilization</b> or spermatogenesis, but is not great enough to impair normal male genital development. MAIS is the mildest and least known form of androgen insensitivity syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Appearance of {{pubic hair}} in mid-childhood {{is the most}} common feature that leads to {{evaluation}} and diagnosis. Other accompanying features are likely to be tall stature and accelerated bone age (often 3–5 years ahead). Often present are increased muscle mass, acne, and adult body odor. In boys the penis will be enlarged. Mild clitoral enlargement may occur in girls, and sometimes a degree of prenatal <b>virilization</b> is recognized that may have gone unnoticed in infancy.|$|E
25|$|At present no program screens {{for risk}} in {{families}} {{who have not yet}} had a child with CAH. For families desiring to avoid <b>virilization</b> of a second child, the current strategy is to start dexamethasone as soon as a pregnancy has been confirmed even though at that point the chance that the pregnancy is a girl with CAH is only 12.5%. Dexamethasone is taken by the mother each day until it can be safely determined whether she is carrying an affected girl.|$|E
25|$|Stage 5 denotes {{complete}} male <b>virilization,</b> with a normally formed penis {{with the}} urethral opening {{at or near}} the tip. The scrotum is normally formed but empty. The internal pelvic organs include normal ovaries and uterus, and the vagina connects internally with the urethra as in Stage 4. These infants are not visibly ambiguous, and are usually assumed to be ordinary boys with undescended testes. In most cases, the diagnosis of CAH is not suspected until signs of salt-wasting develop a week later.|$|E
25|$|Methyltestosterone {{should be}} used with caution in women and children, as it can cause {{irreversible}} <b>virilization.</b> Due to its estrogenicity, methyltestosterone can also accelerate epiphyseal closure and thereby produce short stature in children and adolescents. It can worsen symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Methyltestosterone {{should not be used}} in men with prostate cancer, as androgens can accelerate tumor progression. The drug {{should be used}} with caution in patients with pre-existing hepatotoxicity, due to its own potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{methyltestosterone}} include androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, increased aggressiveness and sex drive, and spontaneous erections, {{as well as}} estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia, fluid retention, and edema. In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible <b>virilization,</b> for instance voice deepening, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility. In men, the drug may also cause hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a variant of androgen insensitivity that solely affected spermatogenesis was theoretical at first. Cases of phenotypically normal males with isolated spermatogenic defect due to AR mutation were first detected {{as the result of}} male infertility evaluations. Until then, early evidence in support of the {{existence of}} MAIS was limited to cases involving a mild defect in <b>virilization,</b> although some of these early cases made allowances for some degree of impairment of genital masculinization, such as hypospadias or micropenis. It is estimated that 2-3% of infertile men have AR gene mutations.|$|E
25|$|In adulthood, {{individuals}} do not experience male-pattern baldness. As DHT {{is a far}} more potent androgen than testosterone alone, <b>virilization</b> in those lacking DHT may be absent or reduced compared to males with functional 5-AR. It is hypothesized that rising testosterone levels at the start of puberty are able to generate sufficient levels of DHT either by the action of 5α-reductase type I (active in the adult liver, non-genital skin and some brain areas) or through the expression of low levels of 5α-reductase type II in the testes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Virilization</b> {{of genetically}} female (XX) infants usually {{produces}} obvious genital ambiguity. Inside the pelvis, the ovaries are normal {{and since they}} have not been exposed to testicular antimullerian hormone (MIF), the uterus, fallopian tubes, upper vagina, and other mullerian structures are normally formed as well. However, the high levels of testosterone in the blood can enlarge the phallus, partially or completely close the vaginal opening, enclose the urethral groove so that it opens {{at the base of the}} phallus, on the shaft or even at the tip like a boy. Testosterone can cause the labial skin to become as thin and rugated as a scrotum, but cannot produce palpable gonads (i.e., testes) in the folds.|$|E
25|$|Genetic males (46,XY) with 5α-reductase type II {{deficiency}} {{are born}} with undervirilization including pseudohermaphroditism (ambiguous genitalia), pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias, and usually undescended testes. Their external genitalia are female-like, with micropenis (a small, clitoris-like phallus), a partially unfused, labia-like scrotum, and a blind-ending, shallow vaginal pouch. Due to their lack of conspicuous male genitalia, genetic males with the condition are typically raised as girls. At the time of puberty however, they develop striking phenotypically masculine secondary sexual characteristics including partial <b>virilization</b> of the genitals (enlargement of the phallus into a near-functional penis and descent of the testes), voice deepening, typical male musculoskeletal development, and no menstruation, breast development, or other signs of feminization that occur during female puberty. In addition, normal libido and spontaneous erections develop, they usually show a sexual preference for females, and almost all develop a male gender identity.|$|E
25|$|Androgens like {{testosterone}} and DHT play {{a critical}} role in the pathogenesis of a number of dermatological conditions including acne, seborrhea, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth in women), and pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia). In demonstration of this, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) do not produce sebum or develop acne and have little to no body, pubic, or axillary hair. Moreover, men with congenital 5α-reductase type II deficiency 5α-reductase being an enzyme that greatly potentiates the androgenic effects of testosterone in the skin, have little to no acne, scanty facial hair, reduced body hair, and reportedly no incidence of male pattern hair loss. Conversely, hyperandrogenism in women, for instance due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), is commonly associated with acne and hirsutism as well as <b>virilization</b> (masculinization) in general. In accordance with the preceding, antiandrogens are highly effective in the treatment of the aforementioned androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} {{cells from}} the mesenchyme can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include fibroblasts and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include ovarian torsion, hemorrhage from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, isosexual precocious pseudopuberty may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation (excessive bleeding, infrequent menstruation, or no menstruation) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur {{at the same time}} as endometrial cancer or breast cancer. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause <b>virilization</b> and excessive hair growth due to the production of testosterone and androstenedione, which can also cause Cushing's syndrome in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and hydrothorax. With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.|$|E
25|$|Although {{progesterone}} {{does not}} bind {{directly to the}} AR, it is a precursor and intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens from cholesterol. For this reason, {{there has been some}} speculation that exogenous progesterone could be transformed into androgens by certain tissues that express the requisite enzymes. Progesterone is converted by 17α-hydroxylase into 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 17,20-lyase into androstenedione, and androstenedione is converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases into testosterone. CYP17A1, the cytochrome P450 gene that encodes 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, is expressed mainly in the gonads (ovaries and testes) and the adrenal glands. Despite the reasoning that progesterone could be converted into androgens however, clinical studies in which women were treated with 100 to 300mg/day OMP have found no or only a small increase in levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and no change in androgen levels, including those of dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. In these studies, levels of estradiol and cortisol, which progesterone is also a precursor of, did not change either, although levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone did increase significantly. In accordance with the lack of changes in androgen levels, progesterone, unlike various progestins, has not been associated with androgenic effects in clinical studies, including changes in the blood lipid profile or sex hormone-binding globulin levels, acne, skin oiliness, hirsutism, or voice deepening, or induction of teratogenicity (i.e., <b>virilization</b> of female fetuses).|$|E
2500|$|... 11β-OH CAH resembles 21-hydroxylase {{deficient}} CAH in its androgenic manifestations: partial <b>virilization</b> {{and ambiguous}} genitalia of genetically female infants, childhood <b>virilization</b> of both sexes, and rarer cases of <b>virilization</b> or infertility of adolescent and adult women. The mineralocorticoid effect differs: hypertension {{is usually the}} clinical clue that a patient has 11- rather than 21-hydroxylase CAH. Diagnosis of 11β-OH CAH is usually confirmed by demonstration of marked elevations of 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), the substrates of 11β-hydroxylase. Management {{is similar to that}} of 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH except that mineralocorticoids need not be replaced.|$|E
2500|$|... {{excessive}} facial hair, <b>virilization,</b> and/or menstrual irregularity {{in adolescence}} ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{functional}} and average sized penis {{in cases involving}} extreme <b>virilization</b> (but no sperm) ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Virilization</b> {{capacity}} can {{be assessed}} by measuring the response to a trial of exogenous androgens; some studies have measured {{the growth of the}} phallus in response to exogenous testosterone [...] or dihydrotestosterone, while others have measured the change in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in response to the artificial androgen stanozolol to assess androgen sensitivity. [...] Some experts have cautioned that it remains to be proved that a good response to exogenous androgens in neonates is a good predictor of androgen response at puberty. [...] If a mutation in the AR gene is found, it is important to determine whether the mutation is inherited or de novo (i.e. a somatic mutation); a certain amount of the wild-type androgen receptor will be present in cases of somatic mutation, which can induce <b>virilization</b> at puberty. [...] A genital skin fibroblast study [...] and a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation test [...] may also provide information helpful in the assessment of <b>virilization</b> capacity.|$|E
2500|$|... 1950: Lawson Wilkins administers daily {{methyltestosterone}} to a karyotype|46,XY female patient, {{who shows}} no signs of <b>virilization.</b> [...] His experiment is the first documented demonstration of the pathophysiology of AIS.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{depending}} on the severity of hyperandrogenism, a female infant can be mildly affected, obviously ambiguous, or so severely virilized as {{to appear to be}} a male. Andrea Prader devised the following Prader scale as a way of describing the degree of <b>virilization.</b>|$|E
