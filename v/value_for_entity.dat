The main {{research objective}} is to examine how enterprises can protect themselves against hostile takeover and raiders on Russian market? The research problem can be further divided into three sub-problems. The first sub-problem is to examine most common schemes of hostile takeovers in Russia. The second sub-problem is to identify already well-known anti-hostile takeover defense methods used in Russia. The third sub-problem is to describe which of above mentioned defense methods or their combinations are effective against which takeover scheme. The main purpose of the thesis is to create some sort of instructions that SME with their limited resources and large entities {{would be able to}} use <b>for</b> protecting an <b>entity</b> from potential hostile takeover on its initial stage and during takeover attempt. DATA Two takeover events were chosen for the research. First case is TogliattiAzot takeover event. Second takeover case is Russneft. Togliattiazot and Russneft tend to be critical cases rather representative ones. The critical cases are chosen because they encompass the most concerned issues that I’m interested in, rather than help to attempt statistical generalization. Data used in the research is a combination of several types and sources. First, juridical databases “Consultant”, “Codex” and “Garant” is used to obtain data related to takeover events’ trials. Second, a number of interviews are conducted with participants of the corporate control market. Through interviews it’s expected to obtain data and information related to takeover events not available to the public. RESULTS Theoretical generalizations of results is summarized in Survival Guide part of the research, which is intent to have practical <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>entities</b> and serve as an instruction for enterprises in hostile environment. The instruction is focused on steps which could be taken by enterprises to avoid becoming easy target in hostile environment and prevent any hostile behavior towards the company...|$|R

List is a crucial source of structured data on the web. Ranking the list data is generously important for information retrieval. Tremendous efforts have been done for extracting information from the structured data, especially from web tables, which contain quality information. Instead of focusing on context- free structured data, we aim to focus on context that we can spot, and then using the context to render less controlled information and proceed to its extraction. Here we highlight expensive as well as, rich source of information on the web, those are top-k web pages. Top-k web pages contain rich and quality information. They aim to identity the top attribute <b>values</b> <b>for</b> the <b>entities</b> of interest.

A property storage module for a specific application can be instantiated from a simple specification describing the requirements imposed by that application. This approach eases the task of the person designing the application, and allows them to strongly separate the property storage aspects of solutions to different subproblems. 1 Introduction Many computer applications deal with entities that have properties.

This thesis examines desirable features in the context of quantitative modeling for systems engineering modeling language. Object Management Group’s UML and SysML and Vitech’s System Definition Language are then analyzed in terms of these features. The first important feature is the capability for interoperability between different MBSE tools combined with the ability to integrate the use of specialty tools to interact with and manipulate the system model. Flexibility is necessary in describing and defining entities in the system modeling language. This allows supporting project specific concerns in the system semantics, making MBSE tool support simpler. Finally, support <b>for</b> non-fixed <b>value</b> properties <b>for</b> <b>entities,</b> particularly random variables, is essential to representing system behavior. Existing system modeling languages have shortcomings that should be addressed to improve the conduct of MBSE. Random variables are inconsistently supported. Behavior modeling allows intermingling event timelines <b>for</b> different <b>entities,</b> preventing automated analysis of possible event sequences. Finally, support of parametric modeling is not universal, and the semantics for the use of black box entities to represent external analysis is ad-hoc. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} in information extraction technology has enabled {{a vast array}} of applications that rely on structured data that is embedded in natural-language text. In particular, the extraction of concepts from the Web—with their desired attributes—is important to provide applications with rich, structured access to information. In this paper, we focus on an important family of concepts, namely, entities (e. g., people or organizations) and their attributes, and study how to efficiently and effectively extract them from Web-accessible text documents. Unfortunately, information extraction over the Web is challenging for both quality and efficiency reasons. Regarding quality, many sources on the Web contain misleading or invalid information; furthermore, extraction systems often return incorrect data. Regarding efficiency, information extraction is a time-consuming process, often involving expensive text-processing steps. We presentatop-k extractionprocessingapproachthataddresses both the quality and efficiency challenges: <b>for</b> each <b>entity</b> and attribute of interest, we return the top-k values of the attribute <b>for</b> the <b>entity</b> according to a scoring function <b>for</b> extracted attribute <b>values.</b> This scoring function weighs the extraction confidence from individual documents, as well as the “importance ” of the documents where the information originates. We define the document importance in terms of entity-specific document “popularity ” statistics from a major search engine. Overall, our top-k extraction processing approach manages to identify the top attribute <b>values</b> <b>for</b> the <b>entities</b> of interest efficiently, as we demonstrate with a large-scale experimental evaluation over real-life data...|$|R

While the existing literature has focused on problems such as schema integration and entity identification, it has largely overlooked a basic question: When an attribute <b>value</b> <b>for</b> a real-world <b>entity</b> is recorded differently in different databases, how should the "best" value be chosen from the set of possible values? This paper provides an answer to this question. We first show how a probability distribution over a set of possible values can be derived. We then demonstrate how these probabilities can be used to solve a given decision problem by minimizing the total cost of type I, type II, and misrepresentation errors. Finally, we propose a framework for integrating multiple data sources when a single "best" value has to be chosen and stored for every attribute of an entity. data integration, heterogeneous databases, probabilistic databases, data quality, type I error, type II error, misrepresentation error...|$|R

Therefore, USPIO-enhanced MR-VSI was performed on DU- 4475, MDA-MB- 435, and EOMA tumor–bearing mice xenografts with known differences in angiogenic activity and vessel morphology. MR results were compared to vessel sizes determined by immunohistochemistry (anti-CD 31) and by intravital microscopy (IVM).

The semantic differences usually include incompatible data schemas (structures, different data types, domains etc.) and differences in content (different <b>values</b> <b>for</b> the same <b>entity).</b> While the second type of differences is difficult to be solved in an automated way, the first type can be described by the new tool HALE, developed within the HUMBOLDT project. The HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor (HALE) allows to interactively specify transformations between models at a conceptual schema level. It is possible to rename attributes, to make reclassification (classification mapping), to change geometric types, to change values using various mathematical expressions, to set default values etc. The paper presents features, functions and results of testing harmonisation process for selected geodata. The process of data integration into common schemas which are INSPIRE compliant is discussed. The INSPIRE theme Hydrography is used as a core of the solution.

40|$|The {{most popular}} way {{environmental}} economists have quantified the worth we hold for wildlife {{has been through}} calculating a <b>value</b> <b>for</b> conservation or preservation practices. These typically focus upon endangered or charismatic species, and to an existence or non-use value which somebody holds for the creature in question. This thesis recognises that our <b>value</b> <b>for</b> wildlife may be more diverse than this. Indeed, it is highly feasible that people can derive an important yet cognitively disparate benefit from the animals and plants which they experience every day and which reside within close proximity to their homes. Using a combination of inter-disciplinary theories and techniques, this doctorate seeks to explore how mankind receives ‘nature connectivity’ value from local wildlife. This work implies that by undertaking a ‘warden-style’ role when interacting with {{the flora and fauna}} which resides upon our doorsteps, humans can satisfy a separate and distinct aspect of their subjective well-being from that which they establish through classic conservation mechanisms. Furthermore, this satisfaction may act as a substitute for other local social activities which are dwindling in modern UK society, including the participation in community or religious groups. The potential impact of these findings are that we may want to rethink the ways we approach the natural world if people are to maximise the participation in and welfare derived from their engagement with it. This includes attending to the behavioural and social infrastructure which can facilitate the opportunities for people to express and enjoy a connection with nature. More generally, the conjectures made here indicate the importance of understanding not only if <b>values</b> exist <b>for</b> environmental <b>entities,</b> but comprehending when these will be dampened or elevated. Until this can be done successfully, environmental economists will forever be fighting a losing battle to retain natural resources at socially optimum thresholds...|$|R
