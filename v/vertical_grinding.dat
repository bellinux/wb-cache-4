40|$|Abstract Grinding {{introduces}} unavoidable {{residual stresses}} of significant but unknown magnitudes. The effect of residual stresses in surface integrity {{is related to}} the nature of the residual stresses which relies purely on the process parameters and the workmaterial properties. It is a well-known fact that the fatigue strength of a ground component is increased by introducing compressive stresses. On the other hand, fatigue cracks may originate at regions of maximum tensile stress and usually at the surface of the material. Moreover, stress corrosion cracking is another consequence of critical surface tensile stress. Added to that, the residual stresses may result in dimension alteration and surface distortion, particularly for thin products such as plates. The beneficial effects of compressive residual stresses have been widely recognized in industry. The wise application of such a principle would bring about improved economical use of parts subjected to fatigue loading and aggressive environmental conditions. Therefore a better understanding of residual stress mechanisms is necessary to increase the dimensional accuracy and improve the surface integrity of ground elements, particularly for parts with high precision and manufactured by automated production lines. Consequently, the development of reliable models for predicting residual stresses is of great value in reducing the amount of measurements and experimental tests of residual stresses. Unfortunately, little effort has been devoted so far to develop appropriate models to take into account grinding conditions, workmaterial properties and boundary conditions. This thesis aims to investigate the residual stress mechanisms induced by grinding in terms of grinding parameters. In order to obtain a full understanding, both the roles of individual factors causing residual stresses (i. e. mechanical, thermal and phase transformation) and their couplings were carefully studied with the aid of the finite element method. The studies include: (1) residual stresses due to thermal grinding conditions, (2) residual stresses due to iso-thermal mechanical grinding conditions, (3) coupling of thermo-mechanical conditions, (4) coupling of thermo-phase transformation, and (5) the full coupling of all the factors. It is found that under sole thermal grinding conditions, the heat flux associated with up-grinding may lead to a higher grinding temperature compared with that of down-grinding. A constant flux introduces the least temperature rise if the total grinding energy is the same. Higher convection heat transfer not only decreases the grinding temperature but also makes the temperature rise occur mainly within a thin surface layer. A similar effect can be achieved by applying higher table speeds. When the grinding temperature is less than the austensing temperature, surface residual stresses are tensile. The heat generated within the grinding zone causes a very non-uniform temperature field in the workpiece. The part of the workmaterial subjected to a higher temperature rise expands more significantly and causes compressive stresses because of the restraint from its surrounding material that expands less. When the surface heat flux moves forward, the material outside the grinding zone contracts under cooling. Since the workmaterial has been plastically deformed during thermal loading, the contraction is restrained and thus a tensile stress field is generated locally. If a workpiece material experiences a critical temperature variation in grinding, phase transformation takes place and a martensite layer appears in the immediate layer underneath the ground surface. It was found that the growth of martensite develops a hardened zone with a higher yield stress that expands with the movement of the heat flux. A tensile surface residual stress is then developed. When the volume growth of material takes place during phase change, compressive residual stresses may also be generated. Under iso-thermal grinding conditions, it was found that plane stress is mainly compressive regardless of the distribution of surface traction and the direction of the tangential grinding force. With up-grinding, the residual stress in the grinding direction is always tensile. However, down-grinding may yield compressive surface residual stresses if the magnitude of the ratio of horizontal to <b>vertical</b> <b>grinding</b> forces is sufficiently large. Moreover, it is noted that discrete surface traction, which is more reasonable in terms of simulating the individual cutting of abrasive grits, would bring about more complex residual stress distribution that is very sensitive to the combined effect of individual cutting grits. If thermal and mechanical grinding conditions are coupled, a state free from residual stresses may be achieved if grinding heat is low and either the convection heat transfer or the table speed is high. However, it is found that the full coupling of the mechanical deformation, the thermal deformation and deformation by phase change results in tensile residual stresses. The effects of cooling and mechanical traction in this case however are minor. In summary, the research of this thesis explored the following: (a) grinding temperature development in terms of a wide range of grinding parameters together with the effect of temperature-dependent material properties, (b) the origin and onset of irreversible deformation due to mechanical loading, thermal loading and phase change under critical grinding conditions, (c) the effects of individual residual stress mechanisms and their partial and full couplings, and (d) the selection of grinding conditions to achieve beneficial residual stresses. Finally, based on the new findings in this research, a more comprehensive methodology is suggested for further study...|$|E

These serial papers consist of three parts. Part 1 {{is concerned with the}} measurement of temperatures reached in the grinding zone.

Then temperatures under different operating parameters were studied by using the foil thermocouple for three different grinding methods- straight surface grinding, circular sawing, and <b>vertical</b> spindle <b>grinding.</b> Both the optical fiber and foil thermocouple were found to be effective in the investigation of temperatures generated in the grinding of granite. Although the complex infrared technique is considered to be of much faster response, both methods gave comparable temperature responses under the conditions used in the present study.

Ceramic inclusions can lead to eventual fracturing or breakage of the glass container, especially if the container is filled with a pressurized liquid like soda or beer.

Many MRFs physically remove ceramic contaminants from the cullet, either manually or with automated systems.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{there has been an}} {{increase}} in demand for fine grinding due to the depletion of coarse-grained orebodies and an increase of processing fine disseminated minerals and complex orebodies. These ores have provided new challenges in concentrator design because fine and ultra-fine grinding is required to achieve acceptable recovery rates. Therefore, the correct design of a grinding circuit is important for minimizing unit costs and increasing product quality.

Conference Address: Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:APR 26 - 29, 2010. The {{ultrasonic}} vibration-assisted machining (UVAM) {{technology is}} increasingly attractive for the ultraprecision machining of brittle materials. But the machining mechanism for UVAM is still unknown, {{especially for the}} grinding process. In this paper, the kinematical characteristics of two-dimensional <b>vertical</b> ultrasonic vibration-assisted <b>grinding</b> (UVAG) technology are investigated. A consistent physical modeling of the grinding process with ultrasonic vibration assistance is established firstly, {{which is based on}} the interaction of individual grinding grains with the workpiece. Then the kinematical equation is deduced, and so does the velocity and acceleration of a single abrasive grit relative to the workpiece in UVAG. The kinematics of a single abrasive grit during 2 D UVAG is simulated for the perpendicular vibration mode. The results show that the relation motion of an abrasive grit is altered significantly with the assistance of ultrasonic vibration, and the grinding path is elongated, which will increase the material removal rate per abrasive grit. The most interesting result is that the relative velocity of an abrasive grit in UVAG is changed slightly when compared to that without ultrasonication. While the relative acceleration in UVAG is increasing tremendously, especially for high frequency ratio (a ratio between the vibration frequency to the rotation frequency) condition. This result means that the ultrasonic vibration assistance can introduce a huge acceleration impact on the material in the machining deformation zone by the grinding grit, and may change the material removal mechanism of grinding. Thus it can do a favor to the precision machining of brittle materials. The UVAG experiment of polysilicon shows that the surface roughness is improved and the normal and tangential grinding forces decrease with the increasing of applied voltage, while the axial grinding force increases. The results indicate that the assistance of ultrasonic vibration can result the change of the grinding mechanism of brittle material...|$|R
