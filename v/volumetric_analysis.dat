Similarly, Cu2HgI4 is used as a precipitating reagent to test for alkaloids. The iodide and iodate anions are often used for quantitative <b>volumetric</b> <b>analysis,</b> for example in iodometry and the iodine clock reaction (in which iodine also serves as a test for starch, forming a dark blue complex), and aqueous alkaline iodine solution is used in the iodoform test for methyl ketones.

5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for <b>volumetric</b> <b>analysis</b> in cerimetric titrations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A fully {{automated}} method for computerized de-tection of pulmonary embolism in spiral computed tomography angiography was developed based on <b>volumetric</b> image <b>analysis.</b> The detection method {{is based on}} segmentation of pulmonary vessels to limit the search space, and analysis of several three-di-mensional features inside segmented vessel volume. The features utilized are vascular size, local contrast based on mathematical morphology, degree of curvilinearity based on second derivatives, and geometric features such as volume and length. Detection results were obtained for 19 clinical data sets {{and the performance of}} the method was evaluated. Using the number and locations of thrombi diagnosed by radiologists as the gold standard, 100 % sensitivity was achieved with 7. 7 false positives per case, and 85 % sensitivity was obtained with 2. 6 false positives. For identification of all the positive cases as positive, i. e., detection of at least one thrombus per positive case, 1. 9 false positives per case were obtained.

50|$|Once the {{presence}} of certain substances in a sample is known, the study of their absolute or relative abundance can help in determining specific properties. Knowing the composition of a sample is very important, and several ways {{have been developed to}} make it possible, like gravimetric and <b>volumetric</b> <b>analysis.</b> Gravimetric analysis yields more accurate data about the composition of a sample than <b>volumetric</b> <b>analysis</b> but also takes more time to perform in the laboratory. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>analysis,</b> on the other hand, doesn't take that much time and can produce satisfactory results. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>analysis</b> can be simply a titration based in a neutralization reaction {{but it can also be}} a precipitation or a complex forming reaction as well as a titration based in a redox reaction. However, each method in quantitative analysis has a general specification, in neutralization reactions, for example, the reaction that occurs is between an acid and a base, which yields a salt and water, hence the name neutralization. In the precipitation reactions the standard solution is in the most cases silver nitrate which is used as a reagent to react with the ions present in the sample and to form a high insoluble precipitate. Precipitation methods are often called simply as argentometry. In the two other methods the situation is the same. Complex forming titration is a reaction that occurs between metal ions and a standard solution that is in the most cases EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic acid). In the redox titration that reaction is carried out between an oxidizing agent and a reduction agent.|$|E
