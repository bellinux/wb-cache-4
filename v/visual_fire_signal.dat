5000|$|There is no {{standard}} [...] "fire" [...] signal in the United States, {{and while}} the use of sirens by volunteer fire departments is still common, it is diminishing. In the dry areas of the western states, residents {{may be required to}} shut off outdoor water systems to ensure adequate pressure at fire hydrants upon hearing the <b>signal.</b> The <b>fire</b> <b>signal</b> can vary from one community to another. Three long blasts on a siren is one common signal, similar to the signal used by volunteer brigades in Germany and other countries. Other locales use the hi-lo signal described above, and some communities (particularly in New England and northern California) make use of coded blasts over a diaphone or air horn for <b>fire</b> <b>signals,</b> reserving the use of sirens for more serious situations. Some cities use the Attack tone as their fire call. Some communities make use of an [...] "all-clear" [...] signal, or sound separate <b>signals</b> for <b>fire</b> calls and ambulance runs.

40|$|Many speech {{enhancement}} algorithms suffer from musical noise – an estimation residue noise consisting of music-like varying tones. To reduce this annoying noise, some {{speech enhancement}} algorithms require post-processing. However, {{a lack of}} au-ditory perception theories about musical noise limits the effectiveness of musical noise reduction methods. Scientists now have some understanding of the human auditory system, thanks to the advances in hearing research across multiple disciplines – anatomy, physiology, psychology, and neurophysiology. Auditory models, such as the gammatone filter bank and the Meddis inner hair cell model, {{have been developed to}} simulate the acoustic to neuron transduction process. The auditory models generate the neuron <b>firing</b> <b>signals</b> called the cochleagram. Cochleagram analysis is a powerful tool to investigate musical noise. We use auditory perception theories in our musical noise investigations. Some auditory perception theories (e. g., volley theory and auditory scene analysis theories) suggest that speech perception is an auditory grouping process. Temporal properties of neuron <b>firing</b> <b>signals,</b> such as period and rhythm, play important roles in the grouping process. The grouping process generates a foreground speech stream, a background noise stream, and possibly additional streams. We assume that musical noise is the result of grouping to the background stream the neuron <b>firing</b> <b>signals</b> whose temporal properties are different from the ones grouped to the foreground stream. Based on this hypothesis, we believe that a musical noise reduction method should increase the probability of grouping the enhanced neuron <b>firing</b> <b>signals</b> to the foreground speech stream, or decrease the probability of grouping i them into the background stream. We propose a post-processing musical noise reduc-tion method for the auditory Wiener filter speech enhancement method, in which we employ a proposed complex gammatone filter bank for the cochlear decomposition. The results of a subjective listening test of our speech enhancement system show that the proposed musical noise reduction method is effective. i...|$|R
40|$|Every year {{wildfires}} threaten {{or destroy}} ecological habitats, man-made infrastructure and people’s lives. Additionally {{millions of dollars}} are spent each year trying to prevent and control these fires. Ideally if a wildfire can be detected before it rages out of control it can be extinguished and avoid large scale devastation. Traditional manned fire lookout towers are neither cost effective nor particularly efficient at detecting wildfire. It is proposed that temporal filtering {{can be used to}} isolate the signals created at the beginnings of potential wildfires. Temporal filtering can remove any background image and any periodic signals created by the camera movement. Once typical signals are analyzed, digital filters can be designed to pass <b>fire</b> <b>signals</b> while blocking the unwanted signals. The temporal filter passes only <b>fire</b> <b>signals</b> and signals generated by moving objects. These objects can be distinguished from each other by analyzing the objects mid and long wave energy profile. This algorithm is tested on 17 data sources and its results analyzed...|$|R
