Increased UV radiation increases the photolysis rates for several tropospheric gases, in particular ozone.

40|$|Phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) is an {{important}} chiral molecule, the R-isomer of which {{is used in the}} manufacture of several pharmaceutical products and is currently produced by means of biotransformation. The knowledge of thermodynamic properties of PAC is essential to improve the process involving the separation of PAC from the organic solvent, used in the biotransformation process to extract PAC from the aqueous broth. In spite of its importance, limited experimental vapour pressure data is available on PAC in the literature. Hence, in this study, the physical and thermodynamic properties of PAC are predicted using structure property correlations combined with equations of state, and also molecular simulation as the first step to optimize the process design for the production of PAC. The properties predicted include liquid and <b>vapour</b> <b>densities</b> at co-existence, enthalpy of vaporization, saturation pressure, critical point and normal boiling point. The liquid and <b>vapour</b> <b>densities</b> at coexistence and the critical point data from both the methods are found to be in agreement. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Mediterranean hydrometeorological {{observatory}} Cévennes-Vivarais (OHM-CV) coordinates hydrometeorological observations (radars, rain gauges, {{water level}} stations) on a regional scale in southeastern France. In {{the framework of}} OHM-CV, temporary GPS measurements {{have been carried out}} for 2 months in autumn 2002, when the heaviest rainfall are expected. These measurements increase the spatial density of the existing permanent GPS network, by adding three more receivers between the Mediterranean coast and the Cévennes-Vivarais range to monitor maritime source of water vapour flow feeding the precipitating systems over the Cévennes-Vivarais region. In addition, a local network of 18 receivers covered an area of 30 by 30 km within the field of view of the meteorological radar. These regional and local networks of permanent and temporary stations are used to monitor the precipitable water vapour (PWV) with high temporal resolution (15 min). Also, the dense local network provided data which have been inverted using tomographic techniques to obtain the 3 -D field of tropospheric water vapour content. This study presents methodological tests for retrieving GPS tropospheric observations from dense networks, with the aim of assessing the uncertainties of GPS retrievals. Using optimal tropospheric GPS retrieval methods, high resolution measurements of PWV on a local scale (a few kilometres) are discussed for rain events. Finally, the results of 3 -D fields of water <b>vapour</b> <b>densities</b> from GPS tomography are analysed with respect to precipitation fields derived from a meteorological radar, showing a good correlation between precipitation and water vapour depletion areas...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{simulation}} studies of equilibrium features, namely circular islands on model surfaces, using Monte-Carlo methods. In particular, {{we are interested}} in studying the relationship between the <b>density</b> of <b>vapour</b> around a curved island and its curvature. The “classical ” form of this relationship is the Gibbs-Thomson formula, which assumes the vapour surrounding the island to be an ideal gas. Numerical simulations of a lattice gas model, performed for various sizes of islands, don’t fit very well to the Gibbs-Thomson formula. We show how corrections to this form arise at high <b>vapour</b> <b>densities,</b> wherein a knowledge of the exact equation of state (as opposed to the ideal gas approximation) is necessary to predict this relationship. By exploiting a mapping of the lattice gas to the Ising model one can compute the corrections to the Gibbs-Thomson formula using high field series expansions. The corrected Gibbs-Thomson formula matches very well with the Monte Carlo data. We also investigate finite size effects on the stability of the islands both theoretically and through simulations. Finally the simulations are used to study the microscopic origins of the Gibbs-Thomson formula. It is found that smaller islands have a greater adatom detachment rate per unit length of island perimeter. This is principally due to a lower coordination of edge atoms and a greater availability of detachment moves relative to edge 1 moves. A heuristic argument is suggested in which these effects are partially attributed to geometric constraints on the island edge...|$|R
