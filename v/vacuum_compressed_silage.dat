50|$|A major advance was the {{adoption}} of a vacuum braking system, in which flexible pipes were connected between all the vehicles of the train, and brakes on each vehicle could be controlled from the locomotive. The earliest scheme was a simple vacuum brake, in which vacuum was created by operation of a valve on the locomotive; the vacuum actuated brake pistons on each vehicle, and the degree of braking could be increased or decreased by the driver. <b>Vacuum,</b> rather than <b>compressed</b> air, was preferred because steam locomotives can be fitted with ejectors; venturi devices that create vacuum without moving parts.|$|R

Any fluid can be used, but mercury is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr (100 Pa) to above atmospheric. An important variation is the McLeod gauge which isolates a known volume of <b>vacuum</b> and <b>compresses</b> it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10−6 torr (0.1 mPa), which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology.

These indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.|$|R

Our HCLaminate is produced via <b>vacuum</b> bag <b>compressing</b> and subsequent UV-curing of the matrix resin-impregnated ChNF transparent paper (ChNF paper). It is worthwhile to note that this new type of ChNF-based transparent substrate film retains the strengths of the original ChNF paper and compensates for ChNF paper's drawbacks as a flexible transparent substrate. As a result, compared with high-performance synthetic plastic films, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(ether sulfone), poly(ethylene naphthalate), and polyimide, our HCLaminate is characterized to exhibit extremely smooth surface topography, outstanding optical clarity, high elastic modulus, high dimensional stability, etc. To prove our HCLaminate as a substrate film, we use it to fabricate flexible perovskite solar cells and a touch-screen panel. As far as we know, this work is the first to demonstrate flexible optoelectronics, such as flexible perovskite solar cells and a touch-screen panel, actually fabricated on a composite film made of ChNF.

50|$|Suction {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at {{the eye of the}} pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees <b>vacuum</b> and is <b>compressed</b> back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nebulizers are {{a popular}} means of {{delivering}} aerosolized medication, primarily albuterol, to the bronchial airways of patients, {{and there has}} been extensive research done on numerous nebulizers used with nebulizer T-pieces and corrugated tubing. Very little research has been performed on other types of nebulizer delivery systems and there is no substantial information on how effective various nebulizer delivery systems are in terms of the quantity and particle size of aerosolized medication delivered to the patient. In this study the Circulaire and the AeroTee, two devices that rely on bags to store aerosol during patient exhalation, are evaluated and compared to the conventional nebulizer T-piece with corrugated tubing. METHODS: Three each of the nebu-lizer T-piece with corrugated tubing, the Circulaire, and the AeroTee were sampled using 3 Vixone nebulizers. Each one of the 3 nebulizer delivery systems used the same 3 Vixone nebulizers. Each nebulizer delivery system was evaluated by connecting a constant-flow <b>vacuum</b> and <b>compressed</b> gas source cycled to simulate patient breathing at a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min and an inspi-ration-expiration ratio of 1 : 2. Medication delivered was determined by sampling a portion of the simulated patient’s flow onto a membrane filter and calculating the total medication received by the patient. Particle size was determined by sampling with a cascade impactor under ambient condi-tions. RESULTS: The Circulaire delivered significantly less medication than the nebulizer T-piece with corrugated tubing (p < 0. 001), whereas the AeroTee delivered substantially more medication than the nebulizer T-piece with corrugated tubing (p < 0. 001). The particle size delivered by the Circulaire was significantly smaller than that of the nebulizer T-piece with corrugated tubing (p < 0. 001), whereas the AeroTee delivered particle size equivalent to a nebulizer T-piece with corru-gated tubing (p 5 0. 82). CONCLUSION: There are clinically important differences between neb-ulizer delivery systems. When evaluating the optimum means for delivering aerosolized medication, equal consideration should be given to both the brand of nebulizer and the nebulizer deliver...|$|R

Mathematically, such metrics indicate spacetime behaves locally like a simple harmonic oscillator. In the cosmological model presented here these small spacetime oscillations <b>compress</b> <b>vacuum</b> energy into a standing wave inside a dynamic Casimir cavity. At peak compression a phase shift occurs and the standing wave forms into a particle having relativistic mass-energy equal to the compressive work required to produce it. At this point the newly formed particle does isobaric work to expand the volume against the external pressure given T_ii. Equilibrium is achieved when the collision rate on the volume's internal and external surfaces equalizes. By treating spacetime as a classical thermodynamic problem and oscillator, such quantities as {{the mass of the}} compressed particle [...] that of an axion, the radii of the initial and final volume of compression, and the angular frequency of compression can be determined. During axion collision the photon frequency of the particle is calculated to be in the microwave range and inversely equal to that of the frequency of the spacetime compression that produced the particle.

40|$|Transient superheavy quasimolecules formed during quasi-adiabatic {{heavy ion}} – heavy atom {{collisions}} penetrate {{into the region}} of supercritical fields. There, extreme relativistic phenomena {{as well as new}} QED effects dominate the atomic structure and even spontaneous decay of the <b>compressed</b> <b>vacuum</b> may occur. Hence, starting in the seventies the structure and decay of superheavy collision molecules has been investigated with great effort, see e. g. [1]. The drawback of all of these investigations was the low incoming charge state of the ions at that time. Vacancies in the innermost levels of the quasimolecule had to be created first during the collision of concern itself. With the advent of SIS /ESR even for the heaviest ions, bare species can be provided for experiments at moderate velocities too [2]. In order to preserve the high incoming charge state for the collision processes considered gaseous targets should be used. However, in the past ion intensities and luminosities for gas targets prevented these studies with open K-shell for incoming channels. The present study was intended to investigate as to how far the incoming ionic charge state can survive in a solid target and hence, how far solid targets can be utilized for studying superheavy quasimolecular collisions with welldefined open incoming inner shell vacancy channels. For 69 MeV/u U q+ → Au collisions we measured at SIS / Cave A, the x-ray emission as a function of incoming charge state with 73 ≤ q ≤ 91 and determined the target thickness dependence (18 ≤ t in µg/cm 2 ≤ 180) of the cross sections.
