5000|$|A {{remainder}} is vested if (1) {{the remainder}} {{is given to}} a presently existing and ascertained person, and (2) it {{is not subject to}} a condition precedent. A <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> may be indefeasibly vested, meaning that it is certain to become possessory in the future, and cannot be divested. An example, O conveys to [...] "A for life, then to B and B's heirs." [...] B has an [...] "indefeasibly vested remainder" [...] certain to become possessory upon termination of A's life estate. B or B's heirs will clearly be entitled to possession upon A’s death. A <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> may not be certain to become possessory. An example of this: O conveys [...] "to A for life, then to A's children." [...] A has one child, B, so B has a <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> because B is ascertainable. But, A may have no other children in his life, and B could die before A, so the <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> is not certain to become possessory. Instead B is said to have a vested interest subject to partial (more children) and complete divestment (if B dies before A).|$|E

25|$|The Brandenburgers {{were to be}} {{informed}} prior to any investiture of the Pomeranian dukes, and were granted the rights to touch the flags the Pomeranians received from the Holy Roman Emperor during the ceremonial investiture.

The Brandenburgian electors as <b>vested</b> <b>remainders</b> were also granted the right to be invested with the hereditary option of succession in Pomerania by the emperor.

5000|$|A {{testator}} devised {{lands and}} personal property to his executors and their successors and their heirs, in trust, and directed that the income, until his youngest grandchild who might {{live to be}} twenty-one years of age should arrive at that age, should be divided equally among the testator's children or the issue of any child dying, and among the grandchildren also as they successively came of age; that [...] "after the decease of all my children, and when {{and as soon as}} the youngest grandchild shall arrive at the age of twenty-one years," [...] the lands should be [...] "inherited and equally divided between my grandchildren per capita," [...] in fee, and that [...] "in like manner" [...] the personal property should [...] "at the same time be equally divided among my said grandchildren, share and share alike per capita," [...] and that if any grandchild should have died before the final division leaving children, they should take and receive per stirpes the share which their parent would have been entitled to have and receive if then living, and provided that any assignment, mortgage, or pledge by any grandchild of his share should be void, and the executors, in the final division and distribution, should convey and pay to the persons entitled under the will. Held that the executors took the legal title in fee, to hold until the final division, and that the trusts were imposed upon them as executors. Held, also that all the grandchildren took equitable <b>vested</b> <b>remainders,</b> opening to let in those born after the testator's death, and subject to be divested only as to any grandchild who died before the expiration of the particular estate, leaving issue, by an executory devise over to such issue.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to give a person, A, a life interest in a property, with the remainder {{to go to another}} person or persons, B. If the beneficiary of the remainder cannot yet be known, then the remainder is said not to have <b>vested,</b> and the <b>remainder</b> is said to be contingent. This may happen with entailed estates, or when property is left in trust to care for a child or relative without heirs. (See trust law for details).|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{remainders}} in property law, vested and contingent. A <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> is held by a specific person without any conditions precedent; a contingent remainder is one for which the holder has not been identified, or for which a condition precedent must be satisfied.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, in a basic conveyance, [...] "O grants Blackacre to B for life, then to B's heirs," [...] absent {{the rule}} {{there was a}} life estate in B, and a {{contingent}} remainder in B's heirs. The Rule converted the contingent remainder in B's heirs into a <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> in B.|$|E
40|$|In past {{issues of}} the Review Professor Chaffin has {{illuminated}} many areas of Trust and Estates Law. In this Article he treats the inscrutable area of descendible future interests. Future interests which do not terminate at death obviously result in nonpossessory property passing through the estates of their holders. This Article first shows the unhappy consequences of such passage of property. It then points out not only that most draftsmen and testators are unaware of the undesirable consequences of creating descendible future interests, but also that many such interests exist {{as a result of}} Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s constructional preference for early <b>vesting</b> of <b>remainders,</b> rather than from intentional creation. Professor Chaffin determines that the preference for early vesting has no contemporary relevance. He then examines the series of confusing, contradictory, and often startling Georgia cases applying this preference, revealing methods by which an attorney can recognize the areas where unintentional creation of descendible interests is likely, and can avoid through careful draftsmanship the problems attending the creation of such interests...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, a {{life estate}} is {{typically}} {{used as a}} tool of an estate planning. A life estate can avoid probate and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al's death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a life estate in the home. Al keeps a life estate and Bill receives a <b>vested</b> fee simple <b>remainder.</b> As soon as Al dies, the life estate interest merges with Bill's remainder, and Bill has a fee simple title. Such a transfer risks the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered fee simple, selling the estate prematurely to an innocent purchaser such as when Al is on vacation but makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman's consent. [...] "Beneficiary deeds" [...] have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.|$|R
5000|$|But Adam {{does have}} a will: It firstly leaves his land [...] "to Edward for life, then to Adam's heirs", and it also {{contains}} a residuary clause that leaves the remainder of Adam's estate to Fran. By {{the operation of the}} instrument, Edward would have a life estate in the land, while Fran would inherit the rest of the estate immediately; then [...] "Adam's heirs"i.e., Dinahwould have a <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> interest in the land, and expect to inherit it upon Edward's death. The doctrine of worthier title intervenes, however, with unexpected results. The doctrine prefers the interest [...] "Adam's heirs" [...] would have taken to the interest created by an instrument. Here, however, Adam's will designates Fran as his heir at law. Instead of a life estate in Edward, followed by a <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> in Dinah, the doctrine of worthier title operates to disinherit Dinah completely, treats the interest of the heirs as a mere reversion, and upon Edward's death gives the land, as well, to Fran.|$|E
5000|$|A future {{interest}} is vested subject to divestment if something could occur that would divest {{the remainder of}} an interest. For example, [...] "From O to A for life, then to B, but if A stops growing corn, then to C": B would have a <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> subject to divestment because he could be divested of his interest {{by an act of}} A before the interest becomes possessory.|$|E
5000|$|Analysis: The {{class of}} B's {{children}} can't be determined until approximately thirty-eight weeks after A dies, so any {{children who are}} unborn {{at the time of}} the grant have a remainder contingent upon B having offspring. Children of B are fully vested as soon as they are born, provided A is still alive. B's children who are born have <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> subject to open, because the conveyance was given to a class of persons (B's Children) and B could still have more children. If A dies before B, then the class is closed, and only those children alive at A's death will have an interest.|$|E
5000|$|The rule makes a {{difference}} when property owners make inter vivos gifts of less than fee simple interests. Suppose Adam owns title to lands, is married to Beulah, and executes a deed [...] "to Beulah for life, and then to Adam's heirs", Caleb and Dinah. Adam's intent in these words of conveyance {{would appear to be}} to grant Beulah a life estate, and then create a <b>vested</b> <b>remainder</b> interest in his apparent heirs Caleb and Dinah. The remainder interest is vested because Beulah is mortal; her death is certain to happen. But, since Caleb and Dinah are already Adam's apparent heirs, their interest under the laws of descent is [...] "worthier" [...] than the interest they take under the instrument, and the deed is construed as if Adam had stopped with [...] "to Beulah for life." [...] This doctrine is further {{complicated by the fact that}} although Caleb and Dinah are Adam's heirs apparent, it is legally impossible to determine who is an heir until the death of the grantor.|$|E
5000|$|Some scholars, such as John V. Orth, {{believe that}} this {{explanation}} (to promote the right to transfer the land) {{of the origin of}} the Rule is inaccurate. In their view the Rule originated as the courts' response to an estate-planning technique in the 14th century, long before the litigation in Shelley's Case. A tax known as the [...] "relief" [...] had to be paid to the feudal lord (the Crown) when a tenant's heir inherited the land. To avoid this estate tax, if the grant to the land were framed in term of a life estate in the grantee followed by a remainder in the grantee's heirs, then upon the grantee's death his heirs would not inherit the land, but received it as a <b>vested</b> <b>remainder.</b> As a consequence, the heir would take the land without having to pay the relief. The courts could not abide such a transparent attempt to circumvent the tax system, and the Rule was invented to deal with this problem by converting these transfers into fees simple absolute so as to allow the relief to be collected upon the grantee's death. Later, when the relief was abolished, the Rule continued to survive in the common law due to inertia ("it is the genius of the common law to add, but not to subtract"), the [...] "promote the right to transfer the land" [...] explanation was concocted to explain the continued existence of the Rule. Note that {{it is not at all}} uncommon for rules of common law, once their original motivation falls away, to acquire a new justification, and in the process also, sometimes, a new meaning. Many examples of such processes are given in Oliver Wendell Holmes's The Common Law.|$|E
