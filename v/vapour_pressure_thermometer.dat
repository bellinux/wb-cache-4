25|$|Wood is a {{hygroscopic}} substance. It has {{the ability}} to take in or give off moisture in the form of vapour. Water contained in wood exerts <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of its own, which is determined by the maximum size of the capillaries filled with water at any time. If water <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> in the ambient space is lower than <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> within wood, desorption takes place.

The amount of moisture that remains in the wood at this stage is in equilibrium with water <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> in the ambient space, and is termed the equilibrium moisture content or EMC (Siau, 1984). Because of its hygroscopicity, wood tends to reach a moisture content that is in equilibrium with the relative humidity and temperature of the surrounding air.|$|R
40|$|When {{studying}} and modelling the volatilisation of pesticides from crops, their <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is an essential}} property. In the critical evaluation of <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> stated by various sources, problems were encountered. Therefore, an inventory was made of readily-usable methods for estimating <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> of organic chemicals, for checking the stated values. When applied {{to some of the}} five example pesticides, the estimates were at the same level as the stated values. However, for other pesticides there were substantial differences. Unfortunately, there is a wide range of uncertainty in both measurement and estimation of comparatively low <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures.</b> The solid (crystalline) and sub-cooled-liquid states of the chemical have to be distinguished when specifying and using <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures,</b> because the latter can be much higher. The influence of the uncertainty in <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> on the source strength of volatilisation from plants is illustrated in a few computations.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of two {{experiments}} undertaken to investigate the influence of season and soil drying on stomatal responses to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences. We examined the response of stomatal conductance to increasing leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference, in the wet and dry seasons, of five tropical tree species. We also examined leaves of these species for anatomical differences to determine whether this could explain differences in stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences. Finally, we conducted a split-root experiment {{with one of those}} species to look for interactions between xylem abscisic acid concentration, predawn water potential, leaf area to root mass ratio and stomatal responses to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences. Stomatal conductance declined linearly with increasing leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference in all species. Leaves that expanded in the ‘dry’ season were more sensitive to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences than those that had expanded in the ‘wet’ season. The value of leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference where 50 % of extrapolated maximum stomatal conductance would occur was 5. 5 kPa for wet season but only 3. 4 kPa for dry season leaves. In the wet season, transpiration rate increased with increasing leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference in most example species. However, in the dry season, transpiration was constant as leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences increased in most cases. There were significant changes in the proportion of cell wall exposed to air space in leaves, between wet and dry seasons, in three of four species examined. In the split-root experiment, a very mild water stress increased stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences, and stomatal conductivity declined linearly with decreasing predawn water potential. However, levels of ABA in the xylem did not change, and stomatal sensitivity to exogenous ABA did not change. The ratio of leaf area to root mass declined during water stress and was correlated to changes in stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{generalized}} <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> equation {{has been}} developed to correlate <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> of refrigerants. The proposed <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> equation has one or three adjustable parameters depending on the required accuracy. In the first case the adjustable parameter has been correlated with the reduced triple point temperature. Thus, the proposed <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> equation requires only the fluid-dependent critical and triple point parameters and enables the accurate description of the entire temperature range of pure refrigerants from the triple to the critical point. Another advantage of the proposed correlation is its possibility of being inversed; this way the Boiling point can be calculated from <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> through a single equation. Finally, a predictive method for the triple point pressure is suggested. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{prediction}} method based on group contribution principles is proposed for estimating the <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of α-pinene oxidation products. Temperature dependent contributions are {{provided for the}} following chemical groups: carbonyl, nitrate, hydroxy, hydroperoxide, acyl peroxy nitrate and acid. On the basis of observed <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences between isomers of diols and dinitrates, a simple refinement is introduced in the method, which allows {{to account for the}} influence of the substitutions on the <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> for the hydroxy and nitrate functionalities. In general, the predicted <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> of multifunctional compounds show a better agreement with experimental data (within a factor 2 – 3) than the UNIFAC method (Asher et al., 2002). Among the α-pinene products identified to date, pinic acid and hydroxy pinonic acid are predicted to be the least volatile compounds, with estimated <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> of 3 × 10 − 6 torr and 6 × 10 − 7 torr, respectively. The <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of the other primary products range from 10 − 5 to 10 − 3 torr, with hydroxy hydroperoxides presenting the lowest values. Noting that multifunctional carboxylic acids, in particular pinic acid, are believed to be mostly present as dimers in laboratory conditions, we suggest that the partial <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of the pinic acid dimer should be close to the experimental subcooled <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> for pinic acid (estimated at ~ 10 − 6 torr) due to its large contribution to the total concentration (dimer+monomer) in experimental conditions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAir quality {{models that}} {{generate}} {{the concentrations of}} semi-volatile and other condensable organic compounds using an explicit reaction mechanism require estimates of the <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> of the organic compounds that partition between the aerosol and gas phases. The model of Griffin, Kleeman and co-workers (e. g., Griffin et al., 2005) assumes that aerosol particles consist of an aqueous phase, containing inorganic electrolytes and soluble organic compounds, and a hydrophobic phase containing mainly primary hydrocarbon material. Thirty eight semi-volatile reaction products are grouped into ten surrogate species. In Part 1 of this work (Clegg et al., 2008) the thermodynamic elements of the gas/aerosol partitioning calculation are examined, {{and the effects of}} uncertainties and approximations assessed, using a simulation for the South Coast Air Basin around Los Angeles as an example. Here we compare several different methods of predicting <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> of organic compounds, and use the results to determine the likely uncertainties in the <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> of the semi-volatile surrogate species in the model. These are typically an order of magnitude or greater, and are further increased when the fact that each compound represents a range of reaction products (for which <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> can be independently estimated) is taken into account. The effects of the <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> uncertainties associated with the water-soluble semi-volatile species are determined over a wide range of atmospheric liquid water contents. The <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> of the eight primary hydrocarbon surrogate species present in the model, which are normally assumed to be involatile, are also predicted.
