50|$|The {{phosphors}} were pattered in an RGB-BGR-RGB pattern. The focusing grid {{was aligned}} so the beam would normally focus {{down onto the}} green strips {{in the middle of}} each pair of wires. To produce different colors, say blue, the beam would have to be pulled to the right for one pixel, and then to the left for the next. Since the adjacent stripes of phosphors shared one of the wires, this meant that a single <b>voltage</b> <b>setting</b> would produce the blue color on two adjacent pixels. Since a single frame of color television does not consist of a single color, the deflection system had to be continually varied as the beam moved across the screen.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some areas}} with {{restricted}} clearances, particularly {{in urban areas}} in east London (converted from 1500 V DC) and on suburban routes around Glasgow, 6.25 kV was used. A system known as [...] "Automatic Power Control" [...] was developed to allow trains to automatically switch between the voltages whilst moving. All the driver {{had to do was}} shut off power and coast until clear of the neutral section; the system automatically opened the circuit breaker, detected a change in voltage and switched over the transformer to the correct input <b>voltage</b> <b>setting,</b> then closed the circuit breaker. This system proved somewhat unreliable and, with experience, it was found that less clearance was needed for 25 kV than had initially been allowed for. This allowed the 6.25 kV sections to be converted to 25 kV, with the last section, at the London end of the London Tilbury and Southend line, being converted in 1983.|$|E

5000|$|Reactor {{power winding}} current is {{regulated}} according to proportional control mode, when control angle of rectified current source thyristors is changed according to proportional mode depending on mismatching between the prescribed <b>voltage</b> <b>setting</b> and the voltage {{at the point}} of reactor connection. In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 - 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system - 1 - 2% of the reactor rated capacity. [...] Depending upon desired requirements, MCSR is adjusted {{in such a way that}} would be possible to realize either voltage level stabilization, or consumed reactive power value, or consumed current magnitude. Controlled reactors, same as their non-controlled analogues, are subdivided into bus reactors and line reactors. Based on this principle, MCSR design would be completed with additional element which ensures pre-biasing of electromagnetic part and subsequent inertialess energizing of the reactor (with power increase time less than one cycle of power frequency). Similar to all transformer equipment, MCSR is able to withstand long-term overload up to 120 - 130% as well as should-term overload up to 200%. Moreover, considering the additional measures and the control algorithms, MCSR realizes all functions of uncontrolled shunt reactor including ability to operate within the interval of single-phase automatic reclosing.|$|E

Test-retest reliability results of T 1 ρ values from asymptomatic subjects as well as T 1 ρ maps from abnormal cartilage of two human subjects are presented.
