40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a versatile fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) -based real-time monitoring system, consisting of (a) coumarin-labeled-cysteine tethered mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as the drug carrier, (b) a fluorescein isothiocyanate- 2 -cyclodextrin (FITC- 2 -CD) as redox-responsive molecular <b>valve</b> <b>blocking</b> the pores, and (c) a FRET donor-acceptor pair of coumarin and FITC integrated within the pore-unlocking event, thereby allowing for monitoring the release of drugs from the pores in real-time. Under nonreducing conditions, when the disulfide bond is intact, the close proximity between coumarin and FITC on the surface of MSNs results in FRET from coumarin to FITC. However, {{in the presence of the}} redox stimuli like glutathione (GSH), the disulfide bond is cleaved which leads to the removal of molecular valve (FITC- 2 -CD), thus triggering drug release and eliminating FRET. By engineering such a FRET-active donor-acceptor structure within the redox-responsive molecular valve, we can monitor the release of the drugs entrapped within the pores of the MSN nanocarrier, following the change in the FRET signal. We have demonstrated that, any exogenous or endogenous change in the GSH concentration will result in a change in the extent of drug release as well as a concurrent change in the FRET signal, allowing us to extend the applications of our FRET-based MSNs for monitoring the release of any type of drug molecule in real-time. 1 DP 20 D 006462 - 01 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United StatesDP 2 OD 006462 /OD/NIH HHS/United States 2014 - 03 - 26 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} issues connecting an offshore WPP via a VSC HVDC transmission line to the host power system is to fulfill the grid code requirements during power system faults. It is essential to ensure that the offshore WPPs can stay connected during host system fault conditions {{in order to meet the}} fault ride through (FRT) requirements specified by various grid codes. This topic has been investigated in a number of literatures [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In [8], a controlled demagnetization method was proposed to realize fast voltage drop at the sending end converter (SEC) and fast power reduction from the WPP during a three phase fault in the host system. In [9], a control structure for a full converter wind turbine based WPP was presented including de-loading the fully rated converter wind turbines and emulating short circuit in the WPP collector system by reducing the voltage at the offshore HVDC converter terminal. In [12], a control strategy was developed in order to define the optimal converter <b>valve</b> <b>blocking</b> time according to the severity of the fault and alleviate the oscillations at the electrical system after de-blocking the converter valves. In [13] and [14], control strategies were proposed to realize FRT of HVDC connected offshore WPPs through offshore converter control by sending out power orders to individual wind turbines or by frequency modulation in the offshore AC collector system. DC voltage control and power dispatch schemes of a multi-terminal HVDC system for integrating large offshore wind farms were proposed in [15] for both normal operation and onshore grid fault ride through. A new hybrid HVDC connection for large wind farms with doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) was proposed which is comprised of a line-commutated converter plus a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) on the rectifier side and a pulse-width modulation (PWM) current source inverter (CSI) on the inverter side, and the startup process and the system performance under both normal and fault conditions were demonstrated with such a hybrid HVDC connection connected wind farms [16].|$|E

50|$|The valves {{required}} {{for oil and}} gas separators are oil discharge control valve, water-discharge control valve (three-phase operation), drain <b>valves,</b> <b>block</b> <b>valves,</b> pressure relief valves, and Emergency Shutdown valves (ESD). ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving. For safety critical applications, it must be ensured that the valves operate upon demand.|$|R

40|$|Today’s {{high lift}} systems of civil {{transport}} aircraft {{are driven by}} Power Control Units using valve controlled constant displacement hydraulic motors. This concept leads to com-plex <b>valve</b> <b>blocks,</b> attended by high power losses to realise discrete speed control, positioning and pressure maintaining functionality. The concept of secondary controlled hydraulic motors with variable displacement offers reduction in flow consumption without pressure losses and decreases {{the complexity of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> design. Instead of controlling flow of the hydraulic motor with valves, torque is adjusted to the load by varying displacement. An electronic control circuit allows flexible digital control concepts e. g. load independent speed control, pressure maintaining function-ality, smooth start-up sequences and continuous positioning of the mechanical transmission system. This paper introduces the concept of today’s Power Control Units, the principle and mathematical model of secondary controlled hydraulic motors and the cascade control loop structure. A new hydraulic concept for Power Control Units using secondary controlled hydraulic motors is presented. Theoretical, simulated and experimental results show typical operation sequences under load and a comparison of power requirement to conventional systems.

50|$|The effects a {{variable}} flow system {{had on the}} selection of control valves, was not initially realized. A control valve was selected by using the same Kv calculation and the bypass on a 3-port <b>valve</b> <b>blocked,</b> giving a 2-port valve. Unfortunately it wasn’t that simple. This is because our Kv calculationKv = Flow Rate (m3/h) / Δ P (Bar)was based upon a constant pressure and a constant Kvs, delivering a constant flow. However, as areas of the variable flow system closed down the differential pressure increased, stepping up the delivery flow and causing overflow in the open circuits.|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} valve {{location}} problem, {{one of the}} basic problems in design of long oil pipelines. Whenever a pipeline is depressurized, the shutoff <b>valves</b> <b>block</b> the oil flow and seal the damaged part of the pipeline. Thus, the quantity of oil possibly contaminating the area around the pipeline is determined by the volume of the damaged section of the pipeline between two consecutive valves. Then, ecologic damage can be quantified by the amount of leaked oil and the environmental characteristics of the accident area. Given a pipe network together with environmental characteristics of the area, and given a number of valves to be installed, the task is to find a valve location minimizing the maximal possible environmental damage.
