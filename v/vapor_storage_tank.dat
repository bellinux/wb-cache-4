50|$|Vapor {{recovery}} {{is also used}} in the chemical process industry to remove and recover <b>vapors</b> from <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The <b>vapors</b> are usually either environmentally hazardous, or valuable to be recovered. The process consists of a closed venting system from the <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> ullage space to a vapor recovery unit (VRU) which will recover the vapors for return to the process or destroy them, usually by oxidation.|$|R
50|$|Vapor {{recovery}} towers (VRT) {{have been}} posed {{as a potential}} solution for vapor loss via thief hatches. VRTs are a {{way to reduce the}} <b>vapor</b> loading on <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> by removing some of the flash gas before it gets to the oil tanks. The VRT can improve safety by reducing the potential for issues relating to high vapor evolution from the oil tanks.|$|R
40|$|Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is {{generally}} stored in refrigerated tanks at temperatures of about- 160 °C and pressures slightly above atmospher e in liquefaction plants and LNG regasification terminals. Heat leaks, even in well-insulated tanks, cause a slow boil-off of the LNG, and this requires removal of some vapor. During this weathering process {{the composition of}} the LNG changes because the small amount of nitrogen present is much more volatile than the methane and the heavier hydrocarbons are effectively non-volatile at storage conditions. Natural convection causes circulation of the LNG within the <b>storage</b> <b>tank,</b> maintaining a uniform liquid composition. The addition of new liquid, however, can result in the formation of strata of slightly different temperature and density within the LNG <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> "Rollover " refers to the rapid release of LNG <b>vapors</b> from a <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> caused by stratification. The potential for rollover arise when two separated layers of different densities (due to different LNG compositions) exist in a <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> This paper gives a more adequate theoretical framework for rollover analysis and presents quantitative computer results for the simulation of the La Spezia Rollover incident. Therewith some recommendations have been proposed in order to minimize risk of rollover incident in refrigerated LNG <b>storage</b> <b>tank...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{liquefied}} {{natural gas}} <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> or LNG <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> is a specialized type of <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> used for the storage of Liquefied Natural Gas. LNG <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> {{can be found in}} ground, above ground or in LNG carriers. The common characteristic of LNG <b>Storage</b> <b>tanks</b> is the ability to store LNG at the very low temperature of -162 °C (-260 °F). LNG <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> have double containers, where the inner contains LNG and the outer container contains insulation materials. The most common tank type is the full containment tank. Tanks vary greatly in size, depending on usage.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to get a}} better {{understanding}} of how optimal weight savings of the cylindrical shell plates in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> can be reached using higher strength duplex material. The design criteria will be based on the requirements given by the American Petroleum Institute standards API 650 for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and API 12 B for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The expected result is that use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel can reduce the weight of the material needed to build a <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> A comparison between welded and bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will also be included in the work to find which joining method that is preferable. Additionally, an evaluation of the software TANKTM by Intergraph will be performed. Matlab® will be used in order to perform the evaluation to compare the results. The main difference between the standards API 650 and API 12 B is that there are already given standard sizes of bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> API 12 B. Therefore, only <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> up to 1   625 m 3 could be compared. When comparing <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> sizes up to 1   625 m 3 the result is that bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> require a smaller mean thickness of the cylindrical shell than welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and therefore less material and total weight of the shell. If the trend continues also for larger <b>tank</b> sizes, bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will be preferable to reduce the total weight of the <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> By use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> the minimum required thickness can be reduced because of the higher strength of duplex stainless steel. This leads to a smaller mean shell thickness and therefore a reduced weight compared to <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> made of austenitic stainless steel. For most dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> duplex stainless steel is cheaper than austenitic stainless steel, but for some smaller dimensions, grade 1. 4307 (austenitic) is cheaper than LDX 2101 ® (duplex). Instability calculations have been performed for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> while no instability calculations have been performed for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> With the wind speed 190 km/h (proposed by API 650), the welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> need to have wind girders to stiffen the cylindrical shell and in some cases also be anchored to the ground. Anchor is not required for large dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The evaluation of TANKTM showed that most parameters agreed to the computed value of the same parameters in Matlab®. Why a few parameters not agrees is not fully known, therefore better explanations of the parameters used in the equations in API 650 would be preferable. To see the difference between Matlab® and TANKTM it would also be of interest to see how the calculations are performed in TANKTM, as only the results and inputs are printed at the moment...|$|R
