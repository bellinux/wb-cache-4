5000|$|Based on {{conceptual}} {{drawings by}} Ralph McQuarrie, Liz Moore and Nick Pemberton sculpted {{designs for the}} helmet, Brian Muir sculpted armor pieces for the stormtrooper costume. Muir, who was also responsible for sculpting the Darth Vader costume, worked out of the Art Department at Elstree Studios. The suit was molded and initially cast in plaster, with Muir sharpening the detail at the plaster stage. The plaster casts were then remolded and cast in fiberglass to use as the [...] "tools" [...] for the vacuum forming process. The suits were produced in house by Tashy Baines, the resident <b>vacuum</b> <b>former,</b> but then a problem developed with the machine. As Shepperton Design Studios had already been used to vacuum form the helmets, the fiberglass molds for the armor were then sent to them for vacuum forming the suits. By the end of production, two different helmets were produced; one for the common stunt trooper and a second design for close-ups. Fifty stunt helmets were produced in white-painted HDPE and six hero helmets were produced in white ABS plastic. Besides the material used, the two designs can be differentiated by differences in the eyes, the ears, and the mouth area.|$|E
50|$|Original {{equipment}} manufacturers (OEMs) utilize heavy gauge vacuum formed components for production quantities {{in the range}} of 250-3000 units per year. Vacuum-formed components can be used in place of complex fabricated sheet metal, fiberglass, or plastic injection molding. Typical industry examples include kiosks and automated teller machines, enclosures for medical imaging and diagnostic equipment such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, engine covers in a truck cab, and railcar interior trim and seat components. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>formers</b> are also often used by hobbyists, for applications such as RC cars and masks.|$|R

Hard occlusal splint (HOS) which was known earlier had been recognized more effective than soft occlusal splint (SOS) which recently gained some popularity. This clinical study based on case series was to determined which type of occlusal splint was more effective for TMD. This study involved 20 subjects and they were divided into HOS and SOS group with 10 subjects in each group. HOS was processed with heat curing acrylic and SOS with <b>vacuum</b> <b>former.</b> Before and after 4 weeks of treatment, 5 TMD symptoms (impaired range of movement, impaired TMJ function, muscle pain, TMJ pain and pain on movement of mandible) were measured using Helkimo diagnostic index. The results were analyzed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z's test. The findings showed statistically significant improvement in impaired range of movement and muscle pain in favor of HOS group (p< 0. 05). Although they were not statistically significant, HOS group showed better improvement than SOS group in TMJ pain and pain on movement of the mandible. In TMJ's function, no changes were found in both groups. IN general, HOS was more effective than SOS for treating TMD in {{relatively short period of}} time. Despite of the phenomena, the popularity of SOS was not followed with its effectiveness. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{series of}} thermo-moulded relief layered fabrics {{was created for}} Yves Saint Laurent’s 2009 – 10 Winter Collection. The thermo-moulding process was adapted from {{technology}} used by the automotive industry for vehicle interiors. Developments included extending the range of fabrics and fabric combinations (including flannel and silk), exploring the possibilities of using other materials (particularly leathers) and increasing {{the size of the}} thermo-moulding equipment in order to produce sufficient material to make large garments. Wanting more than the limited range of aesthetic qualities required by vehicle manufacturers, Avella exploited the process to create new lightweight ‘sandwiched’ thermo-bonded composite fabrics with a permanent relief-textured surface. These technologies had never previously been applied in a fashion context. The intensive six-month research process started with the production of test pieces of relief fabric using thermo-moulding <b>vacuum</b> <b>formers.</b> This {{led to the development of}} completely new, larger pattern formers. The conclusion was the creation of runs of fabrics large enough to support the commercial production of garments and accessories for the Winter Collection. Development was iterative, responding to the potential of earlier test pieces and, during the later stages, following liaison with garment designers and pattern cutters. The resulting composite fabrics allowed for the creation of pieces that were lightweight while being capable of maintaining a strongly structured form. The fabrics were a key element of the designs shown in Yves Saint Laurent’s 2009 – 10 Winter Collection during Paris Fashion Week and featured heavily in the associated advertising campaign. International press editorials specifically referenced the materials created by Avella, for example: ‘The show opened with black leather, some of it textured with thermo-molding technology borrowed from the car industry…the material was mainly used to construct sleek, though not too close-fitting, pieces’ (Sarah Mower, style. com, 2009 : [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The s-confining {{theories}} are {{a class of}} supersymmetric gauge theories with infrared dynamics which are well-understood. Perturbing such theories can give rise to dynamical supersymmetry breaking. We realize simple models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking by perturbing two of the 10 SU(N) s-confining gauge theories by a single trilinear operator. These examples have locally stable vacua with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The first is SU(5) with two generations (consisting of an antisymmetric tensor and an antifundamental) plus two flavors. The second is SU(5) with three generations.

40|$|AbstractParticle {{creation}} {{leading to}} Hawking radiation {{is produced by}} the changing gravitational field of the collapsing star. The two main initial conditions in the far past placed on the quantum field from which particles arise, are the Hartle–Hawking vacuum and the Unruh <b>vacuum.</b> The <b>former</b> leads to a time-symmetric thermal bath of radiation, while the latter to a flux of radiation {{coming out of the}} collapsing star. The energy of Hawking radiation in the interior of the collapsing star is negative and equal in magnitude to its value at future infinity. This work investigates the backreaction of Hawking radiation on the interior of a gravitationally collapsing star, in a Hartle–Hawking initial vacuum. It shows that due to the negative energy Hawking radiation in the interior, the collapse of the star stops at a finite radius, before the singularity and the event horizon of a black hole have a chance to form. That is, the star bounces instead of collapsing to a black hole. A trapped surface near the last stage of the star's collapse to its minimum size may still exist temporarily.

30|$|In this study, {{we report}} further the {{development}} of tapered whiskers from Zn particulates overlaid with twinned W-ZnO condensates acting as seeds for VLS growth via a thermal oxidation process. There is significant difference in this study in respect of our previous experiments i.e., the usage of an oxygen environment instead of the residual oxygen-containing vacuum [5] to form Zn particulates overlaid with W-ZnO nanocrystallites during PLA. (Zn particulates as the solidification products of molten plumes were significantly formed via PLA in air rather than in <b>vacuum,</b> because the <b>former</b> process has a significant air-breaking effect to broaden the beam and hence to produce more molten Zn particulates covered with ZnO condensates {{in order to prevent}} from complete oxidation.) Such Zn particulates overlaid with W-ZnO nanocrystallites are essential to the present formation of tapered W-ZnO whiskers via a thermal oxidation VLS process from a partially molten bottom source of Zn upon annealing, in drastic contrast with our previously studied case of VLS growth at a partially molten globular tip [5].|$|R
40|$|We discuss non perturbative {{corrections}} to the Coulomb-like {{potential of}} heavy quarks at short distances. We consider both the standard framework provided by infrared renormalons and {{the assumption that}} confinement does not allow weak fields to penetrate the <b>vacuum.</b> In the <b>former</b> case the leading correction at short distances {{turns out to be}} quadratic in r for static quarks. In the latter case we find a potential which is proportional to r as r → 0. We point out that similar effects arise due to a new kind of non perturbative correction proportional to 1 /Q 2, which is unaccounted for by the operator product expansion and which was recently discussed within a different framework. Phenomenological implications of the linear correction to the potential are briefly reviewed. PACS numbers: 12. 38. Cy, 12. 39. Hg, 13. 20. He 1.

25|$|The Merovingians {{established}} {{themselves in}} the power <b>vacuum</b> of the <b>former</b> Roman provinces in Gaul, and Clovis I converted to Christianity following his victory over the Alemanni at the Battle of Tolbiac (496), laying {{the foundation of the}} Frankish Empire, the dominant state of early medieval Western Christendom. The Frankish kingdom grew through a complex development of conquest, patronage, and alliance building. Due to salic custom, inheritance rights were absolute, and all land was divided equally among the sons of a dead land holder. This meant that, when the king granted a prince land in reward for service, that prince and all of his descendants had an irrevocable right to that land that no future king could undo. Likewise, those princes (and their sons) could sublet their land to their own vassals, who could in turn sublet the land to lower sub-vassals. This all had the effect of weakening the power of the king as his kingdom grew, since the result was that the land became controlled by not just by more princes and vassals, but by multiple layers of vassals. This also allowed his nobles to attempt to build their own power base, though given the strict salic tradition of hereditary kingship, few would ever consider overthrowing the king.|$|R
50|$|The {{death of}} Emperor Zhang in 88 and the {{succession}} of his ten-year-old son Emperor He brought significant changes to the political landscape. The regents of the young emperor, Empress Dowager Dou and her brother Dou Xian, favoured a more militaristic policy to the Northern Xiongnu problem. Both their regional background and position at court encouraged them to seek the expansion of central authority through war. With the Grand Commandant Su You, Minister of Works Ren Wei (任隗) and the Nine Ministers, Yuan An marched on the court hall and submitted memorials condemning a campaign in the north. He argued that since the Northern Xiongnu had not invaded the frontier, {{there was no reason}} to waste resources on a distant expedition. Despite his strong opposition and that of other conservative advisors, Lady Dou ordered the dispatch of an expeditionary force. In the summer of 89 a Chinese-led force advanced in three columns with minimal opposition and defeated the Northern Shanyu at Jiluo Mountain and pursued him westwards into the Altai ranges. A final offensive in 91 destroyed the Northern Xiongnu, creating a political <b>vacuum</b> in its <b>former</b> territories which the Han empire would struggle to contain in the next two centuries.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between modernity and Islam {{is still a}} largely under-researched intellectual realm, though the erstwhile discourse defining it as a contestation between tradition and modernity, universalism and cultural particularism, or between change and stagnation, is gradually giving way to a fresher academic perspective. The 'recent' forces of modernity brought into the Muslim heartland by colonialism and highlighted by post-coloniality and mobility have intensified the debate on Muslim identity itself. The Bosnians, especially the Bosnaks/Bosniaks, have been undisputedly European, rooted in a secularist vision of Islam, pursuing modernity with full force in reference to liberalism, rationalism, feminism and, of course, pluralism. Their nationalist aspirations never hinged on religio-lingual monoethnicity, yet still they suffered from the most harrowing crimes ever committed against a human community. In other words, here it was not Islam battling against modernity, rather the latter itself became disputed and went wild, negating the entire thesis of clash of civilisations or Islam being static or pre-modern. The very core of this modernity, nationalism became the most reactionary weapon for ethnic cleansing. Subsequent upon the dissolution of communist centralism, the ideological <b>vacuum</b> in the <b>former</b> Eastern bloc is being claimed by xenophobic nationalism in collusion with religious extremism. This phenomenon largely explains the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans.

40|$|Organic {{photovoltaics}} {{have attracted}} considerable research and commercial interest {{due to their}} lightness, mechanical flexibility and low production costs. There are two main approaches for the fabrication of organic solar cells – solution and <b>vacuum</b> processing. The <b>former</b> relies on morphology control in polymer-fullerene blends resulting from natural phase separation in these systems. The latter takes advantage of solvent-free processing allowing highly complex multi-junction architectures similar to inorganic solar cells. This work aims to combine the benefits of both by depositing conjugated polymers using vacuum thermal evaporation. By employing this unconventional approach it aims to enhance the efficiency of organic photovoltaics through increased complexity of the thin-film architecture while improving the nanoscale morphology control of the individual active layers. The thesis explores the vacuum thermal deposition of polythiophenes, mainly poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and side-group free poly(thiophene) (PTh). A variety of chemical techniques, such as NMR, FT-IR, GPC, DSC and TGA, are {{used to examine the}} effect of heating on chemical structure of the polymers. Optimal processing parameters are identified and related to the resulting thin-film morphology and charge transport properties. Efficient photovoltaic devices based on polythiophene donors and fullerene acceptors are fabricated. Materials science techniques AFM, XRD, SEM, TEM and MicroXAM are used to characterize topography and morphology of the thin films, and UV-Vis, EQE, I-V and C-V measurements relate these to the optical and electronic properties. The results of the study show that polymer side groups have a strong influence on molecular packing and charge extraction in vacuum-deposited polymer thin films. Unlike P 3 HT, evaporated PTh forms highly crystalline films. This leads to enhanced charge transport properties with hole mobility two orders of magnitude higher than that in P 3 HT. The effect of molecular order is demonstrated on polymer/fullerene planar heterojunction solar cells. PTh-based devices have significantly better current and recombination characteristics, resulting in improved overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) by 70 % as compared to P 3 HT. This confirms that the chemical structure of the molecule is a crucial parameter in deposition of large organic semiconductors. It is also the first-ever example of vacuum-deposited polymer photovoltaic cell. Next, vacuum co-deposited PTh:C 60 bulk heterojunctions with different donor-acceptor compositions are fabricated, and the effect of post-production thermal annealing on their photovoltaic performance and morphology is studied. Co-deposition of blended mixtures leads to 60 % higher photocurrents than in thickness-optimized PTh/C 60 planar heterojunction counterparts. Furthermore, by annealing the devices post-situ the PCE is improved by as much as 80 %, achieving performance comparable to previously reported polythiophene and oligothiophene equivalents processed in solution and vacuum, respectively. The enhanced photo-response is a result of favourable morphological development of PTh upon annealing. In contrast to standard vacuum-processed molecular blends, annealing-induced phase separation in PTh:C 60 does not lead to the formation of coarse morphology but rather to an incremental improvement of the already established interpenetrated nanoscale network. The morphological response of the evaporated PTh within the blend is further verified to positively differ from that of its small-molecule counterpart sexithiophene. This illustrates the morphological advantage of polymer-fullerene combination over all other vacuum-processable material systems. In conclusion, this processing approach outlines the conceptual path towards the most beneficial combination of solution/polymer- and vacuum-based photovoltaics. It opens up a fabrication method with considerable potential to enhance the efficiency of large-scale organic solar cells production. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
