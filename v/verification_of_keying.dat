40|$|Trust {{establishment}} in wireless ad hoc networks {{is a challenge}} because of its unique characteristics. These include {{the lack of a}} central authority and the autonomous, dynamic nature of these networks which result in poor connectivity and routing failure. Security can be provided by a certificate based model but key management is a difficulty in wireless ad hoc networks. A key management scheme is proposed which realizes certificate distribution and verification. The key management scheme occurs in an on-demand, fully distributive, wireless ad hoc network environment, establishing trust on the routing layer exclusively. Trust and route establishment are achieved simultaneously with reduced dependency between the security and routing mechanisms. Distribution and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>keying</b> material places delays upon the delivery of secure communication routes. Simulations show the overhead of the proposed scheme and that it has negligible impact on network performance while providing trust establishment for the network...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Formal {{verification}} {{has seen}} much success in several domains of {{hardware and software}} design. For example, in hardware verification {{there has been much}} work in the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> microprocessors (e. g. [1]) and memory systems (e. g. [2]). Similarly, software verification has seen success in device-drivers (e. g. [3]) and concurrent software (e. g. [4]). The area <b>of</b> network <b>verification,</b> which consists <b>of</b> both hardware and software components, has received relatively less attention. Traditionally, the focus in this domain has been on performance and security, with less emphasis on functional correctness. However, increasing complexity is resulting in increasing functional failures and thus prompting interest in <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> correctness properties. This paper reviews the formal verification techniques that have been used here thus far, with the goal of understanding the characteristics of the problem domain that are helpful for each of the techniques, as well as those that pose specific challenges.

40|$|A dynamic {{wireless}} network that is formed without any pre-existing infrastructure, {{in which every}} node {{can act as a}} router is called a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Since MANETS has not got clear cut security provisions, it is accessible to any of the authorized network users and malicious attackers. The greatest challenge for the MANETS is to come with a robust security solution even in the presence of malicious nodes, so that MANET can be protected from various routing attacks. Several countermeasures have been proposed for these routing attacks in MANETS using various cryptographic techniques. But most of these mechanisms are not considerably suitable for the resource constraints, i. e., bandwidth limitation and battery power, since they results in heavy traffic load for exchanging and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b> In this paper, a new semantic security solution is provided, which suits for the different MANET constraints and also is robust in nature, since it is able to identify and prevent four routing attacks parallelly.

40|$|Because {{renewable}} energy sources are environment-friendly and inexhaustible, more and more said {{renewable energy}} power plants have been integrated into power grids worldwide. To compensate for their inherent variability, STATCOMs are typically installed {{at the point of}} common coupling (PCC) to help their operation by regulating the PCC voltage. However under different contingencies, PCC voltage fluctuations in magnitude and frequency may impede the STATCOM from tracking the grid frequency correctly, hence worsening its overall compensation performance, and putting at risk the operation of the power plant. Further, the virtual synchronous machine (VSM) concept has recently been introduced to control grid-connected inverters emulating the behavior of rotating synchronous machines, in an effort to eliminate the shortcomings of conventional d-q frame phase-locked loops (PLL). In this paper, the VSM concept is extended by developing a STATCOM controller with it, which then behaves like a fully-adjustable synchronous condenser, including the adjustment of its “virtual” inertia and impedance. The proposed controller is compared against existent d-q frame STATCOM control strategies, evincing how the VSM-based approach guarantees not just better synchronization, but an improved voltage regulation performance at the PCC, attained through its virtual impedance, as well as a lower sensitivity to system disturbances, attained through its virtual inertia.

40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare perceptions of nurses exposed to short or longer term shift work and their experiences working under this type of scheduling. Background: Shift work is a crucial component of nurses' working lives, ensuring continuous care for patients. This study fills a research gap around the personal experiences of shift working nurses and the strategies used to manage the impacts of shift work. Design: Qualitative case study design. Methods: Constructivist methodology, including in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted in 2015, was used for the study. Iterative review and inductive analysis of transcripts from nine recently graduated nurses and twelve experienced nurses enabled identification and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> themes. Findings: Three main areas of difference between new and experienced nurses relating to shift work challenges in a nursing environment emerged: perceptions about the utility of working in shifts, coping strategies and social support at home and work. Most experienced nurses found shift work advantageous, especially those with dependents. Coping strategies included flexible shift arrangements in both groups. Experienced nurses detailed the importance of support from family and friends while inexperienced nurses described feeling disconnected from social supports. Experienced nurses cited a lack of support from nursing managers as problematic. Conclusions: Findings suggest shift selection mitigated challenges of shift work for both inexperienced and experienced nurses, indicating autonomous roster selection is critical. Similarly, social support at work from senior nurses and management and at home {{played an important role in}} nurses' coping.

40|$|The Lutjanidae (tropical snappers) are {{important}} to fisheries throughout the tropics and subtropics. Reliable age-based demographic data are essential for the sustainable management of lutjanid fisheries, and are underpinned by the selection of appropriate ageing structures and validation of increment periodicity within these. Lutjanid age validation has attracted considerable research attention {{over the past three}} decades, but lacks a recent synthesis. This paper reviews the four main approaches used in lutjanid age validation; bomb radiocarbon dating, radiometry (lead-radium dating), chemical tagging and marginal increment analysis (MIA). Bomb radiocarbon and lead-radium dating provide absolute age estimates, which can validate increment counts in calcified structures. However, bomb radiocarbon dating cannot accurately age fish older than ∼ 55 years, an age that some lutjanids may meet or exceed. The development of 14 C reference curves for the postbomb decline period offers potential to accurately age fish only a few years old. Technical advances and empirical <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> assumptions {{over the last two decades}} have established the accuracy and validity of lead-radium dating. However, this approach is not uniformly applicable to all study species or areas. Mark-recapture studies using fluorochromes clarify changes in increment appearance and periodicity as fish age, but lutjanid recapture rates are often poor. Marginal increment analysis (MIA) is susceptible to bias and misinterpretation if not rigorously applied. While no single validation approach offers a complete solution, almost all studies support annual increment formation in lutjanid otoliths. Future validation studies would benefit from the development of otolith reference collections and cross-institutional collaboration. Because MIA is inexpensive and logistically simple, its use on lutjanids will inevitably continue, and we therefore provide guidelines for its rigorous application...|$|R
