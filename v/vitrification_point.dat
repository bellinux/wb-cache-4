5000|$|To achieve {{more than}} one colour on a given vase, a further trick is necessary: The black {{magnetite}} Fe3O4 has to be prevented from returning to matt red hematite Fe2O3. In other words, the areas to remain black have to be denied access to oxygen, their oxidised particles must be [...] "sealed". This is achieved by using a further property of the clay: the <b>vitrification</b> <b>point,</b> i.e. the temperature at which the individual clay particles irreversibly merge, depends on {{the composition of the}} clay and on the particles contained in it.|$|E
5000|$|At about 900 °C, {{the oxygen}} supply is cut, {{creating}} reducing conditions, so that red hematite Fe2O3 turns to deep black magnetite Fe3O4. In antiquity {{this could be}} achieved through closing the air supply openings and adding non-dried brushwood and green wood, which would only burn incompletely, producing carbon monoxide (CO rather than CO2). The temperature was held for some time, probably at about 945 °C, to assure a complete melting and sintering of the fine-particled paint slip.Subsequently, the temperature sank below the sintering (<b>vitrification)</b> <b>point</b> of the painted slip again, while still in a reducing atmosphere. Now, the slip is [...] "sealed" [...] and permits no further oxygen to react with its contents, so that the magnetite Fe3O4-oxides within it retain their black colour.|$|E

This condition means that the mobility of the polymer network will be restricted at higher DCs, delaying the gel point and the <b>vitrification</b> <b>point</b> relative to the conversion [25].|$|E

Although these efforts may clarify the origin of the spectacular change in properties of liquids approaching <b>vitrification,</b> we <b>point</b> out that a seemingly related phenomenon, thermorheological complexity in polymers, must involve different mechanisms. In particular, as seen from consideration of various properties involving the chain dynamics, averaging over different length and time scales cannot offer a resolution to the problem of thermorheological complexity.

40|$|To characterise a polymer, {{it is of}} {{fundamental}} importance to determine its parameters, like the temperatures of destruction, <b>vitrification,</b> melting <b>point,</b> specific mass losses or polymorphic transformations, which frequently determine {{the quality of the}} product and its applications. Thermal analyses were conducted of samples of a biopolymer binder: a starch-poly(acrylic acid) composition and a moulding sand with a biopolymer binder previously hardened with microwaves. In order to determine the thermal stability of the examined samples by determining the destruction temperature and the thermal effects of transformations taking place during heating, FTIR spectroscopy and thermal analysis (DSC, DTG, TG) methods were used. In addition, volatile products of degradation were analysed using the thermogravimetry (TG) method coupled online with mass spectrometry (MS). These examinations were also aimed at identifying the changes that can take place in the moulding sand when it comes into contact with liquid metal...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of ultrasonic measurements {{can be increased}} significantly by using nonlinear techniques instead of conventional linear ultrasonics. The nonlinear ultrasonics, based on a harmonic generation technique also known as collinear wave interaction, is used widely in practice due to its simplicity in implementation. The amplitudes of harmonics which are monitored with this technique not only originate in a test specimen, but also in electronics, the acoustic channel and the surrounding medium. This makes interpretation of the measurement results extremely complex. Noncollinear wave mixing is an alternative technique to harmonic generation. This technique has multiple advantages in comparison with harmonic generation, and {{it is easy to}} implement in industrial applications when in-line and real-time measurements are required. With a proper selection of measurement conditions for noncollinear wave mixing it is possible to measure a nonlinear material response without an influence of nonlinearities in the electr 5 onics, the acoustic channel and the surrounding medium. A mathematical model for prediction of nonlinear wave amplitude coefficients is presented in this thesis. All possible noncollinear wave interactions can be analyzed with this model and the nonlinear wave amplitued coefficients in isotropic solids can be predicted. Based on this model, a procedure is proposed for the selection of the optimal measurement conditions for noncollinear wave mixing experiments. Three measurement techniques were developed based on noncollinear wave mixing. Firstly, a method was developed for the phase velocity measurement in an isotropic solid. The phase velocity in a solid can be determined with this method when one of the wave velocities (shear of longitudinal) is known. This method does not require an estimation of the phase time-of-flight and wave propagation path. It is only necessary to measure the wave incident angles. Secondly, a method was developed to monitor the curing process of epoxy and experimental results were analyzed. This method enables in-line and real-time measurements of the epoxy cure dynamics in a thin layer (thickess about 0. 2 mm), with detection of the minimum viscosity, the gel onset, the gel peak and <b>vitrification</b> <b>points.</b> Thirdly, a method was developed and the experimental results were analyzed for physical ageing measurements in glassy thermoplastics. The physical ageing dynamics and the current physical age in thermoplastic can be determined with this method. The results of this study demonstrate that more accurate and more sensitive characterization of engineerig materials can be achieved by making use of advanced ultrasonic measurement techniques...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{capacitive}} sensing based {{non-destructive evaluation}} technique {{is applied to}} a vacuum assisted resin infusion process for the fabrication of glass fibre reinforced composites, as such different steps of the fabrication process (the injection of resin, the curing and the post curing) can be better understood to increase {{the quality of the}} fabricated part and reduce the fabrication costs. An interdigital coplanar capacitive sensor was designed, fabricated, and embedded in the glass fibre reinforced composites. Experimental data clearly shows different stages of the resin infusion process: wetting of the glass fibres marked by rapid increase of capacitance; domination of ionic conduction at the early stage of the cure when the resin is still in a liquid state; the <b>vitrification</b> <b>point,</b> indicating a transition of the resin from a gelly state to a glassy state, marked by the relatively big decrease in capacitance; further polymerization during post-curing, marked by a peak in capacitance at the beginning of post-curing cycle, and finally the completion of the cure marked by the saturation of capacitance to a final value.

40|$|The {{isothermal}} structural {{relaxation of}} glassy, spin-cast polymer thin films has been investigated. Specifically, the thickness h of freshly cast poly(methyl methacrylate) thin films was measured over time using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The spin-cast films exhibit a gradual decrease in thickness, which {{is attributed to}} structural relaxation of the glass combined with simultaneous solvent loss. In all cases, It {{was found to be}} greater than the equilibrium thickness h(infinity), which is obtained by cooling slowly from the melt. It is observed that both the rate of the volume relaxation and the fractional departure from h. (referred to as delta(0)) increase with increasing film thickness. In the limit of very thin films, the initial h is close to h(infinity), and delta(0) is small, whereas in thick films (> 500 nm), a plateau value of delta(0) of 0. 16 is observed, which is close to the volume fraction of the solvent at the <b>vitrification</b> <b>point.</b> This dependence of) on thickness is observed regardless of the substrate, polymer molecular weight, or angular velocity during spin casting. Enhanced mobility near film surfaces could be leading to greater relaxation in thinner films prior to, and immediately after, the vitrification of the polymer during the deposition process. </p...|$|E

Oligomers were added at 10 - 30 phr to BisGMA-UDMA-TEGDMA (5 : 3 : 2, BUT). 25 wt% silanated inorganic fillers were added. Commercial cement (Relyx Veneer, 3 M-ESPE) was also evaluated with 10 - 20 phr of aromatic oligomer. Near-IR {{was used to}} follow methacrylate conversion (DC) and rate of polymerization (Rp(max)). Mechanical properties were evaluated in three-point bending (ISO 4049) for flexural strength/modulus (FS/FM, and toughness), and notched specimens (ASTM Standard E 399 - 90) for fracture toughness (KO. Polymerization stress (PS) was measured on the Bioman. Volumetric shrinkage (VS, %) was measured with the bonded disk technique. Results were analyzed with ANOVA/Tukey's test (alpha = 5 %). In general terms, for BUT cements, conversion and mechanical properties in flexure increased for selected groups {{with the addition of}} thio-urethane oligomers. The aromatic versions resulted in greater FS/FM than aliphatic. Fracture toughness increased by twofold in the experimental groups (from 1. 17 +/- 0. 36 MPa m(1 / 2) to around 3. 23 +/- 0. 22 MPa m(1 / 2)). Rp(max) decreased with the addition of thio-urethanes, though the <b>vitrification</b> <b>point</b> was not statistically different from the control. VS and PS decreased with both oligomers. For the commercial cement, 20 phr of oligomer increased DC, vitrification, reduced Rpmax and also significantly increased K-IC, and reduced PS and FM. Thio-urethane oligomers were shown to favorably modify conventional dimethacrylate networks. Significant reductions in polymerization stress were achieved at the same time conversion and fracture toughness increased. (C) 2015 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A guided wave-based in-process cure {{monitoring}} technique for carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites was investigated at NASA Langley Research Center. A key cure transition <b>point</b> (<b>vitrification)</b> was identified {{and the degree}} of cure was monitored using metrics such as amplitude and time of arrival (TOA) of guided waves. Using an automated system preliminarily developed in this work, high-temperature piezoelectric transducers were utilized to interrogate a twenty-four ply unidirectional composite panel fabricated from Hexcel (Registered Trademark) IM 7 / 8552 prepreg during cure. It was shown that the amplitude of the guided wave increased sharply around vitrification and the TOA curve possessed an inverse relationship with degree of cure. The work is a first step in demonstrating the feasibility of transitioning the technique to perform in-process cure monitoring in an autoclave, defect detection during cure, and ultimately a closed-loop process control to maximize composite part quality and consistency...|$|R
40|$|Using one-photon {{excitation}} {{we studied}} photoluminescence of C₆₀ saturated with molecular hydrogen over a temperature range 10 to 230 K. Saturation of samples {{was done at}} a pressure of 30 atm and at temperatures low enough (T < 250 °C) to exclude chemical sorption. The samples were saturated during periods of varied duration τ to reach different occupancy levels. To check reliability of our luminescence results and interpretation, our spectra for pure C₆₀ were compared with data known in the art, demonstrating good compatibility. The luminescence spectra were attributed according to the approach of Akimoto and Kan, no by separating total spectra in two components of different origin. The A-type spectra, which are associated with exciton transport to deep traps, above 70 K become prevail over the B-type emission. Until saturation times did not exceed a certain value (for one, 50 h for a saturation temperature of 200 °C) the integrated intensity I {{as a function of}} the temperature T of luminescence measurements, I(T), remained at a constant level up to the orientational <b>vitrification</b> <b>point</b> of about 100 K and then went rather steeply down with increasing T. However, at longer τ the intensity I(Τ) persisted in constancy to higher T (the higher, the longer τ) and then dropped with increasing T. This finding made us to reexamine more closely the lattice parameter vs saturation time dependence for saturation temperatures 200 and 230 °C. As a result, additional evidence allowed us to infer that after completion of the single-molecule filling of O-voids (specifically, after roughly 50 h for Tsat = 200 °C) a slower process of double filling sets in. Double filling entails an anisotropic deformation of the octahedral cage, which modifies rotational dynamics stronger than single filling. Further, we argue that singlet exciton transport to traps (which is responsible for the A-type emission) can be crucially hampered by rotational jumps of one of the molecules over which a travelling exciton is spread. Such jumps break coherence and the exciton stops thereby increasing the probability of emissionless deactivation. If so, then the temperature, at which the rotational jumps occur sufficiently frequently, may be by inference considered the unfreezing point for the orientational glass state (essentially coinciding with the inverse critical point Tg where the rotational system freezes into the orientational glass). This treatment of Tg differs from that existing in the art according to which the glass state is destroyed owing to the increased density of phonon states. Keeping to our reasoning, we conclude that the orientational glass state does not disappear but, instead, is conserved almost unchanged under one-molecule feeling and persists to appreciably higher temperatures in the case of double filling, which affects exciton dynamics stronger...|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} multifunctional {{epoxy resin}} systems {{are becoming increasingly}} important as matrix materials for the advanced composites used in aerospace, electronics, automotive and other industries. In a composite based on epoxy resin systems, a three-dimensional network of the matrix is formed around the reinforcing fibre {{as a result of}} the chemical reaction between the resin and the curing agent. This chemical process, known as curing, is an important event to he considered in the production of composite components made up of these resin systems. Two process parameters namely viscosity and chemical conversion are of paramount significance in the production of composite materials Curing studies of the resin systems based on these two parameters, would therefore assume great importance in deciding the performance reliability of the end product. The objectives of the present investigation are 1. to study the cure kinetics of three thermoset resin systems, viz., i) epoxy novolac (EPIT) / diamino diphenyl methane{DDM), ii) trigylcidyl para- ammo phenol (TGPAP) /toluene diamine (TDA) and iii) tetraglycidyl diamino diphenyl methane (TGDDM) /pyridine diamine(PDA) using the cure kinetic models based on chemical conversion (α), Theological conversion (β) and viscosity. 2. to develop a correlation between a and viscosity (η) and modify an existing autocatalytic model based on α, to the viscosity domain and 3. to investigate the cure behaviour of these systems in terms of the TTT cure diagram and its associated models. EPN/DDM, TGPAP/PDA and TGDDM/PDA resin systems were chosen for the studies to represent a range of functionalities, The cure was monitored using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) techniques by following the changes in enthalpy, functional groups and rheology, respectively. The kinetic parameters namely, order of reaction and activation energy were estimated from dynamic DSC data using the methods of Freeman-Carroll and Ellerstein using nth rate expression. Barton, Kissinger and Osawa methods were employed to find out the activation energy from the peak/equal conversion at different heating rates. Isothermal DSC data were also analyzed using nth order model and it was observed that the data could be fitted satisfactorily only for higher temperatures The results obtained from the analysis of both dynamic and isothermal DSC data using nth order model clearly indicate that this model is inadequate for describing the cure behavior. The isothermal DSC data was analyzed by the autocatalytic models of Hone and Kamal Good correlation was observed with Hum and Kamal models up to 60 - 70 %, 25 % and 45 % conversions for EPN/DDM, TGPAP/TDA and TCDDM/PDA systems respectively. However, the parameters m and n in Kamal model were found to be temperature dependent for EPN/DDM and TCPAP/TDA systems. The limited applicability of the autocatalytic models IK attributed to the counter-effect offered by the intra-molecular bonding taking place. The primary amine and epoxy groups conversions obtained from FTIR were analyzed using autocatalytic model and the kinetic parameters were calculated. The reactivity ratio of the primary amine and the secondary amine with epoxy was found to be dependent on temperature in agreement with the recent findings reported m the literature. The existing models that relate the cure kinetics and the rheological changes, are dual Arrhenius nth order model and autocatalytic model The nth order kinetic model was used to evaluate the kinetic parameters using the viscosity data at different cure temperatures under isothermal conditions As the storage modulus, G' is proportional to the chemical cross links and becomes significant only after the g< 4 point, it was used to follow the changes in conversion known as rheoconversion after the gel point The rheoconversion was found by normalizing the G' data with G 1 ^, the storage modulus of the fully cured resin It was used to study the cuie kinetics using an autocatalytic model The kinetic parameters such as rate constant, acceptation and retardation parameters were evaluated and that temperature dependence was established. While the existing models relate viscosity and conversion only up to gel point the new proposed model, termed VISCON model takes into account the changes up to vitrification. The relation so developed is used to modify the autocatalytic cure model based on chemical conversion. The parameters appearing in this model were evaluated using Levenberg-Marquardt error minimization algorithm. The kinetic parameters obtained are comparable with the values estimated using the DSC data. All the models cited above represent the microkinetic aspects. The models based on the information of TTT cure diagrams, however, represent the macrokinetic aspects of the cure, as they are based on the cure stages such as gelation and vitrification TTT diagram relates the cure characteristics like cure temperature, cure time, Ta and, indirectly, chemical conversion Hence the ultimate properties of the composite could he predicted and established with the help of the models based on TTT cure diagrams The changes in the storage modulus, G 1 and loss modulus, G", were followed to identify the gel and vitrification points of the resin systems at different cure temperatures Gel point and <b>vitrification</b> <b>point</b> were used to generate gelation and vitrification hues in the construction of TTT cure diagrams for EPN/DDM, TGPAP/TDA and TGDDM/PDA resin systems Theoretical TTT diagrams were generated and IBO-T, contours were established using the TTT diagram-based models The cure schedule for the resin systems investigated could be determined from the TTT diagram and the respective rheological data...|$|E
