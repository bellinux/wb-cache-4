40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{fresh evidence}} on CEO stock option awards. We identify several contracting {{conditions that are}} applied at either plan adoption or a subsequent award. We show empirically that option awards cannot be evaluated without controlling for CEO pre-award stock ownership. Although options potentially augment CEO incentive, they may not when the stock position is large relative to the award size. We also find that option grants are most successful from a shareholder perspective when awards occur within the top quartile of awarded options/pre-award stock, particularly when the award is made at a discount to market in tandem with <b>vesting</b> <b>requirements.</b> Empirical analysis of CEO stock option awards requires more complete specification of contracting variables than generally exhibited in the extant empirical literature. Of the contracting conditions studied, those having the most important incentive and hence wealth consequences are stock dividend protection, <b>vesting</b> <b>requirements,</b> award discounts/premiums and term to expiry.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the VEST experiment scheduled during the Italian “Marco Polo” Soyuz Mission in April 2002 about which the author was Principal Investigator. VEST is a new integrated system of clothing {{to be used in the}} space flight environment. Aim of the experiment was to demonstrate that the provision of a new integrated system of garments to the crew would increase their well being, would allow to collect useful data with less impact on the crew schedule and to prove that in general with VEST equipment less mass and less volume are required for the clothing system. The VEST experiment is the final purpose of the feasibility study in 2001 in order to improve living and working conditions in space by designing innovative fabrics suitable for life inside the International Space Station (ISS) while keeping style a priority. Also, the new materials key characteristics are enable the clothes to guarantee transpiration, body thermal control and hygiene of the crewmember. The results of VEST experiment have allowed to obtain specific requirements for a new clothing system in microgravity and confined environments. Next experiment designed by the author named GOAL, Garments for Orbital Activities in weightLessness, planned for the Italian “Eneide” Soyuz Mission in April 2005, takes into consideration the first result of <b>VEST</b> developing new <b>requirements</b> and items to be comfortable and usable on board during space flight human missions...|$|R

40|$|Although {{pensions}} are an undeniably {{important component}} of most workers ’ compensation packages, {{whether or not their}} role is unique is more problematic. In terms of the structure of compensation, pensions have the following effects. By shifting compensation from one’s working years to the period of retirement, they tilt the life-cycle earnings path up-ward. During the initial periods of employment, workers typically make contributions to the pension but acquire no earned rights to the benefits, thus effectively reducing their wage rate and imposing a transactions cost on job changes. As their experience increases, these contributions are coupled with at least partial earned benefit rights. The extent to which market processes will lead to the use of nontrans-ferable pension benefits is greater than might be concluded from current pension plan characteristics since the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) imposes minimal <b>vesting</b> <b>requirements.</b> Before the advent of ERISA, the majority of workers (70 % from 1950 to 1970) wh...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{acknowledged}} defects in private pension schemes {{as they are}} presently administered: <b>vesting</b> <b>requirements</b> are long, most plans are not portable, plans are subject to insolvencies, and benefits are inadequate because, among other reasons, they are not indexed for inflation. In this article, Harry Glasbeek argues {{that there is little}} hope that these defects in private pension schemes will be remedied since the primary motivation behind their entrenchment was not to provide retirement income for employees, but was to provide certain benefits for employers such as a more stable work force, the easier retirement of less productive workers, and the accumulation of a large private investment fund. Indeed he argues that, ironically and in spite of their expressed ideology, those who seriously argue that private pensions can be improved invariably end up making suggestions that would have private pension schemes take on the characteristics of a public pension scheme. He concludes by arguing the case for abolishing private pensions and substituting a public non-earnings related scheme...|$|E

40|$|Employee {{stock options}} are {{effective}} financial instruments used by firms to compensate, reward and retain their employees. They commonly contain non-traditional {{features that are}} not found in other conventional options traded in the financial markets. The reload provision in an employee stock option entitles its holder to receive one new (reload) option from the employer for each share tendered as payment of strike upon the exercise of the stock option. The reload provision {{may be subject to}} time or performance <b>vesting</b> <b>requirements.</b> Under the time vesting constraint, the holder is prohibiting from exercising the reload until the end of an initial vesting period. After each exercise of reload, the new reload options are subject to the same time vesting requirement. Under the performance vesting constraint, the holder can exercise the stock option only when the stock price has breached some threshold level. In this thesis, the analytic formulas for the fair market value of the employee stock options are derived under the Black-Scholes pricing framework. The pricing models can be formulated as optimal stopping problems, where stopping refers to the premature termination of the original option contract. The analytic properties of the price functions and optimal exercise policies of the employee stock options are explored. The determination of the optimal exercise boundary requires the solution of a non-linear integral equation. Numerical schemes are designed for the numerical valuation of the price functions and the optimal exercise boundary...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of retirees have employer-sponsored retiree health {{insurance}} (RHI). While RHI is a common source of supplemental coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, {{it is also the}} only affordable source of health insurance for many retirees under age 65 who have no access to Medicare. However, employers are scaling back their RHI benefits in response to rising health costs and changes in accounting rules, by either eliminating benefits which shifts costs to retirees, or tightening <b>vesting</b> <b>requirements.</b> Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, this paper examines the potential consequences of eliminating RHI for both pre-Medicare and Medicare-eligible retirees. For younger retirees the likely primary response is to work longer, and we find that number of workers age 55 to 64 would increase by 7 percent, as some of those who have their access to RHI eliminated would work rather than retire. Of those who still choose to retire, most lack any employer-sponsored health insurance option and would need to find an alternative source of coverage or go uninsured. For Medicare beneficiaries over 65, we estimate that about three quarters would replace RHI with another form of supplemental coverage. This shift would slightly reduce total spending and utilization for individuals who choose basic Medicare or a Medicare HMO as opposed to a Medigap plan, but health outcomes would probably be unaffected no matter which supplemental option is chosen. In short, a full elimination of RHI would primarily impact early retirees who must face the cost of much more expensive insurance or of financing illness without insurance. Policymakers may want to consider encouraging insurers to step in to provide more affordable plans for these early pre-Medicare retirees. ...|$|E
