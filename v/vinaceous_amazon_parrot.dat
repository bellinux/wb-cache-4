O Papagaio-de-peito-roxo (Amazona vinacea) é endêmico da mata atlântica e atualmente ameaçado de extinção em decorrência, principalmente, de ações antrópicas. Uma das ferramentas para se conservar espécies ameaçadas é reintroduzi-las na natureza. No entanto, para que os indivíduos possuam maiores chances de se adaptar em ambiente selvagem, é importante adotar alguns critérios no período pré-soltura, dentre eles, a preparação comportamental. O presente estudo teve por objetivos melhorar a habilidade de voo e enfraquecer a associação de humanos à oferta de alimentos em Papagaios-de-peito-roxo candidatos à soltura em um projeto de reintrodução da espécie no Parque Nacional das Araucárias, Santa Catarina. Para atingir tais objetivos, foram utilizados dois grupos de A. vinacea (grupos 1 e 2) e dois treinamentos comportamentais, sendo o treinamento de voo aplicado nos grupos 1 e 2 e o treinamento de aversão à humanos associados a alimentos aplicado somente no grupo 2. Em adicional, foram apresentados os dados de aproximação do grupo 2 à áreas povoadas durante o primeiro ano pós-soltura. O grupo 1 (n= 15) foi alojado no Centro de Triagem de Animais Silvestres de Florianópolis entre setembro de 2010 e janeiro de 2011. Por 90 dias, as aves foram treinadas a voar de uma extremidade à outra do recinto utilizando o reforço negativo como técnica de condicionamento operante. Para isso, um estímulo negativo (rede de captura) foi apresentado ao grupo e após 5 minutos de resposta de voo, o mesmo foi retirado. O grupo 2 (n= 33), alojado na escola Sarapiquá de Florianópolis entre Julho e Setembro de 2012, recebeu o treinamento de voo por 49 dias, seguindo a mesma metodologia do grupo 1. Para avaliar possíveis diferenças na habilidade de voo individual, foi realizado um teste comportamental pré- e pós-treinamento (Teste de Habilidade de Voo) em ambos os grupos, onde para cada animal foi atribuído um escore que variou de 0 a 4. O escore 0 representou as aves que não levantavam voo do chão e não voavam; o escore 1, aquelas que não levantavam voo do chão, porém voavam em ritmo inconstante sem manter o mesmo nível de altura; o escore 2, os animais que levantavam voo do chão, voavam em ritmo constante mas não mantinham o mesmo nível de altura; o escore 3, as aves que levantavam voo do chão, voavam em ritmo constante e mantinham o mesmo nível de altura; e o escore 4, aquelas que levantavam voo do chão, mantinham o ritmo constante e o mesmo nível de altura epermaneciam fora do alcance humano. As variáveis dependentes (pré- e pós-treinamento) foram comparadas através do Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Test (p Abstract : The <b>Vinaceous</b> <b>Amazon</b> <b>Parrot</b> (Amazona Vinacea) is endemic {{from the}} Atlantic forest and {{nowadays}} endangered because of human actions. One way to preserve this endangered species is to reintroduce them to nature. However, {{in order to}} individual have greater chances to adapt in a wild environment, {{it is important to}} adopt some criteria during the pre-release period, among them, the behavioral preparation. This study was conducted to improve flight ability and weaken the human association to food offer to <b>Vinaceous</b> <b>Amazon</b> <b>Parrot,</b> candidates to be released in a project of reintroduction of this species at Araucarias National Park, Santa Catarina. To reach all these goals, two groups of A. Vinacea (groups 1 and 2) and two behavioral trainings were used, the flight training being applied in groups 1 and 2 and the training of aversion to human association to food offer applied only in group 2. In addition, the approaching data of group 2 to populated area during the first year post-releasing was presented. Group 1 (n= 15) was placed in the Wild Animals Screening Center of Florianopolis from September 2010 to January 2011. During 90 days, the birds were trained to fly {{from one side to the}} other in the room using the negative reinforcement as an operant conditioning technique. To do this, a negative stimulus (Capture net) was presented to the group and after 5 minutes of flight response, it was released. Group 2 (n= 33), housed at Sarapiquá school in Florianopolis from July to September 2012, received flight training for 49 days, following the same methodology of group 1. In order to evaluate possible differences in the ability of individual flight, a behavioral test was performed pre-and post-training (Ability of flight test) in both groups, where each animal was assigned a score ranging from 0 to 4. The score 0 represented the birds which didn´t lift off the ground and did not fly; the score 1, those which didn´t lift off the ground, but flew in erratic pace not keeping the same height level; the score 2, the birds which lift off the ground, flew in constant pace, but didn´t keep the same height level; the score 3, the birds which lift off the ground, flew in constant pace and kept the same height level; and the score 4, those which lift off the ground, flew in constant pace and kept far from human reach. The dependable variables (pre and post-training) were compared using the Wilcoxon Matched Pairs test (p< 0, 05). In group 1, the post-training average (Md= 4) was significantly higher than the pre-training average (Md= 2). In group 2, there was not differencebetween pre and post-training averages. The scores minimum value for both groups were post-training (Min= 1) higher. The training of aversion to human associated to food offer was applied to group 2 for 18 days, using the punishment as operant conditioning technique. A familiar human to the animal entered the room and offered a seed of Araucaria angustifolia or a mix of seeds to parrots to each animal. When the birds approached the human to touch the food, they were punished with a negative stimulus (the noise of an aluminum can with stones inside). A behavioral test (Food offer test) evaluated possible individual differences pre and post-training. The dependable variables (pre and post-training) were compared through Wilcoxon Matched Pairs test (p< 0, 05). The pre-training average (Md= 1) was significantly minor than the post-training average (Md= 2). The minimum score value was equivalent pre and post-training. Thirteen birds from group 1 and 30 from group 2 were released at Araucarias National Park (ANP), Santa Catarina, in January 2011 and September 2012, respectively. The initial monitoring was done from January to July 2011 (group 1) and then from September 2012 to September 2013 (groups 1 and 2) through radio-telemetric, observations, listening vocalization and community monitoring. From 30 released birds of group 2, 33 % approached the populated area in September 2012. The number of approaches was reduced by 78 % in the last month of data collection (September 2013). Environmental education actions including lectures, informal dialogues with local dwellers, delivery of educational materials, were implemented to communities in the region of ANP, the surrounding area and influence zone. The operant conditioning technique in both trainings was effective to reach in part the objectives of this study. The training of aversion to human associated to food offer together with the environmental education activities possibly prevented the capture of the species of group 2 by humans at ANP...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The Red-tailed <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrot</b> (Amazona brasiliensis) is an {{endangered}} species of the Psittacine family, and for which various data are important for a comprehensive preservation plan. Data about plasma protein gel electrophoresis of <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrot</b> blood are scarce. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine plasma protein concentrations and concentrations of major protein bands in blood of young and adult Red-tailed <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrot</b> (Amazona brasiliensis). Materials and Methods. Blood samples from eight young and eight adult healthy free-living parrots were obtained. Plasma protein concentration and fractions were determined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare variables. Results and Conclusions. Six major protein bands with the following molecular weights were identified by SDS-PAGE: 170 kDa, 117 kDa, 85 kDa (putative ovotransferrin), 60 kDa, 45 kDa and 23 kDa. Adult parrots had significantly higher concentrations of total proteins, albumin and other proteins with similar mobility (around 60 kDa). Young birds had significantly higher levels of 23 kDa proteins. The concentration of putative ovotransferrin (85 kDa) was not different between young and adult parrots. Plasma protein gel electrophoresis patterns in Red-tailed <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrots</b> are similar between young and adult animals, but specific protein bands differ in their absolute concentrations. This finding should be taken into consideration when clinical pathology data are analysed...|$|R

40|$|Nesting {{behavior}} of the Lilac-crowned Parrot (Amazona finschi) was observed over a three year period at 24 nests in the tropical dry forest of the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, western Mexico. Nest site characteristics and the pattern of parental care throughout the nesting cycle are described for this mainland <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrot</b> and compared with that reported for other <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrot</b> species. Nest sites were located in natural cavities of large mature trees characteristic of semi-deciduous forest. Nest sites were similar {{to one another in}} tree species, tree size, cavity height, and entrance width, indicating that Lilac-crowned Parrots may select nest sites based on these characteristics. Unlike most parrot species, Lilac-crowned Parrots showed low nest site reuse and high synchrony of nest initiation. Throughout the nesting cycle, females and nestlings were fed only twice a day on average. Nest attendance during feeding visits was short. The infrequent feeding visits and short nest attendance exhibited by Lilac-crowned Parrots corresponds with that found for other mainland <b>Amazon</b> <b>parrots</b> in northeastern Mexico, but contrasts with the multiple feedings and longer nest attendance observed for island Amazon species. The distinct aspects of Lilac-crowned Parrot nesting behavior may be related to predation rate and food resource availability during the extreme dry season...|$|R
