40|$|A {{chromatic}} modulator {{has been}} proposed to enable the separate detection of the red, green, and blue (RGB) color components of the same scene by a single charge-coupled device (CCD), active-pixel sensor (APS), or similar electronic <b>image</b> <b>detector.</b> Traditionally, the RGB color-separation problem in an electronic camera has been solved by use of either (1) fixed color filters over three separate image detectors; (2) a filter wheel that repeatedly imposes a red, then a green, then a blue filter over a single image detector; or (3) different fixed color filters over adjacent pixels. The use of separate <b>image</b> <b>detectors</b> necessitates precise registration of the detectors {{and the use of}} complicated optics; filter wheels are expensive and add considerably to the bulk of the camera; and fixed pixelated color filters reduce spatial resolution and introduce color-aliasing effects. The proposed chromatic modulator would not exhibit any of these shortcomings. The proposed chromatic modulator would be an electromechanical device fabricated by micromachining. It would include a filter having a spatially periodic pattern of RGB strips at a pitch equal to that of the pixels of the <b>image</b> <b>detector.</b> The filter would be placed in front of the <b>image</b> <b>detector,</b> supported at its periphery by a spring suspension and electrostatic comb drive. The spring suspension would bias the filter toward a middle position in which each filter strip would be registered with a row of pixels of the <b>image</b> <b>detector.</b> Hard stops would limit the excursion of the spring suspension to precisely one pixel row above and one pixel row below the middle position. In operation, the electrostatic comb drive would be actuated to repeatedly snap the filter to the upper extreme, middle, and lower extreme positions. This action would repeatedly place a succession of the differently colored filter strips in front of each pixel of the <b>image</b> <b>detector.</b> To simplify the processing, it would be desirable to encode information on the color of the filter strip over each row (or at least over some representative rows) of pixels at a given instant of time in synchronism with the pixel output at that instant...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle re-identification is an {{important}} problem and has many applications in video surveillance and intelligent transportation. It gains increasing attention because of the recent advances of person re-identification techniques. However, unlike person re-identification, the visual differences between pairs of <b>vehicle</b> <b>images</b> are usually subtle and even challenging for humans to distinguish. Incorporating additional spatio-temporal information is vital for solving the challenging re-identification task. Existing vehicle re-identification methods ignored or used over-simplified models for the spatio-temporal relations between <b>vehicle</b> <b>images.</b> In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework that incorporates complex spatio-temporal information for effectively regularizing the re-identification results. Given a pair of <b>vehicle</b> <b>images</b> with their spatio-temporal information, a candidate visual-spatio-temporal path is first generated by a chain MRF model with a deeply learned potential function, where each visual-spatio-temporal state corresponds to an actual <b>vehicle</b> <b>image</b> with its spatio-temporal information. A Siamese-CNN+Path-LSTM model takes the candidate path {{as well as the}} pairwise queries to generate their similarity score.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare and {{validate}} three methods to simulate radiographic <b>image</b> <b>detectors</b> with the Monte Carlo software MCNP/MCNPX in a time efficient way. METHODS: The first detector model was the standard semideterministic radiography tally, which has been used in previous image simulation studies. Next to the radiography tally two alternative stochastic detector models were developed: A perfect energy integrating detector and a detector based on the energy absorbed in the detector material. Validation of three <b>image</b> <b>detector</b> models was performed by comparing calculated scatter-to-primary ratios (SPRs) with the published and experimentally acquired SPR values. RESULTS: For mammographic applications, SPRs computed with the radiography tally were up to 44 % larger than the published results, while the SPRs computed with the perfect energy integrating detectors and the blur-free absorbed energy detector model were, on the average, 0. 3 % (ranging from - 3 % to 3 %) and 0. 4 % (ranging from - 5 % to 5 %) lower, respectively. For general radiography applications, the radiography tally overestimated the measured SPR by as much as 46 %. The SPRs calculated with the perfect energy integrating detectors were, on the average, 4. 7 % (ranging from - 5. 3 % to - 4 %) lower than the measured SPRs, whereas for the blur-free absorbed energy detector model, the calculated SPRs were, on the average, 1. 3 % (ranging from - 0. 1 % to 2. 4 %) larger than the measured SPRs. CONCLUSIONS: For mammographic applications, both the perfect energy integrating detector model and the blur-free energy absorbing detector model can be used to simulate <b>image</b> <b>detectors,</b> whereas for conventional x-ray imaging using higher energies, the blur-free energy absorbing detector model is the most appropriate <b>image</b> <b>detector</b> model. The radiography tally overestimates the scattered part and should therefore not be used to simulate radiographic <b>image</b> <b>detectors.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical, computational method whereby two-dimensional images of an optical source represented {{in terms of}} a set of detector array signals can be registered with respect to a reference set of detector array signals. The <b>detector</b> <b>image</b> is recovered from the detector array signals and represented over a local region by a fourth order, two-dimensional taylor series. This local <b>detector</b> <b>image</b> can then be registered by a general linear transformation with respect to a reference <b>detector</b> <b>image.</b> The <b>detector</b> signal in the reference frame is reconstructed by integrating this <b>detector</b> <b>image</b> over the respective reference pixel. For cases in which the general linear transformation is uncertain by up to plus-or-minus two pixels, the general linear transformation can be determined by least squares fitting the <b>detector</b> <b>image</b> to the reference <b>detector</b> <b>image.</b> This registration process reduces clutter and jitter noise to a level comparable to the electronic noise level of the d [...] ...|$|R

The wafer, in turn, is bonded to the CCD so that light in the two orthogonal planes of polarization falls on adjacent pairs of pixels.
