5|$|The Austrians had arrayed {{their own}} army {{in a line}} from the Tyrol to the Danube. A force of 46,000under command of Count Heinrich von Bellegarde formed the defence of the Tyrol. Another small Austrian force of 26,000commanded by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze guarded the <b>Vorarlberg.</b> The main Austrian Army—close to 80,000 troops under the command of Archduke Charles—had wintered in the Bavarian, Austrian, and Salzburg territories on {{the eastern side of the}} Lech. At the battles of Ostrach (21 March) and Stockach (25 March), the main Austrian force pushed the Army of the Danube back into the Black Forest. Charles made plans to cross the upper Rhine at the Swiss town of Schaffhausen. Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze brought a portion (approximately 8,000) of his force west, leaving the rest to defend the <b>Vorarlberg.</b> At the same time, Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, brought the left wing of the main Austrian force across the Rhine by Eglisau. They planned to unite with the main Austrian army, {{controlling}} the northern access points of Zürich and forcing an engagement with Masséna.|$|E
5|$|In 1487, Sigismund {{arranged}} {{the marriage of}} Frederick's daughter Kunigunde to duke Albert IV of Bavaria against her father's will, and he also signed away some of his territories in Tyrol and Further Austria to Albert IV. Frederick intervened by force: he founded the Swabian League in 1488, an alliance of the Swabian cities, the Swabian knights of the League of St. George's Shield and the counts of Württemberg and Tyrol and <b>Vorarlberg.</b> With their help, he forced the Wittelsbach house to return the territories signed over by Sigismund.|$|E
5|$|Mölders {{and members}} of JG 53 {{spent a couple of}} weeks of R skiing in the <b>Vorarlberg</b> before {{continuing}} operations against the RAF over the Channel and occupied France during early 1941. His new wingman from January 1941 was Oberleutnant Hartmann Grasser. Mölders claimed his first aerial victory after the lengthy vacation on 10 February 1941; his tally reached 60 on 26 February and stood at 68 when the Geschwader was recalled from the Channel front. His logbook showed 238 combat missions plus an additional 71 reconnaissance flights; he had engaged in aerial combat 70 times.|$|E

5|$|The Austrian Army and Archduke Charles, its commander-in-chief, had wintered {{with his}} {{army in the}} Bavarian, Austrian, and Salzburg territories {{on the eastern side}} of the Lech; his force alone {{numbered}} close to 80,000troops, and outnumbered the French force by three to one. An additional 26,000, commanded by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze, guarded the <b>Vorarlberg,</b> and further south, another 46,000, under command of Count Heinrich von Bellegarde, formed the defense of the Tyrol. The Austrians had already reached an agreement with Tsar Paul of Russia by which the legendary Alexander Suvorov would leave retirement to assist Austria in Italy with another 60,000troops.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian {{had been}} elected King of the Romans in 1486 on his father's initiative, {{and they had been}} ruling jointly since then. Upon the death of Frederick in 1493, Maximilian also took over his father's {{possessions}} and thus united the whole Habsburg territory in his hands. In the same year, the Peace of Senlis also marked the end of his wars against the French about his Burgundian possessions; he kept the territories in the Netherlands and also the County of Burgundy, but had to cede the Duchy of Burgundy to the French king. Maximilian controlled thus territories that nearly encircled the Old Swiss Confederacy: Tyrol and <b>Vorarlberg</b> in the east, Further Austria in the north, and the County of Burgundy in the west.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the <b>Vorarlberg.</b> Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|Feldkirch {{is one of}} <b>Vorarlberg's</b> {{major railway}} stations. It {{also serves as a}} loading station for the {{motorail}} train from Feldkirch to Vienna, Graz and Villach.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the <b>Vorarlberg,</b> resulting in additional losses.|$|E
5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} {{impatient}} with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested {{the timing was}} fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany. At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol.

5|$|Filming {{took place}} at the {{floating}} opera stage at Bregenz, Austria, from 28 April – 9 May 2008. The sequence in which Bond stalks the villains during a performance of Tosca required 1,500 extras. The production used a large model of an eye, which Forster felt fitted in the Bond style, and the opera itself has parallels to the film. A short driving sequence was filmed at the nearby Feldkirch, <b>Vorarlberg.</b> The crew returned to Italy from 13–17 May to shoot a (planned) car crash at the marble quarry in Carrara, and a recreation of the Palio di Siena at the Piazza del Campo in Siena. 1,000 extras were hired for a scene where Bond emerges from the Fonte Gaia. Originally, he would have emerged from the city's cisterns at Siena Cathedral, but this was thought disrespectful. By June the crew returned to Pinewood for four weeks, where new sets (including the interior of the hotel in the climax) were built. The wrap party was held on 21 June.|$|E
5000|$|The {{population}} of the Bregenz Forest earns a living from tourism, agriculture and trade that is strongly connected with the wood processing industry.

5000|$|Feldkirch {{has had its}} own {{local bus}} network since 1993, which {{currently}} consists of 8 lines including buses {{to the north of}} neighbouring Liechtenstein. The bus system works together with <b>Vorarlberg's</b> bus system which provides several supra-regional lines starting and ending in Feldkirch.There's an additional line called [...] "nightline" [...] which connects different bars and discos all around Feldkirch. The nightline plies till about 4 o'clock am on weekends.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, several NBZ {{candidates}} were included {{on a common}} list including five minor parties, including the Communist Party of Austria, Die Gsiberger (GSI). Gsiberger is <b>Vorarlberg's</b> inhabitants nickname given by other Austrians because of some peculiar expression in their Alemannic (not Austro-Bavarian as {{in other parts of}} Austria) dialect. The anticorruption Euro-MP Hans-Peter Martin supported this list [...] "in order to counter parties oligopoly". [...] "Die Gsiberger" [...] got 3,042 votes (1.74%) and no representative.|$|R
5|$|Hotze was sorely missed. Despite mis-communication {{between and}} among the British, the Austrians and the Russians, the British miscalculation {{of the size of}} troops (consistently 10–25percent higher than they {{actually}} were), the lack of Swiss volunteers, and failed promises of transport mules, Suvorov organized his impressive march across the Alps from northern Italy, counting on Korsakov and his Austrian allies to hold Zürich. His soldiers took the pass at St. Gotthard in a bayonet charge, and endured incredible hardships navigating the narrow trails of the Alps. By the time the Russian army reached Schwyz, preparing to descend from the mountains into the Zürich plain, Masséna's army already had crushed the incompetent Korsakov's force at Zürich, and, in Hotze's absence, Jean-de-Dieu Soult's French division overwhelmed the Austrian flank at Schänis and crossed the Linth unhindered. When Suvorov cleared the mountains, he had nowhere to go; he was forced to withdraw in another arduous march into the <b>Vorarlberg,</b> where his starving and ragged army arrived in late October. Between Korsakov's inability to hold the French at Zürich, and Hotze's death at Schänis, the Swiss campaign degenerated to an utter shambles.|$|E
5|$|In the empire, Frederick {{faced the}} {{opposition}} of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty and of his cousin Sigismund, who was duke in Tyrol, <b>Vorarlberg,</b> and Further Austria then. Sigismund had been {{in conflict with the}} Swiss Confederacy, too. When he had been banned by Pope Pius II in a conflict over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol, the Swiss had annexed the formerly Habsburg territories of the Thurgau. In 1468, Sigismund clashed with the Swiss in the War of Waldshut, which he could end without significant territorial losses only by paying a large ransom, which he financed by pawning territories in the Sundgau and the Alsace to Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1469. Charles did not, however, help Sigismund against the Swiss, and so Sigismund bought back the territories in 1474 and concluded a peace treaty with the Confederacy, the Ewige Richtung, although the emperor never recognized it. In the following Burgundy Wars, the Swiss and Sigismund both fought against Charles the Bold.|$|E
25|$|Other {{ski areas}} are St. Christoph, a hamlet {{where in the}} 14th century the {{shepherd}} Heinrich Findelkind built a hospice as a shelter for travellers crossing the Arlberg pass to the <b>Vorarlberg</b> province, Stuben, Lech, Zürs, Warth-Schröcken and Klösterle/Sonnenkopf.|$|E
50|$|Luger has {{received}} many honors throughout her career. While in Austria, she received the State of <b>Vorarlberg's</b> State Science Prize.

In 2003, she was named a Monfort Professor and awarded $75,000 a year for two years in research funds by the university. Two years later, Luger was appointed as an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. From 2008 to 2012, Luger sat on the National Institute of General Medical Sciences' advisory board.|$|R
5000|$|The {{creation}} of the Czecho-Slovak and South Slav states, {{the dissolution of the}} real union with Hungary, and the post-war treaties imposed by the victorious Allies combined to see the newly established Austrian republic both with the boundaries it has today, and a largely homogeneous German-speaking population. In the Treaty of Saint-Germain, in September 1919 the union with Germany was prohibited, and the new republic's name [...] "Deutschösterreich" [...] was prohibited by the treaty; instead the term [...] "Republic of Austria" [...] was used. The westernmost province <b>Vorarlberg's</b> wish to unite with Switzerland was also ignored. On October 21, 1919, the state changed its name accordingly. Many German Austrian communities were left scattered throughout the other new states, especially in Czechoslovakia, where more than 3 million German Bohemians had not been allowed {{to become part of the}} new Austrian state, as well as in the southern part of Tyrol which now found itself part of Italy. In total, more than 3.5 million German-speaking Austrians were forced to remain outside the Austrian state.The collapse of the empire caused an apparent struggle for some German Austrians between an [...] "Austrian" [...] and a [...] "German" [...] character. The idea of unifying Austria with Germany was motivated both by a sense of a common German national identity, and also by a fear that the new state, stripped of its one-time imperial possessions, and surrounded by potentially hostile nation-states, would not be economically viable. An Austrian identity emerged to some degree during the First Republic, and although Austria was still considered part of the [...] "German nation" [...] by most, Austrian patriotism was encouraged by the anti-Nazi/anti-Socialist clerico-authoritarianist state ideology known as Austrofascism from 1934-38. The Engelbert Dollfuss/Kurt von Schuschnigg government accepted that Austria was a [...] "German state" [...] and believed Austrians were [...] "better Germans", but strongly opposed the annexing of Austria to the Third Reich.|$|R
25|$|Nowotny {{grew up in}} Vienna, Austria during World War II. In interviews, she has {{recalled}} first {{wanting to}} become a scientist {{at the age of}} 8, when she was sent to <b>Vorarlberg,</b> the westernmost province of Austria, and quickly learned the local dialect.|$|E
25|$|Bavarians (ca. 10 million) {{form the}} Austro-Bavarian {{linguistic}} group, together with those Austrians who speak German {{and do not}} live in <b>Vorarlberg</b> and the western Tyrol district of Reutte.

25|$|Since 1726, Bregenz {{has been}} the main seat of Austrian {{administration}} in <b>Vorarlberg</b> (Obervogtei, in 1786 Kreisamt, since 1861 seat of the Landtag, since 1918 seat of the Landeshauptmann). Rieden-Vorkloster and Fluh were incorporated into Bregenz in 1919 and in 1946, respectively. The town was bombarded in 1945, and 72 houses were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} language is German; most speak an Alemannic dialect of German {{that is highly}} divergent from Standard German but closely related to those dialects spoken in neighbouring regions such as Switzerland and <b>Vorarlberg,</b> Austria. In Triesenberg, a dialect promoted by the municipality is spoken. However, Swiss Standard German is understood and spoken by most people within the country.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of Austrian elections, there were {{different}} ballots in all nine states (in 2002 there were three different ballots, in 2006 there were seven). The ballots featured parliamentary parties in the order of votes they received in the last election, i.e. SPÖ, ÖVP, Greens, FPÖ, BZÖ. The extraparliamentary parties were listed in the order in which they submitted their state candidate lists, and this order was different in all nine states; Dinkhauser, for instance, wanted the FRITZ to be the last on the ballot in all nine states, but the Left (in Burgenland and Tyrol) and the Christians (in Salzburg) submitted their lists after he did. The longest ballots could be found in Carinthia and Vienna, which broke the previous record of eleven lists (<b>Vorarlberg,</b> 1994) with twelve lists. Burgenland, Salzburg, Tyrol and Upper Austria had eleven lists, and Lower Austria, Styria and <b>Vorarlberg</b> had only the ten national lists on the ballot.|$|E
25|$|The canton {{is located}} in the north east of Switzerland. It is bounded to the north by Lake Constance (Bodensee). To the east lies the Rhine valley. Over the Rhine are Austria (state of <b>Vorarlberg)</b> and Liechtenstein. To the south, the canton of St. Gallen is bounded by the cantons of Graubünden, Glarus and Schwyz. To the west lie the cantons of Zürich and Thurgau.|$|E
25|$|One {{potential}} {{result of}} World War I was {{an expansion of}} Switzerland itself during the Interwar period. In a referendum held in the Austrian state of <b>Vorarlberg</b> on May 11, 1920 over 80% of those voting supported a proposal that the state join the Swiss Confederation. However, this was prevented by the opposition of the Austrian Government, the Allies, Swiss liberals, the Swiss-Italians and the Swiss-French.|$|E
25|$|His actions {{during the}} {{nationwide}} strike, his advancement {{of membership in}} the League of Nations, and his weak position in the <b>Vorarlberg</b> question resulted in a meager count of votes for Calonder's reconfirmation by the Federal Assembly in December 1919. He asked for sick leave five days later, and announced his resignation on January 21, 1920. The Federal Assembly officially approved his request on February 12, 1920, and elected Heinrich Häberlin as his successor.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} it was obvious to the French Directory that war was {{imminent}} and 200,000 conscripts were called up. Aside from Bonaparte's forces in Egypt, the French were divided into five poorly-equipped armies. Masséna was in Switzerland with 30,000 men, Brune defended Holland with over 20,000 soldiers, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan held Alsace with 37,000 troops, Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer had 58,000 men in northern Italy and Jacques MacDonald (who succeeded Championnet) counted 30,000 soldiers in central and southern Italy. In addition, there was a reserve force commanded by Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte threatening Mannheim and Philippsburg. The Directory ordered Masséna to seize the <b>Vorarlberg</b> and Graubünden (Grisons, Rhätien) and advance on the County of Tyrol. Jourdan was instructed to cross the Rhine River, transit the Black Forest and link its right wing with Masséna's left. Schérer was directed to link with Masséna's right while resisting the Austrians near Verona. The Austrians had 75,000 men in northern Italy under Paul Kray, 18,000 troops in the Tyrol led by Count Heinrich von Bellegarde, 26,000 soldiers in the <b>Vorarlberg</b> and Graubünden under Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze and 80,000 men led by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen on the Lech River in southern Germany.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, Archduke John of Austria was assigned to command the army in the Tyrol and the <b>Vorarlberg.</b> He was directed to detach forces under Franz Jellacic and Franz Xavier von Auffenberg to the Danube army. Auffenberg's division was mauled at the Battle of Wertingen and later surrendered at the Battle of Ulm. Jellacic was required to guard the south flank of the Danube army near Lake Constance. Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps ran him to earth in the <b>Vorarlberg.</b> Jellacic surrendered with his infantry on 14 November in the Capitulation of Dornbirn, his cavalry having gotten away. Another brigade of the Tyrol army under Prince Louis Victor Rohan-Guéméné became separated in the retreat and slipped away to the south where it made a dash for Venice. On 24 November Rohan's 4,400 troops were caught between the divisions of Jean Reynier and Saint-Cyr at the Battle of Castelfranco Veneto and forced to surrender. John managed to escape to the east with about 20,000 soldiers and fought a successful rear guard action against Nicolas Bernard Guiot de Lacour's dragoons near the upper Isonzo at Bovec on 19 November 1805.|$|E
25|$|By car, St. Anton {{is easily}} reached, {{making use of}} the A14 motorway, which runs from <b>Vorarlberg</b> (Austria's westernmost state, which borders Lichtenstein and Switzerland) and then follows {{the spine of the}} Tyrol. Alternatively, St. Anton, Langen am Arlberg and Kloesterle (all located in the Arlberg ski region) have railway stations. Both St. Anton and Langen am Arlberg are stops on {{international}} train services between Zuerich and Budapest, making it easy to reach the ski area from across the continent.|$|E
25|$|A 'core' {{territory}} {{had finally}} been established. The land contained the remnant of many prior civilisations, but the Bavarians predominated, {{except in the}} Lake Constance area to the west occupied by the Alemanni (<b>Vorarlberg).</b> Pockets of the Celto-Romanic population (Walchen or Welsche) persisted, such as around Salzburg, and Roman place names persisted, such as Juvavum (Salzburg). In addition this population was distinguished by Christianity and by their language, a Latin dialect (Romansch). Salzburg was already a bishopric (739), and by 798 an archbishopric.|$|E
