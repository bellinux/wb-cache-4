30|$|If the {{surveyed}} establishment {{assesses the}} technical standard of its {{plant and machinery}} as superior to that of its competitors, the demand for new apprentices is higher, {{to a large extent}} decreasing the demand for already-qualified workers with IVET degrees. A possible explanation for this result is that the superior technical standard of a company’s plant and machinery is often rooted in specific characteristics of that particular company. In this case, it makes less sense to recruit vocationally qualified skilled workers to operate the machinery because the company’s own apprentices can be trained at low cost in all company-specific work content during their comparatively low-paid IVET phase. Furthermore, due to their specific knowledge base, a component of their training cannot be transferred to another company. This non-transferable training allows the training company to potentially pay its newly qualified graduates of in-house IVET a wage lower than their individual productivity and thereby amortise initial <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

From the outset, the Dahir (royal decree) to begin {{the commission}} was unprecedented and very well looked upon.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Continuing <b>Vocational</b> <b>Training</b> Survey, 2010 (CVTS 4) aimed to assess the provision of continuing <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> (CVT) in businesses {{in terms of the}} types of training offered, the numbers of employees being given <b>training,</b> the <b>costs</b> of <b>training</b> provision, and its management and delivery. Initial <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> (IVT) such as that specifically designed for apprentices / trainees, or for inductions, was also covered in a separate section. The scope of CVTS 4 was enterprises employing ten or more people and it measured the training provided to employees other than apprentices and recognised trainees. In total 4, 604 enterprises of varying sizes were represented in the survey. Participants in the survey were Personnel Managers, Personnel Directors and other senior persons with responsibility for training for their enterprise. The survey in the UK is part of a pan-European investigation across EU nations and is the fourth in a series undertaken at half-decade intervals. The survey mainly concerns the <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> undertaken by those employers in the 'reference year' of 2010 (previous reference years of earlier editions of the survey having been 1995, 2000, and 2005). The Statistical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat) undertook co-ordination of the study. The data available at the UKDA cover the UK only. Main Topics : Topics covered include: employer's provision of different types of continuing <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> participation by different groups of employees in different types of continuing <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> training policies and management processes quality assurance with regard to continuing <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> barriers to providing continuing <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> provision and participation in initial <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <br...|$|R

30|$|The German <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> {{system is}} {{characterized}} by a relatively high degree of standardization and occupational specificity, which—in general—is associated with structured and smooth education-to-work-transitions (Allmendinger 1989; Shavit and Müller 2000). Graduating from <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> in Germany therefore is highly attractive as it usually results in good employment opportunities and high chances of a direct entry into a stable position within the training company (Bol and Weeden 2015; Kerckhoff 2000; Soskice 1994; Wolbers 2007). For this reason an increasing proportion of general upper secondary education graduates, who already fulfil the entry requirements for higher education, choose <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> instead of higher education (Jacob 2004; Büchel and Helberger 1995, Pilz 2009). <b>Vocational</b> <b>training</b> and higher education in Germany, however, are not preclusive {{and a growing number of}} young adults enter higher education after <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> (Hillmert and Jacob 2004; Jacob 2004).
