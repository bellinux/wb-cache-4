Recently, it has become a subject of interest to detect influential observations in these stages. Choi and Tanaka(1999) have derived influence functions in the above three stages and have proposed sensitivity analysis procedure. So far influence functions have only been derived for <b>variograms</b> by Gunst and Hartfield(1996).

5000|$|The <b>variogram</b> {{is the key}} {{function}} in geostatistics as {{it will be used}} to fit a model of the temporal/spatial correlation of the observed phenomenon. One is thus making a distinction between the experimental <b>variogram</b> that is a visualisation of a possible spatial/temporal correlation and the <b>variogram</b> model that is further used to define the weights of the kriging function. Note that the experimental <b>variogram</b> is an empirical estimate of the covariance of a Gaussian process. As such, it may not be positive definite and hence not directly usable in kriging, without constraints or further processing. This explains why {{only a limited number of}} <b>variogram</b> models are used: most commonly, the linear, the spherical, the Gaussian and the exponential models.|$|E

Additionally, unprecedented information on patterns in chlorophyll (CHL) and suspended particulate matter (SPM, also known as total suspended matter TSM) concentrations in coastal and marine ecosystems can be discerned from long-term hyperspectral data from ocean colour sensors. <b>Variograms</b> extracted from a dataset of 287 TSM and 287 CHL Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) products from September 1997 until December 2004 were analysed to characterise CHL and TSM patterns in the North Sea. In this paper, the spatial variability in optical characteristics of the North Sea is demonstrated by examples of CHL and TSM quicklooks and <b>variograms</b> for both individual images and seasonal composites, which were made to capture persistent patterns and overcome cloud cover.

30|$|Once the facies and the {{associated}} diagenesis imprint models are built, the facies is populated with porosity and permeability properties. Then, it is inputted into a fluid flow simulator to calculate dynamic flow responses that {{can be compared to}} the actual production data. The least-square differences between data and synthetic responses yield the objective function. The purpose of history matching consists in adjusting the unknown parameters everywhere to minimize the objective function: when generating facies (spatial distributions, <b>variograms</b> and proportions), when distributing the diagenetic phases (spatial distributions, <b>variograms</b> and proportions), when generating the petrophysical properties (spatial distributions, <b>variograms</b> and means) and when simulating fluid flow (aquifer strength, fault transmissivities, PVT, etc.). The optimization process applied in this paper is presented {{in the second part of}} this section. For simplicity, we focus on the parameters related to the simulation of the diagenetic phases.

Such models allow not only estimating values at nondata locations but also prediction in future times, hence, they are useful for analyzing air pollution data, meteorological data, or ground water data. These three kinds of data are nearly always multivariate and because the processes determining the deposition or dynamics will affect all variates, a multivariate approach is desirable. It is shown that the use of marginal <b>variograms</b> for space–time modeling can be extended to the multivariate case and in particular to the use of the Linear Coregionalization Model (LCM) for cokriging in space–time.
