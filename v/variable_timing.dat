25|$|The Boarhound, {{designed}} by Captain Frank Barnwell, was a two-bay biplane which used {{a method of}} steel construction which involved high-tensile steel strips, rolled into cusped and flanged sections, which were riveted together to form longerons and struts. The resulting structure was lighter, stronger and cheaper than one made from drawn tubes. It had a deep fuselage allowing bulky radio and camera equipment to be carried, and was powered by a Bristol Jupiter IV engine with <b>variable</b> <b>timing.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the development of}} a fully continuous, hydraulics-based <b>variable</b> valve <b>timing</b> system. This hydraulics based <b>variable</b> valve <b>timing</b> system is capable of controlling an engine valves lift height and infinitely varying the engine valves lift profile. Along with full valve controllability during normal operation, the <b>variable</b> valve <b>timing</b> system is capable of providing the same operation as a classic cam shaft under engine power loss conditions. This is possible due to the rotating hydraulic spool valves coupled to the engines crank shaft, which are used to actuate the engine poppet valves. The main focus of this thesis is to investigate, alter and implement a new iteration of the hydraulic <b>variable</b> valve <b>timing</b> system on a standalone test bench to validate the systems operating principles. The test bench utilizes servo motors to act as an engines crank shaft which runs the rotating hydraulic spool valves and hydraulic pump. This serves as an intermediate step to full engine implementation of the <b>variable</b> valve <b>timing</b> system. The research begins by analyzing the current mechanical spool valve and hydraulic cylinder design for any potential problems that may occur either during assembly or full operation. The basic system equations are presented to give a glimpse into the working principles of the rotary valves. The mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic subsystems are discussed in terms of what was considered during the design and implementation process. Then design changes that were performed on the rotary valve system to overcome any failures. Lastly the resulting data is presented from the current <b>variable</b> valve <b>timing</b> design to verify proper system functionality...|$|R
