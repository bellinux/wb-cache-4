50|$|For {{all of his}} bumbling antics, the Sultan {{was forced}} to abdicate for his failed administration, and was exiled. The scene shifts from the Istanbul harbour back to the wheat fields of Thessalonica, as the boy Mustafa recovers from his coma. He gets up and runs off beating a can with a stick, as a <b>voice-over</b> of <b>one</b> of his future speeches plays in the background.|$|R
50|$|Padhye also {{presented}} the 150-year-old puppets originally created by pioneer Indian dramatist Vishnudas Bhave. The antique puppets were resurrected after 20 years' research {{by his father}} Ramdas. The next episode opened with this puppet show, scripted by his mother, Aparna Padhye. Aparna, a singer and puppeteer, originally scripted the show presented at the Nehru Centre in 2000. It was presented by Satyajit {{and his team of}} trained puppeteers on Kaun Banega Crorepati. Bachchan was the <b>voice-over</b> for <b>one</b> of the leading puppet characters.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1986, CBS adapted a {{theme that}} has affectionately been {{referred}} to as the Pots and Pans (because of the background notes often resembled the banging of pots and pans) theme. This particular theme was an intense, kinetic, synthesizer-laced theme. In 1989, the Pots and Pans theme was revamped to give it a more smooth, electronic style. This theme was also known for integrating the play-by-play announcer's voice-over introduction into the theme, it integrated three <b>voice-over</b> segments, <b>one</b> for the visiting team, home team, and game storyline to set the game storyline into the broadcast. This practice was common with CBS Sports themes of the 1980s.|$|R

5000|$|Beginning in Week 4 of the 1986 season, CBS adapted a {{theme for}} its game broadcast, an intense, kinetic, synthesizer-laced theme that has affectionately been {{referred}} to as [...] "Pots and Pans" [...] (because of the background notes that often resembled the banging of those particular cooking objects). In 1989, the [...] "Pots and Pans" [...] theme was revamped to give it a more smooth, electronic style. This theme was also known for integrating the play-by-play announcer's voice-over introduction into the theme, it integrated three <b>voice-over</b> segments, <b>one</b> for the visiting team, home team and game storyline to set the latter element into the broadcast; this practice was common with CBS Sports' themes of the 1980s.|$|R

2500|$|The {{autonomous}} {{nature of}} Section One allowed {{the writers of}} this series freedom to explore areas not usually associated with this genre on television. Nikita's <b>voice-over</b> in Season <b>One</b> establishes the Machiavellian motif of Section One. While founded as a counterterrorism organization (traditionally represented within fiction as good), Section One uses (as a standard) immoral means to achieve its objectives, while still citing efficiency and [...] "service of the greater good" [...] as justification for its actions. Its standardized implementation of draconian measures includes the use (upon both terrorist and innocent) of intimidation, torture ("The White Room"), murder ("cancellation"), assassination, abduction, suicide operatives ("abeyance" [...] operatives), false imprisonment, and terrorist co-operation. In one early episode, for example, in exchange for crucial information Section One hands a woman over to a sadist knowing she will be carved up.|$|R
5000|$|James Poniewozik of TIME {{magazine}} {{said the}} use of <b>voice-over</b> [...] "undercuts <b>one</b> of Mad Men’s greatest strengths, which is its use of irony and understatement to show how characters' words and actions often belie their real thoughts and meaning." [...] Poniewozik also noted: [...] "As we get farther into what we usually think of in pop-culture terms as 'the ’60s,' it gets harder even for a show as brilliant as Mad Men to avoid overfamiliar takes", singling out the scene where Don watches Vietnam War news reports. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said, [...] "'The Summer Man' is an episode I expect I'm {{going to need to}} revisit a time or 20 before I decide how I ultimately feel about some of its stylistic departures from the Mad Men norm", referring to {{the use of}} voice-over and the camera effect of Don's pulling away from the office when he isn't drinking. The Huffington Post writer William Bradley called the episode, [...] "another very fine and very consequential episode of Mad Men".|$|R
5000|$|Azaria {{became famous}} for his voice work in the ongoing {{animated}} television series The Simpsons. He joined the show having previously performed only <b>one</b> <b>voice-over</b> - as the titular animated dog in the failed Fox pilot Hollywood Dog, a show he described as [...] "sort of Roger Rabbit-esque, where the dog was animated, but everybody else was real." [...] The first voice he performed on The Simpsons was that of town bartender Moe Szyslak, replacing Christopher Collins who had initially recorded the character's voice. Having known him from Hollywood Dog, casting director Bonita Pietila called Azaria {{and asked him to}} audition for the voice of Moe. At the time he was performing the role of a drug dealer in a play, utilizing a voice based on actor Al Pacino's performance in the film Dog Day Afternoon. He used the voice in his audition for The Simpsons and, {{at the request of the}} show's executive producers Matt Groening and Sam Simon, made the voice more [...] "gravelly". Groening and Simon thought the resultant voice was ideal for Moe and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio. Before he had even seen a script, he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", dubbing Collins' voice.|$|R
5000|$|To a large extent, today fanzines {{have been}} {{replaced}} by websites, podcasts and discussion boards, but a few do still exist. Many of them are published by fan clubs including the DWAS zine Celestial Toyroom, (which was launched in 1976 and has been published continuously since then, making it the oldest surviving Doctor Who fanzine in the world, the New Zealand Doctor Who Fan Club zine Time-Space Visualiser (TSV) which has been in existence since 1987, the DWIN fanzine Enlightenment which has been published six times a year since 1983, and Data Extract launched by the Doctor Who Club of Australia in 1980. Other individuals and groups still produce fanzines. Black Scrolls was the first prozine to offer a multimedia CDROM on its cover in 2005, featuring interviews with actors, Who-related art, a back issue archive and an alternative <b>voice-over</b> commentary for <b>one</b> of the episodes and the distinction of being professionally printed and entirely in colour which was a modest success that ran for eight issues between 1993 and 2005. Doctor Who Fanzines FANWNAK and Vworp! Vworp! are among the full colour A4, printed fanzines available today, as well as others such as Panic Moon, The Finished Product which are smaller sizes and black and white. Many fanzines still take the time-honoured route of printing and distributing their zine by mail, but many now distribute their fanzine as downloadable and printable PDFs such as Planet of the Ming Mongs and [...] "The Terrible Zodin", finally removing what was often the main cause for a fanzine's closure, the cost of printing and distribution - but in so doing also losing the appeal of a unique hardcopy publication, and therefore the only true identifier of a 'fanzine'. It's likely that as this trend increases new terminology will replace the term fanzine, which is already archaic and out-of-place in online contexts.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{begins with}} the camera panning through {{pictures}} of Medusa's album covers and film posters eventually showing her lying in a bed while getting a massage and her hair done. She starts telling the viewers about how lonely she feels since her tour ended. The film then flashes back to when Medusa was rehearsing her [...] "Blonde Leading the Blonde Tour". After being crushed by a giant genitalia statue, Medusa explains in a voice-over how the tour was a technical nightmare. Eventually, the tour begins in the Philippines, only for Medusa {{to find out that}} she was performing during the eruption of a volcano. In an interview, Medusa's manager Benny explains how Medusa's first single [...] "Like a Video" [...] ("Like a Virgin") was a hit for MTV, leading into a parody performance of Madonna's [...] "Blond Ambition" [...] version. After that, Medusa is shown talking to her boyfriend. The tour then moves to Japan where Medusa tells her poverty stricken dancers that they'll be receiving a pay cut. Another shows women protesting Medusa and her director showing how Medusa gained the inspiration to shoot a music video involving robbing a store. Finally, the tour moves to the U.S where Medusa and her dancers play a game of Truth or Dare. After that, she is shown being at a party where a director who tries to get her to star in a movie similar to [...] "Heidi". Later, while Medusa is listing negative things about people, Bobcat Goldthwait shows up and gets offended when he sees Medusa gag after he called her show [...] "neat". After that, Medusa is shown reciting lines from [...] "Romeo and Juliet [...] " [...] while a voice-over explains that Medusa is planning to star in the Broadway show after the tour, and that her ex- husband Shane Pencil was helping her, but Shane gets fed up with Medusa and he leaves. Another <b>voice-over</b> during <b>one</b> of Medusa's show explains her she almost died during [...] "Expose Yourself" [...] ("Express Yourself") as she got electrocuted. After that, Medusa is shown visiting her dog's grave, only to find out she was at the wrong grave. While in Atlanta, Police Officers show up and explain that Medusa will be arrested if she shows her [...] "muffin". Medusa performs [...] "Party in My Pants" [...] and [...] "Vague" [...] ( [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Into the Groove", and [...] "Vogue"). Medusa then goes to the officers to get arrested only for them to ask her for an autograph. Finally, the tour finishes in New York and while Medusa is saying goodbye to the dancers, it is revealed that Medusa was viewing the footage while trying to find an ending. She ends up in the hospital to get a toy dino removed while a montage of clips plays with [...] "Life May End" [...] ( [...] "Live to Tell") [...] The dancers come to visit her, and the film ends with them trying to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the series}} progressed, realistic-looking {{commercials}} were aired for fictional products (such as [...] "Sitagin Hemorrhoid Remedy", [...] "Nasotine Sinus Relief", [...] "TresCafe Coffee", etc.) {{and even a}} few with celebrities (such as Lyle Alzado promoting a snack called [...] "Pigskins", and Ted Nugent doing an ad for a Mexican food chain called [...] "Cucaracha") only to have the Bunny march through, beating his drum, because he was [...] "still going". Eventually real-life products and icons would do a crossover with the Energizer Bunny (i.e. Michael J. Fox doing a Pepsi ad, and the opening of TV shows such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents and ABC's Wide World of Sports). To date, the Energizer Bunny has appeared in more than 115 television commercials. In these commercials, a <b>voice-over</b> would announce <b>one</b> of various slogans used throughout the years; all of them would relate the stalwartness of the Energizer Bunny to the long-lasting power of their batteries. The original slogan boasted that [...] "...nothing outlasts the Energizer...", but it was eventually changed after a lawsuit filed by Duracell disputing Energizer's claim. Those commercials with the bunny interrupting all the action in a commercial were eventually spoofed in the 1993 film Hot Shots! Part Deux, featuring a blue animal drumming through instead of the pink bunny. The two people fighting then used their guns to shoot the blue animal, causing the blue animal to explode. In 1993 through 1995, Energizer ran a series of commercials featuring a fake rival battery, [...] "Supervolt" [...] (including a Supervolt weasel mascot), which was an obvious lookalike of Duracell. In many of the later commercials, film villains (such as Darth Vader, the Grim Reaper, the Wicked Witch of the West, King Kong, Wile E. Coyote, and Boris and Natasha) would try to destroy or capture the Bunny only to see complications arise when their devices using Supervolt batteries ran out, the villains themselves collapsed from exhaustion, or other circumstances allowed for the mascot's escape (i.e. the sun coming out to kill Dracula before he could seek shelter, the Grim Reaper sees the bunny in a dance party and grunts as he prepares to leave a house on a boat, the Supervolt batteries in the main weapon of the beholder (Vader's lightsaber, Coyote's inventions, etc.) go dead before the bunny is stopped or a fire sprinkler (the smoke detector was presumably operated by Energizer batteries) being inadvertently triggered leading to the Wicked Witch melting, or Boris and Natasha attempting to shrink the Bunny, but inadvertently end up shrinking themselves (and they try to escape the Bunny, who is now massive to them). The second one showed the quality of the product being advertised when it created complications for the villain-so as not to boast that Energizer was better than any other brand, as well as to encourage people to buy Energizer batteries for their smoke detectors.|$|R
