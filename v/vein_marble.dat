50|$|The Lexington federal {{building}} has two ornamental, oval-shaped entry lobbies at {{the southeast and}} southwest entries. The southeast entry lobby houses the grand staircase, and the southwest lobby the passenger elevators. These oval lobbies originally opened onto the public lobby and, by extension, to the postal lobby of the first floor. The current postal lobby was sealed-off via aluminum doors and the finishes have been completely altered from the original appearance. The southwest (main) entry lobby is an oval-shaped space. The rounded walls are clad with full height polished St. Genevieve Golden <b>Vein</b> <b>marble.</b> The floors are buff terrazzo with brass divider strips and a Westfield Green marble border and base. The panel ceilings are painted plaster with a painted plaster cornice ornamented with a triglyph motif. The elevators are set back in the marble and the original elevator doors are decorative bronze with cast bronze panels featuring an urn motif in the center. The decorative lintels feature egg and dart, dentil and scroll patterns with a modified keystone directly over the elevator doors. The southeast oval-shaped entry lobby contains the main staircase of the building. The finishes of this lobby {{are the same as}} the southwest with a couple of exceptions. The main staircase curves into the lobby at the north wall. The stair treads are fine sand-rubbed Appalachian Golden Vein marble; the risers, and stair and wall stringers are polished Appalachian Golden <b>Vein</b> <b>marble.</b> The public lobby is 120' long. The floors are buff terrazzo with Westfield Green marble border and base. The walls are punctuated by a series of marble engaged pilasters supporting a polychrome crown mold band with triglyphs. Between the pilasters is wainscot of polished St. Genevieve Golden <b>Vein</b> <b>marble</b> to a height of 3'.|$|E

Again, this piece revolves around ambiguities and unexplained aspects on Michelangelo's part.

The most common rocks are white marbles with lenses and layers of metabasites and small amounts of phyllites. The metabasites, having transition to marble, are exposed both {{on the left and}} right sides of the Šugov valley. Relatively large exposure of metabasites and marble occur on the left slope, where σ- or δ-type clasts of primary lapilli of basaltic composition, mantled in carbonate matrix can be also observed. Besides blue amphibole of glaucophane composition, metabasites contain albite, epidote, phengite, titanite and rarely also garnet, paragonite and Napyroxene. At contact with marble, they may contain actinolite. Blue amphibole is zoned with purple-blue core rich in Fe 3 + and pale-blue rim rich in Al. Na-pyroxene occurs in some coarse-grained unfoliated metabasites and it is mostly aegirine in composition. Maximum jadeite content found in pyroxene from this locality is 53 mol %.

In 1518 Frasco and Sonogno separated from the parish of Vogorno and formed their own parish, which lasted until it divided again in 1734. For centuries, the inhabitants lived on agriculture and alpine seasonal migrations with livestock. Starting in 1870, the Val d'Efra, a <b>vein</b> of white <b>marble,</b> was exploited for limestone quarries. In 2000, the agricultural sector was the only sector providing jobs in Frasco, while about two-thirds of the workers were commuters.

More recently, however, many houses have been built in the municipality.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Madsan {{antimony}} deposit at {{the southeastern}} {{part of the}} Niğde province (south-central Turkey) includes a series of epithermal <b>veins</b> hosted by <b>marbles</b> and gneisses. The veins have a simple mineralogy of quartz, calcite, stibnite and pyrite as major constituents, and cinnabar occurs in trace amounts. The deposit experienced a progressive deformation evidenced {{by a set of}} textures developed especially in stibnite and pyrite. These are pressure lamellae and annealing as the main textures, and curvature, off-set of pressure lamellae and fracture filling as the textures of minor importance. These were developed in three successive deformation phases. Pressure lamellae represent the first stage of deformation in the region, while the second stage of deformation is represented by curved pressure lamellae and annealing texture, and the third stage of deformation is characterised by truncation and offset of pressure lamellae. The deformations probably occurred at temperatures reaching 180 °C and at pressures about 0. 2 MPa. Geological evidence supports that the first phase of deformation is explained by the southward thrusting of the Niğde Massif over the Ulukışla Basin. The second phase of deformation is due to an increase in internal compression within the stibnites after the firs...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} will {{exploit the}} potential of contemporary graphic systems in order to study the different methods used to represent Comatesque floor mosaics.

These floors were created not only by repeating predetermined symmetries and proportional ratios, but also by exploiting available materials {{and the size of}} the space to be covered; hence, not rigid patterns, but solutions that were always different. Throughout the ages Comatesque mosaics have been represented primarily as monochromatic, or by using traditional colour techniques such as watercolours and tempera since these techniques make it possible to record the <b>veins</b> of the <b>marbles</b> and chromatic irregularities, making them instantly recognisable. The contribution will assess and illustrate both the potential and critical aspects of black and white representation as well as the sometimes more comprehensive representations that use a greyscale.

You will now find that the contrast in the sunshine appears {{about the same as}} in the shade--the red and white rising and falling together, and dying away together into the darkness. The fact, however, is, that the contrast does actually for some time increase towards the light; for in utter darkness the distinction is not visible--the red cannot be distinguished from the white; admit a little light, and the contrast is feebly discernible; admit more, it is distinctly discernible. But you cannot increase the contrast beyond a certain point. From that point the red and white for some time rise very nearly equally in light, or fall together very nearly equally in shade; but the contrast will begin to diminish in very high lights, for strong sunlight has a tendency to exhibit particles of dust, or any sparkling texture in the local color, and then to diminish its power; so that in order to see local color well, a certain degree of shadow is necessary: for instance, a very delicate complexion is not well seen in the sun; and the <b>veins</b> of a <b>marble</b> pillar, or the colors of a picture, can only be properly seen in comparative shade.|$|R
40|$|Late-tectonic pegmatitic, aplitic {{and graphic}} granites intrude {{metasedimentary}} {{units of the}} Grenville Supergroup, Composite Arc Belt, in the Renfrew area of southeastern Ontario. Zoned molybdenite-bearing skarns occur at the contact of graphic pegmatites with mixed calcite–dolomite marble, para-amphibolite and gneiss at the Zenith molybdenite deposit. Distal skarns also are found, {{in the form of}} discordant <b>veins</b> within foliated <b>marble.</b> Mineral zoning in the skarn consists of diopside–microcline endoskarn plus exoskarn that grades, away from the intrusion, from a diopside-dominant to a tremolite-dominant metasomatic rock. Textural evidence indicates that tremolite was an earlier-formed skarn mineral in the diopside zone. Diopside is absent in the tremolite zone. These patterns are repeated in other similar occurrences of skarn in the area. Apatite grains formed during metasomatism contain primary high-salinity (‡ 30 wt. % NaCl eq.) liquid-rich fluid inclusions coexisting, along growth zones, with vapor-rich inclusions, indicative of the trapping of an immiscible fluid. The observed parageneses are interpreted to reflect metasomatic replacement of marble by infiltration of a silica-rich orthomagmatic fluid that evolved by the crystallization of the granitic pegmatite, at approximately 600 ° C and 300 MPa. Such conditions are not inconsistent with phase separation of the aqueous fluid, because the salinity of the fluid is known to drastically raise the critical temperature of the H 2 O–CO 2 miscibility gap. A decrease in temperature or in the chemical potential of silica in skarn furthest from the granites (or both) may account for formation of the tremolite zone. The Mo likely was transported in the metasomatic fluid as alkali oxyacidic complexes. A decreas...|$|R

Locally it contains elevated Fe, Sn, Zr and F contents. Negative correlations of Al + F with R 4 + and Al + (Nb 5 +, Ta 5 +) with R 4 + accompanied by low contents of Na in titanite correspond to the substitutions Al(OH,F) (TiO) - 1 and Al(Nb,Ta) Ti - 2.

40|$|The geological, geo-mechanical and {{numerical}} studies {{carried out}} for the static design of the underground exploitation cavern of the Cava Madre of Candoglia (VCO, Italy) are presented and discussed in the paper. This underground cavern was constructed for the mining exploitation of a large sub-vertical <b>vein</b> of pink <b>marble</b> that was necessary {{for the construction of}} Milan Cathedral. This marble orebody was gifted to the Milan Cardinal by the Duke Gian Galeazzo Visconti in the 1387 and the exploitation is today active (only in the underground cavern and no more in open pits) since it is necessary to provide the marble (slabs, blocks for the statues, etc.) for the cathedral maintenance. The cavern started from the mountain side and entered sub-horizontally inside the mountain for a length of about 50 m. Now the cavern has a width of more than 20 m and a variable height that, in the portal area, is of about 40 m. Due to a stability problem of the cavern wall that occurred more than ten years ago in the deepest portion of the cavern, it was decided to restart the exploitation works in the portal area where detailed "geo" investigations have discovered a large portion of very good marble. To permit a safe extraction of this new portion of the orebody it was necessary to develop both side investigations and numerical computations. Three dimensional and two dimensional FLAC models were developed to understand the static conditions of the cavern in the present situation and after the development of the forecasted exploitation. Thanks to a very good monitoring of the cavern during the years it was also possible to carry out a detailed back analysis that permitted to validate the quality of the numerical results. Before carrying out the new mining works it was necessary to demolish several reinforced concreted beams that were built up in the seventies and that were not able to fulfil the displacements induced by the new excavations as shown by the numerical model results. The design of the new beams with a larger cross section than the previous ones is discussed in the paper together with the numerical model results after the development of the new excavation...|$|R
