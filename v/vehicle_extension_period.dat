40|$|Objectives: SB 4 (Benepali, Brenzys) is a biosimilar of {{reference}} etanercept (ETN). In a randomised, double-blind, 52 -week study, SB 4 demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to ETN {{in patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The open-label <b>extension</b> <b>period</b> evaluated long-term efficacy, safety and immunogenicity when continuing SB 4 versus switching from ETN to SB 4. Methods: In the randomised, double-blind phase, patients received weekly subcutaneous administration of 50 [*]mg SB 4 or ETN with background methotrexate for up to 52 weeks. Patients in the Czech Republic and Poland who completed the 52 -week visit {{were enrolled in the}} open-label <b>extension</b> <b>period</b> and received SB 4 for 48 additional weeks. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were assessed up to week 100. Results: Of 245 patients entering the <b>extension</b> <b>period,</b> 126 continued to receive SB 4 (SB 4 /SB 4) and 119 switched to SB 4 (ETN/SB 4). American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates were sustained and comparable between SB 4 /SB 4 and ETN/SB 4 with ACR 20 response rates at week 100 of 77. 9 % and 79. 1 %, respectively. Other efficacy results, including radiographic progression, were also comparable between the groups. After week 52, rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were 47. 6 % (SB 4 /SB 4) and 48. 7 % (ETN/SB 4); one patient/group developed non-neutralising antidrug antibodies. No cases of active tuberculosis or injection-site reactions were reported during the <b>extension</b> <b>period.</b> One patient (SB 4 /SB 4) died of hepatic cancer. Conclusions: SB 4 was effective and well tolerated over 2 years in patients with RA. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were comparable between the SB 4 /SB 4 and ETN/SB 4 groups, showing no risk associated with switching patients from ETN to SB 4...|$|R

40|$|Across the U. S, walking {{trips are}} increasing. However, {{pedestrians}} still face significantly higher delays than motor vehicles at signalized intersections due to traditional signal timing practices of prioritizing vehicular movements. This study explores pedestrian delay reduction methods via {{development of a}} pedestrian priority algorithm that selects an operational plan favorable to pedestrian service, provided a user defined volume threshold has been met for the major street. This algorithm, along with several operational scenarios, were analyzed with VISSIM using Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulation to determine the impact these strategies have on user delays. One of the operational scenarios examined was that of actuating {{a portion of the}} coordinated phase, or actuated-coordinated operation. Following a discussion on platoon dispersion and the application of it in the design of actuated-coordinated signal timing parameters, a sensitivity analysis was performed on <b>vehicle</b> <b>extension</b> timers to explore the impact that this coordinated movement parameter has on user delay. In the scenario analysis, it was shown that employing fully actuated (also known as Free) operation, either with the designed algorithm or without was an effective method of reducing minor street pedestrian delay while also decreasing average intersection vehicle delay for the volumes used in the simulation. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>extension</b> sensitivity analysis showed that shortening the extension timer of an actuated-coordinated phase can reduce the minor street pedestrian delay without increasing overall vehicle delay, which could be a tool used by agencies while in coordinated operation to prioritize pedestrians.

Both algorithms join cubic Bézier curve segments smoothly to generate the path. Additionally, we discuss the constrained optimization problem that optimizes the resulting path for user-defined cost function. The simulation shows the generation of successful routes for autonomous vehicles using these algorithms as well as control results for a simple kinematic <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Extensions</b> of these algorithms towards navigating through an unstructured environment with limited sensor range are discussed.

50|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} gemigliptin monotherapy were evaluated in two double-blind placebo controlled studies and one double-blind active-controlled study. A phase II study (study identifier: LG-DPCL002) of gemigliptin was conducted in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design with three doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg qd {{for the purpose of}} finding a dose responsiveness and an optimal dose in patients with T2DM. The mean changes of HbA1c at week 12 from the baseline were -0.98%, -0.74%, -0.78% (when adjusted with placebo data, -0.92%, -0.68%, and -0.72%) at 50, 100, and 200 mg, respectively. Among the effective doses obtained from the phase II study in patients with T2DM, the 50 mg dose showed a similar efficacy as the 100 and 200 mg doses, within the maximum safety margin. Similar findings were reported from two phase III studies. Patients were randomized to receive gemigliptin, either a 50 mg qd (n=90) or a placebo (n=92) for 24 weeks (study identifier: LG-DPCL005; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01601990). The placebo-subtracted changes from baseline in HbA1c were reported to be −0.71% (95% confidence interval CI, −1.04 to −0.37) with gemigliptin 50 mg. In addition, a 28-week open-label extension study was designed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of gemigliptin. Among 165 patients who consented to participate in the <b>extension</b> <b>period</b> of study LG-DPCL005, 158 patients (96%) completed their treatments for 52 weeks. All patients were switched to or continued their treatments only with gemigliptin 50 mg qd during the <b>extension</b> <b>period.</b> A further decrease in HbA1c was observed in the continued treatment with gemigliptin 50 mg in this <b>extension</b> <b>period,</b> and the mean change from baseline at 52 weeks (-0.87%) was still clinically and statistically significant (full analysis set analysis, P<0.0001). In another double-blind, active-controlled, phase III trial (study identifier: LG-DPCL011), eligible patients with HbA1c greater than 7.5% were randomized to receive gemigliptin 50 mg qd with metformin slow release (SR) qd (n=141), gemigliptin 50 mg qd (n=142), or metformin SR qd (n=150) for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, the reduction from the baseline in HbA1c was -1.24% for gemigliptin monotherapy.|$|R
