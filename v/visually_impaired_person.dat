40|$|INTRODUCTION According to {{the survey}} by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare in 1996, there are 305, 000 <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>persons</b> in Japan. Those who can use Braille among them are less than 10 %. Braille is not {{commonly}} used because it is especially difficult for the elderly <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>persons</b> to learn Braille. On the other hand, only 1, 000 blind persons can use personal computer (PC), according {{to the survey}}. It is important for <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>persons</b> to use Internet with voice, which gives the way of real-time communication and the chance of attending social activities. In recent years, Japanese Text-toSpeech (TTS) systems were available on the standard PC with audio output, though they required additional hardware. These days, there are some screen-readers for the Japanese version of Microsoft Windows, which help the <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>persons</b> to access web and read or write e-mail. They are sold at low prices and do not require any additional hardware. T...|$|R

The accessible copy must be accompanied by an acknowledgement and must carry a statement that it was made under the authority of the Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002's amendments to the 1988 Act. Furthermore, if accessible copies are available commercially in a form suitable for the person whom the accessible copy would be made for, then the exception does not apply.

In 2013 he was accepted onto British Cycling’s Paralympic Development Programme and, was teamed up with sight piloted Adam Duggleby. In December 2014, after became the British road and time trial national champion, Bate was advanced from the development programme to the Paralympic Podium Programme, for athletes who British Cycling believe have medal potential at Paralympic level.

5000|$|Ski for Light {{provides}} {{cross-country skiing}} programs for visually impaired and mobility-impaired adults, pairing each <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>person</b> with an experienced, sighted cross-country skier, who serves both as instructor and guide. The organization holds an annual week-long event for upwards of 200 participants and guides at different venues in the United States. Disabled skiers and their assigned guides ski together in parallel sets of tracks, thus facilitating {{the ability of}} the guides to inform skiers about the terrain ahead. The skill levels of participants with impairments span from novice to expert skier. The annual event includes both touring and racing using the classic (in track) technique only. [...] It has been held in twelve different U.S. states since 1975. Participants have come from throughout the U.S. and at least twelve other countries. The level of skiing proficiency that impaired participants can achieve reportedly inspires the organization's motto, “If I can do this, I can do anything!” Guides often derive sufficient reward from their participation to return regularly to the organization's annual events and to participate in regional events, as well.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} {{increased}} the research {{interest in the}} development of different approaches to support the mobility of the <b>visually</b> <b>impaired.</b> The automatic detection of tactile paving surface is one important topic of research, not only to help the mobility of <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>persons,</b> but also for use in the displacement of autonomous robots, providing a safely route and warnings. In this paper we propose an approach for tactile paving surface detection in real-time with the purpose to assist <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>persons.</b> It uses computer vision algorithms combined with decision tree to eliminate some possible false alarms. We assume the <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>persons</b> holds a smartphone, which is used to obtain images, as well as to assist him by audio feedback to keep it on the tactile paving surface. This problem is very challenging, mainly due to illumination changes, occlusion, image noise and resolution, as well as different possible colors of the tactile paving surfaces. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach works well in low resolution images, effectively detecting the tactile paving surfaces in real test scenarios...|$|R
