Other characteristics com-mon to viruses such as inactivation at low températures and by a low con-centration of formaldehyde (Burmester, 1952) and the stimulation of antibodies (Burmester, 1955) were also found to be properties of the causative agent of <b>viscéral</b> <b>lymphomatosis.</b> Transmission has also been obtained {{by the use of}} trachéal, nasal, cloacal, conjunctival, oral, and aerogenic routes of exposure (Burmester and Gentry, 1954 b). I t was further demonstrated (Burmester and Gentry, 1954 a) that contact trans-mission, which occurs when inoculated and noninoculated chicks are brooded to-gether, was influenced by the âge of the contact chicks and by the proportion of the population which was inoculated. In ail transmission experiments with <b>viscéral</b> <b>lymphomatosis</b> thus far re-ported, large doses (undiluted) of inoc-ulums hâve been employed. In order t...|$|E

Bacteriol. 84 : 1134 – 1139. 1962. —The egg embryo of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica, Temminck and Schlegel) {{was found to}} support readily {{the growth of a}} wide range of viruses known to infect chicken eggs. Methods {{commonly}} used in studying viruses in chicken eggs were modified and adapted to the quail egg. The procedures are described in detail. The sensitivity of quail eggs to representative viruses of the myxo and pox groups was found to be equal to that of chicken eggs. Preliminary observations of the different responses of quail eggs to standard chicken tumor and to quail-adapted Rous sarcoma virus are described. Viruses known not to grow or induce an observable response in chicken eggs (e. g., the agents of mouse hepatitis, murine leukemias, and <b>visceral</b> <b>lymphomatosis</b> of chickens) also failed to produce such responses in quail eggs...|$|E
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that all of the cases just described, from the findings, are {{suffered}} from avian <b>visceral</b> <b>lymphomatosis.</b> The microscopical findings which were observed in all the present cases may be summarized as follows : Hyperplasia of the lymphatic tissue a. "Abnormal hyperplasia" of the lymphatic tissue b. "Immaturation" c. "Maturation"[d. Lymphatic tissue outside the question] In the first place, the authors will explain the terms used. "Abnormal hyperplasia" of the lymphatic tissue This is hyperplasia of the lymphatic tissues in which the principal cellular element was composed of large-pale-nuclear cells repeatedly called in the preceding descriptions. The cells was not identical with lymphoblasts, and the authors consider that the cells may be appropriately called germ cells in the lymphatic tissues. The cells of this kind have frequently been called lymphoid cells in the literature (v. discussion). "Immaturation" and "Maturation" Both terms indicate such histological features as the abnormally hyperplastic lymphatic tissues were composed of large-pale-nuclear cells and had a neoplastic character. In "maturation", it is characteristic that the hyperplastic tissues show histological features suggestive of the lymph follicles (v. discussion). Next, the authors illustrate the findings in the three groups. In group 1 (Chart 1) which includes 123 cases, 6 were cases of "abnormal hyperplasia" of the lymphatic tissues, which were only in the chicken stage. Two cases of "immaturation" and one of "maturation" were detected only in the adult stage. In the final experimental phase, no abnormal cases were detected. In general, the same tendency could be also observed in groups 2 and 3 (Charts 2 and 3). From all of the cases illustrated, also, one case of neural lymphomatosis from the December cases of group 1,one case of erythroblastosis from the June cases in the terminal phase of the experiment in group 2,and two cases of neural lymphomatosis from the October cases of group 3 were also detected. Other than these, there were no remarkable infectious diseases in cases which died or were killed by reason of accidents...|$|E
