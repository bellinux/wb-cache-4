50|$|The University's Agricultural Experiment Station was {{established}} in 1885, with the West Kentucky Substation at Princeton founded in 1925. Today the Experiment Station Farm consists of almost 1,300 acres (520 hectares) where crops such as corn, wheat, soybeans, tobacco, fruits, <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>ornamentals</b> are studied. The Princeton site also includes a 10-acre (40,000 m²) orchard/vineyard, plus 2 acres (8,000 m²) of grapes, and 1.5 acres (6,000 m²) for research in small fruit trees and ornamentals.|$|E
50|$|Pythium irregulare has a {{very broad}} host range, {{including}} many agronomically and horticulturally important crops and is found on every continent except for Antarctica. P. irregulare infects over 200 species, including cereals, legumes, fruits, <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ornamentals.</b> It differs from many other Pythium species in that it prefers cooler environments. A moist environment is also necessary for disease, which aids motility of spores. It is commonly found in both greenhouses and fields.|$|E

50|$|R. stolonifer is most {{commonly}} managed by packing line applications of dicloran (also known as DCNA or Botran). Dicloran, a chlorinated nitro-aniline, {{is a broad}} spectrum fungicide registered for postharvest use on sweet potatoes and in-field use for several fruits, <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ornamentals.</b> There has been a growing interest {{in the use of}} biological control organisms for control of postharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables. Control of Rhizopus soft rot of sweet potatoes by biological control products has been variable.|$|E
50|$|Typhlodromips swirskii is used commercially in Europe and North America for {{biocontrol}} of whitefly and thrips in <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>ornamentals</b> grown under cover. The cultured mites can {{be mixed}} with bran and sprinkled on the crop or spread by air blast. When multiple species of pest are present, it may effectively control one but not another; for example, in field grown cucumbers, {{it was found}} to control melon thrips on leaves, but failed to control common blossom thrips on flowers.|$|E
50|$|Plot sizes {{vary from}} 5 by 9 ft to 14 by 28 ft. Gardening members {{come from the}} {{immediately}} adjoining neighborhoods. Individual gardens vary greatly in what is grown and harvested. Located in two diverse urban neighborhoods, {{a wide variety of}} food, flowers and plant material is grown based somewhat on ethnicity, ancestry, or if a gardener is a recent immigrant, their home country. Land Trust rules allow individual garderns to grow whatever they choose in their plot {{as long as it is}} not grown for commercial sale. Most garderners grow a mix of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>ornamentals.</b> A few of the gardens operate a composting system to convert discarded plant material to soil and fertilizer. Roughly half of the gardens have perimeter borders termed community borders, which are planted with ornamental plants, flowers and small shrubs.|$|E

Its greenhouses contain aquatic plants, crops, ferns, orchids, and succulents.|$|R
50|$|Bacterial soft rots {{are caused}} by several types of bacteria, but most {{commonly}} by species of gram-negative bacteria, Erwinia, Pectobacterium, and Pseudomonas. It is a destructive disease of fruits, <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ornamentals</b> found worldwide, and effects genera from nearly all the plant families. The bacteria mainly attack the fleshy storage organs of their hosts (tubers, corms, bulbs, and rhizomes), but they also affect succulent buds, stems, and petiole tissues. With the aid of special enzymes, the plant is turned into a liquidy mush {{in order for the}} bacteria to consume the plant cell's nutrients. Disease spread can be caused by simple physical interaction between infected and healthy tissues during storage or transit. The disease can also be spread by insects. Control of the disease is not always very effective, but sanitary practices in production, storing, and processing are something that can be done in order to slow the spread of the disease and protect yields.|$|E
5000|$|The main (Saltillo) {{campus of}} the UAAAN {{occupies}} more than 4 square kilometres in a fertile valley a few kilometres {{south of the city}} of Saltillo on the Zacatecas highway. A substantial amount of this land is occupied by experimental and demonstrative plots including annual and perennial crops like: corn, wheat, triticale; vegetables such as temperate (Cruciferae: broccoli, cabbage), warm-season (Solanaceae: peppers, tomatoes), and others (squash, cilantro, onions, garlic, etc.); pecan and pistachio orchards; greenhouses (growing <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>ornamentals).</b> All agriculture must use irrigation; there is no dryland agriculture. The University also includes animal production facilities (barns for intensive rearing of pigs, cows, goats, and dairy cows, mainly) including fistulated cattle. There is also has a cattle ranch (Rancho Los Angeles) (extensively colonized by the endangered Mexican prairie dogs, Cynomys mexicanus); a reforestation woodland occupying more than 4 km² of pines; and a botanical garden featuring mainly desert plant species (cacti, agaves) and trees.|$|E
40|$|Production of fruit, <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>ornamentals</b> {{has been}} {{increasing}} worldwide and represents a huge investment of resources in transport, storage, and marketing facilities designed to maintain a continuous supply of these perishable goods. The goals of postharvest practices are to protect that investment. Essentially a textbook, this new version of an earlier work has been substantially updated to include ornamentals and to reflect modern industrial practices and technology. Particularly noteworthy is the book's coverage of tropical produce. Clearly written and well-illustrated, this book should {{be of interest to}} students of horticulture; nutritionists; farming company technologists, transport workers and retailers; packing house managers; government advisers and concerned consumers.

50|$|Trialeurodes vaporariorum, {{commonly}} known as the glasshouse whitefly or greenhouse whitefly, is an insect that inhabits the world's temperate regions.
