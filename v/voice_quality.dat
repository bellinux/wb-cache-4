5|$|Full {{capital letters}} {{are not used}} as IPA symbols. They are, however, often used for archiphonemes and for natural classes of phonemes (that is, as wildcards). Such usage {{is not part of}} the IPA or even standardized, and may be {{ambiguous}} between authors, but it is commonly used in conjunction with the IPA. (The extIPA chart, for example, uses one or two wildcards in its illustrations.) Capital letters are also basic to the <b>Voice</b> <b>Quality</b> Symbols sometimes used in conjunction with the IPA.|$|E
25|$|On T-carrier digital {{transmission}} systems, bits within the T-1 data stream {{were used to}} transmit supervision. By careful design, the appropriated bits did not change <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> appreciably. Robbed bits were translated to changes in contact states (opens and closures) by electronics in the channel bank hardware. This allowed direct current E and M signaling, or dial pulses, to be sent between electromechanical switches over a digital carrier which did not have DC continuity.|$|E
5000|$|Estill Voice Training {{incorporates}} six 'voice qualities' as {{mechanisms for}} demonstration of voice production control. The increased control developed through proficiency {{in the different}} Figures for Voice allows the singer or speaker to manipulate the vocal mechanism specifically to produce these arbitrary <b>voice</b> <b>qualities,</b> and variations on them. Essentially these <b>voice</b> <b>qualities,</b> such as 'Sob Quality' and 'Belt Quality', are constructed from moving the structures of the vocal mechanism into specific positions or combinations. For example, Sob Quality includes a low larynx position (the larynx figure) and thin vocal folds (the true vocal fold body & cover figure). The six <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> are: ...|$|R

25|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that hormones play also an {{important}} role in vocal fold maturation. Hormones are molecules secreted into the blood stream to be delivered at different targeted sites. They usually promote growth, differentiation and functionality in different organs or tissues. Their effect is due to their ability to bind to intracellular receptors, modulating the gene expression, and subsequently regulating protein synthesis. The interaction between the endocrine system and tissues such as breast, brain, testicles, heart, bones, etc., is being extensively studied. It has clearly been seen that the larynx is somewhat affected by hormonal changes, but surprisingly, very few studies are working on elucidating this relationship. The effect of hormonal changes in voice is clearly seen when hearing male and female voices, or when listening to a teenage voice changing during puberty. Actually, it is believed that the number of hormonal receptors in the pre-pubertal phase is higher than in any other age. Menstruation has also been seen to influence the voice. In fact, singers are encouraged by their instructors not to perform during their pre-menstrual period, because of a drop in their <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E
25|$|The cantorial {{style of}} the Spanish and Portuguese Jews adheres to the general Sephardi {{principle}} that every word is sung out loud and {{that most of the}} ritual is performed communally rather than solistically (although nowadays in the New York community, the Pesukei dezimra (zemirot) throughout the year, Hallél on festivals or the new moon, and several of the selichot during Yom Kippur are chanted in a manner more similar to the Ashkenazi practice of reading only the first and last few verses of each paragraph aloud). The hazzan's rôle is typically one of guiding the congregation rather than being a soloist. Thus, there is traditionally a much stronger emphasis on correct diction and knowledge of the musical minhág than on the solistic <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> In the parts of the service where the ḥazzán would traditionally have a more solistic rôle, the basic melodies are embellished according to the general principles of Baroque performance practice: for example, after a prayer or hymn sung by the congregation, the ḥazzán often repeats the last line in a highly elaborated form. Two- and three-part harmony is relatively common, and Edwin Seroussi has shown that the harmonies are a reflection of more complex, four-part harmonies in written sources from the 18th century.|$|E

40|$|Although an {{increasing}} number of sociolinguistic researchers consider functions of <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> as stylistic features, few studies consider cases where <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> serve as the primary signs of speech registers. This article addresses this gap through the presentation of a case study of Lachixio Zapotec speech registers indexed though falsetto, breathy, creaky, modal, and whispered <b>voice</b> <b>qualities.</b> I describe the system of contrastive speech registers in Lachixio Zapotec and then track a speaker on a single evening where she switches between three of these registers. Analyzing line-by-line conversational structure I show both obligatory and creative shifts between registers that co-occur with shifts in the participant structures of the situated social interactions. I then examine similar uses of <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> in other Zapotec languages and in the two unrelated language families Nahuatl and Mayan to suggest the possibility that such voice registers are a feature of the Mesoamerican culture area...|$|R

It used short cutaways and a plethora of self-referential jokes the writers must have stockpiled for years about the animation quality, <b>voice</b> <b>quality,</b> {{and structure of the}} pilot to every possible advantage." [...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight." [...] She continued, [...] "Treating its animated characters like real actors was a nice touch as well. [...] Watching the original family showed how much the characters evolved and changed throughout the series' long run." [...] Moon concluded her review by giving the episode a 4.2 out of 5. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number two on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pure genius".

40|$|This {{study shows}} that there are {{normative}} associations between words and tone-of-voice, and that synchrony and dysynchrony between these two modes of speech communication can be operationally defined. The association of the thematic categories anger " and " depression " with the <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> pitch, loudness, and tempo was examined. Differential use of these <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> was determined by having judges compare the <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> occurring with the contents " anger " and " depression ".
