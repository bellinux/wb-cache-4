40|$|Abstract:- Network {{management}} becomes {{complex and}} hard to understand. Network administrators have now to deal with new data patterns and advanced control services to support ISPs ’ customised commercial offers. The complexity of data patterns is related to new needs: the users ask for more new services to ISPs (e. g. peer 2 peer scenarios are opening up new traffic patterns) or advanced properties to the legacy services. For example, a <b>videoconference</b> <b>session</b> could need new enhanced properties, like QoS support, to enhance users’ needs. Statefull protocols, (e. g. RSVP) do not scale {{very well in the}} core network, and stateless routers supporting DiffServ are used to handle the huge amount of connections per second. Taking into account the complexity of these elements, we show how the combination of a non conventional use of AF-DiffServ queue disciplines supporting end-to-end QoS and an enhanced Policy architecture, provide to network administrators the ability to control a device or a domain, using only few understandable parameters...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{effective}} traffic management in the heavily loaded networks for videoconferencing from the real-time stochastic system perspective. A probabilistic delay model is proposed for the characterization of time-varying nature of the data traffic in the Internet. Connectionist delay representation of the network traffic is derived by considering a <b>videoconference</b> <b>session</b> among a group ofN participants connected via the Internet. Connections among the collaborative participants are represented by their end-to-end network delays statistics involving the characteristics of end-to-end transmission delay of each connection and the inter-connection relation. The first component {{is represented by the}} probability density function of the end-to-end delay in each connection. The second component is modeled as the delay correlation between the connections. For a network of N workstations, this model becomes an NxN matrix of probability density functions and N 2 x N 2 correlation matrix that, when normalized by the delay mean and variances of individual connections, leads to matrix of delay cross-correlation coefficients with values varying in the range of [- 1, 1] independent of scale changes in the correlation amplitude...|$|E

40|$|The {{practical}} {{use of a}} name as a more user-friendly abstraction of a machine’s numerical address on a network is quite old. In fact, the basic functionality of the DNS (Domain Name System) service consists of translating hostnames into IP addresses. In this paper we present Visual DNS, which is an extension to the DNS service that meets the requirements of MANET environments. Visual DNS allows any node in the network to discover any other node in a transparent manner, and independently of its location. The proposed application makes use of a distributed user discovery protocol based on reliable data dissemination to share information about users. Information shared includes the user name and photo, along with the host’s IP address, among other things. Once the discovery protocol starts, the application offers users the possibility to communicate with other known users through either a text based chat application, a VoIP session or a <b>videoconference</b> <b>session.</b> We present {{the architecture of the}} proposed application, along with some implementation details. Finally, experimental results show that, if properly tuned, the proposed data dissemination strategy allows user information to reach all the nodes in a MANET in just a few seconds...|$|E

A questionnaire was given to all participants to determine the profile of the users and the efficiency of the project. Sixty-five per cent of the participants were male. The proportion of female participants was higher at the central location than at the peripheral sites. The mean age of the participants was 37. 7 years (SEM 0. 3).
