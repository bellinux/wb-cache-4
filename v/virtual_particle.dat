5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this <b>virtual</b> <b>particle</b> into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to show that}} there is a {{physical}} process which could underlie the wave properties of matter. A comparison has been drawn between the properties of a pair of electrically unlike <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> created by a quantum entity in the physical vacuum and the characteristics of the quantum entity wave function. Analogies were revealed between the spin precession frequency of pair of <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> and the wave function frequency, between the size of the electric dipole produced by a pair of <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> and the wave function wavelength, and also between the angle of spin precession of pair of <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> and the wave function phase. It is shown that quantum correlations of quantum entities may be caused by spin correlations (by spin supercurrents) between <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> created by the quantum entities in the physical vacuum. It is shown that the wave properties of a quantum entity are due to precession of spin of pair of <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> created by the quantum entity in the physical vacuum...|$|R
50|$|Ordinarily, however, {{quantum field}} theory does not deal with <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> of {{sufficient}} energy to curve spacetime significantly, so quantum foam is a speculative extension of these concepts which imagines the consequences of such high-energy <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> at very short distances and times.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{principal}} {{ways in which}} the notion of <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> appears in modern physics. They appear as intermediate terms in Feynman diagrams; that is, as terms in a perturbative calculation. They also appear as an infinite set of states to be summed or integrated over in the calculation of a semi-non-perturbative effect. In the latter case, it is sometimes said that <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> contribute to a mechanism that mediates the effect, or that the effect occurs through the <b>virtual</b> <b>particles.</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{may be more}} cutoff {{parameters}} {{than just}} for momentum. For example, one may assume that the volume of space is limited, which would interfere with translation invariance of a theory, or assume {{that the number of}} virtual particles is limited, which would interfere with the assumption that every <b>virtual</b> <b>particle</b> may split into more virtual particles. All such restrictions lead to a set of cutoffs that becomes a part of a definition of a theory.|$|E
500|$|In modern {{particle}} physics, {{forces and}} the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity, it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum (4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics). The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than {{the concept of a}} force. Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be [...] "fundamental interactions". When particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) <b>virtual</b> <b>particle</b> B, a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A' exchanging by B. This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change {{in the direction of the}} particle world lines. Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and, in the case of <b>virtual</b> <b>particle</b> exchange, are absorbed at an adjacent vertex.|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} {{example of}} the [...] "presence" [...] of <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> in a vacuum is the Casimir effect. Here, the explanation of the effect requires that the total energy {{of all of the}} <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> in a vacuum can be added together. Thus, although the <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> themselves are not directly observable in the laboratory, they do leave an observable effect: Their zero-point energy results in forces acting on suitably arranged metal plates or dielectrics. [...] On the other hand, the Casimir effect can be interpreted as the relativistic van der Waals force.|$|R

[...] Attempts to develop a theory of gravity consistent with quantum mechanics, a quantum gravity theory, which would allow gravity to be united in a common mathematical framework (a theory of everything) with the other three forces of physics, are a current area of research.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{years of}} {{delays in the}} {{subatomic}} particle research during World War II (1939–45), with most physicists working in applied projects for wartime necessities. When the war ended in August 1945, many physicists gradually returned to peacetime research. The first true meson to be discovered was what would later be called the [...] "pi meson" [...] (or pion). This discovery was made in 1947, by Cecil Powell, César Lattes, and Giuseppe Occhialini, who were investigating cosmic ray products at the University of Bristol in England, based on photographic films placed in the Andes mountains. Some of those mesons had about the same mass as the already-known meson, yet seemed to decay into it, leading physicist Robert Marshak to hypothesize in 1947 that {{it was actually a}} new and different meson. Over the next few years, more experiments showed that the pion was indeed involved in strong interactions. The pion (as a <b>virtual</b> <b>particle)</b> is also believed to be the primary force carrier for the nuclear force in atomic nuclei. Other mesons, such as the virtual rho mesons are involved in mediating this force as well, but to a lesser extent. Following the discovery of the pion, Yukawa was awarded the 1949 Nobel Prize in Physics for his predictions.|$|E

40|$|Although quantum {{correlations}} in {{a quantum}} system {{are characterized by}} the evolving quantities (which are entanglement and discord usually), we reveal such basis (i. e. the set of <b>virtual</b> <b>particles)</b> for {{the representation of the}} density matrix that the entanglement and/or discord between any two <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> in such representation are stationary. In particular, dealing with the nearest neighbor approximation, this system of <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> is represented by the β-fermions of the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Such systems are important in quantum information devices because the evolution of quantum entanglement/discord leads to the problems of realization of quantum operations. The advantage of stationary entanglement/discord is that they are completely defined by the initial density matrix and by the Hamiltonian governing the quantum dynamics in the system under consideration. Moreover, using the special initial condition together with the special system's geometry, we construct large cluster of <b>virtual</b> <b>particles</b> with the same pairwise entanglement/discord. In other words, the measure of quantum correlations is stationary in this system and correlations are uniformly "distributed" among all <b>virtual</b> <b>particles.</b> As examples, we use both homogeneous and non-homogeneous spin- 1 / 2 open chains with XY-interaction although other types of interactions might be also of interest.

Evanescent modes have a purely imaginary wave number, they represent the mathematical analogy of the tunneling solutions of the Schrödinger equation. Evanescent modes exist in the forbidden frequency bands of a photonic lattice and in undersized wave guides, for instance. The most prominent example for the occurrence of evanescent modes is the frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) at double prisms. Evanescent modes and tunneling lie outside the bounds of the special theory of relativity. They can cause faster than light (FTL) signal velocities.
