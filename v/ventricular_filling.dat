40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} the effects of changes in coronary stenosis on left <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling,</b> diastolic filling was serially examined before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty using pulsed Doppler echocardiopraphy in 50 palients with stable exertional angina pecleris. Peak rapid fifting, velocity and the ratio of peak atrial tilling to peak rapid filling velocities were measured from the transmitral flow velocity pattern berore and 2 and 9 days after coronary angioplasty. Peak rapid filling velocity increased and the ratio of peak etrial filling to peak rapid filling velocities decreased gradually after coronary angioplasty. The improvement in left <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling</b> was greatr in patients with severe (> 90 %) coronary stenosis than in patients with mild (≤ 90 %) coronary stenosis. In the long-term follow-up period, the improved left <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling</b> worsened in only 11 patients with marked progression to > 99 % coronary stenosis. Thus, left <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling</b> Improved gradualy after coronary angloplasty, possibly reflecting postiwhemic “stunned” myocardium.

50|$|Prolonged aerobic {{exercise}} training may also increase stroke volume, which frequently {{results in a}} lower (resting) heart rate. Reduced heart rate prolongs <b>ventricular</b> diastole (<b>filling),</b> increasing end-diastolic volume, and ultimately allowing more blood to be ejected.|$|R
50|$|Both valsalva {{maneuver}} {{and standing}} decrease venous {{return to the}} heart thereby decreasing left <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling</b> (preload) and causing more laxity on the chordae tendineae. This allows the mitral valve to prolapse earlier in systole, leading to an earlier systolic click (i.e. closer to S1), and a longer murmur.|$|R
25|$|Patients with {{pacemaker}} syndrome exhibit increased plasma {{levels of}} ANP. That's due {{to increase in}} left atrial pressure and left <b>ventricular</b> <b>filling</b> pressure, {{which is due to}} decreased cardiac output caused by dyssynchrony in atrial and ventricular contraction. ANP and BNP are potent arterial and venous vasodilators that can override carotid and aortic baroreceptor reflexes attempting to compensate for decreased blood pressure. Usually patients with cannon a waves have higher plasma levels of ANP than those without cannon a waves.|$|E
25|$|Chronic aortic {{insufficiency}} If the individual survives the initial hemodynamic derailment that acute AI presents as, the left ventricle adapts by eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation {{of the left}} ventricle, and the volume overload is compensated for. The left <b>ventricular</b> <b>filling</b> pressures will revert to normal and the individual will no longer have overt heart failure. In this compensated phase, the individual may be totally asymptomatic and may have normal exercise tolerance. Eventually (typically after a latency period) the left ventricle will become decompensated, and filling pressures will increase.Some individuals enter this decompensated phase asymptomatically, treatment for AI involves aortic valve replacement prior to this decompensation phase.|$|E
2500|$|In {{individuals}} with severe mitral stenosis, the left <b>ventricular</b> <b>filling</b> {{is dependent on}} the atrial kick. [...] The loss of the atrial kick due to atrial fibrillation ( [...] i.e. blood cannot flow into the left ventricle thus accumulating in the left atrium [...] ) [...] can cause a precipitous decrease in cardiac output and sudden congestive heart failure.|$|E
40|$|Ligating {{the right}} lateral vitelline vein of chicken embryos (venous clip) results in {{cardiovascular}} malformations. These abnormalities {{are similar to}} malformations observed in knockout mice studies of components of the endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) /endothelin-converting enzyme- 1 /endothelin-A receptor pathway. In previous studies we demonstrated that cardiac ET- 1 expression is decreased 3 h after clipping, and <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling</b> is disturbed after 2 days. Therefore, we hypothesise that ET- 1 -related processes {{are involved in the}} development of functional and morphological cardiovascular defects after venous clip. In this study, ET- 1 and endothelin receptor antagonists (BQ- 123, BQ- 788 and PD 145065) were infused into the HH 18 embryonic circulation. Immediate haemodynamic effects on the embryonic heart and extra-embryonic vitelline veins were examined by Doppler and micro-particle image velocimetry. <b>Ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling</b> characteristics were studied at HH 24, followed by cardiovascular morphologic investigation (HH 35). ET- 1 and its receptor antagonists induced haemodynamic effects at HH 18. At HH 24, a reduced diastolic <b>ventricular</b> passive <b>filling</b> component was demonstrated, which was compensated by an increased active <b>filling</b> component. Thinner <b>ventricular</b> myocardium was shown in 42 % of experimental embryos.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the significance of}} augmentation of left <b>ventricular</b> slow <b>filling</b> in patients with hypertrohic cardiomyopathy (HCM), M-mode-and pulsed Doppler echocardiograms were obtained with simultaneous recording of left ventricular pressure in patients with HCM. The large slow filling wave (LSFW) {{was defined as the}} slow filling wave whose peak velocity was more than a half of the peak velocity during the early filling phase (E). Patients with LSFW tended to have a longer isovolumic relaxation time and smaller E, and had a longer time constant T than patients without LSFW. Furthermore, in patients with LSFW, left ventricular pressure kept declining not only during the rapid filling phase, but also during the slow filling phase, but not in the patients without LSFW. Thus, the augmentation of left <b>ventricular</b> slow <b>filling</b> in patients with HCM might be caused by the delayed and incomplete relaxation of the left ventricle...|$|R

40|$|Of seven {{patients}} with pulmonary hypertension, two had marked and one had moderate retarda-tion of the echocardiographic anterior mitral valve leaflet closing motion, suggestive of mitral stenosis. In each patient, however, mitral stenosis was excluded by hemodynamic or anatomic criteria. The {{reason for the}} abnormal mitral valve motion {{was considered to be}} a reduced rate of left <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling.</b> In the group of seven patients it was noted that the ratio of ven-tricular filling pressures (RVedP/LVedP) was inversely correlated with the anterior mitral valve leaflet closing slope.

40|$|Pressure {{overload}} hypertrophy of {{the left}} ventricle is associated with abnormal left <b>ventricular</b> early diastolic <b>filling.</b> The roles {{of the extent of}} cardiac hypertrophy, depressed left ventricular systolic function and aging in the pathogenesis of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction have not, however, been fully defined. To determine the relative importance of these factors in the pathogenesis of diastolic dysfunction in pressure overload hypertrophy, 16 children and 25 adults with aortic stenosis were compared with 48 normal children and adults, using rates of left <b>ventricular</b> early diastolic <b>filling</b> and wall thinning derived from M-mode echocardiography. Left <b>ventricular</b> early diastolic <b>filling</b> and wall thinning rates were significantly depressed in both children and adults with aortic stenosis as compared with values in normal subjects. Filling and thinning rates correlated negatively with age, left ventricular peak systolic pressure and wall thickness in all subjects. Furthermore, the effect of age on diastolic function appeared to be mediated by age-related increases in systolic pressure and wall thickness. In adults with aortic stenosis, early diastolic filling and wall thinning rates were depressed to a similar extent in subjects with normal and abnormal systolic function; thus, diastolic dysfunction {{does not appear to be}} a manifestation of abnormal systolic loading and ejection performance. These results suggest that extent of hypertrophy itself plays a dominant role in the mechanism of impaired left <b>ventricular</b> early diastolic <b>filling</b> in pressure overload due to aortic stenosis...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the total artificial heart (TAH) device {{as a bridge}} to heart transplantation (BTT), and related physical therapy management, while comparisons to left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are made. Summary: The SynCardia CardioWest Temporary TAH System is the only TAH approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada and Consultants Europe (CE) for BTT. CardioWest implantation involves cardiectomy thus avoiding pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, inotropic or anti-arrhythmic agents, myocardial and valve related problems. CardioWest has a fixed beat rate and cardiac output is dependent upon venous return and preload. Both TAH and LVADs are adaptive with exercise, increasing cardiac output during activities, allowing for conditioning to occur peripherally. Left ventricular assist devices have portable drivers permitting discharge home, while the CardioWest's large driver console necessitates inpatient therapy. Exercise progression, positioning, and monitoring of exercise intolerance are similar with LVAD and TAH. <b>Ventricular</b> <b>fill</b> volumes in TAH dictate cardiac output and require close attention. Cardiectomy in TAH prevents electrocardiography, telemetry, and native pulse rate monitoring. Conclusion: While mechanical differences exist between TAH and LVAD, physical therapists can provide evidence-based treatment for patients with TAH using previously established guidelines for patients with heart failure and mechanical circulatory support...|$|R
40|$|To assess left <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling</b> in {{patients}} with amyloid heart disease 12 patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy and 15 normal subjects were studied by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. None of the patients had clinical evidence of overt heart disease or restrictive cardiomyopathy and only two of them showed ventricular wall thickening. The peak flow velocity of rapid diastolic filling and the acceleration rate of early diastolic inflow were significantly lower {{in patients}} with familial amyloid polyneuropathy than in controls. The pressure half time was significantly longer in patients than in controls. In addition, the peak flow velocity during atrial contraction and the ratio of atrial peak flow velocity to rapid diastolic peak flow velocity were significantly greater in patients than in controls. Although {{there were no significant}} correlations between measurements of diastolic filling and clinical findings {{in patients with}} familial amyloid polyneuropathy, the ratio of atrial peak flow velocity to rapid diastolic peak flow velocity was significantly related to left ventricular posterior wall thickness. These findings suggest that in patients with cardiac amyloidosis without restrictive cardiomyopathy, abnormal left <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling,</b> manifested by a reduction in the rate and volume of rapid diastolic filling with enhanced atrial contraction, can be seen even in the early stage of the disease...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} whether left ventricular diastolic abnormalities are an early feature of sickle cell anemia, indexes of diastolic filling were obtained with pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 30 consecutive patients with this disease (mean age 29 years; range 19 to 39) {{who had not}} experienced symptoms of heart failure and had normal left ventricular systolic function. Data were compared with those in 30 normal control subjects of similar ages. Seventeen (57 %) of the 30 patients with sickle cell, anemia had evidence of abnormal left <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling.</b> Six of these 17 patients had a Doppler pattern consistent with “restrictive” filling, characterized by reduced early diastolic deceleration time (7. 4 m/s 2), or both, as well as decreased late diastolic velocity-time integral (2. 6 ± 0. 7 vs. 3. 4 ± 0. 8 cm in normal subjects: p 166 ms) or reduced EF slope (< 3. 8 m/s 2), as well as increased late diastolic velocity-time integral 14. 0 ± 0. 5 vs. 3. 4 ± 0. 8 cm in normal subjects; p = 0. 03). This Doppler echorardiographic analysis demonstrates that left <b>ventricular</b> diastolic <b>filling</b> patterns are altered in patients with sickle cell anemia and that these diastolic abnormalities may {{be present in the}} absence of symptoms of heart failure.

30|$|Under normal conditions, the septum {{has a right}} convexity, {{and this}} {{configuration}} is maintained during the cardiac cycle. Because the two ventricles compete for space within the pericardium and share common myocardial fibres in the septal region, filling in one ventricle affects filling in the other, because of septal shift. This is a normal physiological phenomenon known as ventricular interdependence, which is altered by the pressure changes during ventricle filling [1, 3]. Inspiration enhances early right <b>ventricular</b> (RV) <b>filling</b> while the opposite occurs during expiration, {{which leads to a}} small septal excursion in normal subjects, and in a minority to inspiratory septal flattening dependent upon the depth of respiration [3].|$|R
