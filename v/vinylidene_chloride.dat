Tertiary vinylogous amides, both open-chain and cyclic, were prepared by several routes {{with a view}} toward their use as ligands for metal ions. It is shown that the thermodynamically preferred isomer (functionality trans) is the exclusive product in the open chain case. A new convenient synthesis of [beta]-aminobutenones is described. In contrast to previous studies, {{it was found that}} activated <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chlorides</b> (AVDC's) with [alpha]-hydrogen (Cl 2 C=CH-L, L = carbonyl function or cyano), react with certain secondary amines to give acetylenes, [ [...] . ], either as intermediates or final products except with L = CHO. The mechanism of this reaction is discussed. A simple synthesis of 3, 3 -dichloropropenoic acid and its conversion to several functional derivatives are described. A case is presented for rotational isomerism in four [beta,beta]-dichlorovinyl carbonyl compounds. Nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectral correlations were made for the compounds prepared. In particular, it is shown that nmr spectroscopy allows ready distinction of piperidino vinylogous ureas from the isomeric acyl ketenaminals of this amine. Synthesis and partial characterization of complexes of some of the above polarized ethylenes and acetylenes with cobalt(II) chloride are reported. The polarized ethylenes behave somewhat like tertiary amides as ligands; in two cases, different forms of complex with same ligand were found. The "push-pull" acetylenes form 1 : 1 complexes in which the triple bond absorption(s) of the ligand is absent. The possible implications of this result are discussed...|$|R

The micromorphology and fire performance of ULDFs were investigated using a scanning electron microscope, limiting oxygen index instrument, and cone calorimeter. The results showed that PVDC specimens were coated with a regularly smooth film, while the distribution of CP inside CP specimens was uneven. The limiting oxygen index increased with the dosage of PVDC, then reached a plateau at 50 mL and 28 %, slightly higher than CP specimens (27. 3 %). The peak of heat release rate, mean heat release rate, mean CO, and total smoke release of PVDC specimens was reduced 43. 3 %, 13. 5 %, 38. 5 %, and 51. 5 % lower than respective CP specimens, and with nearly the same total heat release (only 0. 04 MJ/m 2 higher).

40|$|Recently, {{because of}} the {{increase}} of environmental concerns in process design, the need to enhance conversion to product and prevent generation of wasteful byproducts in the reactor network has become urgent. This prevents high cost treatment and separation costs downstream in the process. Therefore, in this thesis I focus on making production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) more efficient and on possible ways of industrial organochlorine waste (OCW) recycling. In particular, in the first experiment, we investigate how catalyst and its structure can affect product output. Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis were utilized to investigate {{the structure of the}} γ-Al 2 O 3 carrier with CuCl 2 catalyst on its surface. Structure of the two catalysts, HarshowX 1 and MEDC-B, and their effect on the mechanism of ethylene oxidative chlorination reaction into 1, 2 -dichlorethane were studied. Differential thermal analysis and mass spectroscopy were applied to study the structure and the mechanism differences between the deposited and permeated CuCl 2 catalysts. The second experiment deals with ecological processing and recycling methods of wasteful byproduct that can be called chlororganic wastes. Typical waste products are 1, 2 -dichloroethane, 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane, <b>vinylidene,</b> and vinyl <b>chloride</b> monomer. Polymerization and copolymerization of typical waste products with their C 5 -C 9 fraction resulted in non-toxic polymer products {{that can be used in}} construction and road-building industries. The possibility of joint chlorine and sulfide-containing chemical wastes recycling into polysulfide oligomeric products is discussed. This comprehensive recycling allows utilizing 80 - 90 % of all wastes generated during synthesis of chlorinated products in the chemical industry. The results of the studies aim to improve the conversion of ethylene to vinyl chloride and minimize the formation of byproducts...|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{copolymerisation}} behaviour of acrylonitrile with the monomers methyl acrylate and <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> respectively. The project arose from reports by workers at Courtauld's Ltd. that the lengths of the sequences of the monomer units in certain copolymers of acrylonitrile and <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> were longer than predicted by statistical considerations. The copolymerisation of methyl acrylate with acrylonitrile was studied to examine the possibility of a preferential swelling of polymer particles by one monomer during polymerisation. Copolymerisation was carried out in three different solvents, and unsuccessful attempts were made to measure the sequence lengths in the polymers directly using NMR spectroscopy. Only compositional analysis was possible by this means, but measurements of the thermal properties of the polymers indicated that the sequence lengths were short in all cases. It was found that the Alfrey-Lewis copolymerisation equation was obeyed when the reaction was carried out homogeneously in dimethylformamide, but it was not obeyed when it was carried out heterogeneously in hexane or butanol. The copolymerisation of acrylonitrile with <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> was studied in several different solvents, and also in mixed solvent systems. Sequence lengths were measured by NMR spectroscopy, and were found to be short for all methods of preparation. In no case was the Alfrey-Lewis copolymer equation obeyed, even in those solvent systems for which the reaction was homogeneous. The preparation of copolymers homogeneously in dimethylformamide showed the least deviation from the simple copolymer equation; for some of the systems used the results could be fitted to the equation derived by Merz et al. in which the effect of the penultimate group in the polymer chain is considered.
