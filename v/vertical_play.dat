40|$|The {{concept of}} active {{technology}} in rail vehicles {{has been studied}} theoretically and experimentally for several decades and has now reached the stage of implementation. Active Lateral Suspension (ALS) is the active technology that leads the development in active secondary suspensions if carbody tilting is disregarded. Active suspension systems may have an influence on running safety of the vehicle. The requirements to fulfil are related to forces between wheel and rail. The safety must be assured by the manufacturer by a safety assessment, which must {{be sent to the}} authorities before entering service. An important part of the assessment is to show that the active system, under all conditions, is part of a vehicle that runs safely on the track. The passive components {{in the vicinity of the}} active system have an important role in assuring that even a defective active system fulfils the required safety. This master thesis aims to set requirements on the passive suspension components for the failed ALS. The study has been conducted by varying various parameters of the vehicle with different running conditions and failure cases. The study highlights that the secondary lateral bumpstop is the most important parameter for the vehicle safety. With soft bumpstop (low stiffness) the vehicle runs within safe limits for all studied conditions, and the effect of varying other parameters, running conditions and failure cases, is marginal. For somewhat higher stiffness (medium bumpstop), the effect of other parameters plays a critical role in ensuring safe run. For hard bumpstop, the track shift forces are above the limit values, independently of the passive component settings. High vertical forces have been observed for certain cases with medium bumpstop, due to primary vertical bumpstop contact, which can be prevented by increasing the primary vertical damping or by increasing the <b>vertical</b> <b>play.</b> Reduction in track shift forces has been observed with the increase of primary vertical damping. The reason for the effect is not known and is proposed for further study...|$|E

50|$|Some {{paintings}} from the 14th and 15th centuries depict musicians playing {{what appear to}} be two end-blown flutes simultaneously. In some cases, the two flutes are evidently disjoint, separate flutes of similar make, played angled away from each other, one pipe in each hand. In others, flutes of the same length have differing hand positions. In a final case, the pipes are parallel, in contact with each other, and differ in length. While the iconographic criteria for a recorder are typically a clearly recognizable labium and a double handed <b>vertical</b> <b>playing</b> technique, such criteria are not prescriptive, and it is uncertain whether any of these depictions should be considered a single instrument, or constitute a kind of recorder. The identification of the instrument depicted is further complicated by the symbolism of the aulos, a double piped instrument associated with the satyr Marsyas of Greek mythology.|$|R

50|$|The Giants won the toss {{and elected}} to receive, and {{immediately}} picked the Vikings' secondary apart. Kerry Collins began {{the game by}} hitting Amani Toomer, who had hardly practiced all week due to an injury, on a slant pattern for 16 yards.

On the ensuing kickoff, Brad Daluiso's kick was poor, but Vikings running back Moe Williams misplayed the ball and fumbled.

50|$|The {{two players}} sit at {{opposite}} sides of a <b>vertical</b> <b>playing</b> surface. The dealer deals half of the cards to each player. The cards are held face down. Every round, each player plays five cards face up vertically in between both players and slightly closer to themselves. Once both players have done this, they look for two or more cards having the same number. When a player finds one, he places another card {{on top of the}} cards with that number until all of the cards with the common number are covered. In other words, if there are three fours out then all three cards can get a new card on top of it. If a four is played on top of a four it is called a double, and the player may place a third card on top of it. This requires that players pay attention to the cards they are laying down on the pile. If a player runs out of cards then that player wins. When there are no more groups of cards remaining, each player scoops up the four piles directly in front of him or her and places them face down on the bottom of his or her deck. That round ends and the next begins.|$|R
40|$|The {{steering}} {{principle of}} tropical cyclone motion {{has been applied}} to tropical cyclone forecasting and research for nearly 100 years. Two fundamental questions remain unanswered. One is why the steering flow plays a dominant role in tropical cyclone motion, and the other is when tropical cyclone motion deviates considerably from the steering. A high-resolution numerical experiment was conducted with the tropical cyclone in a typical large-scale monsoon trough over the western North Pacific. The simulated tropical cyclone experiences two eyewall replacement processes. Based on the potential vorticity tendency (PVT) diagnostics, this study demonstrates that the conventional steering, which is calculated over a certain radius from the tropical cyclone center in the horizontal and a deep pressure layer in the <b>vertical,</b> <b>plays</b> a dominant role in tropical cyclone motion since the contributions from other processes are largely cancelled out due to the coherent structure of tropical cyclone circulation. Resulting from the asymmetric dynamics of the tropical cyclone inner core, the trochoidal motion around the mean tropical cyclone track cannot be accounted for by the conventional steering. The instantaneous tropical cyclone motion can considerably deviate from the conventional steering that approximately accounts for the combined effect of the contribution of the advection of the symmetric potential vorticity component by the asymmetric flow and the contribution from the advection of the wave-number-one potential vorticity component by the symmetric flow...|$|R

This paper presents two accounting results from a global input-output framework that shed light on this channel. We feed in observed changes in final demand and find that trade in final goods fell by twice as much as trade in intermediate goods. Nevertheless, intermediate goods account for more than two-fifths of the trade collapse. We also find that vertical specialization trade fell 13 percent, while value-added trade fell by 10 percent, because declines in demand were largest in highly vertically-specialized sectors. ...|$|R

The driving force behind this result is the risk of rent extraction faced by competing integrated generators on the wholesale market.
