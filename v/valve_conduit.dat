40|$|ObjectivesClinical {{translation}} of tissue-engineered heart valves requires valve competency {{and lack of}} stenosis in the short and long term. Early studies of engineered valves showed promise, although lacked complete definition of valve function. Building on prior experiments, we sought to define the in vivo changes in structure and function of autologous engineered pulmonary <b>valved</b> <b>conduits.</b> MethodsMesenchymal stem cells were isolated from neonatal sheep bone marrow and seeded onto a bioresorbable scaffold. After 4 weeks of culture, <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> were implanted. <b>Valve</b> function, cusp, and conduit dimensions were evaluated at implantation (echocardiography), at the experimental midpoint (magnetic resonance imaging), and at explant, at 1 day, and 1, 6, 12, or 20 weeks postoperatively (direct measurement, echocardiography). Histologic evaluation was performed. ResultsNineteen animals underwent autologous tissue-engineered <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> replacement. At implantation, <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> function was excellent; maximum transvalvular pressure gradient by Doppler echocardiography was 17 mm Hg; most <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> showed trivial pulmonary regurgitation. At 6 postoperative weeks, valve cusps appeared less mobile; pulmonary regurgitation was mild to moderate. At 12 weeks or more, <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> cusps were increasingly attenuated and regurgitant. <b>Valved</b> <b>conduit</b> diameter remained unchanged over 20 weeks. Dimensional measurements by magnetic resonance imaging correlated with direct measurement at explant. ConclusionsWe demonstrate autologous engineered tissue <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> that function well at implantation, with subsequent monitoring of dimensions and function in real time by magnetic resonance imaging.

In five baboons, {{at an average of}} 40 months after <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> implantation, fibrointimal stenosis at the valve site resulted in narrowing and a mean transconduit pressure gradient of 49 mm Hg (range 33 to 65). A tubular slotted steel stent (1. 2 cm long) was deployed within the <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> after inflation of an 8 to 15 mm diameter balloon catheter that was introduced through the femoral vein. A stent was delivered to all valved conduits; however, in two baboons, balloon undersizing resulted in stent dislodgment. In the remaining three baboons, the transconduit gradient was reduced by 59 % (49 to 20 mm Hg) and right ventricular systolic pressure decreased acutely by 35 % (77 to 50 mm Hg).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{composite}} mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>conduit</b> replacement is {{the standardized}} operation for aneurysms of the aortic root. The {{objective of this}} study is to evaluate the long-term surgical results of aortic valve-preserving procedures to the root reconstruction. METHODS: From 1996 to 2008, 54 consecutive patients underwent two different techniques of valve-sparing aortic root operation (40 Yacoub operations and 14 David operations). Mean age was 48 ± 14 years (range 17 to 74). 36 patients (66. 7 %) were male and 16 (29. 6 %) experienced Marfan's syndrome. The mean Euroscore was 4 ± 1. 25. The mean follow up time was 4. 1 years (from 49 days to 10. 9 years). Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were analysed. T-Student paired test, the McNemar Non Parametric test and the Kaplan-Meyer Outcome Curves have been used. RESULTS: The hospital mortality was 5. 6 % and the average hospitalization time was 9 ± 4 days. One non related late death (2 %) was reported. The actuarial survival and freedom from reoperation were respectively 94. 4 % and 96 % within 11 years of follow-up. There were benefits in reduction of functional class (P= 0. 002; 78 % CF I), in reduction of aortic regurgitation (P< 0. 001; 78 % with or without discrete reflux), in reduction of systolic and diastolic diameters, end-sytolic and end-diastolic volumes of left ventricle (respectively P= 0. 004; P< 0. 0001; P= 0. 036 and P< 0. 001). Two (3. 9 %) patients required aortic valve replacement due to severe aortic regurgitation during this same period. No thromboembolic, endocarditis or bleeding events were reported during the follow-up.

We report the immunoreactivity (positive panel reactive antibody assay) and early operative results of the CryoLife SynerGraft aortic <b>valve</b> <b>conduit</b> homograft. MethodsTwenty-two patients (age 53 ± 14 years, range 31 - 80 years) from April 2002 to July 2003 underwent aortic root replacement with a CryoLife SynerGraft aortic <b>valve</b> <b>conduit</b> homograft (CryoLife Inc, Kennesaw, Ga) for congenital or acquired aortic valve disease, aortic aneurysm with aortic valve disease, or native or prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis. Baseline percentage positive panel reactive antibody results were negative (< 10 %) for all and were assessed at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 -year. Homograft function was evaluated by echocardiography. ResultsEarly mortality was 0 %. Two late deaths at 1 postoperative year were unrelated to homograft function. At 1 postoperative month, panel reactive antibody results were negative in 20 patients (91 %). At 3 months, 19 of 22 patients (86 %) had negative results, including 1 with previous positive results. At 1 year, 19 of 20 patients (95 %) had negative results, including 2 of the 3 with previous positive results. The mean aortic valve gradients were 12 ± 8 mm Hg (n = 21) at discharge and 11 ± 7 mm Hg (n = 18) at 1 year. At a mean follow-up of 30. 3 ± 5. 2 months, the mean gradient was 8. 8 ± 6. 3 mm Hg. ConclusionThe SynerGraft decellularization technology successfully removed antigens from an aortic valve homograft conduit. Aortic root reconstruction with the CryoLife SynerGraft aortic valve homograft resulted in low transvalvular gradients, similar to those seen with standard cryopreserved homografts. These early results suggest an advancement in homograft technology.

In this study we have evaluated the merits of our newly developed calcification-free biologic valve incorporated in a compatible conduit of biologic origin in an animal model. Methods: Porcine aortic valves and main pulmonary arteries were cross-linked in glutaraldehyde, followed by coupling to partially degraded heparin through an intermediate surface-bound substrate containing amino groups. Because commercially available valves are treated only with glutaraldehyde, control aortic valves and main pulmonary arteries were cross-linked in 0. 625 % glutaraldehyde. <b>Valved</b> <b>conduits</b> were fabricated from main pulmonary arteries, which were sewn to the aortic and ventricular ends of aortic <b>valves.</b> <b>Valved</b> <b>conduits</b> were examined for calcification and other pathologic changes after being implanted in the descending thoracic aorta in juvenile sheep for 5 months. Results: Severe calcification was noticed in all layers of cusps (calcium, 231. 86 ± 17. 90 mg/gm) and aortic wall (calcium, 123. 24 ± 24. 72 mg/gm) of aortic valves and main pulmonary arteries (calcium, 135. 43 ± 26. 63 mg/gm) of <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> treated with 0. 625 % glutaraldehyde. Cusps (calcium, 1. 28 ± 0. 22 mg/gm) of the aortic <b>valve</b> of heparin-bonded <b>conduits</b> did not calcify at all.

Immunohistochemical techniques were used to study extracellular matrix constitution (elastin, collagen, fibronectin, and chondroitin sulfate) and cellular infiltration. ResultsThe decellularization procedure resulted in a complete loss of all cellular structures from the entire <b>valve</b> <b>conduit</b> with minimal damage to the extracellular matrix. All transplanted cellular allografts became deformed, swollen, and acellular with major changes in extracellular matrix structure. The transplanted decellularized allografts, however, retained normal preserved valve leaflets comparable to transplanted cellular and acellular syngeneic grafts. With the exception of cellular syngeneic grafts, all other grafts showed retrovalvular thrombi. ConclusionsDamage to the valves caused by decellularization technique is much less than the damage caused by the recipient's immune response. In vitro removal of viable cells in (cryopreserved) homografts may decrease graft failure. Seeding with autologous or major histocompatibility complex–matched donor endothelial cells will be necessary to diminish damage induced by an absent blood-tissue barrier...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} cardiac valve {{replacement}} {{in the early}} sixth decade of the last century, the search continued for ideal cardiac valve substitute with proven structural durability {{over a period of}} 10 to 20 years, central flow orifice without transvalvular gradient, absence of host reactivity deleterious to valve function, non-thrombogenecity without the use of anti-coagulant, resistance to infective endo-carditis, availability with cost effectiveness and ease of surgical implantation 1. The experience with prosthetic tissue valves commenced almost simultaneously with the silastic ball valve and the aortic homograft valve. Homograft aortic valves have been used either as fresh, antibiotic sterilized or cryo-preserved, as a replacement for mitral valve, aortic valve, aortic root replacement, or a conduit between the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk. Homograft cardiac valve or <b>valve</b> <b>conduit</b> is used in correcting some congenital malformation in child-hood, in old age because of higher rate of compli-cation of either bleeding or thromboembolism from anticoagulant used along with mechanical valves, in women wanting a child because of the risk of embryopathy or CNS defect from warfarin anticoa-gulant, patients with risk of hemorrhage from chronic liver disease, active peptic ulcer, bleeding diathesis, in refractory cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis or native valve endocarditis. Fresh sterile homograft is difficult to procure so a method of sterilizing contaminated heart valve from autopsy specimen using low concentration of antibiotic cocktail is needed before its storage by cryo-preservation method...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate a newly developed biologic <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> fixed with genipin used to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow tract in a canine model. Methods: Fresh bovine jugular veins with a retained native valve procured from a slaughterhouse were used as raw materials to fabricate the <b>valved</b> <b>conduits.</b> A naturally occurring crosslinking agent, genipin, was used to fix the procured jugular veins. The glutaraldehyde-fixed counterpart was used as a control. A canine model was used in the study. Results: Echocardiography revealed that the motion of the valvular leaflets in both the glutaraldehyde- and genipin-fixed conduits was satisfactory. The transvalvular pressure gradients of both studied groups were minimal. No endothelium-like cells were observed on the luminal surface of the conduit and the valvular leaflet for the glutaraldehyde-fixed group throughout the entire course of the study. In contrast, endothelium-like cells were observed on the entire surface of the genipin-fixed <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> retrieved at 6 months postoperatively in all the cases studied. There was no evidence of luminal fibrous peel in any the <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> studied. Degradation of valvular leaflet in one of the glutaraldehyde-fixed conduits was observed. In this particular case, thrombus formation was also observed {{on the surface of the}} valvular leaflet. On the other hand, no apparent degradation or thrombus formation was observed on the surfaces of the genipin-fixed valvular leaflet and conduit. A significantly more severe inflammatory reaction was observed for the glutaraldehyde-fixed conduit than for its genipin-fixed counterpart throughout the entire course of the study. The calcium contents of the samples before implantation and those retrieved at distinct implantation duration were minimal for both the glutaraldehyde- and genipin-fixed tissues. Conclusion: Although further studies are necessary, the genipin-fixed <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> appears to have great potential in helping mitigate the complications observed in the commercially available conduits...|$|R
50|$|With the {{descending}} aorta exposed, the surgeon applies a side clamp to the aorta, effectively pinching and isolating {{one side of}} the great vessel. Blood continues to flow to the body's lower half through the unisolated remainder of the aorta. A lengthwise slit is made through the pinched face, and the open end of the <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> is carefully sutured to the slit. Once the suture line is checked for leaks, the aortic partial side clamp is removed and the <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> fills with blood up to the bioprosthetic valve. The valve acts as a check valve, thereby maintaining hemostasis.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{focus of}} this study is to share the {{experience}} and outcomes of Contegra graft implantation in the paediatric and adult population in Pakistan. Methods: Between May 2007 and July 2011, 16 patients, underwent implantation of a Contegra <b>valved</b> <b>conduit.</b> All operations were performed through a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. Indications included: Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (n= 11), Tetralogy of Fallot with absent Pulmonary Valve (PV) syndrome (n= 2), double outlet right ventricle, transposition of great arteries and pulmonary stenosis (n= 1), isolated aortic valve disease (n= 1) and a pseudo-aneurysm with infective endocarditis (n= 1). Conduit sizes varied between 16 - 22 mm. Results: The three in hospital deaths were unrelated to the Contegra <b>valved</b> <b>conduit.</b> One patient was lost to follow up. Of the 12 survivors, 10 are currently free from re-operation or complications related to the conduit while one needed distal pulmonary artery dilatation owing to critical stenosis and another had severe Valvular regurgitation. Echocardiographic evaluation of the Contegra <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> demonstrated no haemodynamically significant valve regurgitation in 10 patients. Conclusion: In this small review of 16 operations using the Contegra <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> for Right Venticular Outflow Tract (RVOT) reconstruction in the paediatric population, we observed good post operative results concerning conduit function. The Contegra conduit provides an excellent substitute to the homograft with satisfactory early and mid-term results though long term results are awaited in Pakista...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{field of}} tissue {{engineering}} {{deals with the}} creation of tissue structures based on patient cells. The scaffold plays {{a central role in the}} creation of 3 -D structures in cardiovascular tissue engineering like small vessels or heart valve prosthesis. An ideal scaffold should have tissue-like mechanical properties and a complete immunologic integrity. As an alternative scaffold the use of fibrin gel was investigated. Methods: Preliminary, the degradation of the fibrin gel was controlled by the supplementation of aprotinin to the culture medium. To prevent tissue from shrinking a mechanical fixation of the gel with 3 -D microstructure culture plates and a chemical fixation with poly-l-lysine in different fixation techniques were studied. The thickness of the gel layer was changed from 1 to 3 mm. The tissue development was analysed by light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Collagen production was detected by the measurement of hydroxyproline. Injection molding techniques were designed for the formation of complex 3 -D tissue structures. Results: The best tissue development was observed at an aprotinin concentration of 20 μg per cc culture medium. The chemical border fixation of the gel by poly-l-lysine showed the best tissue development. Up to a thickness of 3 mm no nutrition problems were observed in the light and transmission electron microscopy. The molding of a simplified <b>valve</b> <b>conduit</b> was possible by the newly developed molding technique. Conclusion: Fibrin gel combines a number of important properties of an ideal scaffold. It can be produced as a complete autologous scaffold. It is moldable and degradation is controllable by the use of aprotini...|$|E
40|$|Propionibacterium acnes {{isolates}} {{usually have}} relatively low virulence {{and are often}} classified as contami-nants when isolated from blood and tissue cultures. We report a patient with Propionibacterium acnes bacte-remia and late prosthetic valve endocarditis, complicated by an aortic root abscess. CASE REPORT The patient was a 50 -year-old man {{with a history of}} a bicus-pid aortic valve and dilated aortic root who had undergone aortic valve replacement surgery with a Hall-Medtronic <b>valve</b> <b>conduit</b> 2 years earlier. The surgery was complicated by a symptomatic loculated pericardial effusion 1 month postoper-atively, which required a subxiphoid pericardial window pro-cedure. A culture of organized fibrin from the pericardial space grew a few colonies of Propionibacterium species, which was considered, at the time, to be a contaminant. The patient was well for the intervening 2 years before being admitted to a community hospital with a 1 -month history of increasing fa-tigue, dyspnea on exertion, chills, and night sweats. Several blood cultures grew gram-positive bacilli. Following transfer to our hospital, the patient’s initial phys-ical examination indicated that he was afebrile and appeared well. Auscultation revealed a soft aortic flow murmur without a diastolic murmur and a crisp, mechanical, second heart sound. Findings from examination of the lungs, abdomen, ex-tremities, and neurological functioning were unremarkable, and nail bed splinter hemorrhages of the second and third digits of the right hand were noted. The patient’s electrocar-diogram showed sinus bradycardia with a first-degree atrioven-tricular block, his chest X ray was unremarkable, his white blood cell count was 11, 630 leukocytes/mm 3 with no bands, and his hemoglobin level was 9. 8 g/dl.

40|$|ObjectiveLimited {{long-term}} outcome {{data are}} available on survival {{and the need for}} aortic root or valve reoperation after surgery for acute ascending aorta dissection. We report our 42 -year experience. MethodsWe reviewed the records of 269 patients who had undergone surgery for acute ascending aorta dissection from July 1969 to June 2011. The mean age at surgery was 62. 1 ± 15. 2 years, and 181 were men (67. 3 %). The distal operation was limited to hemiarch replacement. The proximal aortic operation groups included a composite <b>valve</b> <b>conduit</b> in 66 patients (24. 5 %), aortic root repair in 112 (41. 6 %), and isolated supracoronary ascending aorta replacement in 91 (33. 8 %). ResultsOperative morbidity occurred in 224 patients (83. 3 %) and mortality in 44 (16. 4 %), with similar rates among the groups (P = . 894 and P = . 466, respectively). The mean follow-up was 9. 7 ± 7. 5 years. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimate at 10 and 20 years was 65. 5 % ± 3. 6 % and 28. 7 % ± 4. 3 %, respectively, and was similar among the groups (P = . 227). Reoperation on the aortic root or valve occurred in 20 patients (8. 9 %) at a median of 6. 8 years (range, 0. 2 - 20. 3). The freedom from reoperation rate at 10 and 20 years was 91. 5 % ± 2. 3 % and 79. 3 % ± 6. 1 %, respectively, with no difference among the groups (P = . 605). ConclusionsOperative morbidity and mortality rates are significant after repair of acute ascending aorta dissection. Aortic root surgery can be performed without an apparent increase in the prevalence of operative morbidity or mortality; however, patients remain at risk of subsequent aortic root or valve surgery...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Evaluate {{long-term}} {{results of}} autologous pericardial <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> in the pulmonary outflow. Methods: Between June 1983 and October 1993, 82 conduits {{were placed in}} the outflow of the venous ventricle. Patients who received homografts (n = 2 patients), heterografts (n = 3 patients), and valveless conduits (n = 19 patients) and those patients who died within 90 days after the operation were excluded. Fifty-four survivors of pulmonary outflow reconstruction with fresh autologous pericardial <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> were followed up from 5 to 15 years (mean, 7. 47 ± 2. 8 years). Diagnosis include d -transposition of great arteries (n = 16 patients), L -transposition of great arteries (n = 14 patients), tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (n = 11 patients), truncus arteriosus (n = 10 patients), and double-outlet ventricle (n = 3 patients). Implantation age ranged from 0. 25 to 24 years (mean, 5. 2 ± 4. 2 years). Median conduit diameter was 16 mm. Two-dimensional echocardiographic Doppler evaluations were made yearly; 9 patients underwent cardiac catheterization. Reintervention for stenosis was indicated when the pressure gradient exceeded 50 mm Hg. Results: Three late deaths were unrelated to the conduit. Thirty-five autologous pericardial <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> increased in diameter (1 - 7 mm), remained unchanged in 15 patients, and reduced 1 to 2 mm in 4 patients. The median diameter was 18 mm at the last evaluation (P =. 0001). Eight patients required conduit-related reoperation 3 to 8 years after the implantation. Two patients underwent balloon dilation of the autologous pericardial <b>valved</b> <b>conduit.</b> No conduit had to be replaced. Freedom from reintervention at 5 and 10 years was 92 % and 76 %, being 100 % at 10 years for conduits larger than 16 mm at time of implantation. Conclusions: Autologous pericardial <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> show excellent long-term results and compare favorably with other conduits. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2000; 119 : 869 - 79...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: This report reviews our {{experience}} with repeated aortic root replacement after failure of cryopreserved aortic allografts placed during childhood and compares replacement with aortic allografts, pulmonary autografts, and mechanical <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> in these patients. Methods: This was {{a retrospective analysis}} of all such patients from 1986 through May 2001. Results: There were 25 operations (11 aortic allografts, 9 pulmonary autografts, and 5 mechanical <b>valved</b> <b>conduits)</b> among 23 patients. The mean time to reoperation was 6. 3 years. There were 2 in-hospital deaths (8 %, 1 patient with a pulmonary autograft and 1 with a mechanical <b>valved</b> <b>conduit).</b> There were 2 early nonfatal valve-related events (1 patient with an aortic allograft and 1 with a pulmonary autograft). There were no late valve-related deaths and 2 late non-valve-related deaths of patients with aortic allografts placed. No variable predicted early death or early valve-related event. No differences in preoperative characteristics, hospital variables, early outcomes, or late outcomes were detected among the groups. Overall, 19 patients are alive (18 in New York Heart Association functional class I and 1 in New York Heart Association functional class III) at a mean follow-up of 49 months. Two late aortic allograft failures necessitated reoperation. All patients with successful pulmonary autografts had excellent autograft function at a mean follow-up of 68 months. All early survivors with mechanical <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> are alive and free of valve-related events (mean follow-up 71 months). Five-year freedoms from valve-related death or event (Kaplan-Meier) were 84 % for all patients, 91 % for aortic allografts, 78 % for pulmonary autografts, and 80 % for mechanical <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> (no statistically significant group differences by log-rank test). Conclusions: Replacement of cryopreserved aortic root allografts placed during childhood is safe. Five-year pulmonary autograft durability is excellent, although the risk of early failure may be increased. Differences in 5 -year conduit longevity were not detectable.
