500|$|The liberum veto (Latin for [...] "free veto") was a {{parliamentary}} device in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It {{was a form}} of unanimity <b>voting</b> <b>rule</b> that allowed any member of the Sejm (legislature) to force an immediate end to the current session and to nullify any legislation that had already been passed at the session by shouting, Sisto activitatem! (Latin: [...] "I stop the activity!") or Nie pozwalam! (Polish: [...] "I do not allow!"). The rule was in place from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century in the Sejm's parliamentary deliberations. It was {{based on the premise that}} since all Polish noblemen were equal, every measure that came before the Sejm had to be passed unanimously. The liberum veto was a key part of the political system of the Commonwealth, strengthening democratic elements and checking royal power and went against the European-wide trend of having a strong executive (absolute monarchy).|$|E
500|$|In 1855 the {{national}} Know Nothing convention {{split on the}} subject of slavery. [...] Prominent antislavery Know Nothing supporters in Massachusetts, including Henry Wilson, began another attempt (after having failed in 1854) to form a party with abolition as a major focus. [...] This effort resulted {{in the formation of the}} Republican Party, which sought to negotiate with the Know Nothings for a fusion of the two parties. [...] However, Massachusetts Know Nothing leadership refused fusion and Republican leadership refused coalition, with many Republicans skeptical of Gardner's fidelity to the antislavery cause despite his support for fusion. [...] The parties ended up fielding separate slates of candidates, and many Know Nothing politicians and supporters switched allegiance. [...] In the fall election Gardner, running on a strictly nativist platform, garnered 38% of the vote, to the 27% of Republican Julius Rockwell. [...] With the new plurality <b>voting</b> <b>rule</b> in effect, Gardner won the election, but the split (and disaffection in some circles with the Know Nothing agenda) cost him support from former Free Soilers and Democrats. [...] In the 1856 election Gardner benefited from a deal with the Republicans, who refused to run a candidate for governor in exchange for Know Nothing support for their presidential candidate, John C. Frémont. [...] He easily won reelection, although many Republicans voted for a protest candidate instead of supporting him. [...] He attempted to parlay the Republican support into an election to the United States Senate (a matter then decided by the state senate early in its session) replacing Charles Sumner. [...] However, Republican operatives maneuvered the Senate into voting before Gardner's speech opening the 1857 session, and Sumner was easily reelected.|$|E

40|$|Sequential <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> and correspondences {{provide a}} way for agents to make group {{decisions}} when the set of available options has a multi-issue structure. One important question about sequential <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> (correspondences) is whether they satisfy two crucial criteria, namely neutrality and efficiency. Recently, Benoit and Kornhauser established an important result about seat-by-seat <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> (which are a special case of sequential <b>voting</b> <b>rules)</b> : they proved that if the multi-issue domain satisfies some properties, then the only seat-by-seat rules being either efficient or neutral are dictatorships. However, {{there are still some}} cases not covered by their results, including a very important and interesting case—voting correspondences. In this paper, we extend the impossibility theorems by Benoit and Kornhauser to voting correspondences, and obtain a dichotomy theorem on the existence of efficient or neutral sequential (seat-by-seat) <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> and correspondences. Therefore, the question of whether sequential (seat-by-seat) <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> (correspondences) can be efficient or neutral is now completely answered. ...|$|R

50|$|Hervé Moulin {{showed in}} 1988 that {{whenever}} {{there are at}} least 4 candidates and at least 25 voters, no resolute (single-valued) Condorcet consistent <b>voting</b> <b>rule</b> satisfies the participation criterion. However, when there are at most 3 candidates, the minimax method (with some fixed tie-breaking) satisfies both the Condorcet and the participation criterion. Similarly, when there are 4 candidates and at most 11 voters, there is a <b>voting</b> <b>rule</b> that satisfies both criteria, but no such rule exists for 4 candidates and 12 voters. Similar incompatibilities have also been proven for set-valued voting rules.|$|E
5000|$|For {{a strict}} <b>voting</b> <b>rule,</b> the {{converse}} of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem is true. Indeed, a strict <b>voting</b> <b>rule</b> is dictatorial if {{and only if}} it always selects the most-liked candidate of the dictator among the possible outcomes; in particular, it does not depend on the other voters' ballots. As a consequence, it is not manipulable: the dictator is perfectly defended by her sincere ballot, and the other voters have no impact on the outcome, hence they have no incentive to deviate from sincere voting. Thus, we obtain the following equivalence.In the theorem, {{as well as in the}} corollary, it is not needed to assume that any alternative can be elected. It is only assumed that at least three of them can win, i.e. are possible outcomes of the <b>voting</b> <b>rule.</b> It is possible that some other alternatives can be elected in no circumstances: the theorem and the corollary still apply. However, the corollary is sometimes presented under a less general form: instead of assuming that the rule has at least three possible outcomes, it is sometimes assumed that [...] contains at least three elements and that the <b>voting</b> <b>rule</b> is onto, i.e. every alternative is a possible outcome. The assumption of being onto is sometimes even replaced with the assumption that the rule is unanimous, in the sense that if all voters prefer the same candidate, then she must be elected.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether letting people vote for multiple candidates would yield policy moderation. We {{do so in}} a setting that takes three key features of elections into account, namely, strategic voting, endogenous candidacy and policy motivation {{on the part of the}} candidates. We consider two classes of <b>voting</b> <b>rules.</b> One class consists of the <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> where each voter casts several equally-weighed votes for the different candidates. The other class consists of the <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> where each voter rank-orders the candidates. We identify conditions under which these <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> yield policy moderation. We also show that these <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> may yield policy extremism instead of policy moderation if one (or several) of the conditions is not satisfied! Finally, we find that amongst these <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> the extent of policy moderation is maximal under the Borda Count if we consider only equilibria where all candidates are serious contenders. However, this result does not carry over to spoiler equilibria, where Approval Voting can yield more moderate policy outcomes than the Borda Count.

40|$|Lu and Boutilier {{proposed}} {{a novel approach}} based on "minimax regret" to use classical score based <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> in the setting where preferences can be any partial (instead of complete) orders over the set of alternatives.

We call this attack "manipulative elicitation. " More specifically, {{it may be possible to}} (partially) elicit the preferences of the agents in a way that makes some distinguished alternative win the election who may not be a winner if we elicit every preference completely. More alarmingly, we show that the related computational task is polynomial time solvable for a large class of <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> which includes all scoring rules, maximin, Copeland^α for every α∈[0, 1], simplified Bucklin <b>voting</b> <b>rules,</b> etc. We then show that introducing a parameter per pair of alternatives which specifies the minimum number of partial preferences where this pair of alternatives must be comparable makes the related computational task of manipulative elicitation for all common <b>voting</b> <b>rules</b> including a class of scoring rules which includes the plurality, k-approval, k-veto, veto, and Borda <b>voting</b> <b>rules,</b> maximin, Copeland^α for every α∈[0, 1], and simplified Bucklin <b>voting</b> <b>rules.</b> Hence, in this work, we discover a fundamental vulnerability in using minimax regret based approach in partial preferential setting and propose a novel way to tackle it.
