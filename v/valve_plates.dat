50|$|Quadrajet carburetors have {{mechanical}} secondary {{throttle plates}} {{operated by a}} progressive linkage; the primaries open before the secondaries, and use on-demand air <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> above the secondary throttle plates. The air valves are connected by a cam and linkage to the secondary fuel metering rods. As the airflow increases through the secondary bores, the air valves are pushed down, rotating a cam that lifts the secondary metering rods. The secondary rods are tapered {{in a similar fashion}} to the primary metering rods, effectively increasing the size of the fuel metering holes as the rods are lifted and delivering more fuel. Therefore, the position of the air valve will control both fuel and air flow through the secondary venturis, even if the secondary throttle plates are fully opened. Thus the Quadrajet acts like a vacuum-secondary carburetor and only delivers more fuel as it is needed.|$|E

The aim of this research is to develop a design methodology that is general enough to design all types of <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> and the simple enough not to require advanced technical knowledge from the user. A new style of valve plate designs has been developed that comprehensively considers all previous design techniques and does not require significant changes to the manufacturing processes of <b>valve</b> <b>plates.</b> The design methodology utilizes a previously developed accurate computer model of the physical phenomenon. This allows the precise optimization of the valve plate design through the use of simulations rather than expensive trial and error processes. The design of the valve plate is clarified into the form of an optimization problem. This formulation into an optimization problem has motivated the selection of an optimization algorithm that satisfies the requirements of the design.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{fundamentals}} for fabrication of stepped microstructures from fluorinated polymers using the LIGA technique are discussed. By means of these developments, {{applicability of the}} LIGA technique has been enhanced considerably. The process developed to fabricate micropatterned molding tools for plastic molding of LIGA microstructures with two or more level heights is described. A first single-step LIGA molding tool is used to structure a modified resist layer by plastic molding. This pre-structured resist layer is then structured by deep-etch X-ray lithography and subsequently used as a negative mold for electroforming of the stepped molding tool. Using this molding tool LIGA microstructures with a real three-dimensional shape have been produced by plastic molding. The essential developments are shown. In LIGA technique, PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) is the molding material preferred for plastic molding. However, many applications, especially in medical and environmental technologies, require materials with high chemical and thermal stability. Especially for this, fluorinated polymers are well suited but could not be microstructured by the LIGA process so far. Therefore the process of vacuum hot embossing of microstructures from PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) was developed. The potentials of both developments are demonstrated by the example of molded stepped micro <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> of PMMA and PVDF. These micro <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> were built in miniaturized valves and tested successfully. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by H.

40|$|Virtual {{prototyping}} {{of positive}} pumps and motors is incredibly useful, increasing {{speed of development}} and lowering cost. The calculations of fluids discharge pressure, displaced by a swashplate-type-axial piston pump/motor {{is dependent on the}} load impedance driven by the unit. The load impedance is estimated by a variable orifice found downstream of the unit. Similarly, the suction line impedance is also estimated with an orifice. The current project aims to evaluate the various loading architectures in their ability to quickly and accurately create the desired impedance. The robustness of the loading architectures was tested {{on a wide range of}} pump sizes, speeds, pressures, and displacements. The estimated initial conditions of the loading architectures, such as the orifice areas and line volumes and pressures are very efficient means of converging to the correct discharge pressure. To develop a model, based on past simulation, a full factorial design of experiments (DOE) was performed to generate the required training data set. The DOE revealed the models sensitivity to the normally unknown variables which contributed to large variations in accuracy. However, after analyzing the impact of other variables, an alternate approach was taken. By creating a variant of the simulation, which sets port pressures equal to line pressures, orifice areas can be effectively removed from the equation. In order to compare the performance, ideal <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> specific to each code variant should be used. This is because arbitrary <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> may favor one over the other, yielding extraneous conclusions.

The <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> utilizing damping holes show excellent performance in avoiding air-release and cavitation. This study aims to reduce the noise emitted from an axial piston pump using a novel <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> utilizing damping holes. A dynamic pump model is developed, in which the fluid properties are carefully modeled to capture the phenomena of air release and cavitation. The causes of different noise sources are investigated using the model. A comprehensive parametric analysis is conducted to enhance {{the understanding of the}} effects of the <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> parameters on the noise sources. A multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization method is proposed to optimize the parameters of <b>valve</b> <b>plate.</b> The amplitudes of the swash plate moment and flow rates in the inlet and outlet ports are defined as the objective functions. The pressure overshoot and undershoot in the piston chamber are limited by properly constraining the highest and lowest pressure values. A comparison of the various noise sources between the original and optimized designs over a wide range of pressure levels shows that the noise sources are reduced at high pressures. The results of the sound pressure level measurements show that the optimized <b>valve</b> <b>plate</b> reduces the noise level by 1.6  dB(A) at the rated working condition.

To better understand the factors that affect reciprocating compressor valve performance and life, a Gas Machinery Research Council (GMRC) program has been initiated to systematically investigate the physical behavior of <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> during compressor operation. A reciprocating compressor’s valve plate life is generally considered to be a function of the plate’s cyclic kinematics, transient stresses, and material properties.

Hydrostatic displacement units and their standard fluids based on mineral oils {{have been developed}} to a high technical standard. The fluids in this case are biologically harmful and often toxic. Fluids that are environmentally friendly (for example synthetic ester) must not include additives that are toxic. Due to the lack of additives, many environmentally friendly fluids have worse tribological properties than standard fluids.

40|$|Improved efficiency, better {{controllability}} and {{low noise}} {{are the most}} demanding features form a displacement machine now-a-days. Most of the conventional displacement machines are basically a reciprocating pumping element controlled by <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> or {{with the help of}} check valve [1]. This kind of hydraulic machines loose efficiency dramatically at partial displacement because all of the pistons remain at high pressure at the cycle time and due to pressure inside the piston leakage and shear losses increases. One approach to improve the efficiency of the displacement machine can be controlling each hydraulic piston by using programmable faster valves called digital valve. As the total displacement will be controlled digitally, the total system is called Digital Displacement Technology. In digital displacement machine it is possible to disconnect some of the pistons from the load and the piston will connect only with the low pressure side, minimizing losses due to leakage and shear. As the valve will control directly with digital controller it will eliminate the necessity of servo-hydraulic control required by conventional systems. Digital valves can open fully and close again with the input signal within one revaluation of the shaft, so it gives better control to the pumping element results reduction in hysteresis and increase the linearity of the pumping element. In Digital Displacement machines by controlling the valves pistons are connected with the machine when pressure is equal, but in the traditional machines piston connection was pre-determined with the shaft angle. By doing the piston control efficiency of the machine will improve and the sound generates for the decompression flow will be reduced [17].

A comparison of the Cu- 10 Sn- 10 Pb and Cu- 10 Sn- 3 Bi powder metal <b>valve</b> <b>plates</b> showed that the differences in wear behavior between the two alloys arose due to the soft phase bismuth in the alloy that is known to cause both solid and liquid metal embrittlement of copper alloys. A lead-free alternative was developed by using infiltration of high-tin alloys into porous bronze compacts compacted at 350 MPa and sintered for 2 hours at 650 °C to replicate the dual phase structure of leaded bronze. The resulting engineered composite had a lower volume loss than samples of leaded and bismuth bronze under lubricated wear test conditions. It also possessed a similar coefficient of friction and abrasive/plowing mechanism of wear as the Cu- 10 Sn- 10 Pb alloys. The results of wear testing show that the alloy demonstrates wear resistant properties comparable to those of the very successful leaded-bronze alloys. Furthermore, the microstructure of the composite alloy can be engineered by increasing the compaction pressure and sintering temperature of the bronze to balance strength and percentage of the soft phase to match the end use. Also critical to the alloys performance is the control of copper-tin intermetallic formation and growth. The amount of intermetallics could be controlled by minimizing time at temperature during infiltration.
