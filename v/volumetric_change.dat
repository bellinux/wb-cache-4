By contrast, {{the behavior of}} compressible fluids, and especially gases, demonstrates the essence of elastic energy with negligible complication. The simple thermodynamic formula: [...] where dU is an infinitesimal change in recoverable internal energy U, P is the uniform pressure (a force per unit area) applied to the material sample of interest, and dV is the infinitesimal change in volume that corresponds to the change in internal energy. The minus sign appears because dV is negative under compression by a positive applied pressure which also increases the internal energy. Upon reversal, the work that is done by a system is the negative {{of the change in}} its internal energy corresponding to the positive dV of an increasing volume. In other words, the system loses stored internal energy when doing work on its surroundings. Pressure is stress and <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> corresponds to changing the relative spacing of points within the material. The stress-strain-internal energy relationship of the foregoing formula is repeated in formulations for elastic energy of solid materials with complicated crystalline structure.|$|E

The brain <b>volumetric</b> <b>changes</b> of prefrontal cortex are highly associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. Besides, brain atrophy re-veals the expanded interhemispheric fissure and the concomitant increasing cerebrospinal fluid volume. Thus, the quantitative as-sessment of brain <b>volumetric</b> <b>changes</b> {{is an important}} consideration for clinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we first proposed an approach that uses near-infrared brain volumet-ric imaging to detect brain <b>volumetric</b> <b>changes.</b> The healthy, aged, and typical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains were modeled with dif-ferent characterization of brain <b>volumetric</b> <b>changes</b> from in vivo MRI data based on time-resolved 3 -D Monte Carlo simulation.

The filling ability and <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> (in mm 3) were evaluated by Micro-CT (Bruker-MicroCT, Kontich, Belgium) using resin models with cavities 3 mm deep and 1 mm in diameter. The cavities were filled with materials to evaluate filling ability, and then scanned by Micro-CT. After 7 and 30 days immersed in distilled water, the filled cavities were scanned again to evaluate the <b>volumetric</b> <b>change.</b> MTA Angelus (MTA), Biodentine (BIO) and zinc oxide-eugenol cement (ZOE) were evaluated. Data were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test with 5 % significance level. Results The results suggested correlated or complementary data between the proposed tests. At 7 days, BIO showed higher solubility and at 30 days, showed higher <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> in comparison with MTA (p 0. 05) at 7 days. At 30 days, they presented similar solubility.

Background: The <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> that occur during the polymerization of dental composite restorations {{are considered to be}} one of the most significant contributing factors when considering the failure in composite restorations. Volumetric shrinkage of more than 2 % is considered to be enough to result in the occurrence of secondary caries resulting in fracture of restorations and failure in the adhesive layer of a resin restoration. The total <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> of dental resins can be attributed to three main factors: Firstly, the polymerization reaction that results in the formation of a polymer chain. Secondly, the increase of the exothermic thermal effects produced by the polymerization reaction and thirdly, light irradiance energy that is transferred to the dental resin. Materials and Methods: A specially designed electronic mercury dilatometer at the UWC Oral and Dental Research Institute was used to {{determine the}} <b>volumetric</b> <b>change.</b> The light intensity was set at 500 mW/cm 2. The mercury dilatometer measured the <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> every 0. 5 seconds during the 35 second irradiation exposure time. The materials tested were Z 250 as the control and four bulk fill flowable composites. The volume of voids within the cured material samples were assessed with a Micro- 3 D ct reconstruction (General Electric Phoenix). Results: The sequence of total <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> from least to most were: Z 250 < Filtek bulk fill < Xtra-Base bulk fill < SDR < Venus bulk fill. The speed/rate of shrinkage of the bulk fill flowable composites were faster than that of Z 250, while the 2 bulk fill flowables with the highest shrinkage speed (SDR and Venus) also had the highest total <b>volumetric</b> <b>change.</b> Of the different materials tested the <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> of Z 250 (1. 13 %) was the lowest and significantly less (p< 0. 05) than that of SDR (1. 56 %) and Venus (1. 72 %). The Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison test indicated that the material with the highest filler content (Z 250) also showed the lowest shrinkage (1. 13 %) but this effect of the filler content could not be seen in the bulk fill flowable composites. The volume of the voids within the test specimens were determined and were represented as a percentage of the cured volume (49. 087 mm³). Venus had the largest percentage of voids (1. 18 %) in the test specimen (specimen volume: 49. 087 mm³), followed by Z 250 with 0, 5248 %, Xtra base with 0, 00015 %, SDR with 0, 00059 % and Filtek bulk fill with 0, 00069 %.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A specially designed electronic mercury dilatometer was used to {{determine the}} <b>volumetric</b> <b>change.</b> The light intensity was 500 mW/cm 2. The mercury dilatometer measured the <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> every 0. 5 seconds during the 35 second irradiation exposure time. The materials tested were Z 250 as standard and control. Four bulk fill flowable composites were tested. RESULTS: The sequence of total <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> was found to be: Z 250 < Filtek bulk fill < Xtra-Base bulk fill < SDR < Venus bulk fill. The speed of shrinkage of the bulk fill flowables was faster than that of Z 250, while the 2 flowables with the highest shrinkage speed (SDR and Venus) also had the highest total <b>volumetric</b> <b>change.</b> Of the different materials tested the <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> of Z 250 (1. 13 %) was the lowest and significantly less (p< 0. 05) than that of SDR (1. 55 %) and Venus (1. 72 %). The material with the highest filler content (Z 250) also showed the lowest shrinkage (1. 13 %) but this effect could not be seen in the flowables. In general, it was found that a 35 second irradiation period (with a light intensity of 500 mW/cm 2) was satisfactory for complete polymerization of the resins. CONCLUSIONS: The volumetric changes and speed of shrinkage were higher for all 4 bulk fill flowable composites than for Z 250. SDR and Venus flowables had the fastest and highest volumetric shrinkage. Clinical significance: The manufacturers of bulk fill flowable composites advocate filling layers of 4 mm.

To test {{this idea of}} different tropical cyclones delivering consistent coastal change, a landform with such evolution is needed. One such landform is a spit. What contributions do tropical cyclones give toward {{the evolution of a}} spit, and do tropical cyclones give the same kinds of impacts? To determine if tropical cyclones have similar impacts, shoreline and <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> from four storms impacting Bolivar Peninsula are considered. Being a southwest-trended spit at a length of 33. 5 kilometers, storm impacts are measured in the form of one dimensional shoreline and two dimensional <b>volumetric</b> <b>change.</b> These impacts are abstracted into shoreline change and <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> patterns. These patterns are identified and compared for differences between each storm and similarity among all storms. Results indicate that shoreline accretionary zones vary alongshore. Results from Hurricane Ike indicate an accretionary zone ten kilometers from the distal end. Shoreline change patterns for Hurricane Rita show an unstable accretionary zone at four kilometers from the distal end. Results for Tropical Storm Fay indicate an unstable accretionary zone that begins at the distal end and continues {{to the middle of the}} spit. In terms of similarity for shoreline change, all patterns from storms demonstrated erosion near Rollover Fish Pass. One dimensional <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> patterns were entirely erosive for Hurricanes Rita and Ike, and Tropical Storm Fay had by small zones of accretion near the distal portion of the spit. Tropical Storm Josephine demonstrated an accretion zone between the middle and distal portion of the spit. Results from two dimensional <b>volumetric</b> <b>change</b> patterns suggest a threshold for inland penetration. Tropical Storm Fay showed a ten to twenty meter wide pattern of erosion around five kilometers from the distal end and near the proximal end of the spit, and Hurricane Rita demonstrated a twenty meter wide pattern of erosion near the distal end.
