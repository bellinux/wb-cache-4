50|$|Herbert Hill led Birfield {{to develop}} the {{constant}} <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> breakthrough which permitted reliable front wheel drive {{and led to the}} development of the Mini and the subsequent popularity of front wheel drive cars. He retired in 1961 but remained a member of the board.|$|E
50|$|NTN Driveshaft in Columbus, Indiana {{produces}} constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints</b> used in four-wheel, front-wheel and {{all-wheel drive}} cars.|$|R
50|$|The Laplander used {{constant}} <b>velocity</b> <b>joints,</b> of {{the type}} invented by Alfred H. Rzeppa, in its front axle.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the bearing products produced by the company, the facility manufactures constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints</b> and precision equipment.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, {{due to the}} {{increasing}} worldwide need for lighter, quieter, smoother riding constant velocity joints and their subcomponents, NTN Corporation created a subsidiary in Fukuroi, Shizuoka called NTN Fukuroi Corporation. This was their third constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> manufacturing facility in Japan, and their fourteenth globally.|$|E
50|$|The {{constant}} <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> {{used to make}} modern articulated {{drive shafts}} was unheard of as yet and even the simpler Hooke-type universal joint wasn't yet in common use. Thornycroft's usual practice for prop shafts {{at the time was}} to use a flexible leather disk joint. To save weight, the axle casings were cast in aluminium.|$|E
50|$|Herbert Hill {{pushed his}} team to make {{continuous}} improvements to the basic Rzeppa constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> and was rewarded in the 1960s when much of the world's motor industry switched to front wheel drive using Birfield joints, the CV joints now made by GKN Driveline and currently installed in {{more than one-third of}} all new cars worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Founded in 1971, NTN Bearing-Singapore is a {{regional}} distribution center of bearings, constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints</b> and precision {{equipment for the}} Southeast Asia region.|$|R

50|$|Guangzhou NTN-Yulon Drivetrain {{was formed}} in 2002 to {{manufacture}} constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints.</b> The company is a partnership with Yulon Group, a company that manufactures automobiles through Aeolus Motor Corporation and South East Motor Corporation.|$|R
50|$|For the {{transmission}} gearboxes, all DTM cars currently uses semi-automatic transmission with 6-speed gearbox operated by paddle shifters since 2012 season. From 2000-2011, all DTM cars were used sequential manual transmission with 6-speed gearbox operated by gear lever. The clutch of all DTM cars are CFRP 4-plate clutch operated by foot-pedal. Mechanical limited-slip differential are also allowed and constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> tripod driveshafts are also used.|$|E
50|$|However, by {{the late}} 1980s, with {{extensive}} Japanese competition in both the axle and constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> business, the company started selling off its steel and fasteners businesses. By 1991, it had disposed {{of all of the}} assets within these two business lines. This included the closure of its iconic Bilston factory in the West Midlands in 1989. The factory buildings were demolished soon after, but the offices (built in the late 1950s) were not demolished until 1995.|$|E
5000|$|The TT RS {{has a new}} short-shift {{close-ratio}} six-speed manual transmission, {{and like}} all [...] "RS" [...] models, is only available with Audi's 'trademark' quattro four-wheel-drive system, with the TT RS using a specially adapted version of the latest generation multi-plate clutch from Haldex Traction. Additions to the quattro system include a constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> before the cardan propeller shaft, and a compact rear-axle differential - upgraded {{to cope with the}} increased torque from the five-cylinder turbo engine.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, NTK Precision Axle Corporation began {{business}} with its sole facility in Frankfort, IN. The subsidiary manufactures wheel hub assemblies for {{four wheel drive}} and front wheel drive vehicles as well as axles for constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} 2004, NTN Mie Corporation and Shangzhou NTN-Guangyang Corporation were formed for bearing {{fabrication}} while Nagano Works, Kuwana Works, Iwata Works, and Okayama Works earned ISO/TS16949 and ISO9001 certifications. Next year, NTN Kamiina Corporation and NTN's General Research & Development Center (Iwata) were formed domestically while NTN Investment Corporation (China), NTN-NIDEC (Thailand) and NTN Manufacturing India were formed abroad. The year after, in 2006, NTN Corporation made two grand investments. These investments included infusions into IFA-Antriebstechnik GmbH, {{a producer of}} constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints</b> in IFA Group as well as SNR Roulements, a sub-tier of Renault (which became part of NTN Corporation in 2008). During that same year, NTN Fukuroi Corporation became the company's third local factory for constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
50|$|NTN USA Corporation, {{based in}} Mount Prospect, Illinois, {{was founded in}} 1990. It is the United States holding company for several {{subsidiaries}} that supply ball, roller & mounted bearings, bearing units, constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints</b> for the aircraft, automotive, fabrication & forklift fields in addition to power transmission equipment.|$|R
5000|$|.....transfer {{power from}} the engine to the wheels, {{allowing}} articulation and movement from steering and suspension. The three major elements are: Inboard Constant Velocity Joints (CVJ) including lubrication and sealing systems, Interconnecting shafts and Outboard Constant <b>Velocity</b> <b>Joint</b> (CVJ) including lubrication and sealing system. The Inboard Joint is a plunging joint that allows the effective length of the sideshaft to adjust due to suspension movement. The Outboard Joint needs to transfer power effectively through {{a wide range of}} angles (up to 53 degrees).|$|E
5000|$|The {{universal}} joint, one of {{the earliest}} means of transmitting power between two angled shafts, was invented by Gerolamo Cardano in the 16th century. The fact that it failed to maintain constant velocity during rotation was recognized by Robert Hooke in the 17th century, who proposed the first constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint,</b> consisting of two Cardan joints offset by 90 degrees, so as to cancel out the velocity variations. This is the [...] "double Cardan", shown below. Many different types of constant-velocity joints have been invented since then.|$|E
50|$|The second way he {{contributed to}} the {{development}} of front-wheel-drive vehicles was in designing and in some cases manufacturing front-wheel-drive cars. The Tracta Gephi was his first design and it was this car that inspired him to design a constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint.</b> All subsequent Tracta cars, and there were about two hundred manufactured between 1927 and 1932, used it. The first of these was raced at Le Mans in 1927 completing the 24-hour race. The Tracta cars used engines from S.C.A.P. from 1100 cc to 1600 cc, and Continental and Hotchkiss, from 2700 cc to 3300 cc.|$|E
25|$|CitroÃ«n had {{developed}} expertise with front-wheel drive {{due to the}} pioneering Traction Avant, {{which was the first}} mass-produced steel monocoque front-wheel-drive car in the world. The 2CV was originally equipped with a sliding splined joint, and twin Hookes type universal joints on its driveshafts; later models used constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints</b> and a sliding splined joint.|$|R
50|$|The four cylinder, side valve, 1185 cc engine had its all {{synchromesh}} equipped, four speed, gearbox {{mounted in}} front of it with gear selection via cables. The drive was transmitted to the front wheels via short shafts and constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints.</b> The steering used a rack and pinion mechanism. Suspension was independent all round using torsion bars at the rear.|$|R
50|$|Power {{steering}} became {{standard equipment}} {{with a new}} rack-and-pinion system, rather than recirculating ball. Changes {{were made to the}} rear suspension layout, which also meant the exhaust pipe now exited from the left, rather than right-hand side. The rear brake calipers and rotors were also changed and the drive shafts (half shafts) were upgraded from universal <b>joints</b> to constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints</b> on certain models.|$|R
5000|$|Most shaft-drive systems {{consist of}} a drive shaft (also called a [...] "propeller shaft" [...] or Cardan shaft) {{extending}} from the transmission in front to the differential in the rear. The differentiating characteristic of the Hotchkiss drive {{is the fact that}} it uses universal joints at both ends of the driveshaft, which is not enclosed. The use of two universal joints, properly phased and with parallel alignment of the drive and driven shafts, allows the use of simple cross-type universals. In contrast, a torque tube arrangement uses only a single universal at the end of the transmission tailshaft, typically a constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to transmitting the traction forces, the torque tube is hollow and contains the rotating driveshaft. Inside the hollow torque ball is the universal joint of the driveshaft that allows relative motion {{between the two}} ends of the driveshaft. In most applications the drive shaft uses a single universal joint which has the disadvantage that it causes speed fluctuations in the driveshaft when the shaft is not straight. The Hotchkiss drive uses two universal joints which {{has the effect of}} canceling the speed fluctuations and gives a constant speed even when the shaft is no longer straight [...] The 1963-66 AMC Rambler big cars use a double-Cardan constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> in V8 powered models to eliminate driveshaft fluctuations, though six cylinder and earlier V8 models used only one standard universal joint.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{quality of}} the lancers' wards must be, {{according}} to Basta, [...] "velocity and collision velocity, i.e. <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> mass"; The gun armor is, besides the spear, a short sword for tip and picks that [...] "can greatly benefit in retreat." [...] On the [...] "rules of residence", Basta illustrates the rules already dictated by Alessandro Farnese: the commissioner. It has to carry out topographic surveys and deal with all the logistical problems {{with the help of}} a [...] "forier major", also providing the surveillance system for the equinox. Another important chapter is the one devoted to remote viewing, which Basta underlines as one of the main tasks of the cavalry. In this part, he sets out with great precision the various procedures to be followed to secure the large army of enemy surprises. Especially of personal experiences in the Netherlands and France, although he attributes the merit of introducing this use of cavalry to Duke of Alba. Finally, Basta deals with the tactical organization of light cavalry in combat, recommending the crescent moon, rather than the manipulative ones, in lines, in chessboard, in columns.|$|E
50|$|In November 1995 {{associate}} Dana Corporation bought GKN's axle group. At {{that time}} GKN held 34 per {{cent of the}} world market for constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints.</b> At the same time GKN took larger shares of its other driveline joint ventures with Dana in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. From the late 1990s, the company built a major global business in powder metallurgy, which operates as the GKN Powdered Metallurgy group.|$|R
50|$|It {{was then}} in 2010 that NTN entered the wind energy market via the {{establishment}} of Seohan-NTN Bearing Company. This was a joint-venture with Seohan in South Korea. Additionally, NTN Driveshaft do Brasil and NTN Noto Corporation were formed for constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints</b> and industrial machinery bearings. Most recently, however, NTN partnered with Luoyang LYC to distribute bearings in China, with mass production in the country expected to begin in 2012.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{methods for}} {{the determination of}} a humanoid robot's <b>joint</b> <b>velocities</b> and accelerations directly from link-mounted Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) each containing a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer. No information about the global pose of the floating base or its links is required and precise knowledge of the link IMU poses is not necessary due to presented calibration routines. Additionally, a filter is introduced to fuse gyroscope angular <b>velocities</b> with <b>joint</b> position measurements and compensate the computed <b>joint</b> <b>velocities</b> for time-varying gyroscope biases. The resulting <b>joint</b> <b>velocities</b> are subject to less noise and delay than filtered velocities computed from numerical differentiation of joint potentiometer signals, leading to superior performance in joint feedback control as demonstrated in experiments performed on a SARCOS hydraulic humanoid.

5000|$|The Thompson {{constant}} <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> (TCVJ), {{also known}} as a Thompson coupling, assembles two cardan joints within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft. A control yoke is added to keep the input and output shafts aligned. The control yoke uses a spherical pantograph scissor mechanism to bisect the angle between the input and output shafts and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the input shafts aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced shear stresses and vibration inherent in double cardan shafts. While the geometric configuration does not maintain constant velocity for the control yoke that aligns the cardan joints, the control yoke has minimal inertia and generates little vibration. Continuous use of a standard Thompson coupling at a straight-through, zero-degree angle will cause excessive wear and damage to the joint; a minimum offset of 2 degrees between the input and output shafts is needed to reduce control yoke wear. Modifying the input and output yokes so that they are not precisely normal to their respective shafts can alter or eliminate the [...] "disallowed" [...] angles.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 {{he started}} driving USAC sprint cars. This is when Malloy {{would get a}} huge break in his racing career. He {{was hired by the}} Jim Robbins Race Team to drive USAC Indy Cars. He would run eight races for the Robbins team that year with his best finish being a 6th at Langhorne, Pennsylvania. The Robbins team would bring Malloy to Indianapolis in 1968 where he would be the fastest rookie qualifier. He started 14th and {{finished}} 22nd, dropping out after 64 laps with mechanical failure. In 1969 Malloy started 13th and despite an early 22 minute pit stop he managed an 11th-place finish. In 1970 he qualified 9th, his best starting position to date. Unfortunately his car broke a rear constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> and hit the 4th turn wall {{at the end of the}} pace lap, putting himself out of the race even before the start. In 1971 was originally entered in a car for the M.V.S. Racing Team. But when Lee Roy Yarbrough crashed hard with one of Dan Gurney's Eagles, his injuries was severe enough that he could not compete in the Indy 500 in 1971. Dan Gurney asked Malloy to pilot the Eagle in place of Yarbrough. He drove a solid race finishing 4th, his personal best at Indianapolis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the finite}} element method, the contact {{analysis}} on the tripod constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> widely used in the car was conducted. The settings of material attribute, boundary conditions processing, and the contacting setting of constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joint</b> used in the finite element software ANSYS Workbench were expounded. Through the contacting analysis, the contacting situation of stress was acquired, and it is concluded that the fatigue life and safety factor of the whole universal joint. This article has a certain practical value to study universal joint weak part under the action of fatigue, and provides a reference for the universal joint design and improvement...|$|E
50|$|As {{front wheel}} drive systems became more popular, with cars such as the BMC Mini using compact {{transverse}} engine layouts, the shortcomings of universal joints in front axles {{became more and more}} apparent. Based on a design by Alfred H. Rzeppa which was filed for patent in 1927 (a CV joint, the Tracta joint, designed by Pierre Fenaille at Jean-Albert GrÃ©goire's Tracta company was filed for patent in 1926), constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints</b> solved many of these problems. They allowed a smooth transfer of power despite the wide range of angles through which they were bent.|$|R
40|$|Grease {{lubricants}} {{are often}} preferred in machine elements working under elastohydrodynamic {{conditions such as}} rolling element bearings and constant <b>velocity</b> <b>joints</b> due mainly {{to the fact that}} they do not need resupply and filtering systems and provide lower lubricant losses. At the same time grease are complex materials, with liquid and solid phases, which make difficult the prediction of their behaviour in those contacts. In the present paper dielectric properties of lubricating greases are studied, as a step towards the understanding of their behaviour and predicting their in-contact rheological properties...|$|R
40|$|Inverse {{kinematics}} for redundant robotic manipulators {{is typically}} computed using the pseudoinverse of the manipulator Jacobian. Though the pseudoinverse yields {{the most accurate}} minimum-norm <b>joint</b> <b>velocity</b> vector, it fails to prevent high <b>joint</b> <b>velocities</b> when the manipulator is {{in the neighborhood of}} singularities. The Singularity Robust Inverse (SRI), which arises from the Damped Least-Squares technique proves to be a better inverse kinematic solution than the pseudoinverse near singular configurations. The SRI computes damped <b>joint</b> <b>velocities</b> but causes some deviation of the end-effector from its planned trajectory. The SRI performs most satisfactorily when the damping factor, which represents the trade-off between the accuracy and feasibility of the computed solution is calculated optimally, i. e. it yields minimum deviation of the end-effector while ensuring the feasibility of the <b>joint</b> <b>velocities</b> at all points in the manipulator workspace. This work introduces a new method of computing the optimal damping factor. The SRI {{can also be used to}} optimize another sub-task criterion in addition to performing the main motion task and avoiding high <b>joint</b> <b>velocities</b> at singularities...|$|R
