Important to this work is its emphasis of repurposed fairy tales and uncanny tropes. These have purposefully been embedded within realistic, domestic settings for aesthetic purposes. The first story, "Immaculate Flora," begins in the home of Elizabeth and Anchor Mason. They decide to raise a child grown from a Petri dish on their windowsill. The next story, "Breaking In," follows Mary Townsend as she addresses her absent lover, Ambrose, in epistolary form, meanwhile breaking into Johnny and Herman Galahads' Victorian house so that she can retrieve Ambrose's <b>vacation</b> <b>address.</b> In "Matriarchs," Agatha Dale decides to raise a small flock of chickens in her Chicago graystone apartment so that she might win the affection of the new family next door. In the final, most baroque and ornamental story, "In The Winter Palace," a young Russian guard is invited into the Queen's chambers within a St. Petersburg-inspired Winter Palace. All four stories challenge the expectations of the traditional domestic space and the way characters' psychologies shape these spaces into something new for the reader...|$|E

40|$|People {{are always}} looking to {{experience}} something interesting and unique when on vacation. What could be more unique than staying in a hotel that is completely underground? While people have always been amazed at natural caves and other subterranean structures, the idea of spending the night {{in one of these}} is a somewhat untried area, although it could be quite the selling point. This being the case, the idea of a subterranean hotel is not so farfetched, however {{there are a number of}} issues that arise with this project. These issues include construction and selecting the proper site and building materials to ensure strength, issues of humidity and lighting, as well as simply getting people to make this a destination on their <b>vacation.</b> This paper <b>addresses</b> these issues and discusses composition of materials and the use of a steel and concrete mixture to ensure strength and rigidity. Lighting issues are also solved using reflectively coated light tubes to gather sunlight and heat from the outside. The biggest internal issue of humidity is solved through the use of energy recovery ventilation. Finally, the cost of the hotel and the cost of operation are justified in the final section. With the ideas presented in this paper, forward thinking hoteliers could see how a property of this nature could indeed be possible and profitable...|$|R
40|$|Every year Thailand is {{invaded by}} {{tourists}} seeking {{the sun and}} white beautiful beaches. Most of them come for the inexpensive travel and lodging, good food and kind inviting people. For some of them the purpose of visit is somewhat different: every year there are people travelling to Thailand with the purpose to sexually exploit children. The world wide globalisation has contributed to a massive growth in tourism which has brought an economical growth to the country. This in turn has had some negative effects, where the poor rural areas are largely affected by inequality and {{the dream of a}} better lifestyle. Economical disadvantage, lack of education and the absence of capable guardians affect childrenâ€™s vulnerability and make them an easy target for child-sex tourism. I argue that potential child-sex tourists travel to Thailand due to a perception of the prevalence of easy targets affected by people in a society that is not always aware of what is happening around them as well as due to a common perception that Thailand has a weak legal system. Based on this assumption and with the theoretical basis of routine activity and rational choice I research if there is a {{reason to believe that the}} legal system is corrupt. I believe that a combination of the three elements provided routine activity as well as analysing a phenomenon through rational choice can open up to answers of why perpetrators chose Thailand as their child-sex <b>vacation</b> hot-spot. To <b>address</b> the aim of my study I conducted six semi-structured interviews with people working in Bangkok, Thailand. From these interviews I first explain the process leading to the prosecution of Swedish child-sex tourists in Thailand and, second, uncover and examine potential difficulties in this process. In the result of this study a few of the answers differ substantially from previous studies as well as some of the interviewees sharing controversial opinions. The results of the conducted interviews show three identifiable weaknesses that play a large part in the problems of the judicial process. These three are: education, bail and cooperation between authorities...|$|R
