The {{important point is that}} most debates still centre around a dichotomy: there is nature and agriculture, nature provides environmental services and agriculture does not. We look at the agroforestry system as in between those two poles and find that, although not as much as nature forest, there is still substantial provision of environmental services. Of course agroforestry is also less productive than <b>very</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture,</b> which means that if all economic incentives purely correspond with productivity, then we [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Islands are {{interesting}} subjects for study, with their frequent fluctuations in population size and economic activities, and their propensity for being at once both isolated fromand {{dependent on the}} outside world. They are often seen as metaphors-for human societies faced with environmental dangers and limitations, and (on a larger scale) for {{the world as a}} whole. Using examples fromdifferent parts of Europe, and with a focus on the Wadden Sea, this article analyses the specific ‘island-ness’ of their landscapes’ character. In periods of population pressure, islandscapes developed into ‘pressure-cooker’ landscapes, with <b>very</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> and extremely small-scale field patterns. In these situations, the sea acted as a safety valve: many islands typically show mixed economies of agriculture combined with shipping or fishing. In other periods, migration led to much lower population numbers, and some islands even became unpopulated. In the present phase of globalisation, many have ceased their agricultural activities, but others manage to continue cultivation by specialising in specific crops, and yet another group now use their landscapes for that other major global industry, tourism, very often capitalising on their ‘heritage landscape’ character that {{is a result of the}} alternating periods of activity (creation) and stagnation or desertion (preservation) that appear to be characteristic of islands in the first place...|$|E

40|$|The {{modernisation}} of Spanish agriculture {{began in}} the sixties. This modernisation was reinforced in 1975 with democracy, then in 1987 with the entry of Spain in the EEC. It led to a double-oriented agriculture, with, on the one hand, a <b>very</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> based on a high {{decrease in the number}} of farm workers, and on the other hand, a marginalised agriculture in the areas where natural conditions (soil fertility and relief) have not allowed this intensification to occur. The increased productivity of the latifundia system has now led to very efficient enterprises, providing the main part of the national production in agricultural and forest products. However, besides this intensive form of agriculture, there is a social concern for other types of agriculture more respectful of natural resources. Interest in the sustainability of production systems, is increasing, notably in sensitive areas. The dehesa is a traditional agrosylvopastoral system, located in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. It is developed on poor soil, generally in mountainous regions. It consists of trees (oaks) producing acorns and forest products such as wood and cork, combined with herbaceous vegetation consisting of various species and domestic animals using these different forage resources (pigs, goats, ovines and bovines, all from local breeds).

40|$|The study {{analyzes}} the source apportionment {{of a river}} basin, the Dese-Zero river, located within the North-Eastern part of the Venice Lagoon Watershed (VLW), Italy. The Dese-Zero river basin is characterised by a <b>very</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> and landfarming system. To assess the source apportionment, two different models have been applied: the QUAL 2 E model for the simulation of the dry weather scenario and the BASINS-SWAT model for the simulation of the wet weather scenario. Out of a total nitrogen load of 512 t N y- 1, for a surface of 293 km 2, in dry weather conditions the apportionment was found as follows: 20 % point sources (i. e. WWTP and industrial discharge and direct sewer discharge into surface waters) and about 80 % attributed to not rain-driven diffuse loads (i. e. groundwater/spring recharge and tributary/irrigation channels coming from bordering watersheds). As far as rainy events are concerned, the surface runoff load was of about 200 t N y- 1, over a total annual nitrogen load of about 700 t N y- 1. Therefore, on an annual basis, the total source apportionment was found as follows: about 30 % surface runoff loads, about 15 % point sources and about 55 % of the total annual load {{was found to be}} constituted by not rain-driven diffuse sources...|$|E

40|$|Nitrate {{leaching}} from agricultural lands is {{a worldwide}} concern particularly in intensively cropped areas which often are net sources of nitrate to surface water and groundwater. The Ferrara Province {{is a completely}} flat territory located in the North-eastern part of Italy, <b>very</b> suitable for <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> and recently declared vulnerable to nitrate from agricultural sources. This study focuses on factors affecting mineral nitrogen speciation in shallow aquifers below agricultural soils by means of marker species, witnessing the occurrence of denitrification. A grid of shallow piezometers, screened through the water table, was established in 58 agricultural plots throughout the FP. Inorganic nitrogen species were monitored together with conservative species, as chloride. In parallel, low molecular weight organic compounds (acetate, formate and oxalate) were analyzed and employed as tracers of labile dissolved organic carbon, potentially fuelling denitrification. Where, acetate formate and oxalate were continuously exposed to oxygen and more likely consumed within the unsaturated zone, the dissolved organic carbon {{is assumed to be}} low. Comparing acetate versus nitrate in all the groundwater samples an hyperbolic relationship is evident, indicating a stoichiometric control of dissolved nitrate concentration due to the presence of labile organic compounds. In addition the temporal variation of chloride, nitrate and acetate is used to discriminate between conservative and reactive transport; the disappearance of nitrate and acetate suggests that denitrification is taking place. This study shows that acetate {{can be used as a}} proxy for labile dissolved organic carbon which drives denitrification processes, while formate and oxalate cannot be used because of their low concentrations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> is a {{farming system}} characterised {{by a large}} use of inputs, causing a large {{pressure}} on the environment. As peculiar and efficient example of <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> cultivation under plastic tunnels provides several advantages for farmers due to improvement of microclimatic conditions coupled with a relatively low investment costs. In the Mediterranean Basin such cultivation systems reach about 200, 000 ha mainly in Spain, Turkey, Italy, and Morocco. As downside, <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> negatively affects soil fertility principally because of a loss in soil organic matter. Sustainable practices providing organic amendments could be a useful tool to maintain or increase organic matter content in agricultural soils, preserving and improving soil fertility. An improved knowledge of management factors affecting soil quality is crucial to plan farming systems that effectively maintain soil fertility. Therefore, this review focuses on the potential value of organic amendments in the recovery of soil fertility, in particular in sites under plastic cover intensive farming system. Following {{a brief overview of}} the effects of <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> on soil, the review describes various organic amendments used in agriculture and their benefits on soil fertility, to conclude with the need, in the future researches, to identify organic amendments able to maximize a recovery of soil fertility...|$|R
