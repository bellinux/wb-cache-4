The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze endovascular laser-assisted resection of human aortic valves in situ in 10 human cadavers. Material and MethodsAfter anterolateral minithoracotomy, the aortic <b>valve</b> <b>isolation</b> chamber system was inserted into the descending aorta and pushed forward transluminally into the aortic position to generate a separate operation space between the subvalvular and the proximal ascending aortic area. After deployment and sealing of the chamber, stable function with a continuous chamber lavage of 1. 58 L/min saline solution was established (8 / 10 cases). The endoscopically guided laser fiber was delivered via the right carotid artery. After fixation of a leaflet by a forceps catheter, the native leaflets were resected each by a thulium:YAG laser with 20 -W power rating. Macropathology and micropathology of surrounding anatomic structures were analyzed. ResultsThe duration of transluminal positioning and deployment of the aortic <b>valve</b> <b>isolation</b> chamber took 7. 3 ± 5. 8 minutes. Fluoroscopy confirmed sealed chambers. The resection was completed in all leaflets and took, on average, 6. 0 ± 3. 5 minutes per leaflet. The aortic wall was moderately injured in 4 of 10 cases and the aortic annulus in two cases with one aortic wall perforation. The surrounding tissue, the coronary ostia, the mitral valve, and the left ventricular outflow tract remained unaffected.

40|$|Flushing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} tools available to maintain and improve water quality in a water distribution system. Almost all water utilities use some form of flushing program in a regular maintenance schedule. However, these flushing programs are not typically sequential and often do not use <b>valve</b> <b>isolation</b> techniques. Adopting a Uni-directional flushing (UDF) program will result in significant system improvements and cost savings. Uni-directional flushing consists of isolating particular pipe sections or loops by closing the appropriate valves and opening hydrants in an organized sequential manner. Earth Tech Canada has developed a new computer-based UDF approach aiming at a systematic cleaning of the pipes of the City of Penticton (BC, Canada) water distribution system. Hydraulic and fire flow simulations were performed to identify the flushing sequences as well as the expected flushing velocities for each pipe. By spatially joining different Geographical Information System (GIS) database layers and the hydraulic model, the valves to close were identified for each flushing sequence as well as the hydrant to open. Finally, this new computer-based UDF approach is easy to implement and results in immediate and long-term solutions to water quality concerns by determining the optimal flushing sequences...|$|E

The cryogenic system consists of a model 1660 S PSI piston plant, a 3800 liter storage dewar, subcooler, a wet expander, a 50 g/s main helium compressor, and a 170 m{sup 3 } storage tank. A system description and operating plan of the cryogenic plant and cryomodules is given. The cryogenic system for ERL and the Vertical Test Dewar has a plant that can produce the equivalent of 300 W at 4. 5 K {{with the addition of}} a wet expander 350 W at 4. 5 K. Along with this system, a sub-atmospheric, warm compression system provides pumping to produce 2 K at the ERL cryomodules or the Vertical Test Dewar.

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with deterministic and probabilistic analysis of ex-vessel melt risks in a Swedish designed BWR plant. The focus is placed on a station blackout (SBO) scenario, with immediate SCRAM and subsequent activation of the main steam <b>valve</b> <b>isolation</b> (at 52 s). Four sequences were examined in detail to study the effect of two valves systems related to the operation of ADS (Automatic Depressurization System), and cavity flooding by water from suppression pool. The later action constitutes a cornerstone in the SAM (Severe Accident Management) strategy adopted in the newer Swedish and Finnish BWR plants. On the deterministic side, the US NRC MELCOR code was used to simulate the BWR system behaviours and phenomena that govern threats to the containment integrity. Remarkably, time factor (such as delays in instrumentation activation) {{was found to be}} of paramount importance to the sequence’s dynamics and consequences. On the probabilistic side, a review of methods in Level 2 Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) based on classical concepts of event trees-fault trees reveals that the existing methods ignore the time dependence, suggesting the need and potential value to explore a dynamic approach. In the present work, a recently-developed concept of dynamic fault trees was adopted. Specifically, dynamic structures were built into the tree’s branching points to enable capturing the effect of time-competing events in Level 2 PRA (severe accidents). The technique was successfully implemented in Matlab. The method was then applied to four cases to compute the probability of occurrence of various key events. For the four cases studied, MELCOR results show the time for cavity rupture due to debris ablation varied between the 17. 5 h and the 30. 5 h. They also show direct containment heating (DCH) when ADS fails to operate. Interestingly, the probabilistic results exhibit associative and competitive behaviours in the two valve systems, confirming the need to account for their interdependence...|$|E
50|$|To easily {{understand}} the concept of an <b>isolation</b> <b>valve,</b> one can think of the valves under a kitchen or bathroom sink in a typical household. These valves are normally left open so that the user can control the flow of water with the spigot above the sink, and does not need to reach under the counter to start or stop the water flow. However, if the spigot needs to be replaced (i.e. maintenance needs to take place on the system), the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> are shut to stop the flow of water when the spigot is removed. In this system, the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> and the spigot may even be the same type of valve. However, due to their function they are classified as the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> and, {{in the case of the}} spigot, the control valves.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from American Society of Civil Engineers via the DOI in this record. <b>Isolation</b> <b>valves</b> are crucial components of water distribution systems for separating pipe segments from the network for repair or maintenance purpose. This paper looks at the impacts of <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> failure on the three indictors including number of valves that are needed to isolate a distribution system segment, the size of distribution system segments and the shortfall in meeting demands during failure. A network with various <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> configurations {{in terms of the}} density of valves is used as a case study. The results obtained from the case study show that the failure of an <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> has substantially varying impacts on system performance during a shutdown. The density of valves in the network determines impacts of inoperable valves on a shutdown. Generally speaking, a higher density of <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> leads to the less impact of valve failure. Finally, several conclusions drawn from the critical valve analysis in this study could be applied to guide the <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> maintenance and management.
