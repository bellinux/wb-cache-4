5|$|The {{development}} of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online identities, {{and the existence of}} communication forums established {{for the sole purpose of}} giving support to members facing significant health or psychological problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} this graduating paper is the {{rehabilitation}} provision towards children as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence.</b> The problem formulation is how to implement the rehabilitation provision towards children as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence.</b> The objective <b>of</b> {{this study is to}} determine how to implement the rehabilitation provision towards children as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence.</b> The result <b>of</b> this analysis is in fact the implementation of the rehabilitation provision towards children as <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> has not been determined by the judge’s decision even though Article 64 paragraph (3) of Law no. 23 of 2002 (children protection) state that the <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> should be rehabilitated.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to analyse the lifetime prevalence <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and sexual abuse among the Inuit in Greenland and to study the associations between health and having been the <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> or sexual abuse. Associations were studied with specific attention to possible differences between women and men. Further, response rates were analysed specifically in order to understand conse-quences of including questions on violence and sexual abuse in the questionnaire survey. The analyses were based on material from a cross-sectional health inter-view survey conducted during 1993 - 94 with participation from a random sample of the Inuit population in Greenland (N= 1393). The prevalence of ever having been a <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> was 47 % among women and 48 % among men. Women had more often than men been sexually abused (25 % and 6 %) (p< 0, 001) and had more often been sexually abused in childhood (8 % and 3 %) (p= 0. 001). Having been the <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> or sexual abuse was significantly associated with a number of health problems: chronic disease, recent illness, poor self-rated health, and mental health problems. The associations between having been the <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> or sexual abuse and health was stronger for women than for men.

Adolescents may suffer from depressive mood (DM) which is common and multi-factorial. This study assessed, among boys and girls, the causal relationships between DM and parent education, nationality, occupation, income, divorce/separation, and death, repeating a school-year, lifetime alcohol/tobacco/cannabis/other drugs uses, <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and sexual abuse, involvement in <b>violence,</b> and lack <b>of</b> social supports (family members/friends). Methods: 1559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France (mean age 13. 5, SD 1. 3) completed in class a questionnaire including DM (Kandel scale), factors studied, and their occurring/persisting period. Data were analyzed using Cox models taking into account risk factors which came before and persisted until DM occurring. Findings: Lifetime-DM affected 7. 6 % of boys and 19. 1 % of girls. Among girls factors with significant crude hazard ratios (HR) were: parent divorce/separation (1. 57), insufficient income (1. 95), repeating a school-year (1. 95), <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> (2. 99) or sexual abuse (4. 96), and lack of supports (4. 08 for score 1 - 2 and 7. 74 for score 3 +, vs. score 0) while tobacco use was close to significance (1. 77). Taking all factors into account retained only repeating a school-year (adjusted HR 1. 87), <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> (2. 50) or sexual abuse (4. 02), and lack of supports (3. 83 and 7. 28). Among boys, the significant factors were: hard-drug use (6. 01), <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> (2. 88), and lack of supports (2. 27 and 4. 78) while insufficient income (1. 75), low parent education (1. 60), and <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> sexual abuse (3. 58) were close to significance. Full model retained only <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> (adjusted HR 2. 29) and lack of supports (2. 16 and 4. 18).
