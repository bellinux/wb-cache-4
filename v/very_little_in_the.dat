5|$|In 1891 Smyth {{returned}} to Hamilton College {{to become the}} Stone Professor of Natural History. In addition to his teaching duties at Hamilton, Smyth spent each summer from 1892 to 1903 doing field work for the New York State Museum in the western Adirondack Mountains, which had been studied <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifty years prior. He collaborated with his old advisor Kemp, who specialized in the eastern Adirondacks, and Henry Platt Cushing, who claimed the northern and northeastern sections. He {{returned to}} field work a final time in 1908; ill health prevented further expeditions.|$|E
5|$|The entry hall {{is almost}} entirely {{original}} construction. Nearly all the woodwork and decoration in this area dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and newel posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into sliding doors. The second floor central hall and Washington Room (on the second floor, in the southeast corner) were also changed <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> renovation.|$|E

5|$|The {{structures}} at Zaculeu {{were grouped}} around small plazas and were generally built from masonry, {{coated with a}} thick layer of plaster. Fragments bear floral and geometric designs, indicating the structures were originally brightly painted. Stones were undressed and cemented in adobe mortar. No evidence of corbel vaulting has been found and <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of stone sculpture. The architecture completely lacks stone sculpture. Burials from the Early Classic yielded a rich array of finds, but Late Classic burials were accompanied by a lesser variety of grave offerings.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way {{of heavy}} weapons, {{as they had}} {{discarded}} most of their artillery and machine guns {{due to lack of}} ammunition. Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns up close to the rifle pits, using them only at close range to ensure his ammunition would not be wasted. The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and finding themselves hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered {{despite the fact that they}} had enough military supplies to continue the action.|$|E
5|$|During 1973, B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment—designated the Medium Tank Trials Unit (MTTU)—evaluated the German Leopard 1 {{against the}} American M60A1 Patton as a {{replacement}} for the obsolete Centurions. The Leopard was judged the superior tank, and 90 gun tanks, eight Leopard 1 Armoured Recovery Vehicles Medium and five Leopard 1 bridge layer tanks were ordered. The Australian tanks were designated the Leopard AS1, and were based on the Leopard 1A3 which had been built for the German Army. The main difference between the Australian and German tanks was the inclusion of a SABCA fire control system, equipment to allow the tank to better operate in the tropics, additional storage boxes {{on the sides of the}} tank as well as improved trunnion bearings and combustion cleaners. These tanks were delivered to Australia in batches between 1976 and 1978. During the Leopard's service <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of upgrades were undertaken, and by the 1990s they had become obsolete.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Don was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in the United States during the 2011 season. The fourth named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Don formed from an {{area of low pressure}} along a tropical wave, Don developed into a tropical depression on July 27, and on that same day, was upgraded to tropical storm intensity, based on data from a reconnaissance aircraft noted the presence of tropical-storm-force winds. It tracked across the Gulf of Mexico and reached a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) before moving ashore in Texas on July 30 as a tropical depression, dissipating shortly afterwards. Initially, Don was expected to provide relief to the state, which was suffering from a major drought. However, the system dissipated rapidly just before making landfall, providing <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of help to the state; rainfall totals were less than 1 in (25 mm).|$|E

The religion's spiritual content, however, is inspired by older Pagan faiths (for example, in the veneration of historical pagan deities), with Buddhist and Hindu influences (e.g. in the Wiccan doctrine of reincarnation).|$|E
25|$|But, {{while the}} disease's {{geographical}} range is broad, {{it is not}} continuous. The disease clusters around areas of drought, famine, and high population density.

25|$|Munden {{made his}} {{first-class}} cricket debut {{in a few}} matches in the 1946 season, batting low in the Leicestershire order and not bowling a lot: as a left-arm spin bowler, his opportunities in an attack dominated by another left-arm spinner, Jack Walsh, were limited. Towards {{the end of the}} 1948 season he played fairly regularly for the first team and in a match against Derbyshire, bowling in tandem with Walsh, he took five wickets for 48 runs. Even so, he took only 12 wickets in 10 matches, and in the following season, when he played 19 first-team games and his batting developed a little, there were only eight wickets in the whole season. He played <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950 season.|$|E

25|$|An {{official}} CIA history {{suggests the}} recommendations and suggestions {{contained in the}} Eberstadt Report influenced <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> national security structure or intelligence community. Although Congress authorized the First Hoover Commission and its national security task force, Congress did not initiate or enforce any of its recommendations. Also, {{at the same time}} Eberstadt’s task force was completing its research and report for Congress, the Intelligence Survey Group was conducting similar research and produced its own report, the Dulles Report, which was submitted to Congress January 1, 1949. The Dulles Report became better known and forced the Eberstadt Report to be almost completely overlooked. While the CIA suggests {{at least some of the}} Eberstadt Report’s ideas were used, it is unlikely the report was widely read or had any significant influence.|$|E
25|$|With Alec Bedser and the spinners {{doing most of}} {{the work}} against South Africa in 1951, Statham had to do <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tests, but he only missed 100 {{first-class}} wickets due to injury and showed himself a formidable bowler on a pitch offering help. In India, his average was good, but the heat and humidity certainly seemed to take their toll upon his body and he did little in the Tests, with the result that he was not chosen for a Test match in 1952 even though he was gaining speed and straightness and was often extremely formidable despite conditions rarely favouring bowlers. In 1953, Statham was within a whisker of heading the first-class averages and bowled wonderfully on the most placid of pitches against Hampshire, but Bedser ensured he was not needed in the Ashes Tests. Statham and fellow fast-bowler Fred Trueman were on occasion, in 1953, called up to the Test squad, but with the England team maturing, the captain, Len Hutton did not feel comfortable playing two fast-bowlers, often preferring the more economical, slower bowling of Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. This meant that Statham and Trueman rarely bowled in tandem in this period.|$|E
25|$|American {{occupation}} {{troops in}} Nuristan would find themselves directly {{in opposition to}} the HIG forces prepared by the CIA to resist the Soviets. Colonel Pat Donahue, the former commander of the 3rd BCT, had believed that Nuristani population was essentially neutral, hostile to any outside groups, and so isolated that resources allocated to the region would be wasted. These resources were limited by the fact that only 5,000 American troops were available to occupy a rugged area the size of Virginia that had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of Infrastructure. A new Counter-insurgency strategy seemed to offer a way around these problems. Known as COIN and refined by General Petraeus, Commander of US forces in Afghanistan, the Army and Marine Counter-insurgency Field Manual FM 3-24 would convert the population of Nuristan to American goals in the region. Unlike Donahue, Nicholson was a supporter of COIN in addition to seeing Kamdesh as a decisive control point in the region. The basic approach to victory by the PRT would involve three steps: 1. Separate the enemy from the people. 2. Link the people to their government. 3. Transform Afghanistan by economic development {{and the creation of a}} national infrastructure. Nicholson hoped the PRT would seed a process that would be developed by the local Nuristanis rather than completely imposed from the outside. Lieutenant Keating, first commander of the Kamdesh PRT, was determined to make COIN a success in the region.|$|E
