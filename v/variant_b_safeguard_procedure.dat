40|$|Salinity {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} stresses that affect plant growth and agricultural production. Considerable efforts have therefore been made to investigate how plants respond to salt stress. To investigate the responses of Acanthophyllum to salinity stress, changes on lipid peroxidation, H 2 O 2 content and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in calli of two Acanthophyllum laxiusculum variants, without (variant A) and with (<b>variant</b> <b>B)</b> B-chromosomes, were analyzed. Under salinity stress, lipid peroxidation and H 2 O 2 content decreased in variant A compared to <b>variant</b> <b>B.</b> Moreover, <b>variant</b> A produced a higher amount of proline under salt stress than <b>variant</b> <b>B.</b> In calli of variant A, salinity stress preferentially enhanced the activities of the superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1. 15. 1. 1), catalase (CAT, EC 1. 11. 1. 6), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1. 11. 1. 11) and glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1. 6. 4. 2), whereas it decreased their activity in <b>variant</b> <b>B.</b> Guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, EC 1. 11. 1. 7) activity decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations in variant A but its activity increased in <b>variant</b> <b>B.</b> After native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis, calli of both A and <b>B</b> <b>variants</b> had only Mn-SOD and Fe-SOD isoforms.

40|$|The US {{has placed}} certain special nuclear {{materials}} declared excess to their strategic needs under international safeguards through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This Presidential initiative has obligated materials at several Department of Energy (DOE) facilities for these safeguards activities {{to demonstrate the}} willingness of the US to ban production or use of nuclear materials outside of international safeguards. However, IAEA inspection activities generally tend to be intrusive in nature and are not consistent with several domestic <b>safeguards</b> <b>procedures</b> implemented to reduce worker radiation exposures and increase the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of accounting for and storing of special nuclear materials. To help identify and provide workable solutions to these concerns, the Office of Safeguards and Security has conducted a program to determine possible changes to the DOE safeguards and security requirements designed to help facilities under international safeguards inspections more easily comply with domestic safeguards goals during international inspection activities.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to find the influence of different silage additives on the quality of fermentation process of ensiled high moisture crimped corn. Three variants were examined: untreated control (UC) variant in which was high moisture corn conserved without additives, and experimental <b>variants</b> A and <b>B.</b> In these <b>variants</b> different silage additives (bacterial inoculant in variant A and combined biochemical additive in <b>variant</b> <b>B)</b> were applied. After 6 months of silage fermentation process the average samples for the fermentation products content were determined. The highest lactic acid content was found in untreated control variant (24. 27 g/kg of dry matter). After the silage additives application lower acetic acid content was found (2. 87 in variant A and 2. 82 g/kg of dry matter in <b>variant</b> <b>B).</b> Undesirable butyric acid content was generally very low. The lowest value (significantly at P< 0. 01) of titration acidity was determined in <b>variant</b> <b>B.</b> The value of active acidity (pH) of water extracts of silages were from 3. 70 (<b>variant</b> <b>B)</b> to 3. 75 (variant UC), without statistical differences. In variants conserved by additives lower ammonia content as well as total alcohols were found. In comparison with untreated variant (UC) we didn’t find in top of silage profiles of experimental <b>variants</b> <b>B</b> sensory occurrence of fungi. The application of combined biochemical additive influenced the quality of fermentation process more positively for higher lactic acid content and the lowest acetic acid content, titration acidity and the value of pH, than bacterial inoculant...|$|R

40|$|Age related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is the leading}} cause of blindness among the elderly population. It occurs in two forms, a nonexudative "dry" form which can lead to geographic atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in the region of the macula and an exudative "wet" form which involves neovascularisation from the choroid, through Bruch's membrane and the RPE layer and into the photoreceptor layer causing significant damage. Cystatin C is a cysteine protease inhibitor known to inhibit cathepsin activity. It is a highly abundant transcript in the RPE and is known to be processed through the secretory pathway. A variant form of this protein with an amino acid substitution in its signal sequence results in the protein being retained intracellularly and is found localised with the mitochondria. This variant form has been associated with increased risk of developing exudative AMD. In this study a number of key cellular processes were examined to elucidate the effect the <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> protein has on the RPE. These processes were respiration, apoptosis, autophagy and oxidative stress; all of which have been implicated in AMD pathology or ageing. In addition the protein-protein interactions of <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> cystatin C were assessed through mass spectrometry analysis of pulled-down cystatin C protein from transfected cell lysates. No effect on respiration, apoptosis or autophagy was identified. However a statistically significant difference in oxidative stress was identified as a result of overexpression of either wild type cystatin C or <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> cystatin C. Mass spectrometry analysis resulted in two highly promising proteins that were found interacting with <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> cystatin C at a statistically significant level, prohibitin and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC 1). Although oxidative stress was found for both proteins given the nature of the expression (driven by a CMV promoter) it seems likely that the oxidative stress response is due to a high level of intracellular cystatin C. This suggests that the retention of <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> protein within the cell would lead to increased oxidative stress levels. It can be speculated that this response could be a contributory factor to development of AMD. VDAC 1 and prohibitin may offer an explanation of what happens to the <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> protein within RPE cells. VDAC 1 is the major pore-forming protein in the mitochondrial membrane, disruption of its functioning by the binding of <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> protein might be expected to have detrimental effects. Prohibitin is an even more promising target as it has been associated with oxidative stress. In addition it is known to translocate between the nucleus and the mitochondria, offering the tantalising possibility of a complete explanation for the mitochondrial mislocalisation...|$|R
