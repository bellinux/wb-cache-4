5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future <b>veins,</b> in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the <b>veins</b> becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to <b>veins.</b> The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral <b>veins</b> drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The brain has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) <b>veins.</b> The <b>veins</b> of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal <b>veins</b> or into adjacent cerebral <b>veins.</b>|$|E
40|$|Facial <b>vein</b> is {{the main}} <b>vein</b> of the face. Though its origin is constant, it {{frequently}} shows variations in its termination.

Deep dissection of the gland revealed the abnormal termination of facial <b>vein</b> into the superficial temporal <b>vein.</b> The transverse facial <b>vein</b> drained into the facial <b>vein.</b> The superficial temporal <b>vein</b> after receiving the facial <b>vein</b> continued as retromandibular <b>vein.</b> Knowledge of this anomalous course and termination of facial <b>vein</b> may be important for the surgeons doing parotid, maxillofacial and plastic surgeries...|$|R

5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of <b>veins.</b> The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the <b>veins</b> are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major <b>veins</b> there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the <b>veins</b> are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Retinal <b>vein</b> {{occlusion}} {{is one of}} the {{vascular disorders}} affecting vision. Branch retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion and central retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion are the two basic types of <b>vein</b> occlusion. Branch retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion is three times more common than central retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion and is second only to diabetic retinopathy as the most common retinal vascular cause of visual impairment. The origin of branch retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion includes systemic factor-hypertension and local anatomic factor-arteriovenous crossings. Branch retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion results in misty or distorted vision. Retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion is a multifactor process. There is no single magic bullet that cures retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion. A comprehensive management of patients with retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion is necessary to correct associated diseases or predisposing abnormalities that could lead to local recurrences or systemic event. This paper reviews the etiology and treatment of retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion and recommends the collaboration between other branches for its management. Key words: Branch retinal <b>vein</b> occlusion • Hypertension • Arteriovenous crossing • <b>Vein</b> anterior • <b>Vein</b> posterio...|$|R
5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep <b>veins</b> via perforator <b>veins.</b> However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the <b>veins</b> that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial <b>veins.</b>|$|E
5|$|Postcubitus (Pcu) is {{the first}} anal of the Comstock–Needham system. The postcubitus, however, has the status of an {{independent}} wing vein and should be recognized as such. In nymphal wings, its trachea arises between the cubital trachea and the group of vannal tracheae. In the mature wings of more generalized insect the Postcubitus is always associated proximally with the cubitus and is never intimately connected with the flexor sclerite (3Ax) of the wing base. In Neuroptera, Mecoptera, and Trichoptera the postcubitus may be more {{closely associated with the}} vannal <b>veins,</b> but its base is always free from the latter. The postcubitus is usually unbranched; it is primitively two branched. The vannal <b>veins</b> (lV to nV) are the anal <b>veins</b> that are immediately associated with the third axillary, and which are directly affected by the movement of this sclerite that brings about the flexion of the wings. In number the vannal <b>veins</b> vary. from 1 to 12, according to the expansion of the vannal area of the wing. The vannal tracheae usually arise from a common tracheal stem in nymphal insects, and the <b>veins</b> are regarded as branches of a single anal vein. Distally the vannal <b>veins</b> are either simple or branched. Jugal <b>Veins</b> (J) of the jugal lobe of the wing is often occupied by a network of irregular <b>veins,</b> or it may be entirely membranous; but sometimes it contains one or two distinct small <b>veins,</b> the first jugal vein, or vena arcuata, and the second jugal vein, or vena cardinalis (2J).|$|E
