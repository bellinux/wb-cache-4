5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} <b>viral</b> proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the <b>viral</b> RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the <b>viral</b> genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the <b>viral</b> protease (coded by NS3), which splices <b>viral</b> proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for <b>viral</b> replication.|$|E
5|$|NSP4 is a <b>viral</b> {{enterotoxin}} that induces diarrhoea and was {{the first}} <b>viral</b> enterotoxin discovered.|$|E
5|$|Uncoating happens {{inside the}} cell when the <b>viral</b> capsid is removed and {{destroyed}} by <b>viral</b> enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the <b>viral</b> nucleic acid.|$|E
5|$|Uncoating is {{a process}} in which the <b>viral</b> capsid is removed: This may be by {{degradation}} by <b>viral</b> enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the end-result is the releasing of the <b>viral</b> genomic nucleic acid.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of {{research}} an untested HIV vaccine has been created. Bi-specific antibodies that target both the surface of T-cells and <b>viral</b> epitopes can prevent entry of the virus into somatic cells. Another group has utilised the same technology to develop a bi-specific antibody that neutralises <b>viral</b> particles by cross linking of envelope glycoproteins.|$|E
5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host {{cells to}} replicate, they {{are difficult to}} eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to <b>viral</b> diseases are vaccinations to provide immunity to infection, and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with <b>viral</b> replication.|$|E
5|$|Croup {{is usually}} {{deemed to be}} due to a <b>viral</b> infection. Others use the term more broadly, to include acute laryngotracheitis, spasmodic croup, {{laryngeal}} diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a <b>viral</b> infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the <b>viral</b> messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense <b>viral</b> RNA is in the same sense as <b>viral</b> mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense <b>viral</b> RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the <b>viral</b> mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a <b>viral</b> agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some <b>viral</b> causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be <b>viral</b> and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|PCR {{tests have}} been {{developed}} to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the <b>viral</b> load, in clinical specimens. These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high <b>viral</b> loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the <b>viral</b> particle necessary for <b>viral</b> entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the <b>viral</b> nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the <b>viral</b> RNA is released.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, {{the genome}} {{enclosed}} within the <b>viral</b> particle {{can be used}} as messenger RNA and immediately translated by the host cell. On entry, the virus hijacks the cell's translation machinery, causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virus–specific protein production. Unlike the host cell's mRNAs, the 5'end of poliovirus RNA is extremely long—over 700 nucleotides—and highly structured. This region of the <b>viral</b> genome is called internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and it directs translation of the <b>viral</b> RNA. Genetic mutations in this region prevent <b>viral</b> protein production. The first IRES to be discovered was found in poliovirus RNA.|$|E
5|$|Replication {{of virus}} {{particles}} is {{the stage where}} a cell uses <b>viral</b> messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce <b>viral</b> proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA.|$|E
5|$|Several highly lethal <b>viral</b> {{pathogens}} {{are members}} of the Filoviridae. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause <b>viral</b> haemorrhagic fever, and include the Ebola and Marburg viruses. The Marburg virus attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 after an outbreak in Angola. Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, there were 252 cases including 227 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} <b>viral</b> capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached <b>viral</b> proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the <b>viral</b> RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded <b>viral</b> DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the <b>viral</b> DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another <b>viral</b> enzyme called integrase.|$|E
5|$|The eleven dsRNA strands {{remain within}} the {{protection}} of the two protein shells and the <b>viral</b> RNA-dependent RNA polymerase creates mRNA transcripts of the double-stranded <b>viral</b> genome. By remaining in the core, the <b>viral</b> RNA evades innate host immune responses called RNA interference that are triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{served as}} {{inspiration}} for the Brazilian web series <b>Viral.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>viral</b> load of an {{infected}} person {{is an important}} risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission. During the first 2.5months of an HIV infection a person's infectiousness is twelve times higher due to this high <b>viral</b> load. If the person is in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.|$|E
5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the <b>viral</b> envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The <b>viral</b> envelope contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the <b>viral</b> envelope. The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the <b>viral</b> envelope with the target cell membrane releasing the <b>viral</b> contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Viral</b> {{infections in}} animals provoke an immune {{response}} that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses {{can also be}} produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific <b>viral</b> infection. However, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and <b>viral</b> hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Antibiotics {{have no effect on}} viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between <b>viral</b> capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the <b>viral</b> envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of <b>viral</b> and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E
5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of <b>viral</b> diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and bluetongue of sheep. <b>Viral</b> diseases of livestock {{can be devastating}} both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the <b>viral</b> RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the <b>viral</b> genome in the virus particle. The resulting <b>viral</b> DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and <b>viral</b> proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E

5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates <b>viral</b> hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in <b>viral</b> hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between <b>viral</b> proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new <b>viral</b> proteins that replicate the <b>viral</b> RNA and begin to form <b>viral</b> particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Other {{investigations}} (such {{as blood}} tests and <b>viral</b> culture) are discouraged, {{as they may}} cause unnecessary agitation and thus worsen the stress on the compromised airway. While <b>viral</b> cultures, obtained via nasopharyngeal aspiration, {{can be used to}} confirm the exact cause, these are usually restricted to research settings. Bacterial infection should be considered if a person does not improve with standard treatment, at which point further investigations may be indicated.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic <b>viral</b> shedding and elevated <b>viral</b> titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|Several highly lethal <b>viral</b> {{pathogens}} {{are members}} of the Filoviridae. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause <b>viral</b> hemorrhagic fever, and include ebolaviruses and marburgviruses. Marburg virus, first discovered in 1967, attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola. Ebola Virus Disease has also caused intermittent outbreaks with high mortality rates since 1976 when it was first identified. The worst and most recent one is the West Africa epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is a <b>viral</b> {{infection}} of the upper respiratory tract. The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total over 200 <b>viral</b> types are associated with colds.|$|E
5|$|Vaccination is a {{cheap and}} {{effective}} way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent <b>viral</b> infections long before {{the discovery of the}} actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with <b>viral</b> infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Smallpox infections have been eradicated. Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen <b>viral</b> infections of humans, and more are used to prevent <b>viral</b> infections of animals. Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or <b>viral</b> proteins (antigens). Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are called attenuated. Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines. These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.|$|E

25|$|<b>Viral</b> microRNAs play an {{important}} role in the regulation of gene expression of <b>viral</b> and/or host genes to benefit the virus. Hence, miRNAs play a key role in host–virus interactions and pathogenesis of <b>viral</b> diseases. The expression of transcription activators by human herpesvirus-6 DNA is believed to be regulated by <b>viral</b> miRNA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viral</b> vectors are {{generally}} genetically engineered viruses carrying modified <b>viral</b> DNA or RNA {{that has been}} rendered noninfectious, but still contain <b>viral</b> promoters and also the transgene, thus allowing for translation of the transgene through a <b>viral</b> promoter. However, because <b>viral</b> vectors frequently are lacking infectious sequences, they require helper viruses or packaging lines for large-scale transfection. <b>Viral</b> vectors are often designed for permanent incorporation of the insert into the host genome, and thus leave distinct genetic markers in the host genome after incorporating the transgene. For example, retroviruses leave a characteristic retroviral integration pattern after insertion that is detectable and indicates that the <b>viral</b> vector has incorporated into the host genome.|$|E
25|$|For lytic {{replication}} to occur, the <b>viral</b> genome must be linear. The latent EBV genome is circular, {{so it must}} linearize in {{the process}} of lytic reactivation. During lytic replication, <b>viral</b> DNA polymerase is responsible for copying the <b>viral</b> genome. This contrasts with latency, in which host cell DNA polymerase copies the <b>viral</b> genome.|$|E
