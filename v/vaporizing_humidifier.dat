40|$|Abstract: Background. Adequate {{humidification}} of {{inspired gas}} with active or passive humidifiers {{is a standard}} of care for tracheotomized patients. In this study, a comparison is made between the tracheal climate after tracheobronchial humidifica-tion either with molecular water (via a <b>vaporizing</b> <b>humidifier)</b> or particulate water (via spray) in spontaneously breathing tracheo-tomized patients. Methods. We performed a randomized, 2 -way crossover study on 10 tracheotomized patients. Tracheal humidity and temperature were measured prior to and after use of a vaporiz-ing humidifier and aerosol spray, respectively. Results. After use of both the <b>vaporizing</b> <b>humidifier</b> and the aerosol spray, the end-inspiratory total water content and water gradient in the upper trachea increased significantly, compared with baseline values before application. After end of use of the <b>vaporizing</b> <b>humidifier,</b> the total water content and the water gra-dient decreased significantly faster than after application of the aerosol spray. Conclusions. Delivery of both molecular and particulate water significantly increases the tracheal climate and condition-ing in the tracheal airways. Because the tracheal humidity remained on a higher level after aerosol spray, we speculate that particulate water may be efficient on tracheal humidification for longer. However, the positive effect on tracheal humidity after prolonged application of the aerosol spray remains to be pro...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background. Our aim was {{to compare}} {{inhalation}} with molecular water (<b>vaporizing</b> <b>humidifier)</b> and particulate water (trachea spray) in spontaneously breathing tracheostom-ized patients. Methods. We performed a randomized, 2 -way crossover study and a prospective, comparative, nonblinded study. Tra-cheal humidity and temperature were measured before and after use of a humidifier and spray for 1 week. Results. After both inhalation and spray, the tracheal temper-ature and total water content increased significantly (study 1). The temperature gradient between ambient and tracheal air was significantly higher after spray, but not after inhalation (study 2). The water gradient increased nonsignificantly after spray and in-halation. The water gradient after inhalation or spray did not dif-fer significantly. Conclusions. Molecular water is not superior to particulate water because of temperature and humidity increase after both forms of water delivery. Because of its easy use, portability, and moisturizing effect, a trachea spray may offer additional options in postoperative tracheostomy care. VC 2007 Wiley Periodicals...|$|E
30|$|Li et al. [37] {{examined}} the effects of Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) wood oils on endocrine and immune activity. The participants were 12 male instructors aged between 37 and 60  years who worked at a university, who stayed for three nights in a room at an urban hotel where Japanese cypress wood oil was <b>vaporized</b> with a <b>humidifier.</b> After this, the concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the participants’ urine were reduced and natural killer cell activity was induced. Thus, olfactory stimulation by Japanese cypress wood oil brought about improvements in immune functions.|$|R
