50|$|Dysphonia can be {{categorized}} into two broad main types: organic and functional. The type of dysphonia {{is dependent on the}} cause of the pathology. While the causes of dysphonia can be divided into five basic categories, all of them result in an interruption of the ability of the vocal folds to vibrate normally during exhalation, which affects the voice. The assessment and diagnosis of dysphonia is done by a multidisciplinary team, and involves the use of a variety of subjective and objective measures, which look at both the quality of the voice as well as the physical state of the larynx. Multiple treatments have been developed to address organic and functional causes of dysphonia. Dysphonia can be targeted through direct therapy, indirect therapy, medical treatments, and surgery. Functional dysphonias may be treated through direct and indirect <b>voice</b> <b>therapies,</b> whereas surgeries are recommended for chronic, organic dysphonias.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the use of the}} non-verbal <b>voice</b> in music <b>therapy</b> with children with severe learning disabilities, complex needs and autism. Recent literature {{on the use of the}} <b>voice</b> in music <b>therapy</b> is summarised and links are made between the aims of music therapy and those of special educational establishments. Theories regarding the voice and the self, and the important connection between body awareness and emotion as precursors to learning are referred to, particularly in relation to learning disability. Through a case study, I demonstrate how a young girl used voicework to build connections with herself and the music therapist, whereby consequently she became more motivated to interact with her surroundings. I argue hence that the use of the non-verbal <b>voice</b> in music <b>therapy,</b> through its intrinsic connection to identity and internal emotional states can contribute significantly towards the healthy developments necessary for a person to be able to learn. Therefore, by increasing our knowledge about the actual process of learning, and the significance of our work within that process, we can move towards demonstrating clearer outcomes of music therapy in the educational context and have a stronger ‘voice’ within the multi-disciplinary teams that serve this population...|$|R
40|$|This {{report from}} the International Consortium on Hallucinations Research {{considers}} the current status and future directions in research on psychological therapies targeting auditory hallucinations (hearing <b>voices).</b> <b>Therapy</b> approaches have evolved from behavioral and coping-focused interventions, through formulation-driven interventions using methods from cognitive therapy, {{to a number of}} contemporary developments. Recent developments include the application of acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches, and consolidation of methods for working with connections between voices and views of self, others, relationships and personal history. In this article, we discuss the development of <b>therapies</b> for <b>voices</b> and review the empirical findings. This review shows that psychological therapies are broadly effective for people with positive symptoms, but that more research is required to understand the specific application of <b>therapies</b> to <b>voices.</b> Six key research directions are identified: (1) moving beyond the focus on overall efficacy to understand specific therapeutic processes targeting voices, (2) better targeting psychological processes associated with voices such as trauma, cognitive mechanisms, and personal recovery, (3) more focused measurement of the intended outcomes of therapy, (4) understanding individual differences among voice hearers, (5) extending beyond a focus on voices and schizophrenia into other populations and sensory modalities, and (6) shaping interventions for service implementation. © 2014 The Author...|$|R
50|$|To {{date the}} {{standard}} treatment approach for NSSI disorder has been hospitalization, but this treatment method is expensive {{and has not}} been found to reveal effective outcomes. Furthermore, many that engage in NSSI are unlikely to be admitted because they do not express the intent to die. Because non-suicidal self-injury is mainly categorized as a tool for emotion regulation and is considered a behavior mainly maintained through positive and negative reinforcements (as well as self punishment), treatments using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) show the most effectiveness in reducing NSSI behaviors. Two types of treatments using cognitive behavioral therapy that focus specifically on NSSI are Problem-Solving Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy. These treatments share commonalities including being time-limited, and a focus on immediately targeting NSSI and improving skills. Other treatments for NSSI disorder include Emotion-Regulation Group <b>Therapy,</b> <b>Voice</b> Movement <b>Therapy,</b> and Transference Focused Psychotherapy. Although relatively limited information exists on Pharmacotherapy for NSSI, empirical evidence has been found for 5 different drug classes: SSRI's, atypical antipsychotics, SNRI's, opioids, and opioid antagonists.|$|R

40|$|Background: Speech and {{language}} therapists (SLTs) deliver <b>voice</b> and communication <b>therapy</b> for trans and gender diverse people to facilitate authentic vocal and communicative expression. Davies, Papp, and Antoni (2015) {{have provided a}} comprehensive review of the literature, with recommendations for good clinical care. Several areas highlighted as gaps in the research were identified by the current authors as ones in which evidence is expanding. Aims: To demonstrate 1) an expansion of the evidence base in particular innovations in <b>voice</b> group <b>therapy</b> for trans women and trans men; 2) the importance of delivering <b>voice</b> and communication <b>therapy</b> as part of a complete approach to trans and gender diverse health care; and (3) developments in training and competency in the UK. Method: Data were drawn from three small-scale projects, two surveys, and one audit. Measurements: Data from survey and audits and pre- and post-group acoustic measures of and client self-perceptual measures, including the Transsexual Voice Questionnaire (TVQMtF); a client-generated set of questions for trans men; and the migration of vocal identity map, adapted from Narrative Therapy practices. Results: Positive outcomes for both pitch measures and client perception were recorded. Audit and survey data provided evidence of developments in training and competency in the UK. Conclusion: Evidence supports group therapy as a successful approach for trans individuals across a number of parameters of voice and self-perception. Voice group protocols for both trans men and trans women should take account of the social context within which to explore relational presence and authentic voice. SLTs within gender identity clinics provide voice and communication {{as part of a broader}} pathway of care, alongside sharing professional knowledge and skills.
