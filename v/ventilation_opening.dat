This study aims at improving noise reduction of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>openings</b> in low-frequency using active noise control(ANC) technique. In our previous study, basic performance of the ANC system for <b>ventilation</b> <b>openings</b> was examined. However, when the living sound is mixed into the ANC system, it is doubtful whether the noise reduction performance of the ANC will be ensured.

The lid itself has two layers: an inner layer made of vertical planks, providing structural integrity and watertightning, and an outer layer made of horizontal planks that integrates into the outer hull. A short roof above the gun port offers some protection from the elements, and prevents the lid from jamming against the hull.|$|E

50|$|The southeastern {{wall was}} blank {{to the front}} section, with {{regularly}} spaced multi-paned sash windows to the rear wing, which was slightly recessed. The northwestern wall was similarly blank to the front section, with a central circular roof <b>ventilation</b> <b>opening</b> to the gable, and a slightly recessed stairwell projecting at the rear. The rear wing had a verandah along the northwestern side, which returned to align with the stairwell at the western end, and abutted a hipped roofed projecting room at the northern end. The verandah had timber posts, with curved timber brackets and a battened valance to the ground floor, and a curved timber valance to the first floor. The first floor had a metal railing, with a non-original walkway linking it to an adjacent building. Timber panelled doors opened onto the verandah, and the stairwell had a multi-paned sash window to the first floor. The {{lower part of the}} first floor exterior walls, along the northwestern side of the building, had been rendered in an attempt to overcome rising damp deterioration to the brickwork.

40|$|Ventilation {{is one of}} {{the methods}} used to obtain the {{biological}} optimal point of environmental factors needed for the plants in greenhouses. In the greenhouses, air change coefficient must be more than 50 h- 1 in order to supply effective air ventilation.

In this study, the temperature values were calculated by using energy balance and Bernoulli equation at different <b>ventilation</b> <b>opening</b> ratios (AV/AG) depending on climatic properties in the Mediterranean region (Antalya). If was found that, based on temperature and radiation values of Antalya province, 20 % <b>ventilation</b> <b>opening</b> rate is sufficient in the roof area.

30|$|A {{series of}} nine {{full-scale}} studies, {{funded by the}} National Institute of Justice, were conducted with ignitable liquid fuel spilled on carpeted and vinyl flooring with varying ventilation scenarios (Mealy et al. 2013). These tests evaluated many aspects of fire investigations, including the presence of ignitable liquid residue after extinguishment, fire patterns, depth of calcination and the fire dynamics of an under-ventilated compartment. A compartment (3.7  m[*]×[*] 3.7  m[*]×[*] 2.4  m) with a single doorway <b>ventilation</b> <b>opening</b> located {{in the center of}} a wall was used for this series of tests. An upholstered sofa and upholstered chair were located in adjacent corners across the room from each other with a coffee table in between.

The <b>ventilation</b> <b>opening</b> was varied throughout the test between a slit vent (2  m[*]×[*] 0.2  m) and the full door opening (2  m[*]×[*] 0.9  m). Test one used only Class A fuels, while the eight remaining tests used gasoline as the first fuel ignited. The location of gasoline spilled was varied between the floor and on/around furniture items.|$|E
