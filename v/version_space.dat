40|$|Although <b>version</b> <b>spaces</b> {{provide a}} useful {{conceptual}} tool for inductive concept learning, they often face severe computational difficulties when implemented. For example, the G set of traditional boundary-set implementations of <b>version</b> <b>spaces</b> can have size exponential {{in the amount}} of data for even the most simple conjunctive description languages [Haussler, 1988]. This paper presents a new representation for <b>version</b> <b>spaces</b> that is more general than the traditional boundary-set representation, yet has worst-case time complexity that is polynomial {{in the amount of}} data when used for learning from attribute-value data with treestructured feature hierarchies (which includes languages like Haussler's). The central idea underlying this new representation is to maintain the traditional S boundary set as usual, but use a list N of negative data rather than keeping a G set as is typically done. 1.

40|$|Mitchell's {{original}} work on <b>version</b> <b>spaces</b> (Mitchell, 1982) presented {{an analysis of}} the computational complexity of <b>version</b> <b>spaces.</b> However, this analysis proved somewhat coarse, as it was parameterized by s and g, the maximum sizes that the S and G sets reach during learning. As has been pointed out by Haussler (1988), g can be exponential in the number of examples processed. This paper presents a more fine-grained analysis of the computational complexity of <b>version</b> <b>spaces,</b> demonstrates its equivalence to Mitchell's analysis, and instantiates it for two commonly used conjunctive concept description languages. 1 Introduction The problem of inductive concept learning [...] -to form general rules from data [...] -has been wellstudied in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

5000|$|In {{settings}} {{where there is}} a generality-ordering on hypotheses, it is possible to represent the <b>version</b> <b>space</b> by two sets of hypotheses: (1) the most specific consistent hypotheses, and (2) the most general consistent hypotheses, where [...] "consistent" [...] indicates agreement with observed data.|$|E
50|$|Thus, during learning, the <b>version</b> <b>space</b> (which {{itself is}} a set - {{possibly}} infinite - containing all consistent hypotheses) can be represented by just its lower and upper bounds (maximally general and maximally specific hypothesis sets), and learning operations can be performed just on these representative sets.|$|E

5000|$|The {{notion of}} version spaces was {{introduced}} by Mitchell in the early 1980s {{as a framework for}} understanding the basic problem of supervised learning within the context of solution search. Although the basic [...] "candidate elimination" [...] search method that accompanies the <b>version</b> <b>space</b> framework is not a popular learning algorithm, there are some practical implementations that have been developed (e.g., Sverdlik & Reynolds 1992, Hong & Tsang 1997, Dubois & Quafafou 2002).|$|E
5000|$|The method {{proposed}} in Section 8.7 of [...] suggests successively guessing grammar rules (productions) and testing them against {{positive and negative}} observations. The rule set is expanded {{so as to be}} able to generate each positive example, but if a given rule set also generates a negative example, it must be discarded. This particular approach can be characterized as [...] "hypothesis testing" [...] and bears some similarity to Mitchel's <b>version</b> <b>space</b> algorithm. The [...] text provide a simple example which nicely illustrates the process, but the feasibility of such an unguided trial-and-error approach for more substantial problems is dubious.|$|E

5000|$|Old Latin Codex Vercellensis Evangeliorum, {{preserved}} in the cathedral library {{is believed to be}} the earliest manuscript of the Old Latin Gospels. Its standard designation is [...] "Codex a" [...] (or 3 in the Beuron system of numeration). The order of the gospels in this Codex is Matthew, John, Luke and Mark, which is also found in some other very old [...] "Western" [...] manuscripts, such as Codex Bezae. In its text of Mt 3, before V. 16, it includes a statement that a light suddenly shone when Jesus was baptized. (Et cum baptizaretur, lumen ingens circumfulsit de aqua, ita ut timerent omnes qui advenerant) It contains the last twelve verses of the Gospel of Mark, but on a replacement-page. The original final pages after Mk 15:15 have been lost, and the replacement-page resumes mid-sentence in 16:7 and includes the text to the end of verse 20, but in the Vulgate <b>version.</b> <b>Space</b> considerations suggest that it is unlikely that the original, non-extant pages included verses 9-20, but this calculation (made by C. H. Turner in 1928) depends on unverifiable assumptions that only four pages have been lost, that the scribe did not accidentally skip any text, and that the person who made the replacement-page had access to the missing page that it replaced. However Turner did not explain why a scribe would replace only one of four pages. It is more probable that the replacement-page was removed from another manuscript than that it was made to insert in Codex Vercellensis. The text of Codex Vercellensis is related to the text of Codex Corbeiensis (ff2), another Old Latin copy (in which Mk 16:9-20 is included).|$|E
