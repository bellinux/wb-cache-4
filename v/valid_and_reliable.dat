25|$|Objective tests assume {{personality}} is consciously accessible {{and that it}} can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more <b>valid</b> <b>and</b> <b>reliable</b> than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the Forer effect to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because {{there is no way to}} tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.|$|E

This goal, however, is rarely achieved during {{the aftermath of a}} disaster. In this paper, we showcase how we used administrative records to assist Mississippi in evaluating the overall impact of Katrina on the state’s economy. Specifically, we assisted the state in developing a methodology to generate <b>valid,</b> <b>reliable,</b> <b>and</b> timely information on (1) the business environment and labor market and (2) rehiring and hiring practices. This information was used by the state to design recovery strategies and justify the necessary funds from federal agencies to assist local communities in their economic recovery. The experience of Mississippi clearly shows that <b>valid,</b> <b>reliable,</b> <b>and</b> timely {{information is}} critical for developing effective policy...|$|R

25|$|The multivariate {{nature of}} SA {{significantly}} complicates its quantification and measurement, {{as it is}} conceivable that a metric may only tap into one aspect of the operator's SA. Further, studies have shown that different types of SA measures do not always correlate strongly with each other (cf. Durso, Truitt, Hackworth, Crutchfield, Nikolic, Moertl, Ohrt, & Manning, 1995; Endsley, Selcon, Hardiman, & Croft, 1998; Vidulich, 2000). Accordingly, rather than rely on a single approach or metric, <b>valid</b> <b>and</b> <b>reliable</b> measurement of SA should utilize a battery of distinct yet related measures that complement each other (e.g., Harwood, Barnett, & Wickens, 1988). Such a multi-faced approach to SA measurement capitalizes on the strengths of each measure while minimizing the limitations inherent in each.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} basic {{principles}} are accepted by scientists as standards for {{determining whether a}} body of knowledge, method, or practice is scientific. Experimental results should be reproducible and verified by other researchers. These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation {{to determine whether a}} hypothesis or theory related to given phenomena is both <b>valid</b> <b>and</b> <b>reliable.</b> Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and bias to be controlled for or eliminated through randomization, fair sampling procedures, blinding of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for peer review, allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results. Statistical quantification of significance, confidence, and error are also important tools for the scientific method.|$|E
