The current methods of microbiologic examination of water in water-bodies used for different types of water sources in Uzbekistan do not always meet the ISO requirements. This sets the goals of studying the validity of the bacteriological and viral indicators as well as implementing appropriate methods of laboratory analysis. Timely identification of microbial contamination of water is of special importance for correct and quick arrangement of anti-epidemic and sanitation activities. Among all other activities aimed at the reduction and prevention of viral infections, early and prompt identification of <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> of water is of top priority. According to the Uzbek State Standard 950 : 2000 “Drinking Water” a number of plague forming units (PFU) of coliphages in water was recommended as an indirect indicator of water pollution by enteroviruses. The study conducted in Khorazm and Karakalpakstan (in the Aral Sea area) could find no correlation between the rate of viral hepatitis A (VHA), percentage of tap-water samples that do not meet the standard and the quality of water from surface water-bodies tested for coliphages. This makes questionable the sanitary-indicative value of coliphages and their usefulness for evaluation of epidemiological safety of water regarding viral infection. It is necessary to set modern and more representative direct methods revealing the indicators of <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> of water in water-bodies and tap-water in Uzbekistan...|$|E

This study {{was carried out}} to detect and compare the presence of reoviruses and enteroviruses by ICC-PCR in one wastewater and three drinking water treatment plants, studying {{the possibility of using}} reoviruses as indicator of <b>viral</b> water <b>pollution</b> and genotyping of the isolated strains. One hundred and forty four drinking water and 76 wastewater samples were collected for two years. Reoviruses and enteroviruses were detected in 12. 5 % (18 / 144) and 8. 3 % (12 / 144) of total collected drinking water samples. In the studied wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), reoviruses were detected in 26 % (20 / 76) of total collected samples while enteroviruses were detected in 21 % (16 / 76) of the total collected samples.

40|$|Quantitative {{method of}} <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> {{determination}} for {{large volume of}} water using ferric hydroxide gel impregnated {{on the surface of}} glassfibre cartridge filter. The use of ferric hydroxide gel, impregnated on the surface of glassfibre cartridge filter enable us to recover 62. 5 % of virus (Poliomylitis type I, Lsc strain) exsogeneously added to 400 liters of tap-water. The virus concentrator system consists of four cartridge filters, in which the three first one are clarifiers, where the contaminants are removed physically, without significant virus loss at this stage. The last cartridge filter is impregnated with ferric hydroxide gel, where the virus is adsorbed. After the required volume of water has been processed, the last filter is removed from the system and the viruses are recovered from the gel, using 1 liter of glycine/NaOH buffer, at pH 11. Immediately the eluate is clarified through series of cellulose acetate membranes mounted in a 142 mm Millipore filter. For the second step of virus concentration, HC 1 1 N is added slowly to the eluate to achieve pH 3. 5 - 4. MgC 1, is added to give a final concentration of 0. 05 M and the viruses are readsorbed on a 0. 45, porosity (HA) cellulose acetate membrane, mounted in a 90 mm Millipore filter. The viruses are recovered using the same eluent plus 10 % of fetal calf serum, to a final volume of 3 ml. In this way, it was possible to concentrate virus from 400 liters of tap-water, into 1 liter in the first stage of virus concentration and just to 3 ml of final volume in a second step.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of coliphages and enteroviruses {{in a variety}} of water systems in Czechoslovakia was monitored for two years. Two host strains of Escherichia coli bacteria were used to test 1161 water samples for the presence of bacteriophages. These strains were polyvalent hosts for a broad spectrum of morphologically distinct coliphages, and their use thus gave quantitative data on the degree of <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> in any given water sample. Ninety-two water samples were tested in parallel for the presence of enteroviruses, by using a flocculation method to concentrate the viruses followed by isolation in cultures of a buffalo green monkey (BGM) kidney continuous cell line. The enterovirus and coliphage recovery rates showed similar differences when waters with different levels of pollution were compared. Seasonal fluctuations of both the coliphage and enterovirus (mostly poliovirus) levels in river water were demonstrated by statistical analysis of the data collected. The levels increased in the winter and sharply declined in the summer months as the river water temperature increased. Chemical pollution did not seem to influence the survival of either the coliphages or the enteroviruses in the observed rivers...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the fecal {{indicator}} bacteria (FIB) currently used to indicate water quality in the coastal environment may be inadequate to reflect human viral contamination. Coliphage was suggested as a better indicator of human <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> and was proposed by the U. S. EPA as an alternative indicator for fecal pollution in groundwater. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and distribution of FIB, F+ coliphage, and PCR-detectable human adenovirus and enterovirus for an entire year at 15 locations around the Newport Bay watershed, an important southern California estuary for water recreation and an ecological reserve. Peak concentrations and prevalences of FIB and F+ coliphage were associated with winter storms (wet weather). Human adenoviruses and enteroviruses, however, were detected by PCR in ∼ 5 % of samples collected in the summer (dry weather) but only once in wet weather. These results demonstrated that FIB and coliphage have similar seasonal and freshwater-to-saltwater distribution patterns, while the detection of human viruses depends on a distribution pattern that is the opposite of that of FIB and coliphage. This research suggested that coliphage and FIB share similar environmental sources, while sources of human viruses in Newport Bay are perhaps different...|$|E

The second part of this study involves the selection of a protocol for virus detection, which was validated by analyzing the distribution and concentration of human viral pathogens under diverse conditions during an 18 -month period in four European countries. Shellfish-growing areas from diverse countries in the north and south of Europe were defined and studied, and the microbiological quality of the shellfish was analyzed. Human adenovirus, Norwalk-like virus, and enterovirus were identified as contaminants of shellfish in all the participating countries. Hepatitis A virus was also isolated in all areas except Sweden. The seasonal distribution of viral contamination was also described. Norwalk-like virus appeared to be the only group of viruses that demonstrated seasonal variation, with lower concentrations occurring during warm months. The depuration treatments currently applied were shown to be adequate for reducing Escherichia coli levels but ineffective for the elimination of viral particles.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the presence of pathogenic viruses in the Moselle River and to compare the usefulness of thermotolerant coliforms and somatic coliphages as tools for river water quality assessment in terms of viral contamination. Thermotolerant coliforms and somatic coliphages were enumerated by standardized methods in 170 samples of river water drawn from five sampling sites along the Moselle River (eastern France). BGM cell culture and integrated cell culture-reverse transcription-PCR DNA enzyme immunoassay were used to determine the presence of pathogenic viral genome (Enterovirus and Norovirus genogroup II [GGII]) and infectious Enterovirus spp. in 90 1 -liter samples. No infectious Enterovirus spp. were isolated, but Enterovirus and Norovirus GGII genomes were detected in 38 % of the samples. Norovirus GGII genome was mostly detected in winter, whereas Enterovirus genome was mostly detected in summer and fall. Somatic coliphages appeared to be less sensitive to higher river water temperature than thermotolerant coliforms. Furthermore, the number of river water samples positive for pathogenic viral genome increased with increasing concentration of somatic coliphages, whereas coliform concentration was unrelated to viral genome contamination. Consequently somatic coliphages, which are less sensitive to environmental factors than thermotolerant coliforms in river water, would provide a promising tool for assessment of river water quality in terms of fecal and <b>viral</b> <b>pollution...</b>|$|E

The detection of human adenoviruses by PCR was also examined as a potential molecular test to monitor <b>viral</b> <b>pollution.</b> The samples studied were urban and slaughterhouse sewage, river water, seawater, and shellfish. Enteroviruses were quantified by PFU in Buffalo green monkey kidney cells and fecal coliforms and phages of Bacteroides fragilis HSP 40 were also evaluated in some of the samples. The amplification of viral DNA and cDNA has shown a high prevalence of human viruses that would not be detected by the use of classical techniques, such as the quantification of PFU in cell lines. The results of the analysis of slaughterhouse sewage samples together with the test of farm animal feces indicate that the adenoviruses and the HAVs detected in the environment are mostly of human origin. A significative correlation between the detection of human viruses by PCR and the values of bacteriophages of B. fragilis HSP 40 in urban raw sewage was observed. Human adenoviruses were the viruses most frequently detected throughout the year, and all the samples that were positive for enteroviruses or HAVs were also positive for human adenoviruses.

The time taken to reduce levels of E. coli by 90 % was 6. 5 h or less in all cases. In contrast, the amounts of time needed to reduce levels of F+ bacteriophage by 90 % were considerably longer: 47. 3 and 41. 3 h (after short- and long-term exposures, respectively) in mussels and 54. 6 and 60. 8 h (after short- and long-term exposures, respectively) in oysters. No differences in the rates of reduction of indicators of <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> following exposure of the shellfish to either short- or long-term sewage contamination were observed.

40|$|International audienceF-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPH) {{have been}} widely studied as tools for {{evaluating}} fecal or <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> in water. It has also been proposed {{that they can be}} used to differentiate human from animal fecal contamination. While FRNAPH subgroup I (FRNAPH-I) and FRNAPH-IV are often associated with animal pollution, FRNAPH-II and -III prevail in human wastewater. However, this distribution is not absolute, and variable survival rates in these subgroups lead to misinterpretation of the original distribution. In this context, we studied FRNAPH distribution in urban wastewater and animal feces/wastewater. To increase the specificity, we partially sequenced the genomes of phages of urban and animal origins. The persistence of the genomes and infectivity were also studied, over time in wastewater and during treatment, for each subgroup. FRNAPH-I genome sequences did not show any specific urban or animal clusters to allow development of molecular tools for differentiation. They were the most resistant and as such may be used as fecal or viral indicators. FRNAPH-II's low prevalence and low sequence variability in animal stools, combined with specific clusters formed by urban strains, allowed differentiation between urban and animal pollution by using a specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) method. The subgroup's resistance over time was comparable to that of FRNAPH-I, but its surface properties allowed higher elimination rates during activated-sludge treatment. FRNAPH-III's low sequence variability in animal wastewater and specific cluster formation by urban strains also allowed differentiation by using a specific RT-PCR method. Nevertheless, its low resistance restricted it to being used only for recent urban pollution detection. FRNAPH-IV was too rare to be used...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{chlorinated}} primary effluents in <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> of the Ottawa River (Ontario) {{was assessed}} by examining 282 field samples of wastewaters from two different sewage treatment plants over a 2 -year period. The talc-Celite technique was used for sample concentration, and BS-C- 1 cells were employed for virus detection. Viruses were detected in 80 % (75 / 94) of raw sewage, 72 % (68 / 94) of primary effluent, and 56 % (53 / 94) of chlorinated effluent samples. Both raw sewage and primary effluent samples contained about 100 viral infective units (VIU) per 100 ml. Chlorination produced a 10 - to 50 -fold reduction in VIU and gave nearly 2. 7 VIU/ 100 ml of chlorinated primary effluent. With a combined daily chlorinated primary effluent output of approximately 3. 7 × 108 liters, these two plants were discharging 1. 0 × 1010 VIU per day. Because the river has a mean annual flow of 8. 0 × 1010 liters per day, these two sources alone produced a virus loading of 1. 0 VIU/ 8 liters of the river water. This river also receives at least 9. 0 × 107 liters of raw sewage per day and undetermined but substantial amounts of storm waters and agricultural wastes.

Thus, significant shellfish-growing areas from diverse countries {{in the north and}} south of Europe (Greece, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) were defined and studied by analyzing different physicochemical parameters in the water and the levels of Escherichia coli, F-specific RNA bacteriophages, and phages infecting Bacteroides fragilis strain RYC 2056 in the shellfish produced, before and after depuration treatments. A total of 475 shellfish samples were studied, and the results were statistically analyzed.

The F-RNA phages, which are present in higher numbers in Northern Europe, seem to be significantly related to the presence of viral contamination in shellfish, with a very weak predictive value for hepatitis A virus, human adenovirus, and enterovirus and a stronger one for Norwalk-like virus. However, it is important to note that shellfish produced in A or clean B areas can sporadically contain human viruses even in the absence of E. coli or F-RNA phages.

The total number of indigenous F-specific bacteriophages (F-specific RNA and F-specific DNA phages) was also reduced by about 99 % by wetland treatment, with the mean inflow concentration over the period of an entire year reduced from 3, 129 to 33 PFU ml- 1 in the outflow of a vegetated bed and to 174 PFU ml- 1 in the outflow of an unvegetated bed. Such superior treatment by the vegetated bed demonstrates the significant role of higher aquatic plants in the removal process. Seeded MS 2 bacteriophage and seeded poliovirus were removed more efficiently than were the indigenous bacteriophages, with less than 0. 2 % of MS 2 and 0. 1 % of the poliovirus surviving flow at the same hydraulic application rate. The decay rate (k) of MS 2 in a stagnant wetlands (k = 0. 012 to 0. 028 h- 1) was lower than that for flowing systems (k = 0. 44 to 0. 052 h- 1), reflecting the enhanced capacity for filtration or adsorption of viruses by the root-substrate complex (and associated biofilm).

40|$|AbstractThe {{association}} of viruses with settling particles {{is certainly a}} major process controlling the spread of <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> in surface water and sediment. To better understand the viral distribution in a river system, the behavior of F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPHs) was investigated in relationship with the suspended solids and sediment. The partitioning of phage particles (free or associated with solids) in surface water and the attachment capabilities of eight distinct strains of phages to sediment were studied in lab experiments. In situ observations were also performed with the genotyping of 166 individual plaques of FRNAPHs isolated from surface water and sediment. The results reported here demonstrate {{a variation of the}} status of infectious phages {{as a function of the}} hydro-climatological conditions. Phage-solid association seems to mainly occur during the peak of rainfall-runoff events but also to a certain extent during the recession phase compared to low flow conditions. The transfer of phages from the water column to sediment may occur at this time. Furthermore, the ability of FRNAPHs to interact with sediment was established for six strains out of eight, belonging to genogroups II, III and IV. A similar dynamic was observed for strains within a same genogroup despite different intensity of attachment and inactivation rates for strains of genogroups III and IV. The latter results match the in situ observations in the water and sediment compartments of the studied area. Infectious FRNAPH genogroup II was more abundant in sediment than in surface water. Its capability to sorb to sediment and its higher persistence in the environment compared to genogroups III and IV were the two main explanations. Together, lab and in situ experiments produce an overall vision of the mechanisms governing FRNAPH distribution among the water column and riverbed sediment...|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} of bacterial and <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> indicators and Salmonella in urban wastewaters under freezing conditions (- 14 degreesC {{for up to}} 60 days) is reported. Presumptive, total and faecal coliforms (PC, TC, FC), salmonellae and coliphages were tested. The dynamics of somatic coliphage (E coli C) and F-pili specific coliphage inactivation were compared at 4 degreesC and 25 degreesC over various run times. On freezing of the wastewater, {{it was found that}} PC, TC and FC showed a first rapid phase (days) of inactivation followed by a slower second phase (up to 4 weeks) and then stabilisation at between 1 - 10 % of the initial population size, depending on the wastewater sample used. Salmonella spp. were detectable in 0. 1 ml of raw wastewater and were still detected up to 2 days after freezing but none were detected in 100 ml samples after 4, 42 and 60 days, although microbiologically similar but antigenically different forms were found. Viral indicators of pollution showed a slow but constant decrease in viability during the first month but then stabilised at between 10 - 20 % survivors (10 % in somatic E coli C phages, 15. 8 % in somatic Salmonella phages and 17. 9 % in F-pili specific coliphages). Using electron microscopy, no difference in susceptibility to freezing could be detected with respect to morphological phage types, which were either small icosahedral particles or complex tailed phages. The study of viral indicators at 4 degreesC versus 25 degreesC showed a higher {{survival of}} the various coliphages over time at 4 degreesC. F-pili specific leviviridae were particularly susceptible to the antiviral factors at 25 degreesC and no viable units per ml were detected after one month at that temperature, whereas somatic coliphages were detected in higher numbers after this period, especially at 4 degreesC...|$|E
40|$|The {{aetiology}} of haemic neoplasia (HN) is unknown, so far {{but many}} causative factors are suggested such as <b>viral,</b> <b>pollution</b> and genetics. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine if, under chronic exposure, two major pesticides (chlorothalonil and mancozeb) which are used in potato production could induce HN in soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria). Short-term experiments with acute exposure were also performed. Clams were collected from an epizootic site (North River, PEI) and from a site free of the disease (Magdalen Islands, Quebec). The tetraploid level of haemocytes was assessed by flow cytometry for each clam to determine the HN status. The bioaccumulation of pesticides in tissues was quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for chlorothalonil while mancozeb and manganese were quantified by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometer (ICP/MS). Long term exposure to fungicide Bravo 500 ® did not induce high tetraploid levels on negative calm from North River and the analysis of the digestive gland and the mantle did not reveal any detectable level of chlorothalonil. In the Manzate 200 DF®, some clams revealed high level of tetraploid cells but no difference were observed between the treatments and the control. The analysis of the digestive gland and the mantle for manganese did not highlight any significant difference in tissue concentration (p = 0. 05). For the acute exposure, chlorothalonil analysis showed that the active ingredient is distributed between four chlorinated compounds: 99. 5 % for chlorothalonil isomers, 0. 4 % for pentachlorothalonil and 0. 1 % for trichlorothalonil isomers. For a 72 h experiment, the accumulation was within 4 h; the higher tissue concentration of chlorothalonil was 59. 2 μg g− 1 in the mantle after 48 h, following by a decrease to an undetectable level at the end. For the manganese, the accumulation was detected after 4 h; the higher tissue concentration was 48. 8 μg g− 1 in the mantle after 24 h and, over the following 48 h, the accumulation decreased until the end of the trial. Based on the data, the accumulation of these fungicides seems to be transitory. Chlorothalonil and mancozeb are both oxidative-stress promoters and could have induced cell dysfunction while in the tissue. Study on the effect of these fungicides on the p 53 protein system is an example of strategy that would provide information on cellular events promoting neoplasia. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the broad}} fields of Marine Biology and Oceanography, Marine Microbiology {{has been an}} area that until {{recently}} has received little attention by microbiologists and marine biologists. Recent discoveries and the economic support that this branch of science has received during the past sixties and seventies, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries, {{have made it possible}} for marine microbiology to reach a place of honor in the world of biological research. By reason of the 50 th aniversary of the Institucio Catalana d'Historia Natural the author presents the state of the research {{at the beginning of the}} eighties and the future necessities in the study of the microorganisms -bacteria and viruses mainly-, that live in the sea or end up in this habitat. The subject reviewed is very broad and the text has been divided in a series of 21 parts, many of them subdivided, that cover both the applied aspects of the field and the basic problems of marine microbiology. The paper begins with an introduction and a synopsis of the areas of study in modern marine microbiology (Parts 1 and 2), and goes on by reviewing applied aspects like bacterial and <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> of the sea (Part 3), and the interrelationships between marine bacteria and chemical pollution, covering xenobiotic compounds, metals, metalloids and hydrocarbons (Part 4). Next, the paper reviews the present state of research on pathogenic bacteria autochotonous to the marine environment (ecology, taxonomy, toxigenicity) (Part 5) and ends up this section with a revision of the real and potential interrelationships between marine microbiology and industry (Part 6). The basic aspects of marine microbial ecology are dealt with in a series of thirteen parts under the following titles: «Biomass and activity of procariotes in the marine habitats» (Part 7, subdivided in: «Biomass and productivity in the waters», «Biomass and activity in the sediments», and «Viable counting techniques and modern marine microbiology»). Part 8 covers topics more or less directly related to marine bacteria and secondary production and is subdivided into: «Dissolved organic matter and marine bacteria», «Marine bacteria and particulate matter», «Heterotrophic bacteria and excretion of organic compounds by photosynthetic Organisms», «Marine bacteria and nutrient excretion by animals» and «Bacterivorous animals in the sea». Part 9 includes discussions on a few subjects that have recently received a considerable interest by marine microbiologists: «New fields of research of marine microbiology in the pico and nanoplankton». «Microbial life in deep sea vents» in the title of Part 10 covers this most interesting subject under the subheading «Discovery and characteristics of the habitat», «Bacteria as primary producers in the submarine deep sea oases», «Is there microbial life above 100 ºC in the submarine oases?» and «Other areas colonized by thermophilic prokariotes in the bottom of the seas». The classical subjects of barophily and psychrophily are covered in parts 11 and 12 under the headings: «Barophilism and marine microbiology» and «Psychrophily and marine microbiology». «Manganese nodules and marine bacteria» is the title of part 13, whereas «The microbiology of surfaces in the marine habitat» heads part 14 and reviews this most important area of research in nowadays general microbial ecology. The classical problem about the presence and activity of attached versus free living marine bacteria is reviewed in part 15 : «Free living planktonic bacteria and attached bacteria». Marine habitats present a frequent nutrient challenge to the microscopic organisms because extensive areas of the sea are oligotrophic. The adaptation problems that this fact poses to bacteria and the research that is done to find the structural and biochemical adaptations of prokariotes to a nutrient poor environment are covered in part 16 : «Adaptations to starvation: oligotrophism and marine microbiology». Part 17, «Miscellaneous aspects of the research on the physiology and ecology of marine bacteria», includes study areas that have not been treated in the previous parts. Part 18, «The biogeochemical cycles of the elements. Marine microbiology in the sediments» comments on selected topics in the field of microbially based marine biogeochemistry, with a special mention to sedimentary related processes. Under «Other study areas of marine microbiology» (Part 19), the author presents a few topics that have escaped the previous classification. The state of research on marine microbiology in the Catalans Countries is finally briefly reviewed (Part 20). The paper ends with a «Final words» section (Part 21) where the future and perspectives of the branch of microbiology that deals with marine microorganisms in the Catalan speaking countries is outlined...|$|E
40|$|Pour rechercher les virus dans les eaux usées traitées, une {{nouvelle}} méthode d'adsorption-élution sur laine de verre a été appliquée comparativement à la méthode d'adsorption-élution sur poudre de verre. Lorsque la technique de concentration sur laine de verre est utilisée, c'est dans les 25 premiers ml de l'éluat que la majorité des virus poliomyélitique est retrouvé (89 à 94 %). La comparaison des méthodes de concentration des virus indigènes à partir d'échantillons d'effluents provenant de deux stations d'épuration biologique de la Côte d'Azur (Cagnes-sur-Mer et Nice), a mis en évidence la supériorité de cette nouvelle méthode : les taux de positivité ont été respectivement de 85 % vs 38 % pour l'effluent de Cagnes-sur-Mer et 100 % vs 44 % pour l'effluent de Nice. De même, les titres en virus indigènes après concentration ont varié de 0 à 250 NPPUC/l pour la méthode sur laine de verre contre 0 à 25, 5 NPPUC/l pour la méthode sur poudre de verre. La différence constatée entre les méthodes est statistiquement significative après analyse de variance (p = 0, 0119 pour l'effluent de Cagnes-sur-mer et p < 0, 0001 pour l'effluent de Nice). De plus, la technique sur laine de verre ne nécessite ni l'abaissement du pH, ni le changement de la composition ionique de l'échantillon d'eau à analyser. Biological {{treatment of}} sewage in waste water plants does not allow elimination of {{the whole of the}} microbial load. Discharge of the treated sewage results in <b>viral</b> <b>pollution</b> of river, lakes and seas, a potential hazard for the health that has to be monitored. The amont of virus in waste water beeing low, concentration from the samples brought to the laboratory is rendered necessary. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of a new adsorption-elution method on glass wool to recover indigenous viruses from effluents of the cities of Cagnes and Nice (Alpes-Maritimes, France). In order to evaluate its efficiency we compared it to the regular adsorption-elution method on glass powder. As a preliminary we determined upon artificially contaminated 5 liter waste waters samples what detection of virus could be performed only in the first 25 ml of the 100 ml eluate, as in the glass powder concentration method. Results show chat virus titers found in that first fraction of eluate were close to those in the total sample. Thus from 3 samples containing 1. 60 108 MPNCU/ 5 l, 1. 96 107 MPNCU/ 5 l and 4. 32 104 MPNCU/ 5 l we found in that first fraction respectively 1. 50 104 MPNCU/ 5 l (94 %), 1. 80 107 MPNCU/ 5 l (92 %) and 3. 85 104 MPNCU/ 5 l (89 %); these recovery rates are not significantly different by comparison of confidence limits. The glass powder method, necessitates preliminary treatment of the sample : acidification to pH 3. 5 and adjunction of AICI 3 at a final concentration of 5. 10 - 4 M. After flowing the acidified sample through 100 g of borosilicated glass powder at a rate of 10 l/ 10 min inside a decantation ampulla. Then adsorbed virus may be eluted from the sedimentated glass powder with 100 ml of borate buffer containing 3 % beet extract, pH 9  : the first 25 ml were collected into a flask containing 2. 5 ml of a mixture of antibacterial and antifungal antibiotics. For the glass wool adsorption method, a 19 cm 3 cartridge was packed with 5 g sodocalcic glass wool at a 0. 4 g/cm 3 density and rinced sequentially with : 10 ml 1 N HCl, 10 ml deionised water, 10 ml 1 N NaOH and lastly 40 ml deionised water. It was balanced with 200 ml deionised water. The sample, was pumped at a flow rate ca 10 l/h. Enumeration of viruses was performed by inoculating 40 microplate wells containing KB cells, and performing 3 passages 5 days each, after which the number of wells presenting with CPE was determined. This characteristic number allowed calculation of the most probable number of cytopathic units (MPNCU) with the 95 % confidence limit. The Box and Cox analysis of transformation was applied to the data. Since the calculated value of λ approximated zero (λ = - 0. 29 for the Cagnes effluent and λ = - 0, 062 for the Nice effluent), transformation of the gross data into logarithm was justified. To allow this transformation, the zero had to be substituted for by a value equal to half the limit sensitivity of the method (I well out of 40), i. e. 0. 5. Distribution of the data being roughly log-normal, it was then possible to compare the results of the two methods by two-way analysis of variance, cross classification, without replica. The test for factor method was calculated according to the interaction since this factor is fixed. Overall it appeared that all 31 10 -liter samples analysed contained viruses when results from bath methods were combined. Still no single method allowed virus recovery in a 100 % of cases, however the glass wool adsorption method found viruses in 29 / 31 vs 13 / 31 with the glass powder method. The new method detected virus in 11 / 13 (85 %) samples from Cagnes waste waters as well as in 18 / 18 (100 %) from Nice. Quantitative analysis of the viral titers indicates that, titers were higher following the glass wool adsorption method than following the glass powder adsorption method in 11 / 13 samples from Cagnes treatment plant and in 17 / 18 from Nice. Thus virus concentrations varied between 0 and 250 MPNCU/l (MGT= 4. 6 MPNCU/l) for the Cagnes effluent and between 2 and 60 MPNCU/l (MGT= 7. 5 MPNCU/I) for the Nice effluent. For the same samples virus concentrations obtained following glass powder adsorption method varied between 0 and 8. 5 MPNCU/l (MGT 0. 9 MPNCU/l) for the Cagnes effluent and between 0 and 25. 5 MPNCU/l (MOT= 1. 3 MPNCU/l 1) for the Nice effluent. This difference is statistically significant (p = 0. 0119 for the Cagnes effluent and p < 0. 0001 for the Nice effluent). Furthermore, when taking into account the origin of the waters analysed, comparison between observed F 0. 95 (7. 94 for the Cagnes waters and 45. 78 for the Nice waters) and theoretical F 0. 95 (4. 75 for the Cagnes waters and 4. 45 for the Nice waters) leads to the rejection of the hypothesis of identity of the two methods. The discordances observed are an illustration of the fact that concluding to the absence of viruses in a given sample is a matter of method and should be interpreted with prudence. A few drawbacks inherent to the glass powder adsorption method may explain its poorer efficiency : the necessary acidification of the sample to pH 3. 5 may be fatal to a proportion of virions; also the flow rate necessary to maintain the fluid layer of glass powder in suspension during the adsorption step is 6 fold higher than that required in the glass wool method (60 l/h vs 10 l/h). Finally the nature of the adsorbing material, sodocalcic vs borosilicated, may be determinent. We can conclude from the present comparative study, to the statistically significant superiority of the glass wool method for virus concentration from treated waste waters...|$|E
