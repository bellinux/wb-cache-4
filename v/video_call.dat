5|$|Lucy {{returns and}} Chris rejects her offer of being father to her child when Nate confesses {{he does not}} want children; however, Chris changes his mind when Nate {{supports}} him. Nate later helps Chris and Lucy see that they need to think the idea through more thoroughly, and they draw up a contract detailing how their child will be raised. When they learn that they are both carriers of spinal muscular atrophy, Chris tells Lucy that she should find another donor. But when Chris sees how down Lucy is, he changes his mind and they go ahead with the insemination. A couple of weeks later, Lucy calls Chris to tell him that she is pregnant. Chris plans to visit New York for the scan, but Nate confesses he is banned from the States for overstaying his visa there previously. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) agrees to help lift the ban, but Nate misses a meeting and Chris accuses him of not taking it seriously. Lucy returns for a visit and Chris decides he wants to split his time between Erinsborough and New York when the baby comes, although Nate is against this idea. Nate realises that they want different things, and they break-up. Chris then decides to move to New York with Lucy and leaves after a farewell party at The Waterhole. A few months later, Amber contacts Chris and Lucy via <b>video</b> <b>call</b> after learning that they have had a daughter. Chris and Lucy introduce her to Anne, and Chris asks Amber to say hello to Nate for him.|$|E

2500|$|The {{science fiction}} {{television}} series Firefly provided {{the inspiration for}} the project's name.

[...] Another common error message, [...] "Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret!" [...] is a quote from Kaylee Frye in the 2005 motion-picture Firefly continuation, Serenity, and it is matched with a sign declaring that [...] "This wave is experiencing some turbulence and might explode.

50|$|What's more, van der Zwaard and Bannink (2014) {{examined}} {{the effect of}} <b>video</b> <b>call</b> compared with face-to-face communication on the negotiation of meaning between native speakers and non-native speakers of English. Face-to-face communication can provide individuals who use English as the second language both intentional and unintentional actions which could enhance the comprehension of the chat in English. Besides, individuals are more honest in understanding {{when they are in}} face-to-face interaction than in <b>video</b> <b>call</b> due to the potential loss of face issues for the non-native language speakers during the <b>video</b> <b>call.</b> So as a result, face-to-face interaction has a more positive influence on the negotiation of meaning than virtual communications such as the <b>video</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

40|$|Twenty {{five percent}} of {{individuals}} diagnosed with autism are nonverbal and {{need to learn to}} communicate using alternative means (National Research Council, 2001) in order to build functional spontaneous communication. Joint attention behaviors are critical for communication development (Mundy & Newell, 2007). This study introduces a <b>video</b> <b>calling</b> intervention to target the joint attention behaviors, eye gaze, verbalization and gestures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to discover what relationship exists between <b>video</b> <b>calling</b> and joint attention in nonverbal children with autism and to explore the perspectives of parents and their communication interaction with the child. This case study of two children is a quantitative ABA withdrawal design and a qualitative narrative design. The ABA design uses seven-inch Prestige 7 Connect tablets and Skype, <b>video</b> <b>calling</b> software program to communicate during game, reading and discussion activities. Observing and recording procedures were used to collect the data and visual analysis was conducted using graphs, tables. The narrative design used parent interviews and questionnaires to build themes. The findings indicate that <b>video</b> <b>calling</b> had a positive impact on eye gaze and verbalization behaviors during discussion and game activities. From the narrative analysis emerged a theme of engagement and focus. The conclusions indicate that <b>video</b> <b>calling</b> has impact on some joint attention behaviors and increases engagement in nonverbal children with autism. Implications for this study include using <b>video</b> <b>calling</b> in the classroom for peer interactions and skill building. Further study is needed to increase the generalizability of these findings...|$|R
