40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an efficient method {{to solve the}} obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner tree (OARSMT) problem optimally. Our work is developed based on the GeoSteiner approach in which full Steiner trees (FSTs) are first constructed and then combined into a rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (RSMT). We modify and extend the algorithm to allow obstacles in the routing region. For each routing obstacle, we first introduce four <b>virtual</b> <b>terminals</b> located at its four corners. We then give the definition of FSTs with blockages and prove that they will follow some very simple structures. Based on these observations, a twophase approach is developed {{for the construction of}} OARSMTs. In the first phase, we generate a set of FSTs with blockages. In the second phase, the FSTs generated in the first phase are used to construct an OARSMT. Finally, experiments on several benchmarks are conducted. Results show that the proposed method is able to handle problems with hundreds of terminals in the presence of multiple obstacles, generating an optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time...|$|R

30|$|We further {{illustrate}} ConSerts with {{an example}} from the agricultural domain, which has previously been presented in [4]. The agricultural domain today pioneers innovative applications involving systems of systems and dynamic integration. One of these applications is the so-calledTractor Implement Management (TIM). The TIM functionality enables agricultural implements to control typical tractor functions such as velocity, steering angle, power take off, or auxiliary valves. It is possible to fully automate implement-specific work procedures and to optimize them with respect to parameters such as performance, efficiency, or wear and tear. TIM utilizes a standardized bus system for communication between the participating devices and machines. During TIM operation, control is typically assumed by the implement. It uses the TIM functions of the tractor (e.g., controlling velocity, steering angle, power take-off, hydraulic valves) and auxiliary devices, such as sensors for the respective automation purpose, displays data to the operator, and executes operator inputs. Between different tractors, implements, and auxiliary devices such as <b>virtual</b> <b>terminals</b> (providing the operator UI) or GPS systems of different manufacturers, a huge space of configurations arises, which makes it unfeasible to analyze each potential configuration a priori at development time. For this reason, those TIM applications already available {{on the market today}} only work for predetermined concrete pairs of tractors and implements whose integration has been thoroughly analyzed at development time by the involved manufacturers.|$|R
