40|$|Due to {{intrinsic}} genetic instability, multiple mutations, escape mechanisms, {{and unpredictable}} metastasis of individual malignant cells, hitting evasive cancer targets {{proves to be}} a major challenge with targeted cancer therapies. Therefore, we have elaborated an alternative and general anticancer approach namely small molecule sequential dual-targeting theragnostic strategy (SMSDTTS), with the aim to target and debulk the tumor mass, wipe out the residual tumor cells, and meanwhile make the tumor detectable and the treatment monitorable. The study hypothesis has been gradually developed during intensive research over the last 20 years, and has now been preliminarily proven by animal research as demonstrated in this PhD thesis. This dual targeting approach works in two steps of systemic drug administration. First, an anti-tubulin vascular disrupting agent (VDA) such as combretastatin A 4 phosphate (CA 4 P) is used to selectively cut off tumor blood supply and to cause intratumoral necrosis, though always leaving peripheral <b>viable</b> <b>residues</b> and later re-growth. Secondly, a necrosis-avid compound (NAC) is injected, such as hypericin (Hyp) radiolabeled with iodine- 131 (131 I-Hyp), which accumulates in intratumoral necrotic tissue and irradiates neighboring cancer cells with beta particles to prevent tumor relapse. The emitted gamma rays enable radioscintigraphy to detect the tumors and follow up the therapy, i. e. a simultaneous theragnostic approach. In chapter 1 of this PhD thesis, we first reviewed the various targeted anticancer therapies that represent the current mainstream of both preclinical and clinical settings, and proposed the study concept for the SMSDTTS. In chapter 2, the hypothesis underlying the SMSDTTS was tested with experimental evidences in a rat model with hepatic rhabdomyosarcomas (R 1). In chapter 3, we continued a deeper exploration on the theragnostic potential of radioiodinated Hyp in rodent models of benign and malignant necroses. In chapter 4, based on favorable anticancer effects observed in the above preliminary experiments, we further investigated survival probability and long term diagnostic potential in a most challenging mouse tumor model intended to show a tumoricidal effect solely due to SMSDTTS without any spontaneous immune reaction. In chapter 5, the potential chemotoxicity of iodinated Hyp was studied in mice with median lethal dose (LD 50) and clinical biochemistry profile been determined, which offers information about the safety of SMSDTTS. The VDA CA 4 P has demonstrated vascular shutdown and tumor growth delay in both animal experiments and clinical trials, and has been used as the first therapeutic agent in the SMSDTTS protocol. In chapter 6, an intra-individual comparison of variable therapeutic responses to CA 4 P was conducted in rats with subcutaneous and intrahepatic multifocal R 1 tumors using MRI as an in vivo imaging biomarker and digital microangiography as an ex vivo quantitative technique. Finally, in chapter 7, this thesis is concluded by summarizing the current progress, existing challenges and future opportunities on the development of SMSDTTS, which may help to translate this strategy from preclinical research towards possible clinical applications. All these endeavors may pave the path towards future clinical trials on SMSDTTS to prove its safety and theragnostic efficacy, and to eventually benefit desperate cancer patients. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of conventional anticancer {{strategies such as}} radiotherapy and chemotherapy is lacking specificity, i. e. concomitant cytotoxic effects on both cancerous and normal tissues. In order to find more selective treatments, researchers have made efforts to exploit morphological, physiological and microenvironmental differences between the normal and malignant tissues. One {{of the most prominent}} differences lies intheir diverse vascular systems. Solid malignancies have to develop their own blood supply; a process known as tumor neoangiogenesis, which is largely responsible for tumor aggressive growth and metastasis as well astreatment failures. It has been demonstrated that tumor vasculature is structurally immature with chaotic and leaky phenotypes, which provides opportunities for developing novel anticancer strategies. Targeting tumor vasculature is not only a unique therapeutic intervention to starve neoplastic cells, but also enhances the efficacy of conventional anticancer treatments. Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) have been developed to disrupt the already existing neovasculature in actively growing tumors, cause catastrophic vascular shutdown within a short time frame, and induce ischemic tumor necrosis. VDAs are cytostatic; they can only inhibit the tumor growth, but not eradicate the tumor. These unique features have posed a demand for developing multiparametric imaging biomarkers to monitor early hemodynamic alterations, cellular dysfunctionsand metabolic impairments before any detectable changes in tumor dimensions. In addition to serological cancer biomarkers that have been traditionally adopted for the evaluation of antitumor efficacies, the use of imaging techniques as virtual biomarkers has also beenrecommended by the FDA in oncologic drug development. Out of various imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is most frequently applied for the evaluation of VDA effects due to its versatile advantages such as excellent spatial and temporal resolution, imaging in arbitrary planes, no ionizing radiation, and the capacity to provide morphological, functional and metabolic information, which would facilitate noninvasive serial therapeutic follow-up. Conventional MRI biomarkers, derived from T 2 -weighted imaging (T 2 WI), T 1 -weighted imaging (T 1 WI) and contrast-enhanced T 1 WI (CE-T 1 WI), are easy to acquire and analyze, and can provide topographic information such as tumor location, shape and volume,and rough assessment of blood supply and tumor necrosis. But they only reveal incomplete pathophysiological processes, or they are often too late relative to the very rapid vascular shutdown. Thus, it is imperative to develop more prompt, accurate, quantifiable, specific imaging biomarkers for characterizing those early molecular and cellular events, which can be applicable to clinical practice for depicting early functional and metabolic changes, offering the insight into mechanism of VDA action, dictating the course of therapy, and predicting prognosis. For the functional evaluation, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) -MRI canbe used for the quantification of the blood-supply-related physiological parameter such as blood flow, blood volume, vascular permeability, and extravascular extracellular space. Another important pathophysiological parameter that can be provided by MRI is apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Being contrast-agent-free and easy-to-perform, DWI is the technique available for assessing the water diffusion at subcellular level in vivo. But it is onlyby combining multiparametric imaging biomarkers that we may beginto truly understand how VDAs affect tissue microenvironment and tumor cells. So far, DCE-MRI and DWI, as well as Fluorine- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18 F-FDG PET) are most advanced biomarkers, from which we can gain insights into vascular functions, programmed cell death or necrosis, and glucose metabolism. However, procedural rigor of these multiparametric imaging biomarkers has to be established before they could take up an essential position in clinical decision making. In this PhD thesis, we explored the role of multiparametric imaging biomarkers in the morphological, functional and metabolic evaluation of vascular disrupting effects on tumor models of small rodents. We first worked on the methodology for preclinical settings but relevant to clinical practice, including the validation of tumor growth in visceral organs of small rodents for imaging studies with a clinical MRI scanner (chapter 2), the contribution of DWI for assessing tumor viability and blood supply (chapter 3), and the introduction of necrosis-avid contrast agent to the VDAevaluation (chapter 4). Based on such an established preclinical platform in small rodent models, we investigated the therapeutic effects of two lead VDAs, combretastatin A 4 phosphate (CA 4 P) (chapter 5) and ZD 6126 (chapter 6) respectively with multiparametric imaging biomarkers. We also compared the differential therapeutic effects between CA 4 P and ZD 6126 at a clinically relevant dose, providing the results likely more predictable to the clinical practice (chapter 7). The thesis is concluded with an overview of the new developments in the topics covered by the current PhD research (chapter 8). Our studies indicated that multiparametric imaging biomarkers can be used to morphologically, functionally and metabolically quantify vascular shutdown, necrosis formation and tumor relapse early after VDA treatment, as solidly validated by the postmortem gold-standard techniques. Both CA 4 P and ZD 6126 at a clinically relevant dose induced the vascular shutdown in rhabdomyosarcoma of rat liver. CA 4 P was more effective than ZD 6126 on depriving tumor blood supply and delaying tumor growth in this tumor model. Single dose of VDA proves insufficient for the treatment of tumordue to the peripheral <b>viable</b> <b>residues</b> and eventual tumor relapse. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A reciclagem dos resíduos agroindustriais é apontada por diversos pesquisadores como a melhor solução a ser dada para dois grandes problemas ambientais atuais: a escassez de recursos naturais e a disposição inadequada desses resíduos. Sendo assim a pesquisa teve como objetivo o estudo técnico da potencialidade da utilização da cinza do bagaço da cana-de-açúcar (CBC) na substituição do agregado miúdo na confecção de blocos de concreto para pavimentação (pavers), sujeitos a solicitações leves. Para atingir este objetivo a metodologia adotada compreendeu etapas como: a caracterização dos resíduos a serem utilizados, confecção dos pavers com diferentes teores de substituição parcial de agregado miúdo e determinação das principais características dos pavers. A CBC mostrou-se um resíduo viável para a substituição parcial do agregado miúdo na fabricação dos pavers por apresentar uma melhora expressiva das características analisadas (resistência à compressão, absorção e abrasão) em relação aos pavers fabricados sem a substituição parcial da areia pela CBC.

40|$|Background : Primary {{conservative}} surgery and cisplatin-based chemotherapy {{have resulted in}} high cure ratesin malignant ovarian germ cell tumors. A significant proportion of advanced tumors may have post-chemotherapyresidue {{and it is important}} to distinguish necrosis or fibrosis without viable tumor from persistent viable tumorand teratoma. Aims : To evaluate the role of laparotomy in assessing the nature of post-chemotherapy residue in ovariangerm cell tumors. Materials and Methods : Eighty-three patients with malignant ovarian germ cell tumors seen at Cancer Institute,Chennai between 1992 and 2002 were studied. Sixty-eight patients completed combination chemotherapywith cisplatin regimes, of whom 35 had radiological residual masses. Twenty-nine out of these 35 patientsunderwent laparotomy to assess the nature of the residue. Results : On laparotomy, three patients had viable tumor, seven immature teratoma, three mature teratomaand 16 only necrosis or fibrosis. None of our patients with dysgerminoma, embryonal carcinoma, absence ofteratoma element in the primary tumor and radiological residue of &# 60; 5 cm had viable tumor whereas all patientswith tumors containing teratoma component initially had residual tumor. Absence of viable disease was higherin patients who had normalization of serum markers by two cycles of chemotherapy. Conclusion : Our study suggests that patients with absence of teratoma element initially, radiological residue of&# 60; 5 cm and normalization of serum markers after two cycles of chemotherapy do not require surgery to assessthe nature of post-chemotherapy residue. However, laparotomy should be performed in patients with tumorsthat initially contain teratoma element and in those with sluggish tumor marker response after two cycles ofchemotherapy since they have a high chance of having <b>viable</b> postchemotherapy <b>residue...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{residues}} from dilute-acid pretreatment {{coupled with}} simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (DAP-SSF) of pine, poplar, and switchgrass {{were used as}} sole carbon sources for cultivation of oleaginous R. opacus DSM 1069 and PD 630. Due to the insoluble nature of the DAP-SSF residue feedstocks, {{it was necessary to}} perform the fermentations with Rhodococci in a suspension of the solids. The results of this slurry cell culture indicated cell growth is <b>viable</b> utilizing DAP-SSF <b>residues</b> as sole sources of carbon and energy to produce single cell oils. The cell viability for R. opacus DSM 1069 and PD 630  grown on DAP-SSF residues was determined by tracking colony forming units per volume via plating of serial dilutions of culture (Kosa and Ragauskas 2013). This method was utilized as the primary means of tracking cellular growth as opposed to optical density tracking with UV–visible spectroscopy and cell dry weight due to the inability to completely separate cells from compact residues in the suspension broth. Drawbacks of this alternative technique include the extended time for cells to grow in between intervals of measurement. In addition, the lack of cell dry weight prevents the ability to determine cell oleaginicity and final conversion of residues to lipids. However, for all residues, both strains of R. opacus were able to sustain growth. The viability of the Rhodococci strains on the DAP-SSF residues suggest that the cells survived by metabolizing small dissolved lignin molecules, supported by the GPC results (Fig. 2).|$|R
40|$|It is {{anticipated}} that demand for chemicals and fuel derived from sustainably grown bio-mass will {{increase over the}} coming decades. Forest and wood processing residues and waste {{are likely to become}} a significant feedstock to large scale biorefineries to produce both renewable fuels and chemicals. Maximising the economic value of these residues whilst simultaneously minimising the environmental impact of the manufactured product is an important task in process and product selection and design. Multiple processing and product pathways exist and it is often unclear what the best options are without detailed assessment or preliminary design. The P-graph framework was used to examine the economically feasibility of utilising five types of wood processing residues: wood chip, pulp logs, saw dust, and landing and cutover residues. Twenty different products were considered, based on three main production platforms or routes, sugars, pyrolysis, and gasification. Kraft pulp production and energy products were also considered as <b>viable</b> options for <b>residues.</b> Only six of the products considered were found to be profitable with the most economically viable uses being kraft pulp production and boiler fuel. Products included in the feasible solutions and the source of residues are all finely balanced, and slight changes in feedstock cost, product price, and operational and capital costs can cause major changes to the feasible structures. When heat integration for using Total Site was incorporated into the P-graph there was no economic benefit for the routes and scale of production considered here...|$|R
