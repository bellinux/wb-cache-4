40|$|AbstractSemi-active {{landing gear}} can provide good {{performance}} of both landing impact and taxi situation, {{and has the}} ability for adapting to various ground conditions and operational conditions. A kind of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control algorithm (NMPC) for semi-active landing gears is developed in this paper. The NMPC algorithm uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization technique and chooses damping performance of landing gear at touch down to be the optimization object. The <b>valve's</b> <b>rate</b> and magnitude limitations are also considered in the controller's design. A simulation model is built for the semi-active landing gear's damping process at touchdown. Drop tests are carried out on an experimental passive landing gear systerm to validate {{the parameters of the}} simulation model. The result of numerical simulation shows that the isolation of impact load at touchdown can be significantly improved compared to other control algorithms. The strongly nonlinear dynamics of semi-active landing gear coupled with control <b>valve's</b> <b>rate</b> and magnitude limitations are handled well with the proposed controller...|$|R

However, mercury are valves do suffer from random phenomena such as arcback, which requires special bracing for the converter transformer. In addition, mercury arc valves need considerable auxiliaries, including cooling and vacuum plants. Research and development directed towards the improvement in the voltage and current capabilities of thyristors are yielding encouraging results. In contrast to mercury arc valves, thyristors do not suffer from random phenomena and require minim auxiliaries.

The comparatively low ratings of thyristors necessitate series and parallel connection of thyristors in order to construct a <b>valve</b> of sufficient <b>rating</b> for hvdc operation.

The spectrum density function/AErms spectra of both wide band (WD) and resonance (R 15 and R 30) AE sensors were studied. The results demonstrate a very good similarity transfer function in various conditions. Three sets of cutting condition of tool wear monitoring in machining tests were conducted. A tool shank of type SDJCL 1616 H 11 and carbide tool inserts of type CG 4035 DCMT 11 T 3 04 -UF (Sandvik Coromant) were used. Two AE sensors were mounted on the tool-holder: a WD sensor (PAC) {{at the end of}} the tool-holder and an R 30 sensor (PAC) on the side.

We investigated this question for the two most popular bileaflet valves. Methods: Aortic valve data were abstracted from 14 St Jude Medical (St Jude Medical Inc, Minneapolis, Minn; 33, 125 patient-y) and 11 Carbomedics (Sulzer Carbomedics Inc, Austin, Tex; 19, 141 patient-y) series, and mitral valve data were abstracted from 11 St Jude Medical (21, 553 patient-y) and 8 Carbomedics (8368 patient-y) series. Regression analysis was used to accommodate heterogeneity among rates with the same valve model, to estimate hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for the valve model effect, and to incorporate other series-level risk factors. Results: Most of the complication <b>rates</b> with both <b>valve</b> models exhibited significant heterogeneity. For thromboembolism and bleeding, the relative risks for valve model were not significantly different from unity. <b>Valve</b> thrombosis <b>rates</b> exhibited less heterogeneity: the Carbomedics valve had a lower rate in the aortic position (hazard ratio 0. 2, 95 % confidence interval 0. 1 - 0. 6) and a higher rate in the mitral position (hazard ratio 1. 9, 95 % confidence interval 1. 0 - 3. 8). Conclusions: Unlike simple weighted averages of <b>valve</b> complication <b>rates,</b> regression methods can incorporate heterogeneity related to center effects and allow for inclusion of other risk factors. Thromboembolism and bleeding rates were not significantly different with St Jude Medical and Carbomedics valves.

The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the absolute rates of transcatheter aortic valve replacement related PPM implantations in patients with pre-existent right bundle branch block and categorize for different transcatheter heart valves. Methods and Results-We pooled data on 306 transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients from 4 high-volume centers in Europe and selected those with right bundle branch block at baseline without a previously implanted PPM. Logistic regression was used to evaluate whether PPM rate differed among transcatheter heart valves after adjustment for confounders. Mean age was 83 ± 7 years and 63 % were male. Median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6. 3 (interquartile range, 4. 1 - 10. 2).

Overall permanent pacemaker implantation <b>rate</b> post-transcatheter aortic <b>valve</b> replacement was 41 %, and per valve design: 75 % with Lotus, 46 % with CoreValve, 32 % with ES-XT, and 34 % with ES- 3.

ResultsBicuspid aortic valve were found in 50 patients(16, 2 %), mean age 45 ± 16 years(p= 0, 0001),sex ratio 5, 25 / 1. Charlson's comorbidity index was lower in bicuspid valve (1, 64 ± 2, 56 vs 2, 78 ± 2, 43; p= 0, 003). Abscesses was detected in 50 % of cases of bicuspid valve vs 19, 7 % on tricuspid aortic valve (p= 0, 0001). Previous antibiotic therapy before diagnosis was more frequent in bicuspid IE (30, 4 vs 13, 7 %,p= 0, 005), as well as negative blood cultures(24 vs 10 %,p= 0. 006). Digestive organisms were significantly less isolated in bicuspid <b>valve.</b> <b>Rate</b> of embolic events was not different. In bicuspid valve IE, surgery was performed in 72 % of cases. Peri-operative mortality was 11. 1 %, Staphylococcus aureus infection was the only independent predictor of peri-operative mortality (HR 34, 9; IC 95 % 1, 5 - 76, 8;p= 0, 024). Uncontrolled infection was the independent predictor of 1 year mortality(HR 20, 55;IC 95 % 1, 5 - 268;p= 0, 021).
