40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} program are to develop information on lubricity and <b>viscosity</b> <b>improvers</b> {{and their impact on}} the wear mechanisms in fuel injectors operating on blends of dimethyl ether (DME) and diesel fuel. Since DME is a fuel with no lubricity (i. e., it does not possess the lubricating quality of diesel fuel), conventional fuel delivery and fuel injection systems are not compatible with dimethyl ether. Therefore, to operate a diesel engine on DME one must develop a fuel-tolerant injection system, or find a way to provide the necessary lubricity to the DME. In the shuttle bus project, we have chosen the latter strategy in order to achieve the objective with minimal need to modify the engine. Our strategy is to blend DME with diesel fuel, to obtain the necessary lubricity to protect the fuel injection system and to achieve low emissions. In this project, we have sought to develop methods for extending the permissible DME content in the DME-diesel blends without experiencing rapid injector failure due to wear.

40|$|The {{lubricants}} {{are normally}} composed by base oils {{and a number}} of additives which are added to improve the performances of the final product. In this work, which is due to the collaboration between ENI S. p. A. and Prof. Casnati’s group, significant results in the application of calixarene structures to two classes of lubricant additives (<b>viscosity</b> index <b>improvers</b> and detergents) were shown. In particular, several calix[8]arene derivatives were synthesized to use as core precursors in the “arm-first" synthetic processes of star polymers for <b>viscosity</b> index <b>improver</b> applications. The use of calixarene derivatives enable the production of star polymers with a high and well-defined number of branches and endowed with a very low dispersivity of molecular weight which can originate better performances than the current commercially available <b>viscosity</b> index <b>improvers</b> of the major competitor. Several functional groups were considered to prepare reactive p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene cores to be used in living anionic polymerization. n-butyllithium was used as model of the living anionic polymer to test the outcome of the reaction of polymer insertion on the calixarene core, facilitating the analyses of the products. The calixarene derivative, which easier reacts with n-BuLi, was selected for the preparation of star polymers by using a isoprene/styrene living anionic polymer. Finally, the lubricant formulations, which include the calixarene-based star polymers or commercially available products as <b>viscosity</b> index <b>improvers,</b> were prepared and comparatively tested. In the last part of Thesis, the use of calixarenes as polycarboxylic acids to synthetize new sulfur-free detergents as lubricant additives was carried out. In this way, these calcium-based detergents can be used for the formulation of new automotive lubricants with low content of ash, phosphorus and sulfur (low SAPS). To increase the low deprotonation degree of OH groups and their capacity to complex calcium ions, a complete functionalization of the calixarene mixtures with acetic acid groups was required. Futhermore, the “one-step” synthesis of new calixarenes with alkyl chains in para positions longer than the ones already known was necessary to improve the oil solubility and stability of reverse micelles formed by the detergents. Moreover, the separation and characterization of the calixarenes were carried out to optimize their synthetic process, also on pilot scale. For our purpose, the use of p-tert-octylcalixarenes for the preparation of detergents was carried out to compare the properties of the final detergents respect {{to the use of the}} p-dodecyl calixarenes. Once achieved the functionalization of both calixarene mixtures with carboxylic acid groups, the syntheses of new calixarene-based detergents were carried out to identify the best calixarene derivative for our research goals. The synthetic process for the preparation of calixarene-based detergent having very high basicity (TBN 400) was also investigated for applications in lubricants for marine engines. In addition, with the aim of testing the calixarene-based detergents in automotive lubricants, several additive packages (concentrated mixture of additives) containing our detergents were prepared. Using these packages the corresponding automotive lubricants can be formulated. Besides, a lubricant containing commercial calcium alkylbenzene-sulfonates detergents was prepared to compare its detergency properties with those of the calixarene-based oils...|$|R

But with increasing environmental awareness, the research in the area towards the synthesis of multifunctional biodegradable lubricating oil additive is increasing day by day. Hence, in our present work chemistry of biodegradable multifunctional lubricating oil additive based on vegetable oil (sunflower oil) has been investigated. In the present work solvent-free synthesis of homopolymer of sunflower oil was performed by two different ways; microwave irradiation method and thermal method using benzoyl peroxide as initiator. Characterization of the polymers was done by spectral (NMR, IR), GPC and viscometric analysis and finally performance evaluation was tested by standard ASTM methods. Performance evaluation as pour point depressant, viscosity modifier or <b>viscosity</b> index <b>improver</b> and antiwear in different base oils (BO 1, BO 2) was carried out by standard ASTM methods. Shear stability and oil thickening property of the polymers have also been investigated and reported here. Thermal stability of the polymers was determined by thermogravimetric analysis. A comparison of their performances has also been reported. The additive prepared by microwave-assisted method showed better viscosity index and pour point values as compared to thermally prepared additive. Thus, polymerized sunflower oil may be used as a potential biodegradable lube oil additive and hence the microwave-assisted protocol may be considered as a cost-effective greener approach for synthesis of lube oil additive.|$|R

5000|$|The {{temperature}} range {{the oil is}} exposed to in most vehicles can be wide, ranging from cold temperatures in the winter before the vehicle is started up, to hot operating temperatures when the vehicle is fully warmed up in hot summer weather. A specific oil will have high viscosity when cold and a lower viscosity at the engine's operating temperature. The difference in viscosities for most single-grade oil is too large between the extremes of temperature. To bring the difference in viscosities closer together, special polymer additives called <b>viscosity</b> index <b>improvers,</b> or VIIs {{are added to the}} oil. These additives are used to make the oil a multi-grade motor oil, though it is possible to have a multi-grade oil without the use of VIIs. The idea is to cause the multi-grade oil to have the viscosity of the base grade when cold and the viscosity of the second grade when hot. This enables one type of oil to be used all year. In fact, when multi-grades were initially developed, they were frequently described as all-season oil. The viscosity of a multi-grade oil still varies logarithmically with temperature, but the slope representing the change is lessened. [...] This slope representing the change with temperature depends on the nature and amount of the additives to the base oil.|$|R
30|$|<b>Viscosity</b> index (VI) <b>improvers</b> {{are long}} chain, {{high-molecular}} weight polymers that function by causing the relative viscosity {{of an oil}} to increase more at high temperatures than at low temperatures. Generally, this result {{is due to a}} change in the polymer’s physical configuration with increasing temperature of the mixture. It is postulated that in cold oil the molecules of the polymer adopt a coiled form so that their effect on viscosity is minimized. In hot oil, the molecules tend to straighten out, and the interaction between these long molecules and the oil produces a proportionally greater thickening effect [3]. Among the principal VI improvers are methacrylate polymers and copolymers, acrylat e polymers, olefin polymers and copolymers, and styrene butadiene copolymers. The degree of VI improvement from these materials {{is a function of the}} molecular weight distribution of the polymer [3].|$|R

The role of additives in lubricant is very significant. They optimize the performance of lubricant and generally fall into two major categories viz. surface active additive and performance enhancing additive [2]. The first one protects the metal surfaces of the engine from corrosion, such as antiwear, anti-rust and extreme pressure additives [3]. The second type reinforces the base stock performance, such as <b>viscosity</b> index <b>improver</b> (VII) [4, 5], pour point depressant (PPD) [6, 7], antioxidant [8], and detergent–dispersant [9]. Generally, in the formulation of a high performance lubricant, different types of additives at different percentages are blended with the base stocks. This increases the overall cost of the furnished lubricant. The addition of additives having multifunctional character to the base fluid may lead to formulate a cost effective as well as better performing lubricant. Therefore, research in this area has attracted much attention. In this work we have synthesized multifunctional additives which showed excellent VII and PPD performances. Lot of works in this direction has carried out so far. Kamal and his group [10] in their work have shown the application of copolymers of vinyl acetate (VA) and esters of acrylic acid as <b>viscosity</b> index <b>improver</b> for lubricating oil. They also studied the rheological properties of lube oil with and without polymeric additives. Al-Sabagh and his group [11] have mentioned the application of copolymers of VA with n-alkyl itaconate as pour point depressants in lubricating oil. The rheological properties were also studied by the same research team. Abdel-Azim et al. [12] has synthesized the copolymers of dialkyl fumarate with vinyl acetate and recognized that the copolymer of didodecyl fumarate with VA is the most effective as PPD for lubricating oil. In 2008, Nassar [13] had prepared six polymers at different molar ratios of 2 -ethylhexyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate and studied the VI property of the lubricants. He reported that most efficient VI property is obtained when the ratio of acrylate and vinyl acetate is 1 : 0.2. The potential application of copolymer of vinyl acetate (VA) as pour point depressant for crude oil is also well documented. VA—α olefin copolymers [14] and VA—methacrylate copolymers [15] were used as pour point depressant for crude oil. The copolymers of vinyl acetate, styrene and n-butyl acrylate having different monomer ratios were used to study the rheological behaviours of Mexican crude oil [16]. Borthakur and his group [17] have shown the application of alkyl fumarate and vinyl acetate copolymer in combination with alkyl acrylate as a flow improver for high waxy Borholla crude oil. Machado et al. [18] studied the influence of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers on viscosity and pour point of a Brazilian crude oil. Al-Shafy and Ismail prepared an ester of polyethylene acrylic acid with 1 -docosanol and finally it was grafted with vinyl acetate to produce graft ester. The grafted product was used as flow improver for Egyptian waxy crude oils [19].|$|R
