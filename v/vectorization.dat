25|$|AltiVec {{itself has}} been {{encapsulated}} since Mac OS 10.3 by a <b>vectorization</b> library; this library uses AltiVec on the PowerPC and SSE (or equivalent regular instructions) on x86.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of these}} {{optimizations}} performed {{at this level}} include dead code elimination, partial redundancy elimination, global value numbering, sparse conditional constant propagation, and scalar replacement of aggregates. Array dependence based optimizations such as automatic <b>vectorization</b> and automatic parallelization are also performed. Profile-guided optimization is also possible.|$|E
25|$|ArcGIS for Desktop Standard, {{formerly}} known as ArcEditor, is the midlevel software suite designed for advanced editing of spatial data published in the proprietary Esri format. It provides tools {{for the creation of}} map and spatial data used in GIS, including the ability of editing geodatabase files and data, multiuser geodatabase editing, versioning, raster data editing and <b>vectorization,</b> advanced vector data editing, managing coverages, coordinate geometry (COGO), and editing geometric networks. ArcEditor is not intended for advanced spatial analysis.|$|E
2500|$|A SSE2 <b>vectorization</b> of the {{algorithm}} (Farrar, 2007) {{is now available}} providing an 8-16-fold speedup on Intel/AMD processors with SSE2 extensions. When running on Intel processor using the Core microarchitecture the SSE2 implementation achieves a 20-fold increase. [...] Farrar's SSE2 implementation is available as the SSEARCH program in the FASTA sequence comparison package.

2500|$|An {{implementation}} of the Smith–Waterman Algorithm, SSEARCH, {{is available in the}} FASTA sequence analysis package from [...] This implementation includes Altivec accelerated code for PowerPC G4 and G5 processors that speeds up comparisons 10–20-fold, using a modification of the Wozniak, 1997 approach, and an SSE2 <b>vectorization</b> developed by Farrar making optimal protein sequence database searches quite practical. A library, SSW, extends Farrar's implementation to return alignment information in addition to the optimal Smith–Waterman score.|$|E
50|$|The Intel Advisor 2017 is a <b>vectorization</b> {{optimization}} {{and thread}} prototyping tool. It integrates several steps into its workflow {{to search for}} parallel sites, enable users to mark loops for <b>vectorization</b> and threading, check loop-carried dependencies and memory access patterns for marked loops, and insert pragmas for <b>vectorization</b> and threading.|$|E
50|$|Superword level {{parallelism}} (SLP) is a <b>vectorization</b> technique {{based on}} loop unrolling and basic block <b>vectorization.</b> It {{is distinct from}} loop <b>vectorization</b> algorithms in that it can exploit parallelism of inline code, such as manipulating coordinates, color channels or in loops unrolled by hand. It {{is available in the}} gcc compiler since version 4.3.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} image styles and possibilities, and no single <b>vectorization</b> method works well on all images. Consequently, <b>vectorization</b> programs have many options that influence the result.|$|E
50|$|Vector {{extraction}} or <b>vectorization</b> offer another approach. <b>Vectorization</b> first {{creates a}} resolution independent vector {{representation of the}} graphic to be scaled. Then the resolution-independent version is rendered as a raster image at the desired resolution. This technique is used by Adobe Illustrator Live Trace and Inkscape. Scalable Vector Graphics are well suited to simple geometric images, while photographs do not fare well with <b>vectorization</b> due to their complexity.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} step, the {{compiler}} looks for obstacles that can prevent <b>vectorization.</b> A major obstacle for <b>vectorization</b> is true data dependency {{shorter than the}} vector length. Other obstacles include function calls and short iteration counts.|$|E
50|$|An entirely {{different}} approach is vector extraction or <b>vectorization.</b> <b>Vectorization</b> first creates a resolution independent vector {{representation of the}} graphic to be scaled. Then the resolution-independent version is rendered as a raster image at the desired resolution. This technique is used by Adobe Illustrator Live Trace, Inkscape, and several recent papers.Scalable Vector Graphics are well suited to simple geometric images, while photographs do not fare well with <b>vectorization</b> due to their complexity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vectorization</b> {{starts with}} an image.|$|E
50|$|The task in <b>vectorization</b> is {{to convert}} a {{two-dimensional}} image into a two-dimensional vector {{representation of the}} image. It is not examining the image and attempting to recognize or extract a three-dimensional model which may be depicted; i.e. {{it is not a}} vision system. For most applications, <b>vectorization</b> also does not involve optical character recognition; characters are treated as lines, curves, or filled objects without attaching any significance to them. In <b>vectorization</b> the shape of the character is preserved, so artistic embellishments remain.|$|E
