30|$|A {{simple and}} highly {{reliable}} spectroscopic method {{has been developed}} for the estimation of hydrogen content in all petroleum products irrespective of their origin, composition, boiling range, etc. The method is applicable {{to a wide range}} of petroleum products such as naphtha, kerosene, diesel, <b>gas</b> <b>oils,</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oils,</b> and the residua as well as for reformulated gasoline and oxy-diesel. HMDSO, as an internal reference standard, has been introduced for quantitative calculation of hydrogen content and oxygenates in petroleum brands. The internal standard alone serves as a frequency and quantitative reference for proton NMR. The 1 H NMR-based method is also applicable to low boiling fractions and compounds containing very low hydrogen content. In most of the model compounds, the NMR method delivers hydrogen close to its theoretical values. In addition to hydrogen content, the developed method can directly be used to estimate the ethanol content/oxygen content in blended gasoline or oxy-diesel.|$|R

The newly developed high-performance hydroprocessing catalysts are based on synthetic smectite clays and modified zeolites. Active metals have been incorporated into these novel supports to prepare several catalyst formulations for both stages of the conventional fixed-bed hydrocrackers. These novel catalysts have been characterized by sophisticated techniques and evaluated in different types of reactors (such as Pulse Microreactor, Batch Autoclave reactor, Fixed-bed Flow reactor etc.) using different feedstocks (e. g. model compounds and real VGO). Some of the formulations of developed catalysts have exhibited high performance in terms of hydrodesulfurization and cracking activities when compared to commercial catalysts under the same operating conditions.

40|$|Absorption {{heat pumps}} (AHPs) have been {{popular due to}} their ability to convert thermal waste into useful energy. This study investigates the {{applicability}} of the absorption heat pump to the Porvoo oil refinery and compares the results to the ordinary heat pump (HP). The vacuum distillation unit 2 (TT 2) and gas turbine (KTVL- 3) units were considered for the case studies. Vacuum condenser is an inseparable part of the vacuum column DA- 2201. The pressure {{at the top of the}} column DA- 2201 is determined by the temperature of the cooling water (CW) of the vacuum condenser. The temperature of the CW of 2013 was collected and analyzed. Rigorous simulation of the vacuum column overhead system was simulated in aspen plus to estimate the pressure at the top of the column DA- 2201 at various cooling water temperatures. The absorption heat pump based on lithium bromide water solution and ordinary heat pumps based on propane were simulated to generate the cooling water of 10 °C for the TT 2 unit. In addition, preheating the inlet air when required was examined for the gas turbine to avoid freezing in the filters by applying the ordinary heat pump based on propane. When the temperature of the CW was 10 °C, the pressure at the top of the column DA- 2201 was found to be 5. 3 kPa. The decrease in pressure enhanced the separation process with the higher yield of <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oils.</b> The profit achieved due to the higher yield was also estimated. In case of preheating the atmospheric air for gas turbine, ordinary HP was compared to the existing steam-based heating system. The heat pump based on propane was found to be applicable in comparison to the absorption heat pump for both units i. e. TT 2 and KTVL- 3 units.

40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{conducted}} in a microactivity test (MAT) and a fluidized bed reactor to develop an experimental protocol {{to determine how the}} yield and composition of coke and the associated catalyst surface area vary as a function of stripper conditions in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). In both reactors, the use of rapid quenching has allowed the relatively short stripping times encountered in FCC units to be simulated. Low sulphur <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oils</b> (VGO) with a low metal equilibrium catalyst (E-cat) were used for stripping periods of up to 20 minutes. Significant variations occur in the structure of both hard and soft coke during stripping. Although the hard coke becomes more highly condensed with prolonged stripping, the surface area reduction by the hard coke remains fairly constant for stripping periods in excess of ca. 5 - 10 minutes and is small (10 m 2 g- 1) in relation to the loss of surface area from the soft coke. The use of about 70 g of catalyst in the fluidized bed provides sufficient sample for demineralization to recover sufficient of the hard coke for 13 C NMR analysis after the initial extraction of the soft coke. Indeed, it has been found that a further pool of soft (chloroform soluble) coke is physically entrapped within the catalyst pore structure and is only released after demineralization. In fact, this second soft coke fraction is much more highly aromatic than the first and ultimately controls the final coke yield. For the combination of E-cat and VGOs investigated here, typically about half of the final hard coke content of nearly 1 % w/w catalyst is derived from this second soft coke fraction by carbonization. The structural information obtained has been used to formulate a model for the stripping process where the soft coke II fraction undergoes cracking in competition with coke formation and evaporative removal from the catalyst...|$|R

It has been noted that in high vapor rate vacuum services, vapor horns have low levels of entrainment relative to similar technologies.

40|$|Due to the {{decreasing}} {{crude oil}} quality (heavier crudes and increasing contaminant concentrations) methods for upgrading residues from the refining process, such as coking, {{are becoming increasingly}} important. Delayed coking, a method by which residues are thermally cracked (large heavy molecules broken into smaller lighter molecules), produces liquid products and solid coke which can both be sold for further profit. In order {{to increase the amount}} of liquid products produced since they are the most value added product of the coking process catalysts (platinum on 0. 5 % alumina and nickel (skeletal),molybdenum promoted (1 wt%)) were tested to see how they would affect the process and products.

Gas chromatography based on ASTM D 2887 was used to analyze gaseous products every 15 minutes during each test and the liquid products at the end. Testing is still ongoing and preliminary results have yet to be obtained. Due to the increased value of liquid products, catalysts and conditions which produce more of those are favored. Further research into these and other catalysts is recommended since residues from different crudes could interact differently with the catalysts...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{two-stage}} hydrotreating of bitumen-derived light <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (LGO) from Athabasca {{oil sands}} was studied. The {{objective was to}} catalytically upgrade the LGO by reducing the aromatics content and enhancing the cetane content via inter-stage removal of hydrogen sulfide. The impact of hydrogen sulfide inhibition on aromatics hydrogenation (HDA), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodesulfirization (HDS) activities was investigated. Experiments {{for this study were}} carried out in a trickle-bed reactor loaded with commercial NiMo/Al 2 O 3 and lab-prepared NiW/Al 2 O 3 in the stage I and stage II reactors, respectively. Temperature was varied from 350 to 390 oC at the optimum LHSV and pressure conditions of 0. 6 h- 1 and 11. 0 MPa, respectively. The results from two-stage process showed significant improvement in HDA, cetane rating and HDS activities compared to the single-stage process after the inter-stage removal of hydrogen sulfide. Hence, the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the reaction retarded both the HDA and HDS processes in the single-stage operation. Negligible hydrogen sulfide inhibition was however, observed in the HDN process. Prior to the two-stage hydrotreating study, single-stage hydrotreating reactions were carried out over commercial NiMo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst to determine the optimum operating conditions for maximizing hydrogenation of aromatics. A statistical approach via the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique was used to develop regression models for predicting the conversion of aromatics, sulfur and nitrogen in the LGO feed. Experiments were performed at the following operating conditions: temperature (340 - 390 oC); pressure (6. 9 - 12. 4 MPa) and liquid hourly space velocity, LHSV (0. 5 - 2. 0 h- 1). Hydrogen-to-oil ratio was maintained constant at 550 ml/ml. The results showed that the two-level interaction between temperature and pressure was the only significant interaction parameter affecting HDA while interaction between temperature and LHSV was the most important parameter affecting both HDS and HDN activities. A maximum 63 % HDA was obtained at 379 oC, 11. 0 MPa and 0. 6 h- 1. Experiments with NiW/Al 2 O 3 were also performed in a single-stage reactor with LGO blend feedstock by varying temperature from 340 - 390 oC at the optimum pressure and space velocity of 11. 0 MPa and 0. 6 h- 1, respectively. The following order of ease of hydrogenation was observed: poly- > di- >> monoaromatics. The order of ease of hydrogenation in other LGO feedstocks (atmospheric light <b>gas</b> <b>oil,</b> ALGO; hydrocrack light <b>gas</b> <b>oil,</b> HLGO; and <b>vacuum</b> light <b>gas</b> <b>oil,</b> VLGO) was studied and found to follow the order: VLGO > ALHO > HLGO. Studies on mild hydrocracking (MHC) in the <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> feedstocks showed a net increase in gasoline with a corresponding decrease in diesel with increasing temperature. Both the single and two-stage HDA and HDS kinetics were modeled using Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate equations. These models predicted the experimental data with reasonable accuracy. The degree of conversion of the <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> fractions in ALGO, HLGO and VLGO via mild hydrocracking was best described by a pseudo-first order kinetic model based on a parallel conversion scheme...|$|R
40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{introduction}} of heavy oil in a refinery as a first step. The first step will yield {{an increase in the}} production of the bottom products (<b>vacuum</b> residue, <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> and diesel). It will also reduce the production of the light products (gases, LPG and naphtha) from ADU/VDU for oil with API above 20. However, we showed that if the heavy oil is below 20 API, the vacuum residue will be the only increasing product. This also reflects on the unit capital cost. The power and steam required by the refinery should also increase as crude oil becomes heavier due to the high amount of steam used in the delayed coker unit. Nevertheless, the fuel for the fire heaters does not show the expected change as compared to the model. The report goes to a further step by replacing bottom product processes with gasification and syngas routes. This step results to reduce the total production of fuel. Therefore, the fuel gasification paths MTG, DME (direct and indirect), and FT are more valuable than other gasification paths. All fuel paths showed a similar amount of fuel production, yielding extra production around 100, 000 lb/hr compared to the base case. Moreover, the direct path of DME provided the lowest estimated cost compared to other fuel gasification paths. The MTG path and indirect DME path have a similar cost. The final step is to investigate two challenges related to the gasification cases: water balance and fuel demand. The investigation shows that more than 95 % of used water can be recovered by recycling water (both direct and indirect recycling). Furthermore, the study shows that MTG and DME-indirect paths demand less fuel when compared to the base case...|$|R

For the SR <b>gas</b> <b>oils,</b> the simultaneous presence of thiophenic and nonthiophenic compounds {{does not allow for}} a selective analysis of thiophenic compounds by GC-SCD. A new method using gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) is proposed to selectively detect and quantify the alkyl-BT and alkyl-DBT in SR <b>gas</b> <b>oils.</b> The development of the method and comparison of results between GC-SCD and GC-HRMS are presented.

30|$|The {{composition}} and physical properties of FCLS muds and lime muds {{are presented in}} Tables  1, and 3 and 2, and 4, respectively. All the additives of <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> and barite changed the physical properties of muds. The inclusion of 5  % by volume of <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> to FCLS mud with 70  lb/bbl barite reduced mud filtrate from 9.6 to 7.2  cc (25  %) and further to 6.3  cc (35  %) when 10  % <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> was added, whereas the additive of 5  % by volume <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> with 140  lb/bbl barite reduced mud filtrate from 10.5 to 7.5  cc (29  %). On another side, the additive of 5  % by volume of <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> to lime mud with 70  lb/bbl barite caused reduction in mud filtrate from 24 to 20  cc (17  %) and the additive of 10  % decreases the volume to 16.5  cc (31  %), whereas addition of 5  % by volume <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> with 140 -lb/bbl barite caused reduction in mud filtrate from 35 to 32  cc (9  %). This reduction in mud filtrate {{as a result of}} <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> addition may be attributed to the plugging of the filter cake pores by oil droplets. These droplets are deformable, so in addition to the effect of raising the cake resistance, reducing the permeability and the filter cake becomes more compressible, and it increases the viscosity.|$|R
