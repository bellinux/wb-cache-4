40|$|Simple {{converter}} structure, inherent {{short-circuit protection}} and regenerative capability {{are the most}} important advantages of current-source inverters (CSI’s) which have made them suitable for medium-voltage high-power drives. Usually in grid-connected gas turbine generators or pumped storage hydro power plants, efficient and reliable current-source load-commutated inverters (LCI’s) with thyristor switches are employed. Also, this type of CSI is widely used in very large drives with power ratings of tens of megawatts to supply wound-field synchronous motors (WFSM’s). However, LCI’s suffer from some disadvantages such as large torque pulsations, poor power factor, and start-up criticalities. In this paper, a novel multilevel-based CSI is proposed.

These simulations included not only {{the description of the}} <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>circuit</b> and a single unidimensional cable to represent the preparation in the "node" region of a double sucrose gap used previously but also a series resistance and a shunt pathway. The output of the voltage control amplifier is applied across the membrane plus the series resistance, producing a voltage drop across the series resistance due to the current generated by the membrane in response to a depolarizing voltage step. Since the membrane current has an inward and an outward phase, voltage drops of opposite sign are produced across the series resistance. During the transient current and at all points along an axon, the potential deviation produced by the series resistance is opposite to the deviation produced by the longitudinal gradient. Only at a command potential equal to the sodium equilibrium potential, the membrane potential transiently matches the command potential. For the attempted voltage clamp of an axon, values of series resistance larger than 50 omega-cm 2 allowed propagated action potentials in the membrane. In spite of the presence of propagated action potentials at the calbe membrane, the recorded current does not show "notches" and it has a phase of inward current and a phase of outward current.

This synapse was isolated and a <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>circuit</b> was used to control the membrane potential at the release sites. The dependence of transmitter release on extracellular calcium, [Ca]o, was studied over a range of 2. 5 - 40 mM. A power relationship of 2. 7 was obtained between excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) rate of rise and [Ca]o. Brief presynaptic depolarizing steps, 5 - 10 ms, presented at 0. 5 Hz activated EPSP's of constant amplitude. Inserting a 300 -ms pulse (conditioning pulse) between these test pulses potentiated the subsequent test EPSPs. This depolarization-activated potentiation (DAP) lasted for 10 - 20 s and decayed with a single exponential time course. The decay time course remained invariant with test pulse frequencies ranging from 0. 11 to 1. 1 Hz. The magnitude and decay time course of DAP were independent of the test pulse amplitudes. The magnitude of DAP was a function of conditioning pulse amplitudes. Large conditioning pulses activated large potentiations, whereas the decay time constants were not changed. The DAP is a Ca-dependent process. When the amplitude of conditioning pulses approached the Ca equilibrium potential, the magnitude of potentiation decreased. Repeated application of conditioning pulses, at 2 -s intervals, did not produce additional potentiation beyond the level activated by the first conditioning pulse. Comparison of the conditioning EPSP waveforms activated repetitively indicated that potentiation lasted transiently, 100 ms, during a prolonged release.

Online UPS system {{is considered to be}} the most preferable UPS due to its highest level of power quality and proven reliability against all types of line disturbances and power outages. This research presents a new topology of the non-isolated online uninterruptible power supply system. The proposed system consists of bridgeless boost rectifier, battery charger/discharger, and an inverter. The rectifier performs power factor correction and provides regulated DC-link voltage. The rectifier operates with a minimum semiconductor device, reducing the conduction losses of the circuit significantly. A new battery charger/discharger has been implemented, which ensures the bidirectional power flow between the DC-link and the battery bank, reducing the battery bank voltage to only 24 V, and regulates the DC-link voltage during battery mode. The bidirectional operation of the converter is achieved by employing only three active switches, a coupled inductor, and an additional <b>voltage</b> <b>clamped</b> <b>circuit.</b> Batteries are connected in parallel depending on the backup time requirement of the system. Operating batteries in parallel improve the battery performance and resolve the problems related to conventional battery banks that arrange batteries in series. The inverter provides a regulated output voltage to the load. A new cascaded slide mode and proportional-resonant control have been proposed. Slide mode control is recognized as the most robust control with high stability while the proportional-resonant control shapes the output waveform closely according to the reference sinusoidal signal. Keeping in view the characteristics of slide mode and proportional-resonant control, a cascaded controller is proposed for the bipolar single-phase UPS inverter. The outer voltage loop uses the proportional-resonant control while the inner loop uses the slide mode control. The proposed control scheme regulates the output voltage for both linear and non-linear load and shows excellent performance during transients and step changes in load.

40|$|Multilevel {{voltage source}} {{inverter}} (MVSI) is very attractive in high voltage and high power applications such as adjustable speed drives and electric utility applications. The development of MVSI {{began in the early}} 1980 ’s when Nabae et al. [1] proposed a neutralpoint clamped (NPC) PWM inverter. Since then several multilevel topologies have evolved. The general structure of the MVSI is to synthesize a sinusoidal voltage out of several levels of dc voltages [2]. The so-called multilevel inverter starts from three levels. The MVSI can therefore be described as a voltage synthesizer.. There are several advantages offered by the MVSI. In Voltage Source Inverter (VSI), the maximum voltage level output is determined by the voltage blocking capability of each device. By using a multilevel structure, the stress on each device can be reduced in proportional to the number of levels, thus the inverter can handle higher voltages [3]. As a result, an expensive and bulky step-up transformer can be avoided in various applications. In another perspective, the harmonic in the output waveform can be reduced without increasing switching frequency or decreasing the inverter power output [4]. As the number of voltage levels reach infinity, harmonic content will be low enough to avoid the need of filters [5]. The number of the achievable voltage levels, however is limited by voltage unbalance problems, <b>voltage</b> <b>clamping</b> requirement, <b>circuit</b> layout, and packaging constraints. In motor application, high dV/dt in power supply generates high stress on motor windings and requires additional motor insulation. Furthermore, high dV/dt of semiconductor devices increases the electromagnetic interference (EMI), common-mode voltage and possibility of failure on motor. With several levels in output waveform constructed by multilevel inverter, the switching dV/dt stresses are reduced [4]...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2016. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Ned Mohan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 96 pages. High frequency AC link based converters offer several desirable {{features such as}} improved power density, galvanic isolation and improved reliability due {{to the absence of}} an electrolytic capacitor. The power conversion happens through a high frequency link which operates in the tens of kilohertz range and consequently, the size of magnetic components is reduced. An AC or DC voltage source is ’chopped’ by a converter to generate the high frequency voltage which is applied to a transformer {{that can be used to}} provide the necessary voltage transformation. On the secondary winding of the transformer, the high frequency voltage is directly converted to synthesize the desired output voltages which are at a much lower frequency than the AC link. Unlike DC bus based topologies, there is no need for a power stage to first rectify the AC link before generating the output voltage. 	Despite several advantages, transformer isolated single stage power conversion re- quires the use of a <b>voltage</b> <b>clamping</b> <b>circuit</b> across the AC link for its operation due to the presence of transformer leakage inductance. When high frequency AC link volt- age is directly used to synthesize the output voltages, the link currents exhibit sudden polarity reversals. Due to the presence of leakage inductance, which is unavoidable in transformers, large voltage spikes result during the current reversal instants and neces- sitate the use of additional circuitry to limit such overvoltages. This limitation, which is termed the problem of leakage energy commutation, needs to be overcome to pre- vent the link voltage from exceeding the breakdown voltages of the switches, damaging winding insulation or causing unwanted distortion in the output voltage. 	This dissertation proposes two implementations of transformer isolated high frequency link inverters that overcome the problem of leakage energy commutation. The inverters consist of a H-Bridge to generate the high frequency voltage from a DC voltage source and a cycloconverter to generate the output voltages. In the first implementation, a parallel LC tank is proposed to be connected across the secondary winding of the transformer to ensure the current through the leakage inductance does not have sudden reversals. The high frequency transformer along with the LC tank results in a sinusoidal voltage which is applied across the cycloconverter. A discrete space vector modulation technique is used to synthesize three phase output voltages and any change of switch states in the cycloconverter is restricted to the zero crossing regions to avoid switching losses. The second approach proposes using an additional leg across the cycloconverter to induce a resonant current transition when the current flowing through the transformer has to reverse its polarity. The additional leg, comprising of a bidirectional switch and a small capacitor, is only used for a short interval during which it resonates with the leakage inductance. The operation and analysis of the proposed ideas are discussed in this thesis and have been validated through computer simulations. A hardware prototype was constructed to demonstrate the operation of a high frequency link inverter using the LC tank and the results are found to be in agreement...|$|R

A basic <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> will iteratively measure the membrane potential, and then change the membrane potential (voltage) to a desired value by adding the necessary current. This [...] "clamps" [...] the cell membrane at a desired constant voltage, allowing the <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> to record what currents are delivered. Because the currents applied to the cell must be equal to (and opposite in charge to) the current going across the cell membrane at the set voltage, the recorded currents indicate how the cell reacts to changes in membrane potential. Cell membranes of excitable cells contain {{many different kinds of}} ion channels, some of which are voltage-gated. The <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> allows the membrane voltage to be manipulated independently of the ionic currents, allowing the current-voltage relationships of membrane channels to be studied.|$|R

The devices in this power-rail ESD <b>clamp</b> <b>circuit</b> are all 1 -V or 2. 5 -V low-voltage nMOS/pMOS devices, which are specially designed without suffering the gate-oxide reliability issue under 3. 3 -V I/O interface applications. A special ESD detection circuit realized with the low-voltage devices is designed and {{added in the}} power-rail ESD <b>clamp</b> <b>circuit</b> to improve ESD robustness of ESD clamp devices by substrate-triggered technique. The experimental results verified in a 130 -nm CMOS process have proven the excel-lent effectiveness of this new proposed power-rail ESD clamp cir-cuit.
