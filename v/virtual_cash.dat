40|$|The {{widespread}} {{popularity of}} the Internet has made the promise of worldwide electronic commerce (EC) a reality. Companies are exploring how to provide goods and services over the Internet in order to extend their reach to a global marketplace that conducts business 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The low cost of transacting business electronically has been the motivating factor as consumers eagerly look toward the Internet to create economic opportunities. Electronic payment, a financial exchange that takes place online between buyers and sellers, {{is an integral part}} of EC. The content of this exchange usually involves some form of digital financial instrument (such as encrypted credit card numbers, electronic checks, or digital cash) that is backed by a bank or an intermediary, or by legal tender. With the rapid growth in EC, organizations are often faced with the problem of selecting an appropriate electronic payment system (EPS) to meet their requirements. While demand is rapidly growing, security concern is a major reason that impedes EC growth. Organizations selecting individual EPS with different security methods find it extremely difficult to do business with each other. Selection of an EPS is a complex task. Firms often lack the necessary in-house expertise to make this choice. Hiring external consultants with expertise in the area can be expensive. A poor decision may have a significant negative impact. Implementing an EPS requires considerable technical expertise. Difficulties involved in selection and implementation include identifying the firm’s requirements, understanding available EPS options, and evaluating the best option based on economic, technical, and operational concerns. To deal with the complex decision of EPS selection in a changing environment, an expert system may be used. An expert system prototype for the selection of EPS was proposed, based on analysis and evaluation of major electronic payment systems (EPSs). The goal of this dissertation was to develop a rule-based expert system that would aid the requirement analysis process by asking appropriate questions; maintain a knowledge base on the security characteristics of various EPSs; and contain the expertise required to select and implement an appropriate system that meets an organization 2 ̆ 7 s security requirements. An extensive literature review was conducted to evaluate major EPSs to ascertain each system 2 ̆ 7 s applicability, strengths and weaknesses. Features of each were analyzed, with an emphasis on security aspects. Results were used to help design and build a prototype rule-based system to help organizations determine an appropriate strategy for security in EPS. The following EPSs were considered: Electronic card-based systems: First <b>Virtual</b> (FV), Cyber <b>Cash,</b> and Secure Electronic Transactions (SET). Electronic checks: Net Bill and NetCheque. Electronic cash payment systems: Ecash and CyberCoin. Micropayment systems: Millicent and Pay word. The decision table approach was utilized to ensure that the rule base was well designed. The proposed system is capable of providing security advice related to those EPSs that have been included in the system. The proposed system handles questions based on security characteristics, but is not able to handle new systems whose characteristics have not been entered into the system. The expert system was designed in such a way that future changes to EPS characteristics require minimum change to the knowledge base. A prototype expert system for the selection of electronic payment systems was built and tested to validate the system. The recommendations of the expert system were compared to the recommendations of experts. Test results indicated that the rule-based paradigm with decision tables is useful in the design of a successful expert system for the selection of EPSs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the {{open source software}} project Bitcoin. Bitcoin {{is often described as}} <b>virtual</b> <b>cash</b> and this paper asks what the term ‘virtual’ signifies when applied to ‘cash’ and in turn what ‘virtual cash’ says about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is related to the 1990 s activist movement of libertarian cryptographers known as ‘cypherpunks’ and to the cyber-libertarian political philosophy, demonstrating the historical intertwining of cryptography and politics. Cypherpunks argued that privacy is a prerequisite for an open society and that cryptography and anonymous transaction systems were needed as assurance. Bitcoin is the latest effort by cryptographers to create digital tokens similar to cash, where Bitcoin’s designer Nakamoto argues that with Bitcoin users no longer have to trust a third party, traditionally the bank. Bitcoin does not fulfill this promise as trust remains to be established, albeit in a different manner. Power is not destroyed, but transferred from banks to Bitcoin’s protocol. The paper concludes that ‘virtual’ refers to Bitcoin’s model of how cash appears to function in everyday exchange, allowing user privacy. Bitcoin does not model another aspect of cash, namely that it is a credential referring to debt. Bitcoin discontinues the concept of debt...|$|E
30|$|Monetary {{incentives}} {{are the real}} money or any other financial commodity such as <b>virtual</b> <b>cash,</b> redeemable credit, etc. that the users consider valuable [28]. Depending on who sets the price for a sensing task, monetary incentives can be either platform-centric or user-centric [28]. In the platform-centric model, {{sometimes referred to as}} crowdsourcer-centric incentive mechanism [29], the initiator of the sensing task sets the price and aims to maximize the platform’s profit [30]. In the user-centric model, the reverse is the case as the price is defined by the participants [30]. Furthermore, the platform-centric and user-centric models can either operate as static or dynamic incentive mechanisms. In static incentive, the price for a task is estimated in advance and stays the same whereas in dynamic incentive, the price changes based on the minimum amount of money a participant is willing to accept to do the task [31]. In addition to participants’ preference, incentives for mobile crowdsensing can also be designed to dynamically change depending on factors such as the time of day, number of available participants, location and type of data captured as demonstrated in a participation-aware incentive mechanism known as SenseUtil [32, 33]. Similarly, Biswas et al. [34] proposed PISCES, a closed-loop incentive framework that considers the sensing demand and changing availability and reporting behaviour of participants in order to compute rewards that dynamically converge to a minimum value after several trials.|$|E
40|$|Brain injury {{rehabilitation}} is a {{long and}} difficult process that includes training of so-called instrumental {{activities of daily living}} (IADL). This type of training involves activities like preparing meals, doing housework, grocery shopping etc. and it is often used by occupational therapists when they teach brain injury patients how to manage their daily life. A computer-generated Virtual Environment (VE) that is {{to be used as a}} tool in IADL training has been designed. The VE has the shape of a cash dispenser and it can be used by a brain injury patient that wants to practice the activity of withdrawing money. The aim was to design a VE interface that puts as little cognitive load as possible on the brain injury patient, so that he or she can focus completely on the task of withdrawing money. A low-fidelity paper prototype was built and evaluated in order to generate ideas regarding object behaviour, navigation of the viewpoint, interaction with objects and other features. The result of the project so far is a computer prototype built with a Virtual Reality (VR) development kit called WorldUp, a personal computer based VR system. The computer prototype behaves exactly like a real cash dispenser and it has a function that allows the patient to learn his or her banking code.

30|$|Secondly, aid {{agencies}} also use humanitarian technologies that were initially employed {{for reasons of}} efficiency or effectiveness but had the “fortunate” side effect of protecting staff by limiting their need {{to be present in}} the field. Examples of such technologies can be found in technological applications used for needs assessments, goods or services delivery, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). For instance, tablets and smart phones are used to conduct needs assessments among beneficiaries to make data collection and processing faster and more precise. Although drones in these conflict zones have overly strong military connotations, in the future, some managers hope to use drones for assessing needs and vulnerabilities as drones have a much higher resolution than satellite imagery. Mapping platforms with geo-referenced information can occasionally also be put to use in the assessment of needs. In terms of delivery, cargo drones have been mentioned as a future option, but no respondent mentioned having experience with it. More popularly, <b>virtual</b> <b>cash</b> transfer (e.g., M-Pesa) is being tested and used as a safer and faster option for providing aid than physical commodity distribution. With regard to the distribution of goods, Last Mile Mobile Solutions (LMMS) is an advanced tool to make the “last mile” of distribution more efficient, cheaper, and more dignified. It helps {{aid agencies}} to register beneficiaries, calculate their needs, and fairly distribute the supplies through digitalizing all the information. Beneficiaries receive an ID card, which, upon scanning, can show what they received and what they are entitled to. All this information is also easily accessible in one dataset which simplifies subsequent M&E. Further M&E is often carried out by simply calling beneficiaries or providing phone numbers to recipients. Additionally, staff are asked to make pictures with GPS cameras or to make videos of projects and programs. Somewhat more advanced, satellite imagery is used for M&E purposes. For instance, satellite pictures were used to find out whether shelters were built in a remote and dangerous area in Afghanistan. Given this brief overview of how humanitarian technologies affect aid agency security in volatile settings, we now move on to the propositions and reflect on them by using the interview findings.|$|E
40|$|People with {{acquired}} {{brain injury}} (ABI) often have problems leading an independent life due to impaired cognitive abilities. One {{way to address}} this is to let the patients practise {{activities of daily living}} as part of their rehabilitation process. However, some everyday activities can be difficult, inconvenient or risky to practise. The demands of the environment can also {{have an impact on the}} independence of an individual with ABI. Today, the involvement of people with ABI in the design of public space in minimal. Scarcely any regard is taken to this population when planning a new public transport system, for example. Accordingly, there is a need for development of methodology that can facilitate life for people with ABI. Virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential for various applications such as training, learning, visualisation and design. The objectives of the research presented in this doctoral thesis were to: 1) investigate how VR training can be used as a rehabilitation tool by people with ABI, and 2) explore if and how VR can be used to elicit knowledge about public transport accessibility for people with ABI. The first research objective was investigated in four studies in which 60 able-bodied people with little or no experience of 3 D computer graphics and 12 people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) participated. Case study methodology was applied, using observations, interviews and think-aloud protocols to collect data. One of the studies also used quantitative data and statistics. So called desktop VR (i. e. a standard monitor and regular input devices) was used. Three virtual environments were used: a kitchen, a cash dispenser and a hospital environment. In general, the results of the four studies suggest that VR has great potential as a training tool for people with ABI. However, the results also highlighted the importance of an optimised interface between the user and the VR system; seemingly small usability problems can create significant difficulties for a person with ABI. In the first study, a comparison was carried out between a joystick and a special keyboard for navigation in virtual training environments. There were two versions of each input device: one with two degrees of freedom and one with three. The keyboard was found to be more suitable for navigation tasks in which the user wants to give the viewpoint a more advantageous position and orientation for carrying out a specific task. No statistically significant differences between two and three degrees of freedom could be found. Nevertheless, the third degree of freedom, which made it possible to also move sideways, seemed to facilitate the navigation in some situations. The aim of the second study was to evaluate a method for interaction with virtual objects and to compare mouse and touch screen as input device for this purpose. The data showed no difference in performance between the mouse and touch screen subjects. Several touch screen subjects tended to imitate the way things are done in real life, however. This suggests that the touch screen is a more suitable input device in this context since the virtual activity resembles the real world activity. The third study investigated if and how five subjects with ABI could transfer route knowledge from a virtual hospital environment to the real world. They managed to walk a route they had only practised in a virtual environment, which suggests that VR-based route training can be a feasible complement to conventional route training. The aim of the fourth study was to develop and evaluate a <b>virtual</b> <b>cash</b> dispenser that can be used as a training tool by people with ABI. Seven people with ABI practised withdrawing money from the <b>virtual</b> <b>cash</b> dispenser. In general, they learned how to use the <b>virtual</b> <b>cash</b> dispenser. However, some usability problems, mainly related to interaction with virtual objects were noted. Another result, which could also be observed in the second study, was that unclear or non-existing feedback from the VR application was the cause of several of these problems. The second research objective was addressed in two studies in which eleven people with ABI and four occupational therapists participated. Once again, case study methodology was used. Data was collected through observations, think-aloud protocols and interviews. Both studies used a virtual environment in which a complete bus trip could be performed. The first study evaluated a suggested VR methodology for enabling people with cognitive disabilities to communicate their knowledge and experiences of public transport systems. The users interacted with the VR system by verbally describing their actions to the person controlling the VR system and/or pointing with a laser pointer while seated in front of three screens on which the virtual environment was projected. Seven people with stroke were filmed as they made a virtual bus trip and were then asked to think aloud about their experience while watching the video material. Despite some initial difficulties, the subjects managed to communicate their intentions, some by combining verbalisations and pointing with the laser pointer in a very efficient manner. They were engaged in the virtual bus trip and made comments on the experience, including comments on emotional aspects. Interestingly, the subjects’ verbal descriptions of what they wanted to do revealed in part aspects of how they reasoned when taking the bus trip. The results suggested that the VR methodology can be a feasible tool for people with cognitive disabilities but also revealed several issues in need of improvement. The second study investigated if and how the VR methodology can be used to elicit knowledge from occupational therapists and people with ABI about public transport accessibility for the latter population. Four people with ABI made a virtual bus trip and afterwards were asked to think aloud about their experience while watching the video material from the bus trip. Four occupational therapists with experience of working with people with ABI performed the virtual bus trip while at the same time thinking aloud about public transport accessibility for people with ABI. Afterwards they watched the video material from the virtual bus trip of one of the subjects with ABI while once again thinking aloud about public transport accessibility. In general, both subject groups handled the VR methodology. The most relevant knowledge from the subjects with ABI was related to concrete accessibility problems, emotional aspects and strategies. The direct observations of the ABI subjects making the virtual bus trip led to the identification of some problems but revealed very little about what caused them. Instead, the cause of the problems came to light through the ABI subjects’ verbalisations, which demonstrates the importance of not only making observations but also paying attention to the participant’s subjective experience. The most relevant knowledge from the occupational therapists concerned the concrete accessibility problems and suggested solutions. Both think aloud sessions elicited unique knowledge from the occupational therapists and should therefore be part of the VR methodology in order to cover as many aspects as possible of public transport accessibility for people with ABI. Overall, the results suggested that the concept of first carrying out actions in a virtual environment and then reflecting over these actions seems to be a very good way of eliciting knowledge about public transport accessibility for people with ABI. The elicited knowledge from people with ABI and occupational therapists seems to illuminate, in part, different aspects of public transport accessibility and hence is complementary...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} plays of the Roman playwright Plautus (c. 254 – 184 BC) is his Pseudolus. In this play, the clever slave Pseudolus wants to help his young master Calidorus who is in love with one of the prostitutes of the greedy pimp Ballio. Unfortunately, the girl has already been sold to another. Pseudolus therefore is left with only two options: 1) get enough money to buy the girl before the other buyer shows up; or 2) trick the pimp Ballio into giving him the girl. The lover’s problem instigates a performance full of deception, trickery and <b>virtual</b> <b>cash</b> flows. Pseudolus’ main occupation throughout the play is getting his fellow characters to trust him with money and belief (credere). Interestingly, this clever slave warns both his fellow characters and the audience that he is not to be trusted (caveant, ne credant mihi). The tension between this warning and Pseudolus’ actions which are the complete opposite of this warning, has serious consequences for the way the audience reacts to this play. For to enjoy a theatrical performance, it is necessary for the spectators to suspend their disbelief and temporarily take the theatrical world as a separate reality. This process can be stimulated by specific external stimuli created by the actors on stage. This concept is better known as dramatic illusion. Pseudolus’ warning does not only challenge the dramatic illusion, but also thematises it by naming three important factors within the play Pseudolus that are all connected to illusion: the audience; the producer of illusion (Pseudolus); belief and challenges to this belief (credere and cavēre). In all Plautine comedies, metatheatrical devices that challenge the dramatic illusion that was being portrayed can be found. Even more, as Plautine plays consist of quick shifts between the intradiegetical action and extradiegetical communication with the spectators, this dramatic illusion seems to be constantly under attack. The question then arises as to how a play that consciously challenges the illusion it is producing succeeds in keeping its audience involved in the play. Of all Plautine plays, Pseudolus is the most apt to answer this question, as the production and experience of illusion are thematised in the play. Pseudolus, as a producer of illusion, is asking for credit, while his audiences on and off stage are doubting whether to give him this credit or give heed to the warnings they receive. Moreover, the presence of metatheatrical comments justifies abstracting conclusions about audience experience from behaviour of characters that take on the role of audience-on-stage. On top of that, there is a doppelganger motif in the figure of Simia taking on the role of Harpax. This duplication of a performance within the play opens the possibility of looking for other doubles within and outside of the text. By exploring {{the way in which the}} three aforementioned factors (audience, producer, credere and cavēre) are connected in Pseudolus and establishing their relation to the parameters of the concept of dramatic illusion, this thesis contributes to a better understanding of the intricate ways in which dramatic illusion is undermined, stimulated, or played with in Plautus’ Pseudolus...|$|E
