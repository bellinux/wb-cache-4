25|$|The {{neurochemistry}} {{of vertigo}} includes six primary neurotransmitters {{that have been}} identified between the three-neuron arc that drives the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central vestibular neurons, and may modulate synaptic transmission in all three neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{is thought to be}} inhibitory for the commissures of the medial <b>vestibular</b> <b>nucleus,</b> the connections between the cerebellar Purkinje cells, and the lateral <b>vestibular</b> <b>nucleus,</b> and the vertical VOR.|$|E
25|$|Nonsynaptic plasticity, can {{function}} {{to alleviate the}} effects of brain damage. When one of the vestibular nerves is damaged, disparity in the firing rates of neurons in the vestibular nuclei causes unnecessary vestibular reflexes. The symptoms of this damage fade over time. This is likely due to modifications of intrinsic excitability in the neurons of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nucleus.</b>|$|E
25|$|A gap {{junction}} located in neurons {{is often referred}} to as an electrical synapse. The electrical synapse was discovered using electrical measurements before the {{gap junction}} structure was described. Electrical synapses are present throughout the central nervous system and have been studied specifically in the neocortex, hippocampus, <b>vestibular</b> <b>nucleus,</b> thalamic reticular nucleus, locus coeruleus, inferior olivary nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, ventral tegmental area, olfactory bulb, retina and spinal cord of vertebrates.|$|E
40|$|Pre{{clinical}} {{and clinical}} {{evidence indicates that}} the serotonergic system regulates processing in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> and in pathways linking balance function with emotional responses and affect. Previous studies conducted in this laboratory demonstrated that the serotonergic innervation of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> is derived largely from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), and revealed that the DRN also sends a nonserotonergic projection to the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The purpose of these experiments was to characterize {{the organization of the}} serotonergic and nonserotonergic components of the DRN projection to the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei.</b> In Chapter 3, we describe retrograde tracing experiments that examined whether DRN cells send collateralized projections to the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> and central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA), regions involved in the clinical linkage between disorders of balance control and anxiety, and concluded that a subset of the serotonergic and nonserotonergic projections to the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> also project to CeA. Chapter 4 describes experiments with the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) that identified the terminal distribution of DRN projections within the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei.</b> This study revealed that DRN projections descending in the ventricular plexus and the medial longitudinal fasciculus terminate within distinct vestibular terminal fields. In Chapter 5, BDA was used in combination with the serotonergic neurotoxin 5, 7 -dihydroxytryptamine (5, 7 -DHT) to selectively anterogradely trace nonserotonergic DRN projections to the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei.</b> These experiments demonstrated that nonserotonergic DRN projections descend exclusively within the ventricular plexus and terminate primarily within the periventricular aspect of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The purpose of the experiments in Chapter 6 was to map the distribution of serotonergic DRN terminals within the vestibular nuclei; 5, 7 -DHT was injected directly into DRN and silver staining was used to visualize the resulting pattern of terminal degeneration. It appears that projections from serotonergic DRN neurons terminate within both medial and lateral regions of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Based on these findings, we conclude that major differences exist in the course of descent and termination patterns of serotonergic and nonserotonergic DRN projections to the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei,</b> indicating that serotonergic and nonserotonergic cells give rise to distinct DRN projection systems that may selectively modulate processing within specific functional domains of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{vestibular}} sensory {{apparatus and}} associated <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> are generally thought to encode head-in-space motion. Angular head-in-space velocity is detected by vestibular hair {{cells that are}} located within the semicircular canals of the inner ear. In turn, the afferent fibers of the vestibular nerve project to neurons in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei,</b> which, in head-restrained animals, similarly encode head-in-space velocity during passive whole-body rotation. However, during the active head-on-body movements made to generate orienting gaze shifts, neurons in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> do not reliably encode head-in-space motion. The mechanism that underlies this differential processing of vestibular information is not known. To address this issue, we studied <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> neural responses during passive head rotations and during a variety of tasks in which alert rhesus monkeys voluntarily moved their heads relative to space.

30|$|In the {{unconscious}} scans, {{there was a}} strong contrast between the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> and the whole brain, while this contrast was not observed in the conscious scans. In [37], Gupta et al. investigated the effect of isoflurane on the vomiting reflex. They used musk shrews instead of rats since the latter do not exhibit a vomiting reflex (however, the rat brain may nonetheless respond similarly to isoflurane). They found that isoflurane induced a high c-Fos cell count (a protein related to neuronal activity) in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei,</b> where <b>vestibular</b> inputs are integrated with inputs from other sensory systems and the cerebellum for the perception of balance. High neuronal activity in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> would likely be accompanied by an increased glucose uptake, explaining the high FDG uptake in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> in {{the unconscious}} scans compared to the whole brain average.|$|R

Postnatal development of neurons immunoreactive for three neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinases (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) was examined in the rat <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> and subnuclei. TrkA immunoreactivity was not observed in these areas during the first two postnatal weeks, though some TrkA-positive neurons were present in other vestibular-related brainstem regions (e. g. prepositus hypoglossal nucleus). In older rats (>P 21), a strong immunostaining of TrkA was observed on both neuronal somata and nerve fibers within the lateral and spinal <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> while no immunostaining was detected in the medial and superior <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> and subnuclei. In the first few postnatal days, immunoreactivity for TrkB was virtually absent from the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei.</b> At P 4, a diffuse and very weak TrkB immunoreactivity was found restricted to cell bodies in the lateral and spinal <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> as well as group y subnucleus. During the second postnatal week, the TrkB immunostaining became prominent throughout the vestibular nuclear complex. Extremely strong labelling was observed in the large-sized neurons. The intensity of TrkB immunostaining decreased to a moderate level at P 21 and persisted until the adult stage. In contrast, immunoreactivity for TrkC within the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> was weak and diffuse during each of the postnatal ages studied.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether a differential distribution of vestibular afferent information to central nuclear neurons is present in pigeons was studied using neural tracer compounds. Discrete tracing of afferent fibers innervating the individual semicircular canal and otolith organs was produced by sectioning individual branches of the vestibular nerve that innervate the different receptor organs and applying crystals of horseradish peroxidase, or a horseradish peroxidase/cholera toxin mixture, or a biocytin compound for neuronal uptake and transport. Afferent fibers and their terminal distributions within the brainstem and cerebellum were visualized subsequently. Discrete areas in the pigeon central nervous system that receive primary vestibular input include the superior, dorsal lateral, ventral lateral, medial, descending, and tangential vestibular nuclei; the A and B groups; the intermediate, medial, and lateral cerebellar nuclei; and the nodulus, the uvula, and the paraflocculus. Generally, the vertical canal afferents projected heavily to medial regions in the superior and descending <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> as well as the A group. Vertical canal projections to the medial and lateral <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> were observed but were less prominent. Horizontal canal projections to the superior and descending <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> were much more centrally located than those of the vertical canals. A more substantial projection to the medial and lateral <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> was seen with horizontal canal afferents compared to vertical canal fibers. Afferents innervating the utricle and saccule terminated generally in the lateral regions of all <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> in areas that were separate from the projections of the semicircular canals. In addition, utricular fibers projected to regions in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> that overlapped with the horizontal semicircular canal terminal fields, whereas saccular afferents projected to regions that received vertical canal fiber terminations. Lagenar afferents projected throughout the cochlear nuclei, to the dorsolateral regions of the cerebellar nuclei, and to lateral regions of the superior, lateral, medial, and descending <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei...</b>|$|R

40|$|Functional and {{reactive}} neurogenesis and astrogenesis {{are observed}} in deafferented <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> after unilateral <b>vestibular</b> nerve section in adult cats.

This study investigates whether the nature of vestibular deafferentation has an incidence on the neurogenic potential of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei,</b> and on {{the time course of}} behavioural recovery. Three animal models that mimic different vestibular pathologies were used: unilateral and permanent suppression of vestibular input by unilateral vestibular neurectomy (UVN), or by unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL, the mechanical destruction of peripheral vestibular receptors), or unilateral and reversible blockade of vestibular nerve input using tetrodotoxin (TTX). Neurogenesis and astrogenesis were revealed in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a newborn cell marker, while glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD 67) were used to identify astrocytes and GABAergic neurons, respectively. Spontaneous nystagmus and posturo-locomotor tests (static and dynamic balance performance) were carried out to quantify the behavioural recovery process. Results showed that the nature of vestibular loss determined the cellular plastic events occurring in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> and affected the time course of behavioural recovery. Interestingly, the deafferented <b>vestibular</b> <b>nuclei</b> express neurogenic potential after acute and total vestibular loss only (UVN), while non-structural plastic processes are involved when the vestibular deafferentation is less drastic (UL, TTX) ...|$|R
