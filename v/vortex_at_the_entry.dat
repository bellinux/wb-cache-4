40|$|Numerical {{calculations}} of the 2 -D steady incompressible driven cavity flow are presented. The Navier-Stokes equations in streamfunction and vorticity formulation are solved numerically using a fine uniform grid mesh of 601 × 601. The steady driven cavity solutions are computed for Re ≤ 21, 000 {{with a maximum}} absolute residuals of the governing equations that were less than 10 − 10. A new quaternary <b>vortex</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom left corner and a new tertiary <b>vortex</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top left corner of the cavity are observed in the flow field as the Reynolds number increases. Detailed results are presented and comparisons are made with benchmark solutions found in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Helmholtz's {{equations}} {{provide the}} motion {{of a system of}} N vortices which describes a planar incompressible fluid with zero viscosity. A relative equilibrium is a particular solution of these equations for which the distances between the vortices are invariant during the motion. In this article, we are interested in relative equilibria formed of concentric regular polygons of vortices. We show {{that in the case of}} one regular polygon (and a possible <b>vortex</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center) with more than three vertices (two if there is a <b>vortex</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center), a relative equilibrium requires equal vorticities (on the polygon). We also determine all the relative equilibria with two concentric regular n-gons and the same vorticity on each n-gon. This result completes the classical studies for two regular n-gons when all the vortices have the same vorticity or when the total vorticity vanishes...|$|R
