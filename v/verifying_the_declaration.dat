40|$|With the {{introduction}} of integrated safeguards, the IAEA started developing State-level approaches (SLA) considering the State as a whole. The State-level concept (SLC), aimed at implementing safeguards based on SLAs and annual implementation plans, is planned to be extended to all States with CSAs in the future. The SLC represents a fundamental change from the “bottom-up” SLA based on facility level approaches, to the “top-down” SLA focusing primarily on the State as a whole. The development of SLAs {{is based on the}} synergies among various sources of information provided to the IAEA by the Member States or gathered from other sources. The main sources are of course <b>the</b> countries <b>declarations</b> and <b>the</b> results of inspections. These are complemented by analyses and other inputs allowing to <b>verify</b> <b>the</b> <b>declarations</b> and derive conclusions on the absence of non-declared activities. Various aspects of the non-proliferation framework can also contribute to the State level Concept, such as export control, safeguards implementation concepts and experiences, and verification methodologies and technologies, as discussed within the European Safeguards Research & Development Association (ESARDA). The paper aims at reviewing their importance and relevance. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R
40|$|Current {{safeguards}} approaches {{used by the}} IAEA at {{gas centrifuge}} enrichment plants (GCEPs) need enhancement in order to detect undeclared LEU production with adequate detection probability. ''Mailbox'' declarations {{have been used in}} the last two decades to verify receipts, production, and shipments at some bulk-handling facilities (e. g., fuel-fabrication plants). The operator declares the status of his plant to the IAEA on a daily basis using a secure ''Mailbox'' system such as a secure tamper-resistant computer. The operator agrees to hold receipts and shipments for a specified period of time, along with a specified number of annual inspections, to enable inspector access to a statistically large enough population of UF{sub 6 } cylinders and fuel assemblies to achieve the desired detection probability. The inspectors can access the ''Mailbox'' during randomly timed inspections and then <b>verify</b> <b>the</b> operator's <b>declarations</b> for that day. Previously, this type of inspection regime was considered mainly for <b>verifying</b> <b>the</b> material balance at fuel-fabrication, enrichment, and conversion plants. Brookhaven National Laboratory has expanded the ''Mailbox'' concept with short-notice random inspections (SNRIs), coupled with enhanced video surveillance, to include declaration and verification of UF{sub 6 } cylinder operational data to detect activities associated with undeclared LEU production at GCEPs. Since <b>the</b> ''Mailbox'' <b>declarations</b> would also include data relevant to material-balance verification, these randomized inspections would replace the scheduled monthly interim inspections for material-balance purposes; in addition, the inspectors could simultaneously perform the required number of Limited-Frequency Unannounced Access (LFUA) inspections used for HEU detection. This approach would provide improved detection capabilities for a wider range of diversion activities with not much more inspection effort than at present...|$|R
40|$|Being able to <b>verify</b> <b>the</b> operator¿s <b>declaration</b> {{in regard}} to the {{technical}} design of nuclear facilities is an important aspect of every safeguards approach. In addition to visual observation, it is necessary to know if nuclear material is present or has been present in undeclared piping and ducts. The possibility of combining the results from different measurement techniques into one easily interpreted product should optimize the inspection effort and increase safeguards effectiveness. A collaborative effort to investigate the possibility of combining measurements from a three-dimensional (3 D) laser scanning system and gamma-ray imaging systems is under way. The feasibility of the concept has been previously proven with different laboratory prototypes of gamma-ray imaging systems. Recently, simultaneous measurements were conducted with a new highly portable, mechanically cooled, HPGe, coded-aperture gamma-ray imager and a 3 D laser scanner in an operational facility with complex configuration and different enrichment levels and quantities of uranium. With specially designed software, data from both instruments were combined and a 3 D model of the facility was generated that also identified locations of radioactive sources. This paper provides an overview of the technology, describes the measurements, discusses the various safeguards scenarios addressed, and presents results of experimentsJRC.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} international safeguards activities {{performed by the}} International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the verification that facility design and construction (including upgrades and modifications) do not create opportunities for nuclear proliferation. These Design Information Verification activities require that IAEA inspectors compare current and past information about <b>the</b> facility to <b>verify</b> <b>the</b> operator’s <b>declaration</b> of proper use. The actual practice of DIV presents challenges to the inspectors due to {{the large amount of}} data generated, concerns about sensitive or proprietary data, the overall complexity of the facility, and the effort required to extract just the safeguards relevant information. Planned and anticipated facilities will (especially in the case of reprocessing plants) be ever larger and increasingly complex, thus exacerbating the challenges. This paper reports the results of a workshop held at the Idaho National Laboratory in March 2009, which considered technologies and methods to address these challenges. The use of 3 D Laser Range Finding, Outdoor Visualization System, Gamma-LIDAR, and virtual facility modeling, as well as methods to handle the facility data issues (quantity, sensitivity, and accessibility and portability for the inspector) were presented. The workshop attendees drew conclusions about the use of these techniques with respect to successfully employing them in an operating environment, using a Fuel Conditioning Facility walk-through as a baseline for discussion...|$|R
40|$|Design Information Verification (DIV) {{is a very}} {{important}} activity in <b>verifying</b> <b>the</b> operator <b>declaration</b> to detect possible changes that may represent diversion scenarios in nuclear installations or their misuses. Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) has become involved in the application of safeguards to complex and sensitive facilities, where the physical verification of the design present status is sometimes complex and a long task. The methodology to carry out the DIV has been improved recently. However, the way to execute some tasks is still relying on the expertise and technical background of the inspectors. One of the tools that is currently available to increase the effectiveness of the DIV process is the 3 D Laser Range Finder (3 DLR) developed by the European Commission¿s Joint Research Centre (JRC). This tool is currently used by the IAEA, and ABACC considers it is a very promising tool to be used at facilities having numerous pipes, tanks and accessories. Besides, the technology applied contributes for non proliferation because the information can be kept at the facility, and requires less intrusive access to the plant. ABACC and JRC started cooperating on the 3 D Laser Range Finder (3 DLR) for Design Information Verification within the scope of the general ABACC-EURATOM cooperation agreement. This paper presents the advantages of the technology, the applications envisaged by ABACC, and the technical features of the 3 DLR system for these applications. The paper also describes the operational aspects of the application and the necessary procedure to be agreed among operator, States and Safeguards agencies (ABACC and IAEA). The paper addresses also the status of the ABACC/JRC cooperation in this field. JRC. G. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R
50|$|Inspections are {{designed}} to verify compliance of States Parties with the requirements imposed on production and use of scheduled chemicals and to verify that industrial activities of member states have been correctly declared according to the obligation set by the CWC. The intensity and frequency of the inspections {{is dependent on the}} type of chemical produced (in descending order: Schedule 1, Schedule 2, Schedule 3 or DOC, see Scheduled Chemicals), but is regardless of the standing of the member state.For Schedule 1 and 2 facilities, a mass balance is prepared to identify whether all produced chemicals can be accounted for and whether the amounts are consistent with <b>the</b> <b>declarations</b> made by member states. Furthermore, at Schedule 2 and 3 facilities clues are investigated whether, contrary to <b>the</b> <b>declaration</b> and to <b>the</b> rules in the convention, Schedule 1 chemicals are produced. At Schedule 3 and DOC, the main aim is to check <b>the</b> <b>declaration</b> and to <b>verify</b> <b>the</b> absence of Schedule 2 and Schedule 1 production units.
