The financial system in the Central Euro- pean countries is traditionally based on banks and credit market. Therefore, we see the necessity for modelling <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> market and assessment {{of the factors that}} determine development <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> market. The aim of the paper is to analyze long-run relationships in the Czech Repub- lic’s credit market and to reveal significant determinants <b>of</b> the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> disbursed. We apply cointegration analysis and vector error correction modelling on quarterly data to test existen- ce of equilibrium relationships in credit supply and credit demand during the period 1994 – 2007. The results suggest positive influence of GDP and interest rate on the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> provided. However, the VECM estimation does not prove the existence of a statistically significant long-run equilibrium relationship explaining the credit demand. The credit supply frequently and substantia- lly departed from the equilibrium level. The results show that the more available sources the banks have the higher is the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> provided. Likewise, more profitable the lending activity leads to higher <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> disbursed. The widest gap between the current credit supply and equilibrium level can be observed {{in the first half of}} 2001. At the same time, we witnessed a sharp decline in <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> the <b>credits</b> disbursed. All together can be interpreted as a sign <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> crunch in the Czech banking sector. The credit supply has exceeded its long-run equilibrium since 2002.

50|$|So {{long as we}} have no law {{determining}} what our monetary policy shall be there will always be uncertainty as to the external and internal values of the dollar. Consequently, there is an ever-present danger of abuse of discretionary powers, not only the President’s powers but those of others as well. The Secretary of Treasury, for instance, has discretionary power to issue silver certificates and, for that purpose, to buy silver. He is also free to use, as he pleases, the two billion dollars in stabilization account and thus influence foreign exchange. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may change the reserve requirements of banks, may buy or sell Government bonds in the open market, may change discount rates, and in other ways effect the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and so the purchasing power of the dollar. Even our gold miners, and still more the miners of gold abroad, may affect the volume of money in circulation in the United States, since for every ounce of gold they turn over to the United States Mint, the Treasury increases our volume of money by $35. Lastly, our 15,000 commercial banks affect {{the value of the dollar}} by expanding, or contracting, the volume of demand deposits when they either make or liquidate loans, and when they purchase or sell securities.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to apply a disequilibrium model on credit market in The Czech Republic and to analyze credit demand and credit supply in period 1994 – 2007. We aim to answer the {{following}} questions: What are the main determinants that drive the demand and supply in the Czech Republic’s credit market? What was the development <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> demand and credit supply? Whether the slowdown in the growth <b>of</b> the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> disbursed was caused by demand or supply factors. The degree of equilibrium in the Czech credit market is assessed subsequently. We came to conclusion that the credit demand in the Czech Republic is a function of one-quar- ter-lagged gross domestic product, investments, capital market index PX 50 and interest rate on loans. The effects of all variables except for interest rate are in line with expectations. Credit supply in the Czech Republic is a function of deposits, industrial production, interest rate on loans and classified loans. The results suggest that a considerable disequilibrium was typical for Czech credit market over the last ten years. During most of the period, the level of provided loans was determined by credit demand. From the second quarter <b>of</b> 2006, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> loans provided has been determined by credit supply. The decline in the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> disbursed during 1998 – 2002 was caused by supply factors.

In the thesis {{the basic principles of}} credit risk management and regulations are described. The volume of granted credit determines the probability of default. If there is an option to transfer a credit risk to the third party, volume of granted credits increases. The <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> depends also on the regulatory duty to hold an adequate amount of capital. In the case the banks find the way to diminish this regulatory capital, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> increases.

The option of credit risk transfer to the third party together with high saturation of credit market leads to taking higher risk by lenders. At the end it has an impact on the business cycle...|$|E

40|$|In {{contemporary}} research, it {{is common}} to measure growth-enhancing financial development by the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> as a ratio {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP), an application of Schumpeter's theory of credit and development. Recently, researchers have been surprised to find a negative relation between this measure and economic growth. This paper has three aims. First, Schumpeter sharply distinguished between the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> financing development and the (typically larger) volume of the 'secondary wave' of credit financing consumption, over-investment and speculation, which follows the 'primary wave' of credit financing innovations. Combined with circuit theory, this helps explain the growth and the effects of credit/GDP ratios in our time. Second, it is shown that an increase in the credit/GDP ratio is due to an increase in 'secondary wave' credit, not productive credit; and since credit is debt, growth in the credit/GDP ratio is negative, not positive for economic development. Third, five contemporary ways in which the use of credit for consumption, financial investment and speculation has been institutionalized are discussed. The message of this paper is that, as Schumpeter wrote, "distinction between debts according to purpose, however difficult to carry out, is always relevant to diagnosis and may be relevant to preventive policy"...|$|E
