40|$|A 4 -lump {{kinetic model}} {{including}} hydrogen consumption for hydrocracking of <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> {{in a pilot}} scale reactor is proposed. The advantage of this work over the previous ones is consideration of hydrogen consumption, imposed by converting <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> to light products, which is implemented in the kinetic model by a quadratic expression as similar as response surface modeling. This approach considers <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (VGO) and unconverted oil as one lump whilst others are distillate, naphtha and gas. The pilot reactor bed is divided into hydrotreating and hydrocracking sections which are loaded with different types of catalysts. The aim {{of this paper is}} modeling the hydrocracking section, but the effect of hydrotreating is considered on the boundary condition of the hydrocracking part. The hydrocracking bed is considered as a plug flow reactor and it is modeled by the cellular network approach. Initially, a kinetic network with twelve coefficients and six paths is considered. But following evaluation using measured data and order of magnitude analysis, the three route passes and one activation energy coefficient are omitted; thus the number of coefficients is reduced to five. This approach improves the average absolute deviation of prediction from 7. 2 % to 5. 92 %. Furthermore, the model can predict the hydrogen consumption for hydrocracking with average absolute deviation about 8. 59 % in comparison to those calculated from experimental data...|$|R

The proposed method is capable of handling the stiffness of the partial differential equations resulting from the hydrocracking reactions.

Initially, the absolute average deviation of the cold dynamic simulation using the CE/SE approach is 8. 98 %, which is better than that obtained using the FDM. Then, the stability analysis proves that for achieving an appropriate response from the dynamic model, the Courant number, which {{is a function of}} the time step size, mesh size and volume flow rate through the catalytic bed, should be less than 1. Finally, it is found that, following a careful selection of these parameters, the CE/SE solutions to the hydrocracking model can produce higher accuracy than the FDM results.

However the primary liquids obtained from DCL (i. e. outflow liquids of the first reactor in a two stages liquefaction process) do not meet the product specifications and need to be upgraded via downstream catalytic hydrotreatment processes. The in depth knowledge of the feed of this upgrading step is of key importance to design better catalysts. In this study, we applied new cutting-edge techniques to improve the characterization of a coal derived liquid obtained from a liquefaction step starting from Scottish bituminous coal. For this purpose, bidimensional chromatography (GC xGC), and C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to analyze four cuts of the coal liquid with the following boiling points intervals: heavy naphtha (initial boiling point: IBP- 215 degrees C), <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (215 - 343 degrees C), <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (343 - 524 degrees C) and vacuum residue (524 (+) degrees C). The analyses showed high aromaticity of all four cuts. The weight content of aromatics in the <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> fraction, was 75 %, with a majority of two rings aromatics and the remainder consisting mostly of normal paraffins. In the <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> cut, which contains mostly four aromatic rings, we found 11 wt% of asphaltenes (compounds in n-heptane), an unexpected high amount comparing to petroleum VGO fractions. The amount of heptane-insoluble (asphaltenes, pre-asphaltenes and sediments) is as high as 80 % in the vacuum residue fraction (524 (+) degrees C). Aromaticity given by C- 13 NMR in this cut is as high as the level observed in petroleum asphaltenes (C-aro = 53 wt%). High content of heteroelements, which highly increase the polarity of the molecules, in the coal liquid and especially in the vacuum residue can explain the enhanced amount of n-heptane-insoluble compounds.

30|$|The {{production}} of propylene is mostly achieved using catalytic reactions with special selectivity for propylene [7, 8, 12, 13]. A number of lumps for catalytic cracking {{were reported in}} the literature but most of them lumped the gaseous products in a single lump, thereby making it difficult to optimize or maximize a particular gas, for instance propylene. Usman et al. [14] conducted experiment using three different crudes (Super Light, Extra Light and Arab Light) catalytically cracked to produce light olefins, where they presented propane and propylene as different lumps. They used different catalysts: base-equilibrated catalyst and others; (Z 30 and Z 1500) which are the base-equilibrated catalyst[*]+[*]MFI Zeolite at varying Si/Al ratio. The results shows that the total weight fraction of the two lumps; propylene and propane has propylene about 80 – 89 % for all the crude oils and catalysts used [14]. This percentage is high, therefore, a combined lump of propylene and propane can be treated as a single lump of propylene and the kinetic model of Ancheyta and Rogelio [15] is suitable for this work.

Additionally it was demonstrated that desilication performed in the presence of PDAs offered greater mesoporosity development when compared to pure NaOH treatment. IR studies employing ammonia and pyridine as probes exhibited considerably Brønsted acidity of the resulting materials. The strength of protonic sites was reduced upon the treatment; nevertheless their accessibility to hindered 2, 6 -di-tert-butylpyridine molecules became noticeably high owing to a more open hierarchical structure. Concentration of the acid sites, their strength, and accessibility were reflected in both catalytic activity and selectivity in the cracking of n-decane, 1, 3, 5 -tri-isopropylbenzene, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|R
