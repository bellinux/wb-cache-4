The last generation of policy instruments, based on <b>voluntary</b> and <b>self-regulation,</b> is then discussed. Their alleged advantages in terms of efficiency and publicity are brought into question by a major problem: the public is privatized within contracts, which represent the currently dominant type of relationship at policy and social level.

The focus {{of this paper is}} on the merits and shortcomings of three major categories of <b>voluntary</b> initiative: <b>self-regulation,</b> the <b>voluntary</b> agreement, and the voluntary challenge. Using data collected from eighteen new and two previously documented case studies of voluntary initiatives, the authors present some of the key characteristics of these types of initiatives and speculate on their role in North America's environmental policy regime. Industry respondents in the case studies identified the threat of regulation, public image, financial considerations, and peer pressure as key motivating factors in their decision to participate in a voluntary initiative. From a policy perspective, issues of concern are the effectiveness of nonstatutory initiatives relative to regulations, the degree of flexibility that they offer, and the role of public involvement. It is concluded that considerable research is still needed to confirm the contentions of proponents or opponents of voluntary initiatives. ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. While political scientists concur about the increasing importance of regulation, the extant literature features a notable diversity of contemporary definitions of regulation. The various understandings of regulation put different emphasis on the role of the state and regulation as an instrument or a process, respectively. This article scrutinizes and clarifies the notions of regulation and self-regulation in the Political Science literature. Along three analytic questions – what is regulated, who regulates, and how is it being regulated? –, the essay illustrates developments from regulation as government intervention to regulation as governance and finally, regulation as various mechanisms of social control. The latter includes hybrid, private, transnational, <b>voluntary</b> and <b>self-regulation.</b> The article discusses the usefulness of modern notions of regulation, as well as potential future research trajectories.

40|$|Privacy-enhancing {{personalized}} (PEP) systems address {{individual users}} ’ privacy preferences {{as well as}} privacy laws and regulations. Building such systems entails modeling two different domains: (a) privacy constraints as mandated by law, <b>voluntary</b> <b>self-regulation,</b> or users ’ individual privacy preferences, and modeled by legal professionals, and (b) software architectures as dictated by available software components and modeled by software architects.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the press {{in an era of}} media convergence is a thorny issue, which regulators around the world have tried to either grapple with or sweep under the carpet.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the mental fatigue induced by {{prolonged}} self-regulation increases perception of effort and reduces performance during subsequent endurance exercise. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying these negative effects of mental fatigue are unclear. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that mental fatigue exacerbates central fatigue induced by whole-body endurance exercise. Twelve subjects performed 30 min of either an incongruent Stroop task to induce a condition of mental fatigue or a congruent Stroop task (control condition) in a random and counterbalanced order. Both cognitive tasks (CT) were followed by a whole-body endurance task (ET) consisting of six minutes of cycling exercise at 80 % of peak power output measured during a preliminary incremental test. Neuromuscular function of the knee extensors was assessed before and after CT, and after ET. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was measured during ET. Both CT did not induce any decrease in maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque (p= 0. 194). During ET, mentally fatigued subjects reported higher RPE (self-regulation 13. 9 ± 3. 0, control 13. 3 ± 3. 2, p= 0. 044). ET induced a similar decrease in MVC torque (self-regulation - 17 ± 15 %, control - 15 ± 11 %, p= 0. 001), maximal <b>voluntary</b> activation level (<b>self-regulation</b> - 6 ± 9 %, control - 6 ± 7 %, p= 0. 013) and resting twitch (self-regulation - 30 ± 14 %, control - 32 ± 10 %, P< 0. 001) in both conditions. These findings reject our hypothesis and confirm previous findings that mental fatigue does not reduce the capacity of the central nervous system to recruit the working muscles. The negative effect of mental fatigue on perception of effort does not reflect a greater development of either central or peripheral fatigue. Consequently, mentally fatigued subjects are still able to perform maximal exercise, but they are experiencing an altered performance during submaximal exercise due to higher-than-normal perception of effort...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the 2002 King Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa has placed new emphasis on companies to attain higher and more consistent standards of governance. Based on widely recognised and supported governance frameworks it also inspired a rising expectation of accountability and transparency across every aspect of society and also other types of organisations. Through {{the establishment of the}} guidelines found in the King II Report the doors have been opened to sport and its various bodies to draw from the experience of corporations and to make use of some of these guidelines in the development of their own guidelines aimed at their own respective needs and purposes. The sports industry and especially its governing bodies need guidelines for proper governance due to the raised level of interest and impact of sport lately. As a result of the corporatisation of sport and increased professionalism, a greater need for proper business management and governance models within sport becomes apparent. The government has also placed renewed emphasis on the need for sport to become more professional {{in the manner in which}} it governs itself. If the sports industry cannot achieve this by means of proactive <b>voluntary</b> action and <b>self-regulation,</b> it runs the risk of legislative regulation, which threatens to undermine the sanctity of flexibility and self-regulation which has been central in the development of sport. This study presents a first attempt to determine the levels of non-adherence by national sports federations of South Africa to the principles of best practice governance, identified as the pillars of good governance. These principles are taken from the King II Report, and also the guidelines developed during the first Governance-in-Sport conference.

The analysis suggests that the ILO’s shift to ‘promotional principles’ and the formal acceptance of <b>voluntary</b> <b>self-regulation</b> from the late- 1990 s has not significantly improved the situation for workers, but was a pragmatic response driven in part by US policy and the increasing marginalization of the ILO within the global system of economic governance.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of recent {{corporate}} collapses, 'corporate governance' has received unprecedented levels of attention. It can be narrowly defined as how a company is directed and steered. The responsibility of steering a company is entrusted with the board of directors, who {{become the focus of}} governance mechanisms. Yet this is not as straightforward as it appears - Australia has experienced massive shifts in business regulations over the past two decades. One innovation in Australian business regulation is 'enforced self-regulation' which combines the benefits of <b>voluntary</b> <b>self-regulation</b> with the coercive power of the State, implemented via a compliance program. A possible hazard of compliance system is that management might treat this responsibility as a 'box ticking' exercise. Therefore effective governance and compliance entails more than setting up internal and regulatory mechanisms; the willingness of various stakeholders to collaborate is crucial. This suggests that managing relationships between stakeholders of an organization is the key to averting corporate collapses...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to achieve a better {{understanding}} of risk management as practised by tax administrations of developed countries and to ascertain what prevents the developing countries from managing risks efficiently and effectively. Tax administrations are faced with challenges to ensure voluntary compliance with the tax law. Compliance risk that is generally faced by tax administrations in relation to the implementation of the Self-Assessment System (SAS) is further explored. A well-designed risk management strategy enables tax administrations to manage risks efficiently whilst reducing administrative costs in the process. The empirical evidence indicates that, in developing countries, the level of compliance is generally low and the administrative capability of tax agencies is relatively poor. In an effort to increase tax compliance, tax administrations in developing countries tend to adopt a traditional approach to their duties by implementing a command-and-control mechanism. The majority of tax compliance research has been written from the perspective of taxpayers. This study, in contrast, investigates the perspective of a tax administration in a developing country; hence the Malaysian Tax Administration, also known as the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (IRBM) has been selected as a case study. Compliance risk management by the IRBM is addressed in order to understand the agency’s activities that are designed to encourage voluntary compliance and manage compliance risk. This qualitative research uses responsive regulation theory as a concept to underpin this investigation. This study also develops a conceptual framework which combines three major themes: tax compliance, risk management and responsive regulation. Responsive regulation in the tax administrations of developing countries is considered a new concept, thus warranting further study. Responsive regulation encourages a soft approach to handling non-compliant taxpayers, resorting to a hard approach only if taxpayers refuse to comply. Empirical data was collected through face-to-face interviews with senior officials of the IRBM and tax practitioners in Malaysia to elicit the interviewees’ perceptions of risk and IRBM risk management practices. To enrich data collection, secondary data was collected from a range of published and unpublished printed materials from the IRBM. Findings from this study suggest that IRBM risk management strategies conform to responsive regulation theory. Various education programmes are conducted by the IRBM to assist and encourage voluntary compliance. The study reveals that Malaysian taxpayers’ compliance behaviour is influenced by tax knowledge, culture and their perceptions of the government administering the revenue. Knowledge gained from this study would provide insights for tax administrations in other developing countries of IRBM risk management practices in fostering <b>voluntary</b> compliance and <b>self-regulation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since {{the advent}} of neo-liberal {{globalisation}} the increasing influence of multinational corporations on society has been widely noted.

The RTMS is an industry-led, government-supported, <b>voluntary,</b> <b>self-regulation</b> scheme that encourages consignees, consignors and road transport operators to implement a management system that demonstrates compliance with road traffic regulations and contributes to preserving road infrastructure, improving road safety and increasing productivity. The surveyed views of the road traffic authorities, banks, insurance companies, the RTMS steering committee, and road transport operators provide insights into the perceptions and experiences with respect to the RTMS from diverse stakeholders. Respondents indicate that improved safety, operational efficiency and reduced road crashes are seen as attractive benefits to implementing the RTMS. The main obstacles to certification are a lack of awareness of the RTMS and a poor understanding of the requirements for becoming RTMS certified.
