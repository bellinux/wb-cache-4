50|$|Like its predecessor, the 1996 Constitution {{provides}} for direct <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> of the Bill of Rights but, unlike its predecessor, does not confine itself to {{this form of}} direct application. Section 8(2) clearly envisages direct application of the Bill of Rights in the horizontal relationship in certain circumstances.|$|E

50|$|Unity is a {{graphical}} shell for the GNOME desktop environment {{originally developed}} by Canonical Ltd. for its Ubuntu operating system. Unity debuted in the netbook edition of Ubuntu 10.10. It was initially {{designed to make}} more efficient use of space given the limited screen size of netbooks, including, for example, a <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> switcher called the launcher, and a space-saving horizontal multipurpose top menu bar.|$|E
50|$|Based on the American West Coast Lumber Inspection Bureau (WCLIB) grading rules, {{there is}} only one grade of stud: STUD. A stud is graded for <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> and its stress {{requirements}} and allowable visual defects reflect that application. A stud is most similar to a #2 grade, which is held to a higher standard during grading. The biggest difference between the two is the frequency, placement and size of knots and overall allowable wane.|$|E
50|$|Like its predecessor, the 1996 Constitution {{provides}} for direct <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> of the Bill of Rights but, unlike its predecessor, {{is not confined}} to this form of direct application. Section 8(2) clearly envisages direct application of the Bill of Rights in the horizontal relationship in certain circumstances, and therefore “points unequivocally toward a much broader conception of direct application.” The 1996 Constitution also still permits, however, in section 39(2) (as the Interim Constitution did in section 35(3)), indirect application of the Bill of Rights in horizontal cases.|$|E
50|$|After {{the merger}} with Firstlight ERA in February 2010, Convera's {{remaining}} assets and technology became {{the property of}} NTENT. NTENT continues to provide web-scale semantic search for <b>vertical</b> <b>applications,</b> and also provides context-sensitive advertising services for both web pages and search results.|$|R
50|$|The Agusta GA.70 was a 4-cylinder, air-cooled, {{horizontally}} opposed engine {{developed in}} Italy for light aircraft and helicopter use. The GA.70/V featured a bottom sump for <b>vertical</b> <b>applications</b> and was rated at 158 hp. It {{was produced in}} the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
50|$|In July 2009, Nuxeo {{launched}} its Galaxy Partner Program for ECM Application and Solution Providers. This {{program is designed}} for application and solution providers in the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) space. The Galaxy Program enables business and field experts to package their knowledge and offer <b>vertical</b> solutions and <b>applications,</b> called Content-Enabled <b>Vertical</b> <b>Applications</b> (CEVAs), to their customers and to the Nuxeo community. Nuxeo EP and DM 5.3 were released in October 2009.|$|R
50|$|The direct {{application}} of the duties under the Bill of Rights is governed by section 8. Broadly speaking, section 8(1) deals with direct <b>vertical</b> <b>application.</b> It describes {{the circumstances in which}} law and conduct of the state may be challenged for being inconsistent with the Bill of Rights. Section 8(2), on the other hand, deals with direct horizontal application. It sets out the circumstances in which the conduct of private individuals may be attacked for infringing the Bill of Rights. Section 8(3) grants powers to the courts to remedy such infringements.|$|E
50|$|The narrowest {{conception}} of {{a bill of rights}} {{is that it is a}} “charter of negative liberties.” This means that it is intended to protect individuals against state power by listing rights that cannot be violated by the state, either by means of law or through the conduct of state actors. This is the “vertical” relationship—between individuals and the state. A bill of rights that has solely <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> will place duties on the state not to violate the rights of individuals. It will not place any similar duties on individuals.|$|E
50|$|Launched in 2014, the presenceCell {{is a new}} {{range of}} small cell, {{designed}} to capture precise user location data via their smart phone, which can be analysed and packaged as a service {{for a variety of}} businesses.In addition to the presenceCell, ip.access also provides the back-end processing and management system that delivers the Presence data anonymously and securely to <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> providers. The company’s Network Orchestration System serves as the infrastructure management solution and also supports the GSMA’s OneAPI standard, which allows third parties to provide value-added services through web friendly message interfaces. The presenceCell was commercially deployed by Vodafone Turkey in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|Application {{software}} {{can also be}} seen as being either horizontal or <b>vertical.</b> [...] Horizontal <b>applications</b> are more popular and widespread, because they are general purpose, for example word processors or databases. <b>Vertical</b> <b>applications</b> are niche products, designed for a particular type of industry or business, or department within an organization. Integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of, for example, manufacturing or banking systems, or accounting, or customer service.|$|R
50|$|Most SX {{supercomputers}} run the SUPER-UX {{operating system}} (OS), and come with Fortran and C++ compilers. Cray has also developed an Ada compiler {{which is available}} as an option. Some <b>vertical</b> <b>applications</b> are available through NEC, but in general customers are expected to develop much of their own software.|$|R
5000|$|The Aphelion Imaging Software Suite is a {{software}} suite that includes three base products (i.e., Aphelion Lab, Aphelion Dev, and Aphelion [...] ) for addressing image processing and image analysis applications.

5000|$|UniVerse was {{originally}} developed by VMark Software and UniData {{was originally}} {{developed by the}} Unidata Corporation. Both Universe and Unidata are used for <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> development and are embedded into the vertical software applications. In 1997, the Unidata Corporation merged with VMark Systems to form Ardent Software. [...] In March 2000, Ardent Software was acquired by Informix. [...] IBM subsequently acquired the database division of Informix in April 2001, making UniVerse and UniData part of IBM's DB2 product family. IBM subsequently created the Information Management group of which Data Management {{is one of the}} sub-areas under which the IBM U2 family comprised UniData and UniVerse along with the tools, SystemBuilder Extensible Architecture (SB/XA), U2 Web Development Environment (U2 Web DE) and wIntegrate.|$|E
5000|$|With the Du Plessis {{decision}} in mind, and concerned that confining the Bill of Rights to direct <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> amounted to the toleration of private violations of rights, the Constitutional Assembly created a different application and jurisdictional scheme in the 1996 Constitution. To provide for direct horizontal application, two textual changes were made. The {{first was the}} addition of the word “judiciary” in section 8(1), missing from the application provisions of the interim Constitution. The second was the imposition of a duty on individuals, in section 8(2), to uphold the rights of other individuals: “A provision of the Bill of Rights binds a natural or a juristic person if, and to the extent that, it is applicable, taking into account the nature of the right and the nature of any duty imposed by the right.” ...|$|E
30|$|So far, we {{have seen}} the {{following}} advantages from taking a policy driven approach. Firstly, it can break down <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> silos. Operating outside application logic, and across system boundaries, it allows for more functionality and flexibility, enabling components to be used and reused in ways not previously possible. It allows for fine-grained personalisation and customisation, responsive to a range of different circumstances. Such functionality is crucial for systems supporting emerging care services.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> of data warehousing and data mining technology: intelligent web caching. We introduce {{several ways to}} construct intelligent web caching algorithms that employ predictive models of web requests; the general idea is to extend the LRU policy of web and proxy servers by making it sensible to web access models extracted from web log data using data mining techniques. Two approaches have been studied in particular, one based on association rules and another based on decision trees...|$|E
40|$|Against a {{background}} of the low engagement of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in e-business this paper investigates the strategic impact of e-aggregation applications, provided by emerging <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> service providers (VSP), and defined as ‘an e-business application, promoted by a trusted third party, which engages {{a significant number of}} SMEs by addressing an important shared business concern within an aggregation’. By conducting quantitative surveys of four aggregations of SMEs using these applications (users) and comparing these results with similar enterprises who are not (non-users) the research shows that such applications can facilitate the e-business engagement by SMEs...|$|E

30|$|It was {{possible}} to produce robust ESH–LWSCC mixtures that satisfy the EFNARC criteria for SCC. Three industrial classes of ESH–LWSCC mixtures with wide range of workability performance were successfully developed. These mixtures can cover various ranges of applications, such as tunnel linings, walls, columns, <b>vertical</b> <b>applications</b> in very congested structures, and structures with complex shapes.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, some {{experiences}} {{of using the}} concurrent functional language Erlang to implement a classical <b>vertical</b> <b>application,</b> a risk management information system, are presented. Due to the complex nature of the business logic and the interactions involved in the client/server architecture deployed, traditional development techniques are unsatisfactory. First, {{the nature of the}} problem suggests an iterative design approach. The use of abstractions (functional patterns) and compositionality (both functional and concurrent composition) have been key factors {{to reduce the amount of}} time spent adapting the system to changes in requirements. Despite our initial concerns, the gap between classical software engineering and the functional programming paradigm has been successfully fullfiled...|$|E
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSN) {{are recognized}} key enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm since its inception. WSNs are a resilient and effective distributed data collection technology, but {{issues related to}} reliability, autonomy, cost, and accessibility to application domain experts still limit their wide scale use. Commercial solutions can effectively address <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> domains, but they often lead to technology lock-ins that limit horizontal composability and reuse. We review some important barriers that hinder WSN use in IoT applications and highlight the main effort and cost components. With these elements in mind, we propose an open hardware-software development platform that can optimize the value flow between technologies and actors with stakes in WSN applications. To reach its objectives, the platform fosters reuse, low-effort low-risk fast prototyping accessible to application domain experts, easy integration of new technology and IP blocks, and simplifies the permeation of research results in commercial applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — {{the field}} of Wireless Local Area Networks (LANs) is {{expanding}} rapidly {{as a result of}} advances in digital communications, portable computers, and semiconductor technology. The early adopters of this technology have primarily been <b>vertical</b> <b>application</b> that places a premium on the mobility offered by such systems. Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) refers to a collision resolution mechanism used in random access MAC protocols. This algorithm is used in Ethernet (IEEE 802. 3) wired LANs. In Ethernet networks, this algorithm is commonly used to schedule retransmissions after collisions. The paper’s goal is to minimize the time transmission cycle of the information between mobiles moving in a Wi-Fi by changing the BEB algorithm. The Protocol CSMA / CA manage access to the radio channel by performing an arbitration based on time. This causes many problems in relation to time transmission between mobiles moving in a cell 802. 11. what we have done show that the protocol using CSMA / CA access time believed rapidly when the number of stations and / or the network load increases or other circumstances affects the network...|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, FPGAs {{have been}} {{reserved}} for specific <b>vertical</b> <b>applications</b> where {{the volume of}} production is small. For these low-volume applications, the premium that companies pay in hardware costs per unit for a programmable chip is more affordable than the development resources spent on creating an ASIC for a low-volume application. Today, new cost and performance dynamics have broadened the range of viable applications.|$|R
