40|$|The paper proposes the <b>vicinities</b> merging {{algorithm}} for prediction with side information. The {{algorithm is}} based on specialist experts techniques. We use <b>vicinities</b> in the side information domain to identify relevant past examples, apply standard learning techniques to them, and then use prediction with expert advice tools to merge those predictions. Guarantees from the theory of prediction with expert advice ensure that helpful <b>vicinities</b> are selected dynamically. The algorithm automatically converges on the right <b>vicinities</b> from an initial broad selection. We apply the resulting algorithms to two problems, prediction of implied volatility of options and prediction of students' performance at tests. On the problem of predicting implied volatility, the algorithm consistently outperforms naive competitors and a highly-tuned proprietary method used in the industry. When applied to the students' performance, the algorithm never falls behind the baseline and outperforms it when the side information is beneficial...|$|R

30|$|Here, {{we present}} our {{work on the}} heating-enhanced (HE) dynamic DEP process for aligned SWCNT film of {{ultrahigh}} density. We think the SWCNTs far from DEP grooves and beyond the DEP force’s ability {{can be taken to}} the <b>vicinities</b> of DEP grooves by the convection induced by intentional heating and then are captured by the DEP force, resulting in much higher alignment density of SWCNTs than the case without heating. The simulation work suggests that the heating-induced convection takes the SWCNTs beyond 100  μm far away from DEP grooves to the <b>vicinities</b> of DEP grooves. We assumed that DEP force is equal to the “convection force” at the boundaries of the SWCNTs-gathering areas in the <b>vicinities</b> of DEP grooves, based on which the convection force can be assessed with DEP force.|$|R
