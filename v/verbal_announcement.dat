500|$|The {{rail traffic}} on Polish railway lines was {{extremely}} dense. An average of 420 German military trains were passing through every 24 hours {{on top of}} internal traffic already in 1941. The Holocaust trains were routinely delayed en route; some transports took many days to arrive. Hundreds of prisoners died from exhaustion, suffocation and thirst while in transit to the camp in the overcrowded wagons. In extreme cases such as the Biała Podlaska transport of 6,000 Jews travelling only a [...] distance, up to 90 per cent of people were already dead when the sealed doors flew open. From September 1942 on, both Polish and foreign Jews were greeted with a brief <b>verbal</b> <b>announcement.</b> An earlier signboard with directions was removed because it was clearly insufficient.

Although he was directly responsible for the camp's operations, according to his own testimony Stangl limited his contact with Jewish prisoners as much as possible. He claimed that he rarely interfered with the cruel acts perpetrated by his subordinate officers at the camp. He became desensitised to the killings, and came to perceive prisoners not as humans but merely as [...] "cargo" [...] that had to be destroyed, he said.|$|E

40|$|Since the September 1985 Plaza Hotel {{announcement}} by the Group of Five industrial countries, a substantial realignment of exchange rates has been achieved. At the same time, {{foreign exchange market}} intervention, much of it concerted {{and much of it}} sterilized, has been undertaken on a scale not seen since the early 1970 s This paper takes a fresh look at the effectiveness of sterilized intervention in the light of recent experience. The paper concludes that sterilized intervention, in itself, has played an unimportant role in promoting exchange-rate realignment. Instead, clear shifts in patterns of monetary and fiscal policy appear to have been the main medium-term policy factors determining currency values. Over certain shorter time periods, intervention has influenced exchange markets through a signalling channel; but this signalling effect has been operative only as a result of authorities' frequent readiness to adjust monetary policies promptly to counteract unwelcome exchange-market pressures. The paper makes some progress in formalizing reasons why intervention might enhance the credibility of messages that governments could convey as well through simple <b>verbal</b> <b>announcements.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This volume {{concerns}} {{the ways in}} which verbal and non-verbal actions are combined and linked in a range of contexts in everyday conversation, in institutional contexts, and in written journalism. The volume includes an introduction which, besides presenting the content of the articles, discusses terminological fundamentals such as the understanding of the terms “clause”, “action” and “linkage” and “combining” in different grammatical traditions and the ways they are conceived of here, as well as open questions collectively formulated by the contributors in planning for the volume concerning the recognition, emergence and distance of linkage, and the ways these questions are addressed in the contributions to the volume. Topics treated in the articles include combining physical actions and <b>verbal</b> <b>announcements</b> in everyday conversation, linking of verbal and nonverbal actions as well as verbal linkages between nonverbal actions by dance teachers building pedagogical activity. Other topics concern the mediation of questions through informal translating in multilingual conversation in order to organize participation, and {{the ways in which}} student requests for clarification and confirmation create learning occasions in a foreign language classroom. Still other articles concern the on-line emergence of alternative questions with the Finnish particle vai ’or’, delayed completions of unfinished turns, the transforming of requests and offers into joint ventures, {{and the ways in which}} direct quotations are created in written journalism from the original talk in the spoken interview. Most of the papers employ Conversation Analysis and Interactional Linguistics as a theoretical framework. The languages used as data are Finnish, English, Estonian, French, Brazilian Portuguese and Swedish. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{notes the}} {{exceptional}} role {{and status of}} the television communication in the social life of modern personality, emphasizes its interactive option, and summarizes briefly but well-grounded about insufficient knowledge of television formats among linguists. Studies indicated the feasibility of small-format television texts, demonstrated the relevance and called the goal. The author identifies the main features of thematic and functional breadth, relevance and popularity of such a TV format, as a talk show. Given the recent trends {{in the development of}} television production, as well as taking into account the current linguistic research, the author describes the main principles of <b>verbal</b> formation of <b>announcement</b> texts of talk shows in the focus of their structure and functioning on the background of the television discourse. The article notes the dual nature of broadcasting due to social and personal orientation of television texts. The main emphasis of article are: dialogization that is realized through the question-answer complex and indirection to the audience; conversationality, which operates with economical use of vocabulary, a violation of the syntactic structure of speech, the use of words-parasites, introductory words, stylistically colored vocabulary, using vulgar expressions and slang; and intimization, which includes a direct appeal to the guests, quoting direct speech, conversational syntactic structures, the use of statements of solidarity and profanity. A detailed description and analysis of the principles of <b>verbal</b> organization of <b>announcement</b> texts and basic techniques open up new ways for further research and studies of small-format texts and create the preconditions for the theoretical and practical study of the specificity of television texts as a whole. ? ?????? ???????? ?????????????? ???? ? ?????? ????????????? ???????????? ? ???????????? ????? ???????????? ????????, ?????????? ?? ????????????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????, ?? ???????????? ???? ? ????????????? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ????? ??????????. ??????? ???????????????? ???????????? ????????????? ??????? ?????? ???????, ?????????????????? ???????????? ? ??????? ????. ???????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????? ????????????, ??????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ???????? ???????????? ??????? ??????? ???-???. ??????? ??????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????????? ?????-??????? ? ????? ????????? ? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????????

40|$|A {{few years}} back I was invited to attend a meeting called by the then {{director}} of the proposed Billy Graham Center for World Evangelism. The director {{had just returned from}} a similar meeting in Latin America where he had discussed the concept of evangelism with a number of Latin American theologians. It was apparent from his remarks that their concept and his were quite different. For one thing, they maintained that the communication of the gospel requires a concrete incarnate witness, not merely a <b>verbal</b> <b>announcement.</b> They also maintained that the proclamation of the gospel should be understood as a form of social action. Finally, they were laboring under the impression that discipleship should be conceived in an ethical context. It was clear from this director's remarks that these ideas were not only very different from his own, but that he believed them to be quite unacceptable.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Sponsorship identification statutes and regulations, overseen by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), require broadcasters to identify commercial content [...] usually an advertisement, an embedded advertisement, or a video news release [...] that has been broadcast in exchange for payment or other consideration. A written or <b>verbal</b> sponsorship <b>announcement</b> must be made at least once during any sponsored commercial content except when the sponsor is obvious. For content considered political or that discusses a controversial issue, broadcasters must follow all requirements for commercial content and additional requirements, such as identifying officials associated with the entity paying for an advertisement. In addition, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) enforces federal election law that requires all political communications for a federal election, including television and radio advertisements, to include a disclaimer statement. FEC also oversees requirements to report campaign funding and expenditures, including funding for political advertising. FCC has guidance that helps broadcasters determine when a sponsorship announcement is needed, such as when a deejay receives a payment for airing specific content. While broadcasters consider this guidance useful, it addresses older technology {{that in some cases}} is no longer used. Furthermore, some broadcasters indicated that it would be helpful for FCC to clarify how the guidance applies in some situations, such as when a video news release or product is used during programming. ...|$|R
40|$|Background to the {{academic}} research. Hilton College is an all boys private school in the Kwa-Zulu Natal Midlands. Since the beginning of 2012 boys have been permitted to carry their phones during the school day, (Thomson, 2012). Wireless internet access was also extended across the campus to allow boys and staff to bring their own devices to class and {{have access to the}} internet (Machlachlan, 2012). In the past, communication between staff and boys was either verbal or {{through the use of a}} daily notice, called the Daily Routine Order (DRO). The DRO is placed at the dining room tables each day and boys are expected to check for any notices that may pertain to them. These notices are emailed to a secretary who prints them out and places them in the dining room each day at lunch. 2. Objectives to the research. This research sought to establish whether current communication methods were effective or whether the prevalence of mobile phones and wireless devices had presented the school with a more effective method. It was important therefore, to investigate what devices were on campus, how those devices were used and when they were used. In addition to this, the research sought to establish communication preference among staff and boys. 3. Research Methodology. The research was conducted through the use of a qualitative survey that was conducted among both staff and boys. Staff and boys were surveyed to establish generation, device prevalence, device usage and device preference. This data was collected using an anonymous qualitative survey that was administered through the use of Google docs in the school labs. 187 Boys in 3 grades 8 and 9 participated in the survey along with 18 staff members. The data was then analysed and compared to data from similar research that had been conducted elsewhere in the world. Because of significant age differences between boys and staff it was critical to establish whether device usage among staff and boys was tied to their generation. Of particular interest were the device behaviours associated with the Millennial generation, who were born between 1982 - 2002 (Strauss 2005 : 10). This generational ‘benchmark’ allowed the researcher to compare the Hilton College cohort to those whose device behaviours and usage had occurred and been discussed in generational research elsewhere. It also allowed for certain assumptions to be made about staff and boys based on their generational profile. 4. Findings It was found that staff and boys exhibited communication traits that were consistent with their generation and consistent with other research in this field. It was also found that staff and boys preferred mobile and digital forms of communication over <b>verbal</b> <b>announcements</b> and the DRO system. For this reason, it was recommended that the Hilton College establish a system that took advantage of technology to improve on communication. Various recommendations were given by the researcher that took advantage of current technologies. These included the use of SMS, Instant Messaging, Social Networks and email. It was also recommended that the school consider prescribing devices that allow for communication between staff and boys...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} possible shifts of the sui-cide rate during the last 15 years in the Republic of Croatia (1985 - 2000), the distribution of male and female suicides accor-ding to age and some other characteristics according to sex in the 1990 - 2000 period, and the distribution of male and female suicides during the war and post-war period. Data were collected from the Suicide Registerof the Ministry of the Interior. According to the Register, 9987 suicides had been reported in 1990 - 2000. The suicide rotes in the last 15 years did not change as well as during the war and post-war period. The suicide rate was 19. 26. The highest suicide rate was in the 15 - 30 age group and in those older than 65 years. The women were on overage five years older than men. Hanging was the most frequent method of suieide (50 %). Men used firearms and explosives more often than wo-men. Medical problems were more often present among women than meni as opposed to alcoholism, which was more present among men. Almost 80 % of the victims had previously verbally announced suicide. Prevention efforts should be focused on 01 -coholism, drug abuse, family crisis, reduction of firearms and ex-plosives possession, and improvement of economic status among men, and toward previous suicide attempts, mental disorders and unemployment among women.
