It raises its legs, its body sways from side to side, and the palps are lowered below the chelicerae ("fangs"). This {{is very different from}} the stalking it uses when encountering another salticid of a different species, despite receiving the same <b>visual</b> <b>stimulus,</b> the sight of the other's large anterior-median eyes. Although P. fimbriata is influenced by pheromones much more than is usual among salticids, visual cues alone are enough to start displays and distinguish members of the same species from other salticids, even if neither partner moves. The spindly, fringed legs of Portia species may identify members of the same species, as well as concealing these spiders from other salticid species.|$|E

40|$|Coordinating spatial {{perception}} between body {{space and}} its external surrounding space {{is essential to}} adapt behaviors to objects, especially when they are noxious. Such coherent multisensory representation of the body extended into external space is conceptualized by the notion of peripersonal reference frame, mapping the portion of space in which somatic and extra-somatic inputs interact closely. Studies on crossmodal interactions between nociception and vision have been scarce. Here we investigated how the perception of <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli,</b> especially those surrounding the body, can be impacted by a nociceptive and potentially harmful stimulus inflicted on a particular body part. In two temporal order judgment tasks, participants judged which of two lateralized <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli,</b> presented either near or far from the body, had been presented first. <b>Visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> were preceded by nociceptive stimuli, either applied unilaterally (on one single hand) or bilaterally (on both hands simultaneously). In Experiment 1 participants' hands were always placed next to the <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> presented near the trunk, while in Experiment 2 they could also be placed next to the <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> presented far from the trunk. In Experiment 1, the presence of unilateral nociceptive stimuli prioritized the perception of <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> presented in {{the same side of}} space as the stimulated hand, with a significantly larger effect when <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> were presented near the body than when presented farther away. Experiment 2 showed that these visuospatial biases were related to the spatial congruency between the hand on which nociceptive stimuli were applied and the <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli,</b> independently of the relative distance of both the stimulated hand and the <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> from the trunk. Indeed, nociceptive stimuli mostly impacted the perception of the closest <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli.</b> It is hypothesized that these crossmodal interactions may rely on representations of the space directly surrounding specific body parts...|$|R
40|$|A fission {{illusion}} (also named a doubleâ€”flash illusion) is {{a famous}} phenomenon of audio-visual interaction, {{in which a}} single brief flash is perceived as two flashes when presented simultaneously with two brief beeps (Shames, Kamitani, & Shimojo, 2000; 2002). The fission illusion has been investigated using relatively simple <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> like single circle. Thus the illusion has not been examined by using complex <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Markovic & Gvozdenovic (2001) reported that the processing of complex <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> tends to be delayed. Therefore, the complexity of <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> may affect the occurrence rate of the fission illusion, since this illusion is generated in the process that copes with <b>visual</b> and auditory <b>stimuli</b> in a short time. The present study examined the differences in illusory occurrence rates by manipulating the complexity of <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli.</b> We used the patterns proposed by Garner & Clement (1963) to control the complexity. The results indicated {{that it was more}} difficult to induce the fission illusion by using complex <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> than it was by using simple stimuli. Thus, the present study suggested that the occurrence rate of the fission illusion differed depending on the perceptual efficiency in the coding process of <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli.</b> This study was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Specifically Promoted Research (No. 19001004) ...|$|R

40|$|People {{obtain a}} lot of {{information}} from visual and auditory sensation on daily life. Regarding the effect of <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> on perception of auditory stimuli, studies of phonological perception and sound localization have been made in great numbers. This study examined the effect of <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> on perception in loudness and pitch of auditory stimuli. We used the image of figures whose size or brightness was changed as <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli,</b> and the sound of pure tone whose loudness or pitch was changed as auditory <b>stimuli.</b> Those <b>visual</b> and auditory <b>stimuli</b> were combined independently to make four types of audio-visual multisensory stimuli for psychophysical experiments. In the experiments, participants judged change in loudness or pitch of auditory stimuli, while they judged the direction of size change or the kind of a presented figure in <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Therefore they cannot neglect <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> while they judged auditory stimuli. As a result, perception in loudness and pitch were promoted significantly around their difference limen, when the image was getting bigger or brighter, compared with the case in which the image had no changes. This indicates that perception in loudness and pitch were affected by change in size and brightness of <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{what effect}} visual spatial information had on auditory temporal order judgments (TOJs) and examined what effect <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> {{had on the}} TOJs of sequences of pure tones in experiment 1.

40|$|On a non-spatial task, {{individuals}} respond {{more slowly}} when the {{stimulus and response}} are on different sides of space versus {{the same side of}} space (the Simon effect). Past Simon effect studies have shown that <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> are represented based on external reference frames. In contrast, we have found that tactile stimuli in a Simon effect task are encoded based on a somatotopic reference frame (eg, stimuli presented to the left hand are always encoded as left regardless of the hand's location in space). In order to understand how <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> are represented on or near the body, we presented individuals with a visual Simon effect experiment. Using foot pedals, participants responded to <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> projected on, near, or far from the hands in three conditionsâ€”hands uncrossed, hand crossed, and no hands. In the no hands condition, <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> were encoded based on an external reference frame. However, we find that as with tactile <b>stimuli,</b> <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> presented on or near the hands (crossed condition) were encoded based on a somatotopic frame of reference. These novel results provide evidence that <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> on or near the hands can be encoded based on body representations...|$|R
25|$|More {{recent studies}} refine this early {{qualitative}} account of multisensory integration. Alais and Burr (2004), found that following progressive degradation {{in the quality}} of a <b>visual</b> <b>stimulus,</b> participants' perception of spatial location was determined progressively more by a simultaneous auditory cue. However, they also progressively changed the temporal uncertainty of the auditory cue; eventually concluding that it is the uncertainty of individual modalities that determine to what extent information from each modality is considered when forming a percept. This conclusion is similar in some respects to the 'inverse effectiveness rule'. The extent to which multisensory integration occurs may vary according to the ambiguity of the relevant stimuli. In support of this notion, a recent study shows that weak senses such as olfaction can even modulate the perception of visual information as long as the reliability of visual signals is adequately compromised.|$|E
25|$|Ventriloquism {{has been}} used as the {{evidence}} for the modality appropriateness hypothesis. Ventriloquism describes the situation in which auditory location perception is shifted toward a visual cue. The original study describing this phenomenon was conducted by Howard and Templeton, (1966) after which several studies have replicated and built upon the conclusions they reached. In conditions in which the visual cue is unambiguous, visual capture reliably occurs. Thus to test the influence of sound on perceived location, the <b>visual</b> <b>stimulus</b> must be progressively degraded. Furthermore, given that auditory stimuli are more attuned to temporal changes, recent studies have tested the ability of temporal characteristics to influence the spatial location of visual stimuli. Some types of EVP â€“ electronic voice phenomenon, mainly the ones using sound bubles are considered a kind of modern ventriloquism technique and is played by the use of sophisticated software, computers and sound equipment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of stimuli which {{were hard to}} verbalize, and unlikely {{to be held in}} long-term memory, revolutionized the study of VSTM in the early [...] 1970s (Cermak, 1971; Phillips, 1974; Phillips & Baddeley, 1971). The basic experimental technique used required observers to indicate whether two matrices (Phillips, 1974; Phillips & Baddeley, 1971), or figures (Cermak, 1971), separated by a short temporal interval, were the same. The finding that observers were able to report that a change had occurred, at levels significantly above chance, indicated {{that they were able to}} encode [...] aspect of the first stimulus in a purely visual store, at least for the period until the presentation of the second stimulus. However, as the stimuli used were complex, and the nature of the change relatively uncontrolled, these experiments left open various questions, such as: (1) whether only a subset of the perceptual dimensions comprising a <b>visual</b> <b>stimulus</b> are stored (e.g., spatial frequency, luminance, or contrast); (2) whether [...] perceptual dimensions are maintained in VSTM with greater fidelity than others; and (3) the nature by which these dimensions are encoded (i.e., are perceptual dimensions encoded within separate, parallel channels, or are all perceptual dimensions stored as a single bound entity within VSTM?).|$|E
2500|$|This {{technique}} allows several (e.g., four) SSEPs to {{be recorded}} simultaneously from any given location on the scalp. Different sites of stimulation or different stimuli can be tagged with slightly different frequencies that are virtually identical to the brain, but easily separated by Fourier series analyzers. For example, when two unpatterned lights are modulated at slightly different frequencies (F1 and F2) and superimposed, multiple nonlinear cross-modulation components of frequency (mF1 Â± [...] nF2) are created in the SSEP, where m and n are integers. These components allow nonlinear processing in the brain to be investigated. By frequency-tagging two superimposed gratings, spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties of the brain mechanisms that process spatial form can be isolated and studied. Stimuli of different sensory modalities can also be tagged. For example, a <b>visual</b> <b>stimulus</b> was flickered at Fv Hz and a simultaneously presented auditory tone was amplitude modulated at Fa Hz. The existence of a (2Fv + 2Fa) component in the evoked magnetic brain response demonstrated an audio-visual convergence area in the human brain, {{and the distribution of}} this response over the head allowed this brain area to be localized. More recently, frequency tagging has been extended from studies of sensory processing to studies of selective attention and of consciousness.|$|E

In our work, we focused on this network and investigated the intrinsic properties of low frequency (0. 01 â€“ 0. 08 Hz) fluctuations (LFFs) during changes of <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli.</b> There were two main questions to be discussed in this study: intrinsic properties of LFFs regarding (1) interactions between <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> and resting-state; (2) impact of repetition rate of <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed scanning sessions that contained rest and <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> in various repetition rates with a novel method.

In a temporal order judgment task, participants judged which of two <b>visual</b> <b>stimuli,</b> one applied to either side of space, had been perceived first. <b>Visual</b> <b>stimuli</b> were presented either near participantsâ€™ hands (peripersonal) or far from them (extrapersonal).

We found that visual detection sensitivity (d') for unimodal stimuli was higher for stimuli of longer duration. Crucially, in a cross-modal condition, we replicated previous unimodal findings, observing that visual sensitivity was shaped by the duration of co-occurring sounds.
