5|$|On September 6, E. coli was {{detected}} in the water supply. According to the CDC, five people died from bacterial infections caused by the toxic waters. The deaths {{appear to have been}} caused by <b>Vibrio</b> vulnificus bacteria, of the Cholera family.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence is the {{production}} and emission of light by a living organism. It {{is a form of}} chemiluminescence. Bioluminescence occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms including some bioluminescent bacteria and terrestrial invertebrates such as fireflies. In some animals, the light is bacteriogenic, produced by symbiotic organisms such as <b>Vibrio</b> bacteria; in others, it is autogenic, produced by the animals themselves.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is defined}} as {{vomiting}} or diarrhea due to infection of the small or large bowel. The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while {{the ones in the}} large bowel are inflammatory. The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for Cryptosporidium) to as many as 108 (for <b>Vibrio</b> cholerae).|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristic}} motility {{of cholera}} <b>vibrios,</b> as viewed through a dark-field microscope, and the adhesiveness of chicken cell-positive <b>vibrios</b> {{provide a means}} for rapidly identifying and biotyping cholera <b>vibrios.</b> Dilute suspensions of <b>vibrios,</b> such as one might find in a fresh rectal swab specimen from a cholera patient, when mixed with a 0. 25 % suspension of chicken erythrocytes in saline, {{can be used to}} biotype the cholera <b>vibrios</b> without prior isolation in pure culture. This is accomplished by using a dark-field microscope through which the chicken cell-positive cholera <b>vibrios</b> are observed to attach to the scattered erythrocytes and to propel them with a characteristic flipping motion...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of the two-chromosome configuration {{was investigated in}} 34 species of <b>vibrios</b> and closely related species. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of undigested genomic DNA suggested that <b>vibrios</b> commonly have two chromosomes. The size of the large chromosome is predominantly within a narrow range (3. 0 to 3. 3 Mb), whereas {{the size of the}} small chromosome varies considerably among the <b>vibrios</b> (0. 8 to 2. 4 Mb). This fact suggests that the structure of the small chromosome is more flexible than that of the large chromosome during the evolution of <b>vibrios...</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1905 at a quarantine {{camp on the}} Sinai Peninsula in El Tor, Egypt by a German physician, E. Gotschlich. The <b>vibrios</b> {{were found in the}} guts of six pilgrims returning from Mecca. Though the pilgrims failed to show ante or post mortem evidence of cholera, the <b>vibrios</b> isolated from the guts were agglutinable within the anti-cholera serum. Later in 1905, Kraus and Pribram found that the bacteria, which produced soluble hemolysin, were more related to non-cholera vibrios; therefore, referred to all hemolytic <b>vibrios</b> as El Tor <b>vibrios.</b> In the early 1930s, A. Shousha, A. Gardner and K. Venkatraman, all researchers, suggested that only hemolytic <b>vibrios</b> agglutinated with anti-cholera serum should be referred to as El Tor <b>vibrios.</b> In 1959, R. Pollitzer designated El Tor as its own species V. eltor separate from V. cholera, but six years later, in 1965, R. Hugh discovered that V. cholerae and V. eltor were similar in 30 positive and 20 negative characteristics. Thus, they were classified as a single species V. cholera: however, Hugh believed the differing features between the two could be of epidemiological importance, so El Tor <b>vibrios</b> were further classified as V. cholerae biotype eltor (serogroup O1).|$|R
5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by <b>Vibrio</b> cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus <b>Vibrio,</b> {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescent {{organisms are}} {{a target for}} many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic {{engineering}} as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging. For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants. <b>Vibrio</b> bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for bioluminescence. Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment.

40|$|The {{viability}} of El Tor <b>vibrios</b> was tested at various temperatures in foodstuffs, kitchen utensils, and water after these materials had been directly contaminated with stools of cholera patients or carriers from the Philippines, collected in 1963 - 64. The period of survival of <b>vibrios</b> in foodstuffs was 2 - 5 days {{at room temperature}} (30 °C- 32 °C) {{and as long as}} 9 days under refrigeration (5 °C- 10 °C). <b>Vibrios</b> survived even longer in refrigerated water.

40|$|In 1924 Sanarelli (1) {{reported}} that rabbits infected with cholera <b>vibrios</b> react to B. coli or B. proteus {{in a way}} entirely {{different from that of}} normal rabbits. In a study on the virulence of cholera <b>vibrios</b> Sanarelli observed that in every large group of rabbits a few would die from the injection of minute doses, much smaller than the dose lethal for most rabbits. The symptoms resembled anaphylactic shock. In order to explain the mechanism of this phenomenon, SanareUi studied the fate of cholera <b>vibrios</b> injected into the circulation. He found that the cholera <b>vibrios</b> disappeared from the blood stream within 2 days after their injection. But he also observed that in the rabbits which succumbed following the injection of sublethal doses, B. coll or proteus bacilli would invade the blood stream. Sanarelli now injected rabbits intravenously with minute doses of cholera <b>vibrios</b> and on the following day gave an intravenous injection of either cholera <b>vibrios</b> or of colon or proteus bacilli. Almost all of the rabbits died within from a few hours to 2 days after the second injection. The symptoms and pathological findings were the same for all three kinds of bacteria. Evidendy th...|$|R
5|$|In 1975 in the United States, {{a serious}} {{outbreak}} of oyster-vectored disease {{was caused by}} <b>Vibrio</b> vulnificus. Although the number of victims was low, the mortality rate was high at 50%. About 10 cases have occurred annually since then and further {{research needs to be}} done to establish the epidemiology of the infections. The cases peak in mid-summer and autumn with no cases being reported in mid winter so there may be a link between the temperature at which the oysters are held between harvesting and consumption. In 1978, an oyster-associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2,000 people occurred in Australia. The causative agent was found to be the Norwalk virus and the epidemic caused major economic difficulties to the oyster farming industry in the country. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams (Anadara subcrenata) took place in the Shanghai area of China. An estimated 290,000 people were infected and there were 47 deaths.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known {{for more than a century}} that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as <b>Vibrio</b> spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called <b>vibrio,</b> are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
40|$|Choleragenic <b>vibrios</b> {{adhered to}} and multiplied on monolayers {{of the highly}} {{differentiated}} mucin-secreting cell line HT 29 - 18 N 2. Their adherence followed first-order kinetics, was dependent on the concentration of <b>vibrios,</b> and was partially inhibited by lipopolysaccharide. Comparison of genetically modified <b>vibrios</b> showed that flagella, an active toxR gene, and the virulence cassette were not essential for initial binding. Inactivation of the hemagglutinin/protease increased binding. This highly differentiated human intestinal cell line provides a versatile new approach for studying major events occurring during intestinal colonization: adherence, multiplication, and detachment...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} the first broad study aiming at {{the reconstruction of}} the evolutionary history of <b>vibrios</b> by means of multilocus sequence analysis of nine genes. Overall, 14 distinct clades were recognized using the SplitsTree decomposition method. Some of these clades may correspond to families, e. g., the clades Salinivibrio and Photobacteria, while other clades, e. g., Splendidus and Harveyi, correspond to genera. The common ancestor of all <b>vibrios</b> was estimated to have been present 600 million years ago. We can define species of <b>vibrios</b> as groups of strains that share > 95 % gene sequence similarity and > 99. 4 % amino acid identity based on the eight protein-coding housekeeping genes. The gene sequence data were used to refine the standard online electronic taxonomic scheme for <b>vibrios</b> ([URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Bacteria {{belonging}} to the Vibrionaceae family are widespread in the marine environment. Today, 128 species of <b>vibrios</b> are known. Several of them are infamous for their pathogenicity or symbiotic relationships. Despite their ability to interact with eukaryotes, the <b>vibrios</b> are greatly underexplored {{for their ability to}} produce bioactive secondary metabolites and studies have been limited to only a few species. Most of the compounds isolated from <b>vibrios</b> so far are non-ribosomal peptides or hybrids thereof, with examples of N-containing compounds produced independent of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Though covering a limited chemical space, <b>vibrios</b> produce compounds with attractive biological activities, including antibacterial, anticancer, and antivirulence activities. This review highlights some of the most interesting structures from this group of bacteria. Many compounds found in <b>vibrios</b> have also been isolated from other distantly related bacteria. This cosmopolitan occurrence of metabolites indicates a high incidence of horizontal gene transfer, which raises interesting questions concerning the ecological function of some of these molecules. This account underlines the pending potential for exploring new bacterial sources of bioactive compounds and the challenges related to their investigation...|$|R
5|$|The {{diseases}} and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods {{are known to}} be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genusAggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate immune system, and the haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes {{play an important role in}} the recognition and elimination of foreign bodies and wound repair. Captive animals have been found to be more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones. A gram-negative bacterium, <b>Vibrio</b> lentus, has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of octopuses in extreme cases.|$|E
25|$|Spf is {{also highly}} conserved within the Vibrionaceae family, and was {{recently}} identified in all 76 available Vibrionaceae genomes (e.g., <b>Vibrio,</b> Aliivibrio, Photobacterium and Grimontia genera). In e.g., <b>Vibrio</b> cholerae, <b>Vibrio</b> vulnificus, Aliivibrio fischeri and Aliivibrio salmonicida the spf gene {{is flanked by}} polA (upstream) and a sRNA gene encoding the novel VSsRNA24 (downstream).|$|E
25|$|Oysters {{can contain}} harmful bacteria. Oysters are filter feeders, so will {{naturally}} concentrate anything {{present in the}} surrounding water. Oysters from the Gulf Coast of the United States, for example, contain high bacterial loads of human pathogens in the warm months, most notably <b>Vibrio</b> vulnificus and <b>Vibrio</b> parahaemolyticus. In these cases, the main danger is for immunocompromised individuals, {{who are unable to}} fight off infection and can succumb to septicemia, leading to death. <b>Vibrio</b> vulnificus is the most deadly seafood-borne pathogen.|$|E
40|$|Soon {{after its}} {{entry into the}} Indo-Pakistan subcontinent in 1964, cholera El Tor {{progressively}} replaced classical cholera. One of the probable reasons for this was found from laboratory studies of {{the interaction of the}} two choleragenic <b>vibrios,</b> V. cholerae and V. El Tor. It was observed, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, that in mixed culture El Tor <b>vibrios</b> from cholera cases are capable of outgrowing and rapidly eliminating V. cholerae. The apathogenic El Tor strains from the Middle East countries differed significantly from the pathogenic type of El Tor strains isolated from cholera cases in that the former did not inhibit the growth of V. cholerae strains. The possible mechanism of interaction of the pathogenic El Tor <b>vibrios</b> and V. cholerae was studied in detail. Various possibilities, including higher rates of multiplication of El Tor <b>vibrios,</b> competition for nutrients, secretion of inhibitory substances and liberation of lethal bacteriophage or vibriocins by El Tor <b>vibrios,</b> were examined. Although {{it was not possible to}} establish the actual mechanism of this interaction, the possible biological effect on the epidemiology of cholera was evident...|$|R
40|$|<b>Vibrios</b> are {{associated}} with a broad diversity of hosts that produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as part of their defense against microbial infections. In particular, <b>vibrios</b> colonize epithelia, which function as protective barriers and express AMPs as a first line of chemical defense against pathogens. Recent studies have shown they can also colonize phagocytes, key components of the animal immune system. Phagocytes infiltrate infected tissues and use AMPs to kill the phagocytosed microorganisms intracellularly, or deliver their antimicrobial content extracellularly to circumvent tissue infection. We review here the mechanisms by which <b>vibrios</b> have evolved the capacity to evade or resist the potent antimicrobial defenses of the immune cells or tissues they colonize. Among their strategies to resist killing by AMPs, primarily <b>vibrios</b> use membrane remodeling mechanisms. In particular, some highly resistant strains substitute hexaacylated Lipid A with a diglycine residue to reduce their negative surface charge, thereby lowering their electrostatic interactions with cationic AMPs. As a response to envelope stress, which can be induced by membrane-active agents including AMPs, <b>vibrios</b> also release outer membrane vesicles to create a protective membranous shield that traps extracellular AMPs and prevents interaction of the peptides with their own membranes. Finally, once AMPs have breached the bacterial membrane barriers, <b>vibrios</b> use RND efflux pumps, similar to those of other species, to transport AMPs out of their cytoplasmic space...|$|R

40|$|Various Sephadex G- 15 {{fractions}} of pepsin-digested mucosal extract inhibited the in vitro association of cholera <b>vibrios</b> with mucosal slices. Inhibitory activity paralleled the taxin {{activity of the}} fractions for these bacteria. This supports the theory that inhibition of mucosal association by pepsin-digested mucosal scrapings {{was due to the}} blocking of taxin receptors on the bacterial surface. Nonchemotactic mutants were significantly less efficient than the chemotactic parent or revertant strains in associating with mucosal slices in vitro. Control experiments in which filter paper disks replaced the mucosal slices showed a comparable extent of association of chemotactic and nonchemotactic <b>vibrios</b> with this material. Histological studies indicated that <b>vibrios</b> associated predominantly with the mucus gel of the intestinal slices rather than with the mucosal epithelium or the serosal surface. Intestinal slices attracted chemotactic <b>vibrios</b> even after prolonged washing, suggesting continuous production of the taxin by the tissue. Inert polystyrene particles 1. 1 micrometers in diameter penetrated the mucus gel of intestinal slices very poorly, but nevertheless could be detected in low numbers in the deep intervillous spaces within 15 min. In contrast, chemotactic <b>vibrios</b> reached the deep intervillous spaces in significantly higher numbers, whereas motile, non-chemotactic <b>vibrios</b> reacted like the inert particles. It is concluded that mucus gel represents a partial barrier to the penetration of particles of bacterial size and that this barrier can be invaded efficiently by motile bacteria, but only when their locomotion is guided by chemotactic stimuli...|$|R

The anterior portion of the jejunum is the primary locus of infection but in more chronic cases practically the whole small intestine may be involved. <b>Vibrios</b> were cultivated from the inflamed intestinal mucosa in both the acute and more chronic spontaneous cases. <b>Vibrios</b> were also obtained from the acutely involved intestine of young calves experimentally exposed to natural infection. On three occasions similar <b>vibrios</b> were found in cultures from the liver. When a single strain of <b>vibrios</b> which had been under cultivation for 3 months was fed to a young calf subclinical infection was produced and the organism recovered.
