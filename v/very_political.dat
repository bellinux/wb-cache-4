25|$|The strike—probably {{the first}} workers' protest since 1958, with the {{exception}} of a September 1972 strike in the Jiu Valley—began not as an anti-Communist or even an anti-Ceaușescu movement but rather a socio-economic one in spontaneous reaction to the new pensions law, as confirmed by the miners’ inexperience, which led them to improvisation and hasty decision-making. However, once the Communist leaders were sequestered, it moved in a political direction and, given the repression that followed, was interpreted as such by the authorities. At the same time, the strike did have an intrinsically political character in the sense that the miners—thought of as essential components of the Communist working class—revolted against their ideological bosses and conditions created by the <b>very</b> <b>political</b> system that used them as part of its labour force. So while collective and unpremeditated, the protest challenged the Communist leadership of the day and ultimately the regime itself.|$|E

In 2008, she also served as the executive of Las juventudes del PAR. In this role, she served {{as the president of the}} ninth Rolde Choben Congress. She ventured back into politics on a symbolic level in 2011 when she was on the ballot for PAR as a member of the Congress of Deputies. She has also served as the CEO of Care Dependence on the Government of Aragon.|$|E
25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a <b>very</b> <b>political</b> direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

Very quirky, very opinionated, <b>very</b> <b>political,</b> very clever, very articulate." [...] Manning's interest in computers continued, and in 2003, she and a friend, James Kirkpatrick, set up an online message board, angeldyne.com, that offered games and music downloads.|$|E
500|$|She {{started to}} work with Mirwais Ahmadzaï {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} developed her eighth album Music (2000). However, that collaboration did not suit Madonna's musical direction. According to Madonna, [...] " [...] Mirwais is also <b>very</b> <b>political,</b> seriously cerebral and intellectual. All we did was sit around, talking politics all the time. So, that couldn't help but find its way into the music. I think there's an angry aspect to the music that directly reflects my feelings at the time." [...] Hence after recording tracks with Mirwais, Madonna decided to stop the project and start fresh. It was then that she turned to Stuart Price who had served as musical director on her two previous concert tours and co-wrote one song on American Life.|$|E

500|$|In {{a similar}} vein Genesis FM founded in 1985 (broadcasting briefly, mainly playing music). Genesis FM re-launched {{properly}} in 1991 and in latter years it began broadcasting 24 hours with various talk and information shows, often extremely politically engaging. One of the founder members of Genesis FM is also {{the founder of the}} legendary Reggae Sound System Saxon Sound. The station suffered constant attacks by the authorities, but was still regularly on the FM. In 2005 Genesis FM {{was one of the first}} pirate stations to go on the internet and became less consistent and unreliable on the FM, sometimes going months without being on the FM. Genesis FM often used the slogan 'Black power station' and 'the people's station'. Like Galaxy FM, many of the talk shows on Genesis FM are <b>very</b> <b>political</b> and controversial discussions are dealt with. [...] In 2010, Lewisham Lib Dem Councillor Duwayne Brooks, who was present when his friend Stephen Lawrence was killed by racists in 1993 urged the police to engage with unlicensed stations such as Genesis FM to help bring community cohesion and crack down on hard crime. Duwayne Brooks also mentioned growing up listening to Genesis FM and described the station as a tool for people to have a platform to speak, where otherwise their voices are silenced or excluded.|$|E

2500|$|While at KFVD, Guthrie met {{newscaster}} Ed Robbin. Robbin {{was impressed}} with a song Guthrie wrote about political activist Thomas Mooney, believed {{by many to be}} wrongly convicted in a case that was a [...] of the time. Robbin, who became Guthrie's political mentor, introduced Guthrie to socialists and Communists in Southern California, including Will Geer (who, in turn, introduced Guthrie to John Steinbeck). Robbin remained Guthrie's lifelong friend, and helped Guthrie book benefit performances in the Communist circles in Southern California. Notwithstanding Guthrie's later claim that [...] "the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party", he was never a member of the party. He was noted as a fellow traveler—an outsider who agreed with the platform of the party while not subject to party discipline. Guthrie wrote a column for the Communist newspaper, People's World. The column, titled [...] "Woody Sez", appeared a total of 174times from May 1939 to January 1940. [...] "Woody Sez" [...] was not explicitly political, but was about current events as observed by Guthrie. He wrote the columns in an exaggerated hillbilly dialect and usually included a small comic; they were published as a collection after Guthrie's death. Steve Earle said of Guthrie, [...] "I don't think of Woody Guthrie as a political writer. He was a writer who lived in <b>very</b> <b>political</b> times." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nietzsche often {{referred}} to the common people who participated in mass movements and shared a common mass psychology as [...] "the rabble", or [...] "the herd". He allegedly valued individualism above all else, although this has been considered by many philosophers to be an oversimplification, as Nietzsche criticized {{the concept of the}} subject and of atomism (that is, the existence of an atomic subject at the foundation of everything, found for example in social contract theories). He considered the individual subject as a complex of instincts and wills-to-power, just as any other organization. Beginning in the 1890s some scholars have attempted to link his philosophy with Max Stirner's radical individualism of The Ego and Its Own (1844). The question remained pendant. Recently there was unearthed further, still circumstantial, evidence clarifying the relationship between Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner. In any case, few philosophers really consider Nietzsche an [...] "individualist" [...] thinker. He is best characterized as a thinker of [...] "hierarchy", although the precise nature of this hierarchy does not cover the current social order (the [...] "establishment") and is related to his thought of the Will to Power. Against the strictly [...] "egoist" [...] perspective adopted by Stirner, Nietzsche concerned himself with the [...] "problem of the civilization" [...] and the necessity to give humanity a goal and a direction to its history, making him, in this sense, a <b>very</b> <b>political</b> thinker.|$|E

6000|$|... "Although man deprives {{himself in}} the civil state of many {{advantages}} which he holds from nature, yet he acquires in return others so great, his faculties exercise and develop themselves, his ideas extend, his sentiments are ennobled, his whole soul is raised to such a degree, that if the abuses of this new condition did not so often degrade him below that from which he has emerged, he would be bound to bless without ceasing the happy moment which rescued him from it for ever, {{and out of a}} stupid and blind animal made an intelligent being and a man."[176] The little parenthesis as to the frequent degradation produced by the abuses of the social condition, does not prevent us from recognising in the whole passage a tolerably complete surrender of the main position which was taken up in the two Discourses. The short treatise on the Social Contract is an inquiry into the just foundations and most proper form of that <b>very</b> <b>political</b> society, which the Discourses showed to have its foundation in injustice, and to be incapable of receiving any form proper for the attainment of the full measure of human happiness.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} the Council met upon the adjournment. Then Mr. Hastings proposed, as a compromise, a {{division}} of the object in question. One half was to be surrendered to the authority of the Court of Directors, the other was reserved for his dignity. But the choice he made of his own share in this partition is very worthy of notice. He had taken his sole ground of objection against Mr. Bristow on the supposed ill effect that such an appointment would have on the minds of the Indian powers. He said, [...] "that these powers could have no dependence on his fulfilling his engagements, or maintaining the faith of treaties which he might offer for their acceptance, if they saw him treated with such contempt." [...] Mr. Bristow's appearing in a political character was the whole of his complaint; yet, when he comes to a voluntary distribution of the duties of the office, he gives Mr. Bristow those <b>very</b> <b>political</b> negotiations of which but the day before he had in such strong terms declared him personally incapable, whose appointment he considered to be fatal to those negotiations, and which he then spoke of as a measure in itself such as the bitterest adversary to Great Britain would have proposed. But having thus yielded his whole ground of ostensible objection, he reserved to his own appointment the entire management of the pecuniary trust. Accordingly he named Mr. Bristow for the former, and Mr. Middleton for the latter. On his own principles he ought to have done the very reverse. On every justifiable principle he ought to have done so; for a servant who for a long time resists the orders of his masters, and when he reluctantly gives way obeys them by halves, ought to be remarkably careful to make his actions correspond with his words, and to put himself out of all suspicion with regard to the purity of his motives. It was possible that the political reasons, which were solely assigned against Mr. Bristow's appointment, might have been the real motives of Mr. Hastings's opposition. But these he totally abandons, and holds fast to the pecuniary department. Now, as it is notorious that most of the abuses of India grow out of money-dealing, it was peculiarly unfit for a servant, delicate with regard to his reputation, to require a personal and confidential agent in a situation merely official, in which secrecy and personal connections could be of no possible use, and could only serve to excite distrust. Matters of account cannot be made too public; and it is not the most confidential agent, but the most responsible, who is the fittest for the management of pecuniary trusts. That man was the fittest at once to do the duty, and to remove all suspicions from the Governor-General's character, whom, by not being of his appointment, he could not be supposed to favor for private purposes, who must naturally stand in awe of his inspection, and whose misconduct could not possibly be imputable to him. Such an agency in a pecuniary trust was the very last on which Mr. Hastings ought to have risked his disobedience to the orders of the Direction,--or, what is even worse for his motives, a direct contradiction to all the principles upon which he had attempted to justify that bold measure.|$|E
