5|$|The {{dissolved}} oxygen levels in Hull Creek ranged from 30.80 to 249.02 percent, {{with an average}} of 115.69 percent. The average value was within the ideal range, but the minimum and maximum <b>values</b> <b>were</b> not. The concentration of salinity in the creek ranges from 70.95 to 310.00 parts per million, with an average concentration of 136.37 parts per million. All <b>values</b> <b>were</b> within the ideal range.|$|E
30|$|In the Swedish {{analysis}} set, for the “mild” health state, {{the mean}} VAS <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 71.1 {{and the mean}} TTO <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 0.76. For the “moderate” health state the mean VAS <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 53.9 and the mean TTO <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 0.71 and for the “severe” health state, the mean VAS <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 43.0 and the mean TTO <b>value</b> <b>was</b> 0.58 (Table 3).|$|R

5|$|Critchlow {{was also}} commended for the risky {{decision}} to write, draw and publish the comic himself. The comic was compared favourably with professional quality comics, with {{its lack of}} adverts viewed as an advantage over those offerings. The high production <b>values</b> <b>were</b> also praised, with the glossy cover and high quality paper used for the inner pages.|$|E
5|$|In January 2004, the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) {{released}} {{their first}} prediction for tropical cyclone activity throughout the Northeast Pacific. Based on a Neutral El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), {{a total of}} 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes was forecast. These <b>values</b> <b>were</b> slightly altered in May to 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes, and again in August to 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the new <b>values</b> <b>were</b> still {{higher than}} the levels that Vespasian and Titus had {{maintained}} during their reigns. Domitian's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years. Coinage from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to Domitian's titulature and refined artwork on the reverse portraits.|$|E

5|$|Submarine escape {{training}} led US Navy {{personnel to}} believe that Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios for fast tissues were unnecessarily conservative, as calculated values indicated that supersaturation in trainees exceeded Haldane's limits, {{but they did not}} develop DCS. A large number (2143) of experimental dives were conducted over 3 years to derive allowable supersaturation ratios for a Haldanian 5 compartment model with compartment half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Values for critical supersaturation derived from this experimental work were different for each tissue compartment. Values for slow tissues (75 and 40-minute) were close to Haldane's findings, but considerably higher <b>values</b> <b>were</b> found for the fast tissues. These <b>values</b> <b>were</b> so high that the researchers concluded that the 5- and 10-minute tissues were not relevant to the development of DCS. Based on these conclusions, a set of tables was computed which omitted the 5- and 10-minute tissues.|$|E
5|$|The PADI tables {{known as}} the PADI Recreational Dive Planner (RDP) were {{developed}} by Raymond Rogers and tested by DSAT (Diving Science And Technology, an affiliate of PADI Inc.). The M <b>values</b> <b>were</b> derived from Spencer's no-stop limits and the repetitive group designators {{were based on a}} 60-minute tissue compartment. This combination resulted in more conservative first dives, but less conservative repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|The {{discharge}} of Nanticoke Creek downstream of the Truesdale Mine Discharge ranges from 0.019 to 40 {{cubic feet per}} second, {{with a mean of}} 6.3 cubic feet per second. The {{discharge of}} the creek at its mouth was measured to be 3.8 cubic feet per second in June 1999 and 8.2 cubic feet per second in October 1999. Both <b>values</b> <b>were</b> significantly lower than those of the nearby Newport Creek.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} {{step in the}} process of acceptance back into the Olympic Movement was achieved at a ceremony held in Cardiff in November 1994, when the IRB was officially confirmed as a Recognised International Federation of the IOC. At that ceremony, International Olympic Committee President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, pointed out that rugby's history and <b>values</b> <b>were</b> very much in tune with the Olympic philosophy and traditions. This historic meeting in Cardiff led to IRB representation at annual IOC meetings and consideration for inclusion in the programme of future Olympic Games. In 2002, a plan was presented to induct rugby sevens, golf and the Chinese martial art of wushu.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} system moved eastward toward the Ohio, Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on April 27, a very {{powerful}} 80–100 knot mid-level jet stream moved into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, behind the trough, creating strong wind shear, with a low pressure center moving quickly northeastward across those areas on the 27th. On the afternoon of April 27, CAPE <b>values</b> <b>were</b> estimated {{to be in the}} range of 2000–3000 J/kg across Louisiana and southern Mississippi, with the moderate instability moving northeastward across the southern Tennessee Valley; in addition, temperatures across the southeastern United States ranged from the 70s°F (mid-20s°C) to the lower 90s°F (near 35°C). Helicity levels ranged from 450–600 m2/s2, which were supportive for significant tornadic activity and strong to violent long-track tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Between 1982 and 1988 {{a series}} based on Irish {{architecture}} {{through the ages}} was released, with line drawings by Michael Craig and graphics by Peter Wildbur. It contained twenty-eight stamps, with values ranging from 1p to £5. Stamps based on Irish cultural heritage followed between 1990 and 1995. Irish birds feature in the 1997 series that span the conversion of currency from the Irish pound, through dual currency {{to the introduction of}} the Euro. These were the first definitives where all <b>values</b> <b>were</b> printed in full colour. On 9 September 2004 new stamps, featuring flowers native to the woodlands and hedgerows of Ireland, become available. These were replaced in September 2010 by a seventh series featuring animals and marine life using photographic images.|$|E

5|$|By early afternoon, the {{low-pressure}} {{area had}} moved east into Nebraska, while the warm front had moved northward into southern Minnesota. The atmosphere {{to the south}} of the warm front was strongly capped, meaning that the best chance of thunderstorm development was in areas along and slightly north of the front. By the time the thunderstorms started developing, CAPE <b>values</b> <b>were</b> 2000J/kg, indicating moderate atmospheric instability. Also present were low-level and deep-layer wind shear values of , respectively. All of these factors combined to create very favorable conditions for the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Póvoa de Varzim {{is driven by}} tourism, manufacturing, construction, fishing, and agribusiness. In 2016, the {{unemployment}} rate, at 10.16%, was high and compares with the national average at 10.2%. However, {{it is one of}} the lowest rates in Greater Porto, which peaks in Vila Nova de Gaia (16.34%) and Porto proper (17.26%) Póvoa de Varzim's purchasing power represented 0.6% of the total national purchasing power in 2013, up from 0.5% in 1993. However, per capita <b>values</b> <b>were</b> just 94.9% of the national average in 2015, up from 93.1% in 2013..|$|E
5|$|The first twelve stamps, the low {{values up to}} 1 shilling, {{were issued}} during 1922–1923, while the three high values, 2/6, 5/- and 10/-, did not appear until 8 September 1937. Designs included: Sword of Light, Map of Ireland, Celtic Cross, Arms of the Four Provinces and St. Patrick. Watermark and extra <b>values</b> <b>were</b> made until new designs, known as the Gerl definitives, using early Irish art motifs, were {{produced}} in 1968. These were the first new designs in 31 years for the high values and 46 years for the low values. The Gerl series was denominated initially in pre-decimal Irish pounds and later in decimal currency (both watermarked issues). It latterly appeared as unwatermarked stamps.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{was caused}} by a vigorous upper-level trough that moved into the Southern Plains states on April 25. An extratropical cyclone developed ahead of this upper-level trough between northeastern Oklahoma and western Missouri, which moved northeast. Conditions were similar on April 26, with a predicted likelihood of severe thunderstorms, including an extended threat of strong to violent long-track tornadoes during the afternoon and evening hours; mixed-layer CAPE <b>values</b> <b>were</b> forecast to be around 3000–4000 J/kg, around east Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. The storm mode on April 26 was predicted to consist of mostly discrete supercells during the afternoon and early evening, shifting over to a mesoscale convective complex, with more of a threat of damaging winds and hail during the nighttime hours.|$|E
5|$|With the win by Shelley of Team TNA, {{the point}} standings for the teams were Team TNA with six, Team Mexico with three, Team Japan with two, and Team International with two {{going into the}} final round. However, TNA stated that Team International and Team Japan also gained points in the match for {{eliminating}} competitors, so by TNA statistics the point <b>values</b> <b>were</b> Team TNA with six, Team Mexico with three, Team Japan with four, and Team International with three heading into the final round.|$|E

30|$|Proposed {{indices are}} {{relative}} to the singularity. When the JTI <b>value</b> <b>is</b> zero, the BTI value of the joint located branch is zero, and the reverse singularity occurs. On the other side, when the ETI <b>value</b> <b>is</b> zero, the forward singularity appears. Thus, if either BTI or ETI <b>values</b> <b>is</b> zero, the parallel mechanism is at its singular pose. If both BTI and ETI <b>values</b> <b>are</b> zero, the duplex singularity happens.|$|R
