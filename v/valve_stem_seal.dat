50|$|The '3E' and '3E-E' {{engines are}} {{considered}} slightly less reliable than other Toyota engines, {{although they are}} also among the easiest engines to service. The most common problems affecting these engines are premature <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seal</b> (nitrile) failure, carbon buildup on the intake valves, and collapse of the oil control ring on the piston. Any of these conditions can lead to rough idling, stalling, and fouled spark plugs, and therefore need to be differentially diagnosed. The valve stem seals, at least, can be replaced with silicone or viton-based seals which last much longer.|$|E
40|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seal</b> leakage is a {{major source}} of {{fugitive}} emissions, and controlling these emissions can result in added expense in leak detection and repair programs. Elastomeric O-rings can be used as valve stem seals, and O-ring manufacturers recommend lubrication of elastomeric seals to prevent damage and to assure proper sealing. In this research, a metallic coating was applied as a lubricant using a vacuum vapor deposition process to the surface of elastomeric valve stem seals. Valve stem leak measurements were taken to determine if the coated O-rings, alone or with the recommended lubrication, reduced <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seal</b> leakage. This research determined that the metallic coating did not reduce valve stem leakage...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seal</b> (VSS) {{is directly related}} to its ability to deliver the correct rate of lubrication. Too little lubrication may result in valve stem wear; too much may result in ‘burnt’ valves and seats. The correct operational envelope will therefore depend upon an engineer's ability to predict how parameters such as seal geometry and material properties change {{over the life of the}} seal. This paper discusses the use of accumulative leakage measurements to study the life performance of a VSS as changes are made to ‘key’ design sealing features. A standard design VSS is used for ‘normal’ leakage bench marking. The results are to be used in the development of predictive leakage models that use both close scrutiny leakage testing and continued lubrication theory development...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{simulation}} of oil leakage through a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seal</b> involves complex fluid-structure interaction between a moving valve stem (rigid body), oil and deformable seal (flexible body). In the simulation {{we used a}} full 3 D model of a seal and considered a two-way fluid-structure coupling between the seal (structure) and oil (fluid). The seal deformation is modeled with Abaqus-explicit and oil leakage with FlowVision (finite volume based CFD code). The calculation domain is descretized by a volume Cartesian grid with dynamic local adaptation and uses a Euler grid approach for {{simulation of}} the moving boundary. At each physical time step the simulation domain is re-meshed and loads are exchanged between Abaqus and FlowVision(FV). Pressure values calculated by FV are transferred to Abaqus-explicit to calculate the resulting seal deformation. The data is automatically exchanged using Capvidia’s Multi-Physics-Manager (MPM). The MPM links FV with Abaqus and transfers data via Abaqus user-subroutines. The approach described above allows us to perform {{detailed analysis of the}} oil leakage through a valve stem for various engine loads and operational conditions. The oil seal shape and material can be optimized to minimize the oil leakage...|$|E
50|$|Radial shaft seals, {{also known}} as lip seals, are used to seal rotary elements, such as a shaft or {{rotating}} bore. Common examples include strut seals, hydraulic pump seals, axle seals, power steering <b>seals,</b> and <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals.</b> Early radial shaft seals utilized rawhide as the sealing element, and many elastomeric seal companies today once were tanneries. The advent of modern elastomers replaced rawhide, industry also added a garter spring which helps the sealing lip compensate for lip wear and elastomer material changes.|$|R
40|$|Detailed exhaust {{emission}} data {{have been taken}} from a Cummins N- 14 single cylinder research engine in which the oil consumption was varied by different engine modifications. Low sulfur fuel was used, and oil consumption was varied by modifying the intake <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals,</b> the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals,</b> the oil control ring and combinations of these modifications. Detailed measurements of exhaust gas particle size distributions and chemical composition were made for the various oil consumption configurations {{for a range of}} engine loads and speeds. The particulate mass was measured with TEOM and traditional gravimetric filter methods. Filter data for EC/OC, sulfates and trace metals have been taken and analyzed. The trace metals in the particulate mass {{serve as the basis for}} assessing oil consumption at the different operating conditions. The data indicate that the oil consumption for the steady state testing done here was approximately an order of magnitude below oil consumption values cited in the literature. We did measure changes in the details of the chemical composition of the particulate for the different engine operating conditions, but it did not correlate with changes in the oil consumption. Furthermore, the data indicate that the particle size distribution is not strongly impacted by low level oil consumption variations observed in this work...|$|R
50|$|Chevrolet added a coolant {{overflow}} {{bottle and}} an electronic low-coolant indicator in 1974 {{that could be}} retrofitted to earlier models at no cost. Under a revised 50000 mi engine warranty for 1971 to 1975 Vegas, {{the owner of a}} damaged engine could choose replacement with a new short block or a rebuilt steel-sleeved unit, which proved costly for Chevrolet. GM engineer Fred Kneisler maintains that too much emphasis had been put on overheating problems, the real culprits being brittle <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals</b> and too-thin piston plating. Regardless of the cause, damaged cylinder walls were common.|$|R
50|$|Serious {{problems}} with the engine led to a redesign for 1976-1977. Marketed as the Dura-Built 140, the new engine had improved coolant pathways, redesigned cylinder head with quieter hydraulic valve lifters, longer-life <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals</b> that reduced oil consumption by 50%, and redesigned water pump, head gasket, and thermostat. Warranty was upgraded to five years or 60000 mi. In 1977 a pulse-air system was added to meet stricter 1977 U.S. exhaust emission regulations and the engine paint color (used on all Chevrolet engines) changed from orange to blue.|$|R
5000|$|A semi-closed deck structure, an {{integrated}} ladder frame and four-bolt {{main bearing caps}} contribute to engine strength, durability, and lower NVH levels. Unlike the 4G63, the 4B11T does not use a balancer shaft. The semi-floating pistons of the 4G63 have been replaced with fully floating pistons for the 4B11T. Aluminium is also used for the timing chain case and cylinder head cover. The engine features an electronically controlled throttle, an isometric short port aluminium intake manifold, and the stainless steel exhaust manifold is positioned {{at the rear of}} the engine. The use of a direct-acting valvetrain eliminates the need of the roller rocker arm configuration previously used in the 4G63.

50|$|As {{valve guides}} wear, {{their ability to}} {{positively}} locate the valve to the valve seat decreases. As the valves lose their ability to seal the combustion chamber properly, the engine can lose performance and start to burn oil, leaking {{from the top of}} the cylinder head into the intake and exhaust manifolds. Modern engines are fitted with <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> oil <b>seals</b> which can be replaced if oil leakage occurs.|$|R
50|$|A {{multi-valve}} engine design typically has three, four, or five valves per cylinder to achieve improved performance. Any four-stroke {{internal combustion engine}} needs at least two valves per cylinder: one for intake of air and fuel, and another for exhaust of combustion gases. Adding more valves increases valve area and improves the flow of intake and exhaust gases, thereby enhancing combustion, volumetric efficiency, and power output. Multi-valve geometry allows the spark plug to be ideally located within the combustion chamber for optimal flame propagation. Multi-valve engines tend to have smaller valves that have lower reciprocating mass, which can reduce wear on each cam lobe, and allow more power from higher RPM without the danger of valve bounce. Some engines are designed to open each intake valve at a slightly different time, which increases turbulence, improving the mixing of air and fuel at low engine speeds. More valves also provide additional cooling to the cylinder head. The disadvantages of {{multi-valve engine}}s are an increase in manufacturing cost and a potential increase in oil consumption due to the greater number of <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals.</b> Some SOHC multi-valve engines (such as the Mazda B8-ME) use a single fork-shaped rocker arm to drive two valves (generally the exhaust valves) so that fewer cam lobes will be {{needed in order to}} reduce manufacturing costs.|$|R

40|$|Testing {{was carried}} out on a Cummins N 14 single-cylinder {{heavy-duty}} D. I. diesel research engine with a full dilution tunnel system to quantify lubricating oil consumption (LOC) rates and determine any effects of changes in LOC rates on the particulate matter. Varying oil consumption rates and their effect on particulates were analyzed at selected operation conditions of the CARB 8 -mode test cycle. The three steady-state engine operating conditions tested were mode 4 (1200 RPM, 25 % load), mode 5 (1200 RPM, 100 % load), and mode 1 (1800 RPM, 100 % load). Several engine alterations, consistent with the literature, for changing LOC rates were applied. The alterations consisted of installing an oil control ring with a unit pressure 50 % less than the standard value, removing the intake <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals</b> (VSS), removing the exhaust VSS, and removing all (intake and exhaust) VSS. Each of these alterations was tested individually to avoid causing interacting effects. LOC rates were successfully quantified by measuring the calcium concentration in the exhaust particulates. For the engine operating conditions tested, no major differences in detailed PM characteristics for changes in LOC rates were found except for organic carbon emissions at mode 5. In addition, very small changes in the particle size distribution for the lower unit pressure oil control ring were observed for modes 5 and 1 in the size range of 150 to 250 nanometers...|$|R

Since it has the highest compressive strength, 58 ksi, of any available, unfilled resin and other mechanical properties such as a tensile strength of 23 ksi, a flexural strength of 32 ksi, a ductile compressive failure mode and the relatively low density of 1.3 g/cm3. [...] Moreover, its thermal and electrical properties also make it a well known thermoplastic resin. The PBI resin comprises a recurring structural unit represented by the following figure.According to the Composite Materials Research Group at the University of Wyoming, PBI resin parts maintain significant tensile properties and compressive strength to 700 F. PBI resin parts are also potential materials for the chemical process and oil recovery industries which have demands of thermal stability and chemical resistance. In these areas, PBI resin has been successfully applied in demanding sealing, for instance, <b>valve</b> seats, <b>stem</b> <b>seals,</b> hydraulic seals and backup rings. In the aerospace industry, PBI resin has high strength and short term high temperature resistance advantages. In the industrial sector, PBI resin's high dimensional stability as well as retention of electrical properties at high temperature make it used as a thermal and electrical insulator.|$|R
40|$|A {{potential}} source of fission product leakage following a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) is the leakage of water from engineered safety features (ESF) equipment which is located outside the primary containment.
