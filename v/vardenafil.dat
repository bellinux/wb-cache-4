5|$|Oral {{medications}} and mechanical devices {{are the first}} choice in treatment because they are less invasive, are often effective, and are well tolerated. Oral medications include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and <b>vardenafil</b> (Levitra).|$|E
25|$|<b>Vardenafil,</b> as {{with all}} PDE5 inhibitors, {{should not be used}} by people taking nitrate medications, because {{combining}} them with <b>vardenafil</b> might provoke potentially life-threatening hypotension (low blood pressure).|$|E
25|$|One {{possibly}} serious, but rare, {{side effect}} with <b>vardenafil</b> is heart attack. Also, in rare cases, <b>vardenafil</b> use may cause priapism, {{a very painful}} emergency condition that can cause impotence if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|Vardenafil's {{indications}} and contraindications are {{the same}} as with other PDE5 inhibitors; it is closely related in function to sildenafil citrate (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis). The difference between the <b>vardenafil</b> molecule and sildenafil citrate is a nitrogen atom's position and the change of sildenafil's piperazine ring methyl group to an ethyl group. Tadalafil is structurally different from both sildenafil and <b>vardenafil.</b> Vardenafil's relatively short effective time is comparable to but somewhat longer than sildenafil's.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vardenafil</b> is also {{available}} under the name Staxyn as a tablet which dissolves on the tongue rather than being swallowed {{in the form of}} a pill.|$|E
25|$|Beyond its {{indications}} for erectile dysfunction, <b>vardenafil</b> may {{be effective}} {{in the treatment of}} premature ejaculation, where it may significantly increase the time from penetration to ejaculation.|$|E
25|$|Further, <b>vardenafil</b> causes {{lengthening}} of the QT interval. Therefore, {{it should}} not be taken by people taking other medications that affect the QT interval (such as amiodarone).|$|E
25|$|GTN {{also can}} cause severe hypotension, circulatory collapse, and death if used {{together}} with vasodilator {{drugs that are}} used for erectile dysfunction, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and <b>vardenafil.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Vardenafil</b> (INN) is a PDE5 {{inhibitor}} {{used for}} treating erectile dysfunction that is sold under the trade names Levitra (Bayer AG, GSK, and SP), Staxyn in India, and Vivanza in Italy.|$|E
25|$|On 18 October 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{announced}} that a warning about possible deafness (sudden hearing loss) would {{be added to the}} drug labels of <b>vardenafil,</b> and other PDE5 inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Alkyl nitrites {{interact}} with other vasodilators, such as sildenafil (Viagra), <b>vardenafil</b> (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis), to cause a serious decrease in blood pressure, which can cause fainting, stroke, and low blood pressure leading to potential heart attack.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer {{scientists}} Andrew Bell, David Brown, and Nicholas Terrett originally discovered sildenafil as {{a treatment}} for various cardiovascular disorders. Since becoming available in 1998, sildenafil has been a common treatment for erectile dysfunction; its primary competitors are tadalafil (trade name Cialis) and <b>vardenafil</b> (Levitra).|$|E
25|$|It is {{available}} in 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg, and 20mg doses in round orange tablets. The normal starting dose is 10mg (roughly equivalent to 50mg of sildenafil). <b>Vardenafil</b> should be taken 1 to 2 hours prior to sexual activity, with a maximum dose frequency of once per day. In some territories, such as the UK, only certain doses may be available.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil is {{a potent}} and {{selective}} inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), {{which is responsible for}} degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The molecular structure of sildenafil {{is similar to that of}} cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections. Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include tadalafil (Cialis) and <b>vardenafil</b> (Levitra).|$|E
500|$|In May2005, the FDA began {{investigating}} {{reports of}} sudden blindness in users of sildenafil (Viagra). The FDA {{said it had}} received reports of the condition, a permanent blindness in one eye known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, in 38users of sildenafil and 5users of tadalafil or <b>vardenafil</b> (Levitra). Lilly Icos voluntarily amended the Cialis label to warn of the condition. The FDA was criticized for its handling of the matter, as an FDA safety officer had commented on unusual reports of blindness over 13months before a journal article was published on the issue. United States Senator Chuck Grassley {{wrote a letter to}} the FDA detailing his criticism, saying that the FDA's Office of New Drugs (OND) had taken no action [...] "despite OND's knowledge of the blindness risks since January2004 and general agreement among FDA staff last spring that the label should be updated". Grassley's letter also suggested that Pfizer resisted adding the blindness warning to Viagra's label. In July2005, the FDA said that Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis labels would all carry warnings on the risk of sudden blindness, though it was unclear whether the drugs were actually causing the blindness.|$|E
500|$|Lilly Icos {{hired the}} Grey Worldwide Agency in New York, {{part of the}} Grey Global Group, to run the Cialis {{advertising}} campaign. Cialis advertisements were described as being gentler, warmer and with a more relaxed feel than those of its rivals, to reflect the longer duration of the drug. (Tadalafil has a half-life of 17.5 hours, compared to 3.5 for sildenafil and 4.5 for <b>vardenafil.)</b> Iconic themes in Cialis advertisements include couples in bathtubs and the slogan [...] "When the moment is right, will you be ready?" [...] Cialis advertisements were unique among those of ED drugs in that they went beyond describing ED and mentioning the drug's benefits. As a result, Cialis advertisements were also the first to describe side effects, as the FDA requires advertisements {{in support of a}} specific brand name to mention side effects; ads for Levitra and Viagra did not mention the brand name of the drug, therefore circumventing this FDA requirement. One of the first advertisements for Cialis aired during the 2004 Super Bowl; Lilly Icos paid more than $4million for the one-minute ad. Just weeks before the game, the FDA required more possible side effects, including priapism, to be listed in the advertisement. Although many parents objected to the ad being aired during the Super Bowl, Janet Jackson's halftime [...] "wardrobe malfunction" [...] overshadowed Cialis. In January2006, a physician was added to the advertisements to describe side effects on-screen, and Icos began running advertisements only where more than 90percent of the audience was made up of adults, effectively ending Super Bowl advertisements. In 2004, Lilly Icos, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline spent a combined $373.1million to advertise Cialis, Viagra, and Levitra respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{option for}} women who have SSRI-induced anorgasmia {{is the use of}} <b>vardenafil.</b> [...] <b>Vardenafil</b> is a type 5 {{phosphodiesterase}} (PDE5) inhibitor that facilitates muscle relaxation and improves penile erection in men. [...] However, there is much controversy about the efficiency of the drug used in the reversal of female sexual dysfunction. <b>Vardenafil</b> is similar to sildenafil, but <b>vardenafil</b> is less expensive and may be covered under some insurance plans. [...] A study by A.K. Ashton M.D. has shown {{that in the case of}} one particular woman, the effects of <b>vardenafil</b> as opposed to sildenafil have not only been comparable in the effectiveness, but that <b>vardenafil</b> is cheaper and reversal of sexual dysfunction requires a smaller dose. [...] So far, <b>vardenafil</b> has been approved by the Food and Drug administration only for use in men.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vardenafil</b> was co-marketed by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline, and Schering-Plough {{under the}} trade name Levitra. As of 2005, the co-promotion rights of GSK on Levitra have been {{returned}} to Bayer in many markets outside the U.S. In Italy, Bayer sells <b>vardenafil</b> as Levitra and GSK sells it as Vivanza. [...] Thus, because of European Union trade rules, parallel imports might result in Vivanza sold next to Levitra in the EU.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} serious {{complications}} of surgery are loss of urinary control and impotence. Reported rates of both complications vary widely {{depending on how}} they are assessed, by whom, and how long after surgery, {{as well as the}} setting (e.g., academic series vs. community-based or population-based data). Although penile sensation and the ability to achieve orgasm usually remain intact, erection and ejaculation are often impaired. Medications such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or <b>vardenafil</b> (Levitra) may restore some degree of potency. For most men with organ-confined disease, a more limited [...] "nerve-sparing" [...] technique may help reduce urinary incontinence and impotence.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{specific}} {{medicine to}} treat angina is nitroglycerin. [...] It {{is a potent}} vasodilator that decreases myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing the heart's workload. [...] Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers act to decrease the heart's workload, and thus its requirement for oxygen. [...] Nitroglycerin should not be given if certain inhibitors such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or <b>vardenafil</b> have been taken within the previous 12 hours as {{the combination of the}} two could cause a serious drop in blood pressure. Treatments for angina are balloon angioplasty, in which the balloon is inserted {{at the end of a}} catheter and inflated to widen the arterial lumen. [...] Stents to maintain the arterial widening are often used at the same time. [...] Coronary bypass surgery involves bypassing constricted arteries with venous grafts. [...] This is much more invasive than angioplasty.|$|E

50|$|Tadalafil, sildenafil, and <b>vardenafil</b> all act by {{inhibiting}} the PDE5 enzyme. These drugs also inhibit other PDE enzymes. Sildenafil and <b>vardenafil</b> inhibit PDE6, {{an enzyme}} {{found in the}} eye, more than tadalafil. Some sildenafil users see a bluish tinge and have a heightened sensitivity to light because of PDE6 inhibition. Sildenafil and <b>vardenafil</b> also inhibit PDE1 more than tadalafil. PDE1 {{is found in the}} brain, heart, and vascular smooth muscle. It is thought that the inhibition of PDE1 by sildenafil and <b>vardenafil</b> leads to vasodilation, flushing, and tachycardia. Tadalafil inhibits PDE11 more than sildenafil or <b>vardenafil.</b> PDE11 is expressed in skeletal muscle, the prostate, the liver, the kidney, the pituitary gland, and the testes. The effects on the body of inhibiting PDE11 are not known.|$|E
50|$|One {{possibly}} serious, but rare, {{side effect}} with <b>vardenafil</b> is heart attack. Also, in rare cases, <b>vardenafil</b> use may cause priapism, {{a very painful}} emergency condition that can cause impotence if left untreated.|$|E
50|$|On November 21, 2003 the FDA {{approved}} tadalafil (as Cialis) {{for sale}} in the United States as the third ED prescription drug pill (after sildenafil (Viagra) and <b>vardenafil</b> (Levitra)). Like sildenafil and <b>vardenafil,</b> tadalafil is recommended as an 'as needed' medication. Cialis is also offered as a once-daily medication.|$|E

50|$|Tadalafil is {{the most}} {{versatile}} inhibitor and has the longest half-life, 17,5 hours. This allows for a longer therapeutic window and is therefore often a more convenient drug than others with a shorter therapeutic window. Tadalafil is more bioavailable (80%) than sildenafil (40%) and <b>vardenafil</b> (15%) {{but it has a}} slow absorption, or about 2 hours compared to 50 minutes of sildenfil. <b>Vardenafil</b> is most known for its potency.|$|E

50|$|Sildenafil, <b>vardenafil,</b> tadalafil, and avanafil are PDE5 inhibitors {{that are}} {{significantly}} more potent and selective than zaprinast and other early PDE5 inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|The PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil, <b>vardenafil</b> and tadalafil are {{competitive}} and reversible inhibitors of cGMP hydrolysis by the catalytic side of PDE5. The structures of <b>vardenafil</b> and sildenafil are similar, they both contain similar structured purine ring of cGMP that contributes their features {{to act as}} a competitive inhibitor of PDE5.
