It is a precursor to tropospheric ozone and it influences the atmosphere's oxidative capacity through its reaction with the hydroxyl radical, ethane's primary atmospheric sink (1 – 3). Here we present the longest continuous record of global atmospheric ethane levels. We show that global ethane emission rates decreased from 14. 3 to 11. 3 teragrams per year, or by 21 per cent, from 1984 to 2010. We attribute this to decreasing fugitive emissions from ethane's fossil fuel source—most probably decreased <b>venting</b> <b>and</b> <b>flaring</b> of natural gas in oil fields—rather than a decline in its other major sources, biofuel use and biomass burning. Ethane's major emission sources are shared with methane, and recent studies have disagreed on whether reduced fossil fuel or microbial emissions have caused methane's atmospheric growth rate to slow (4, 5). Our findings suggest that reduced fugitive fossil fuel emissions account for at least 10 – 21 teragrams per year (30 – 70 per cent) of the decrease in methane's global emissions, significantly contributing to methane's slowing atmospheric growth rate since the mid- 1980 s...|$|E

The valuable gas resource is wasted due to unfavorable economics and limited pipeline capacity. Similarly in India, underdeveloped gas transport infrastructure and restrictive regulatory frameworks prevent distribution and marketing of natural gas from the northeast regions, leaving it stranded in marginal fields. This thesis establishes a techno-economic model, utilizing Aspen Plus chemical processing software, and a discounted cash flow model to estimate economic feasibility of implementing MIT engine reformer-based gas-to-liquids (GTL) systems in the US or India. The system reforms natural gas via partial oxidation into synthesis gas (syngas) in the cylinders of an internal combustion engine, and can significantly reduce capital costs over conventional GTL reforming processes. The engine is operated in fuel rich conditions to generate the syngas, which is synthesized into methanol and dimethyl ether (DME). Once produced on-site, these liquids are more easily transported than gases. This study assesses the regulatory structures surrounding the upstream methane resource and downstream end product marketability for three scenarios: use of DME to replace existing local (1) diesel and (2) liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or (3) sale of methanol as a commodity chemical on domestic or global markets. The analysis shows the system is economical in both locations. In the US, the minimum economically efficient production capacity with a 1 - 2 year payback period is 400, 000 - 860, 000 standard cubic feet per day (scfpd) of natural gas for the range of end use scenarios considered. Differences in costs and product market characteristics in India result in a minimum efficient capacity of 330, 000 - 810, 000 scfpd of natural gas for the three scenarios. by Angela J. Acocella.

40|$|In {{the process}} industry, upset {{conditions}} {{can result in}} the release of fluids to the atmosphere. Such a release process is known as ‘Blowdown’. Accurate modeling and prediction of the blowdown process is important in determining the consequences of <b>venting</b> operations <b>and</b> the design conditions required for <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> <b>flare</b> systems. The predicted information such as {{the rate at which}} the fluids are released, the total quantity of fluids released and the physical state of the fluid is valuable and helps in evaluating the new process designs, process improvements and improves the safety of the existing processes. Blowdown events, amongst other transient processes, are the subject of particular interest to the chemical, oil/gas, and power industries. In the process plants, particularly in the hydrocarbon industry, there are many large vessels and pipelines operating under pressure and containing hydrocarbon mixture. Depressurization of such equipment’s is frequently necessary during maintenance, and in an emergency it may have to be rapid. Hazards arise because of the very low temperatures generated within the fluid during the process and also from the large total efflux and high efflux rates that arise from the large inventory of the long pipelines and high pressure vessels. This inevitably leads to a reduction in the temperature of the vessel / pipeline <b>and</b> associated <b>vent</b> system, possibly to a temperature below the ductile-brittle transition temperature of the material from which the vessel, pipeline or piping is fabricated. To date, a number of blowdown models and simulation codes related to pressure vessels and pipelines have been developed to estimate the blowdown conditions in pressure vessels and pipelines. There is no general model developed specifically for analyzing the conditions developed in a vent pipe. The scope of this work encompasses investigating the behavior of compressible gas in a vent pipe, during venting, by developing a vent pipe model. A fluid dynamic and thermodynamic approach is used in developing the model. The investigation is focused on the pressure, temperature and flow rates of flowing gas and pipe wall temperatures. The model is validated with experimental data generated by performing steady-state venting runs using compressed air.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{limitations}} to understanding the evolutionary history of hydrothermal <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> cold seep communities is the identification of tube fossils from ancient deposits. Tube-dwelling annelids {{are some of the}} most conspicuous inhabitants of modern <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep ecosystems, <b>and</b> ancient <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tubular fossils are usually considered to have been made by annelids. However, the taxonomic affinities of many tube fossils from <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps are contentious, or have remained largely undetermined due to difficulties in identification. In this study, we employ a detailed chemical (FTIR and pyrolysis gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry) and morphological assessment of modern annelid tubes from six families, and fossil tubes (seven tube types from the Cenozoic, 12 Mesozoic, and four Palaeozoic) from hydrothermal <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> cold seep environments.

Our results also highlight that many <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tube fossils formerly thought to be annelids cannot be assigned an annelid affiliation with any certainty.

Results presented here on investigations of Sclerolinum contortum, a species belonging to a little- studied genus of the major vent/seep dwelling annelid family Siboglinidae, demonstrate that it exhibits tube morphological plasticity, wide habitat preferences and a global distribution spanning the Arctic to the Southern Ocean. These results also suggest that this species has dispersed throughout this range using chemosynthetic habitats as stepping stones. A detailed investigation of the full mineralisation process of Alvinella (Alvinellidae) tubes at modern hydrothermal vents shows that these tubes are fossilised by pyrite and silica that template organic tube layers, and that microorganisms living on tube surfaces are also exceptionally well-preserved alongside the tubes. No known ancient vent tube fossils resemble mineralised Alvinella tubes. A major morphological and compositional comparison of both modern and fossil tubes from <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps revealed that two fossil tube types from the Mesozoic were likely made by vestimentiferans (Siboglinidae), suggesting that this major <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep annelid lineage has a longer history within <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps than proposed by molecular clock age estimates. This analysis also demonstrates the need for greater caution in assigning affinities to fossil <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tubes.

This work examines the technical and economic potential for <b>flaring</b> <b>and</b> <b>venting</b> mitigation in a mature oil and gas producing region of the world. Using detailed monthly production data spanning the years 2002 – 2008 for 18, 203 active production facilities, combined with geographic information system pipeline data, reservoir gas composition data, and cost data derived from industry sources, a case study was constructed to explore the technical and economic viability of further mitigation of <b>flaring</b> <b>and</b> <b>venting</b> {{associated with}} upstream oil and gas production in Alberta, Canada. Calculations were performed to evaluate the feasibility of mitigation via collection and compression of gas into pipelines to connect into existing pipeline networks. Four main calculation scenarios were considered, and for each, a series of Monte-Carlo analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainties and sensitivities to key calculation parameters. In all scenarios, the results reveal potentially significant opportunities for economically viable <b>flare</b> <b>and</b> <b>vent</b> mitigation that would yield substantial reductions in CO 2 equivalent emissions. Because of the highly skewed distribution of gas volumes <b>flared</b> <b>and</b> <b>vented</b> at individual facilities, the results also show that solutions for comparatively small numbers of the largest facilities can offer large reductions in overall emissions from the sector. These results suggest that in a concerted effort to minimize carbon emissions in the upstream oil and gas industry, there is potential for significant near-term reductions using existing technology while research and development continues on more advanced methods such as carbon capture and storage...|$|R
