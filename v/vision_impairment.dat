25|$|ADEM has {{an abrupt}} onset and a {{monophasic}} course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, <b>vision</b> <b>impairment,</b> drowsiness, seizures and coma. Although initially {{the symptoms are}} usually mild, they worsen rapidly {{over the course of}} hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days. Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies.|$|E

Some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue (cyanopsia). Some complained of blurriness and loss of peripheral vision. In July 2005, the FDA found that sildenafil could lead to <b>vision</b> <b>impairment</b> in rare cases {{and a number of}} studies have linked sildenafil use with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Near-sightedness is {{the most}} common eye problem and is {{estimated}} to affect 1.5 billion people (22% of the population). Rates vary significantly in different areas of the world. Rates among adults are between 15 and 49%. Rates are similar in males and females. Among children it affects 1% of rural Nepalese, 4% of South Africans, 12% of Americans, and 37% in some large Chinese cities. Rates have increased since the 1950s. Uncorrected near-sightedness {{is one of the most}} common causes of <b>vision</b> <b>impairment</b> globally along with cataracts, macular degeneration, and vitamin A deficiency.|$|E

25|$|V. mandarinia uses both {{visual and}} {{chemical}} cues {{as a means}} of navigating itself and others to the desired location. Scent marking was discussed as a way for hornets to direct other members of the colony to a food source. Even with antennae damage, V. mandarinia was able to navigate itself. It was unable to find its destination only when <b>vision</b> <b>impairment</b> was induced. This implies that while chemical signalling is important, visual cues play an equally important role in guiding individuals. Other interesting behaviors include the formation of a “royal court” consisting of workers that lick and bite the queen, thereby ingesting her pheromones.|$|E
25|$|While the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) has an {{interest}} in the sport because it is open to people with cerebral palsy, it is not governed by them. In 1983, the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the CP-ISRA, but in 2002, the rules governing the sport, including classification, were set by the 1994 IPC Handbook. In the United States, the sport is governed by Disabled Sports USA for skiers with functional mobility, and governed by the United States Association of Blind Athletes (USABA) for skiers with <b>vision</b> <b>impairment,</b> while Special Olympics governs the sport and classification for people with intellectual disabilities.|$|E
25|$|For skiers {{with visual}} impairments, guides {{are used to}} assist the skier down the course. Guides are skiers {{who do not have}} a <b>vision</b> <b>impairment</b> who assist a skier down the slopes by telling the skier where to go using their voice or a radio. Skiers can use more than one guide {{in the course of a}} competition, but the guide is only {{eligible}} for a medal if they have competed with the same skier for the duration of the discipline event. Like the skier, the guide is required to have an IPCAS Licence in order to participate in a competition and adhere to anti-doping rules.|$|E

25|$|Pets {{might have}} the ability to stimulate their caregivers, in {{particular}} the elderly, giving people someone to take care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past. Animal company can also help people to preserve acceptable levels of happiness despite the presence of mood symptoms like anxiety or depression. Having a pet may also help people achieve health goals, such as lowered blood pressure, or mental goals, such as decreased stress. There is evidence that having a pet can help a person lead a longer, healthier life. In a 1986 study of 92 people hospitalized for coronary ailments, within a year 11 of the 29 patients without pets had died, compared to only 3 of the 52 patients who had pets. Having pet(s) was shown to significantly reduce triglycerides, and thus heart disease risk, in the elderly. A study by the National Institute of Health found that people who owned dogs were less likely to die {{as a result of a}} heart attack than those who didn’t own one. There is some evidence that pets may have a therapeutic effect in dementia cases. Other studies have shown that for the elderly, good health may be a requirement for having a pet, and not a result. Dogs trained to be guide dogs can help people with <b>vision</b> <b>impairment.</b> Dogs trained in the field of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) can also benefit people with other disabilities.|$|E

40|$|There is {{an absence}} of {{research}} on test anxiety in students with disabilities although such testing is taken for granted among students without disabilities. This study investigated the test anxiety {{of the students in}} each of the two disability groups, those with <b>vision</b> <b>impairments</b> and those with intellectual disabilities who are placed in specialist and mainstream educational settings in South Australia. The Spielberger’s Test Anxiety questionnaire which measures two components, worry and emotionality and the total test anxiety was administered to 25 students with <b>vision</b> <b>impairments</b> and 20 students with intellectual disabilities. The findings indicated that among both groups of students, most had high scores in worry, emotionality and total test anxiety. However, students with <b>vision</b> <b>impairments</b> had slightly higher physically fearful symptoms (emotionality) in comparison to cognitive fears (worry) in a testing situation, while exactly the reverse was found for students with intellectual disabilities. The Welch two independent sample t-tests revealed that while {{there were no significant differences}} between female and male students with <b>vision</b> <b>impairments,</b> in the Total Test Anxiety, Worry and Emotionality components, the exactly opposite was found for students with intellectual disabilities. The female students with intellectual disabilities were found to be significantly higher than their male counterparts in the Total Tes...|$|R

500|$|The protagonists in Argento's giallo films {{almost always}} suffer from <b>vision</b> <b>impairment</b> of some kind. It is these characters' chronic {{inability}} {{to find the}} missing pieces of a puzzle the puzzle being the solution of a murder or series of murders) that generally provides much of the films' narrative thrust. [...] Most obviously is the blind Franco Arno (Karl Malden) in The Cat o' Nine Tails, who must use his heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied {{to him by his}} niece to solve a mystery. [...] In The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that something seems to be [...] "missing"; as the film's surprise ending makes clear, he did not [...] "miss" [...] anything, but simply misinterpreted what happened in front of his eyes. In Deep Red, Marcus (David Hemmings) has a similar problem in both seeing and not seeing the murderer {{at the scene of the}} crime, and does not realize his mistake until it is almost too late. This recurring theme, according to Douglas E. Winter, creates [...] "a world of danger and deception, where seeing is not believing".|$|E
