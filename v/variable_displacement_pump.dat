50|$|A <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> is {{a device}} that {{converts}} mechanical energy to hydraulic (fluid) energy. The displacement, or amount of fluid pumped per revolution of the pump's input shaft can be varied while the pump is running.|$|E
5000|$|Variable displacement. In a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump,</b> if {{the vector}} normal to the cam plane (swash plate) is set {{parallel}} to the axis of rotation, there is no movement of the pistons in their cylinders. Thus there is no output. Movement of the swash plate controls pump output from zero to maximum. There {{are two kinds of}} variable-displacement axial piston pumps: ...|$|E

In hydraulic power systems, <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> save power, increase the productivity or control the motion of a load precisely, safely and in an economical manner. The displacement varying mechanism and {{power to weight ratio}} of <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> piston <b>pump</b> makes them most suitable for control of high power levels. Positive <b>Displacement</b> <b>Pumps</b> are "constant flow machines " Thus objective of research is defined to develop a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> linkage that will enable to vary the stroke of an two cylinder radial piston pump, thereby offering to vary the discharge of the pump using manual control...|$|R
50|$|Hydrostatic {{transmissions}} use a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and {{a hydraulic}} motor. All power is transmitted by hydraulic fluid. These types can generally transmit more torque, {{but can be}} sensitive to contamination. Some designs are also very expensive. However, they have the advantage that the hydraulic motor can be mounted directly to the wheel hub, allowing a more flexible suspension system and eliminating efficiency losses from friction in the drive shaft and differential components. This type of transmission {{is relatively easy to}} use because all forward and reverse speeds can be accessed using a single lever.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} hybrid vehicle uses hydraulic and mechanical components instead of electrical. A <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> replaces the electric motor/generator. A hydraulic accumulator stores energy. The vessel typically carries a flexible bladder of pre-charged pressurized nitrogen gas. Pumped hydraulic fluid is compressed against the bladder storing the {{energy in the}} compressed nitrogen gas. Some versions have a piston in a cylinder rather than a pressurized bladder. The hydraulic accumulator is potentially cheaper and more durable than batteries. Hydraulic hybrid technology was originally implemented in Germany in the 1930s. Volvo Flygmotor used petro-{{hydraulic hybrid}}s experimentally in buses from the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|A {{fundamentally}} {{different type of}} automatic transmission is the continuously variable transmission, or CVT, which can smoothly and steplessly alter its gear ratio by varying the diameter {{of a pair of}} belt or chain-linked pulleys, wheels or cones. Some continuously variable transmissions use a hydrostatic drive — consisting of a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and a hydraulic motor — to transmit power without gears. Some early forms, such as the Hall system (which dates back to 1896), used a fixed displacement pump and a variable displacement motor, and were designed to provide robust variable transmission for early commercial heavy motor vehicles. CVT designs are usually as fuel efficient as manual transmissions in city driving, but early designs lose efficiency as engine speed increases.|$|E

Instancing a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> axial piston <b>pump</b> controlled bya 3 / 2 proportional valve the improvement will be achieved by fuzzy logic on the one hand and a non-linear approach - adaptation of gain of the classical controller - on the other...|$|R
40|$|Conventional <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> {{hydraulic}} <b>pumps</b> and motors {{suffer from}} poor efficiency at low displacements, {{primarily due to}} the friction and leakage associated with hydrodynamic bearings, which do not scale with output power. A <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> adjustable linkage <b>pump</b> has been developed which can achieve zero displacement and has a constant top dead center position of the pistons, regardless of displacement. This architecture employs roller element bearings in its pin joints, significantly reducing the mechanical losses at low displacements {{as compared to the}} hydrodynamic bearings of variable axial piston and bent axis machines. Previous work has described the experimentally validated efficiency model for a low-power single-cylinder pump. In this paper, the optimization and machine design of an 8. 5 kW, high pressure, <b>variable</b> <b>displacement,</b> triplex prototype are presented and the potential applications are discussed. It will be shown that this architecture can achieve greater than 90 % efficiency across the majority of the operating region. The pump can be applied {{to a wide range of}} applications with little compromise, compared with present <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R
40|$|In the {{hydraulic}} servo control applications, hydraulic valve-controlled systems, {{which have a}} problem of low energy efficiency, are used mostly {{because of the high}} response characteristics. Hydraulic pump-controlled servo systems have high energy-efficiency. However, the conventional pump-controlled systems, which are altered by <b>displacement</b> via <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> have lower response. This paper aims to investigate the servo performance of the high response and high energy efficiency electro-hydraulic pump-controlled system driven by a variable rotational speed AC servo motor in comparison with the conventional pump-controlled systems which are altered by <b>displacement</b> via <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> For that, the control strategy, adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode controller (AFSMC) is introduced. The AFSMC can not only simplify the fuzzy rule base but also estimate the equivalent control force and online self-tune the rule base through the adaptive strategy. The developed high response variable rotational speed electro-hydraulic pump-controlled system controlled by AFSMC and the conventional <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> pump-controlled system (VDPCS) are implemented and verified experimentally for velocity control with various velocity targets and external loading conditions. Furthermore, the energy efficiencies of different experiments are analyzed and compared precisely by the power quality recorder used to measure the electrical power consumed by the AC servo motor...|$|R
50|$|A common <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> used in vehicle {{technology}} is the axial piston pump. This pump has several pistons in cylinders arranged {{parallel to each other}} and rotating around a central shaft. A swashplate at one end is connected to the pistons. As the pistons rotate, the angle of the plate causes them to move in and out of their cylinders. A rotary valve at the opposite end from the swashplate alternately connects each cylinder to the fluid supply and delivery lines. By changing the angle of the swashplate, the stroke of the pistons can be varied continuously. If the swashplate is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, no fluid will flow. If it is at a sharp angle, a large volume of fluid will be pumped. Some pumps allow the swashplate to be moved in both directions from the zero position, pumping fluid in either direction without reversing the rotation of the pump.|$|E

40|$|The {{technology}} in wind turbines has developed very rapidly {{but there are}} still a lot that can be improved also regarding new technologies. One example is wind turbine with hydraulic transmission. At the beginning low power wind turbines are in view. First of all the wind energy is meant to be used by isolated users for household and garden equipment or pumping water. Later, if results will be as expected, and wind potential satisfactory, such systems could be connected to electric grid. In our research laboratory we must build an experimental setup. The simulation for wind turbine and fixed displacement pump coupled to it will be realized using a variable displacement piston pump. As the variable wind speed has as a result variations of the pump flow, the <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> from the test rig may reproduce a similar variation law. In this paper some aspects regarding the <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> are detailed. This study is necessary for the future development of the research...|$|E
40|$|The {{power density}} of {{hydraulic}} drive trains make <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> machines appealing {{to a wide}} range of applications such as mobile hybrid systems, displacement controlled actuation of heavy machinery, and hydrostatic transmissions for wind power. Current state of the art <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> suffer from poor efficiencies at low displacements, thus limiting the potential benefits of hydraulic solutions. Here, a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> linkage <b>pump</b> is presented as a promising method for achieving high efficiency across the full displacement range. In this paper, the linkage kinematics and dynamics are discussed, an energy loss model is presented and used to drive design decisions of a first generation prototype, and experimental results are presented to validate the model.

40|$|The engine {{lubrication}} {{system is a}} vital element for engine health but causes a parasitic load on the engine which increases the fuel consumption: this load can be reduced by matching the oil flow to lubricating requirements using a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> oil <b>pump.</b> In a first stage, two <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> oil <b>pumps</b> were installed on a 2. 4 -L diesel engine; experiments over the New European Drive cycle showed reductions in fuel consumption of up to 3. 4 % and up to 5. 8 % over the urban phase of the cycle. A <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> oil <b>pump</b> was subsequently installed on an instrumented engine capturing over 100 metal and fluid temperatures within the engine structure. This showed that reducing oil flows resulted in lower oil temperature by up to 4 C during cold-start New European Drive cycle but hotter cylinder liner temperatures by up to 6 C. The higher cylinder wall temperatures caused an increase of 3 % in oxides of nitrogen emissions but a reduction of 3 %– 5 % in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. Finally, an energy flow analysis showed that the <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> oil <b>pump</b> can reduce oil pump energy consumption by 160 kJ (32 %) but that {{this led to a}} 400 -kJ reduction in friction and accessory work. These findings highlight the need for a system-level rather than a component-level approach to engine lubrication design to capture key thermal interactions...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{precisely}} controlling {{the position of}} a hydraulic actuator using an on/off valve is developed. Since valves exhibit little power loss when they are fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is more efficient than throttling valve control and can achieve flow variation without the expense or bulk of a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> Mating a pulse-width-modulated (PWMed) on/off valve with a fixed displacement pump and a smoothing accumulator creates a software enabled <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> A drawback of using digital valve control for hydraulic systems is that the relatively low speed of the currently available switching valves results in a significant ripple in the pressure and flow rate. We propose a solution to this problem by using a throttling valve to shield the actuator from the ripple in the output. This creates an effective load sensing system with the throttling valve used only to provide a small known pressure drop between the supply and the load. This approach is significantly more efficient than the conventional technique of using throttling to vary the full flow. This paper presents an averaged model of the system and a nonlinear controller to achieve position control of an actuator. ...|$|E

40|$|In modern {{vehicles}} {{the steering}} systems are still widely equipped with power-assisted steering pumps. In most cases vane pumps are used which limit the fluid volume flow in dependence of required pressure and running speed {{by a special}} design of the internal control valve. This control valve internally redirects the volume flow inside the pump leading still to unnecessary fluid circulation. <b>Variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> now offer an additional opportunity to eliminate the internal volume flow in dependence of the required load with reduced losses and hence increased efficiency. This is realized by a variable adjustment of the displacement cells, but simultaneously the variable force and load distributions inside the pump make the acoustic optimization even more difficult. In this paper the kinematics of the vane pump are modelled with a combined analytical and numerical approach. The data out of this model are used as input data for the hydraulic model of the <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> vane <b>pump</b> with a commercial tool. Both models are validated with data from test rig investigations. With this validated virtual prototype different design options are developed and finally successfully investigated on a test rig and in a passenger vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Current {{state of}} the art <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> suffer from poor {{efficiency}} at low volumetric displacement. Additionally, their performance is strongly dependent on operating conditions. A new <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> linkage <b>pump</b> architecture has been developed which can achieve high efficiency across a wide range of operating conditions. Previous work has described the kinematics, energy loss modeling, and experimental validation of a low power single cylinder prototype as well as the design of a second generation prototype. The second generation pump employs roller element bearings in its joints to minimize friction losses and the three cylinder design reduces the pressure ripple. In this paper, experimental characterization is presented of the new 21 MPa, 6. 75 cc/rev pump. High mechanical efficiency is achieved at low volumetric displacements at partial loads as low as 0. 6 % of maximum power. Poorly performing cartridge check valves result in low volumetric efficiencies at low displacements. Close agreement was obtained between the model and predicted work input using measured cylinder data as an input into the model. This work shows that the presented pump with properly functioning valves can achieve high efficiency across a wide range of operating conditions. Having such versatile pump performance can greatly improve the performance of hydraulic systems as well as expand their potential applications...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{circuits}} {{are typically}} controlled by throttling valves or <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> pump/motors. The first method throttles fluid for a desired pressure output and excess {{energy is lost}} through heat. While <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are more efficient, they are often large and expensive. An alternate method is the switch-mode control of hydraulic circuits through high-speed on-off valves. The proposed on-off valve design makes use of a continuously rotating disc to modulate flow between on and off states; the average power output or pulse duration {{is determined by the}} relative phase shift between the input and output ports. The addition of a directional valve to the the high-speed three-way valve allows any fixed displacement actuator to behave like a virtually <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> unit that is capable of four-quadrant control. In this paper a mathematical model focusing on the throttling, compressibility, internal leakage and viscous friction losses is developed and utilized to optimize the valve design for highest efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Economic and {{environmental}} factors provide the motivation for a continuing trend toward more energy efficient fluid power systems in construction and agricultural machinery. One of the energy-efficient alternatives to today 2 ̆ 7 s valve-controlled hydraulic systems is displacement controlled (DC) actuation, in which hydraulic cylinders and motors are controlled directly by <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> ^ The primary contribution of this thesis is a novel method for optimizing the operation of mobile machines with multiple DC actuators. The proposed power management method improves fuel economy by adjusting the operating points of the hydraulic pumps and diesel engine. The instantaneous rate of fuel consumption is minimized based on operator commands and detailed maps of pump and engine efficiency, including hydraulic energy recovery. Tradeoffs between dynamic response and steady-state efficiency are also considered. In order to facilitate real-time operation, the multi-actuator optimization problem is reduced to a one-dimensional minimization problem without compromising the solution. ^ In support of the new power management method, nonlinear models are derived for <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> and DC linear and rotary actuators. A sliding mode control law is proposed for robustly controlling <b>pump</b> <b>displacement</b> in spite of uncertain control pressure and swash plate moment. DC actuators operate in two modes, depending on {{the direction of the}} load. While actuating inertial loads, DC actuators can experience a limit cycle behavior with repeated switching between modes. Stability characteristics are analyzed. Stability can be assured by design (increasing damping or static load) or by feedback control. Robust control of pumps and actuators is demonstrated by simulation and experiment. ^ A prototype 5 -ton compact excavator was developed as part of the research. The DC excavator was fully instrumented for measuring energy efficiency and fuel consumption. The proposed power management algorithm reduced measured fuel consumption for a load-positioning duty cycle by 56...|$|R
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump,</b> a fixed displacement pump {{can be made to}} function as a virtually variable displacement unit by using a high-speed valve to pulse-width modulate the flow, creating a switch-mode circuit.

One method of minimizing these losses is soft switching, where the flow that would normally be throttled across the high speed valve during transitions is absorbed in a small variable volume chamber. The concept for a novel soft switch mechanism that uses the pressure signal at the exit of the pump to release a lock on the soft switch chamber was previously presented. This paper describes the soft switch concept in more detail and outlines a numerical model used to predict and optimize soft switc...|$|E
