40|$|A {{fast-acting}} valve {{includes an}} annular valve seat that defines an annular valve orifice between {{the edges of}} the annular valve seat, an annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> sized to cover the valve orifice when the valve is closed, and a valve-plug holder for moving the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> on and off the annular valve seat. The use of an annular orifice reduces the characteristic distance between {{the edges of the}} valve seat. Rather than this distance being equal to the diameter of the orifice, as it is for a conventional circular orifice, the characteristic distance equals the distance between the inner and outer radii (for a circular annulus). The reduced characteristic distance greatly reduces the gap required between the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> and the annular valve seat for the valve to be fully open, thereby greatly reducing the required stroke and corresponding speed and acceleration of the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug.</b> The use of a valve-plug holder that is under independent control to move the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> between its open and closed positions is important for achieving controllable fast operation of the valve...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> are valves with {{cylindrical}} or conically tapered [...] "plugs" [...] {{which can}} be rotated inside the valve body to control flow through the <b>valve.</b> The <b>plugs</b> in <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> have one or more hollow passageways going sideways through the plug, so that fluid can flow through the <b>plug</b> when the <b>valve</b> is open. <b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> are simple and often economical.|$|R

40|$|An annular {{control valve}} was {{developed}} for the extrusion of wood slurries and polymers. The objective {{was to determine the}} optimal valve geometry: (1) to provide a linear pressure drop across the valve as a function of valve opening and (2) to eliminate the problem of <b>valve</b> <b>plugging</b> caused by the high solid content of the wood slurries. The approach was to model the non-Newtonian flow in a plasticating single-screw extruder. A finite-difference scheme was developed to model the flow through annular surfaces. The two flow equations were solved simultaneously and a parametric study was performed to determine the optimal valve geometry. The valve operability was evaluated for the extrusion of various mixtures of low-density polyethylene, sawdust, wood flour, and vacuum bottom. The experimental results were in good agreement with the model. In general, a linear valve characteristic was observed and the problem of <b>valve</b> <b>plugging</b> was not evident...|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} for a <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> {{to have more than}} two ports. In a 3-way <b>plug</b> <b>valve,</b> flow from one port could be directed to either the second or third port. A 3-way <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> could also be designed to shift flow between ports 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 1 and 3, and possibly even connect all three ports together. The flow-directing possibilities in multi-port <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> are similar to the possibilities in corresponding multi-port ball valves or corresponding multi-port valves with a rotor. An additional possibility in <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> is to have one port {{on one side of the}} <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> and two ports on the other side, with two diagonal and parallel fluid pathways inside the plug. In this case the plug can be rotated 180Â° to connect the port on the one side to either of the two ports on the other side.|$|R

The construction of a threaded <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> involves a <b>plug</b> with a threaded cap which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of female glass. Screwing the plug in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or plastic, near the plug's base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. Screwing the <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> all the way in engages the plug's tip with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal.

25|$|The {{overhead}} camshaft design adds more valvetrain components that ultimately {{result in more}} complexity and higher manufacturing costs, but this is easily offset by many advantages over the older design: multi-valve design, higher RPM limit, and design freedom to better place <b>valves,</b> spark <b>plugs</b> (Spark-ignition engine), and intake/exhaust ports.|$|R
50|$|The closure {{member of}} the <b>valve,</b> <b>plugs</b> are {{connected}} to the stem which is slid or screwed up or down to throttle the flow. Plugs are typically of the balance or unbalanced type. Unbalanced plugs are solid and are used with smaller valves or with low pressure drops across the valve. The advantages are simpler design, with one possible leak path at the seat and usually lower cost. The disadvantages are the limited size; with a large unbalanced plug the forces needed to seat and hold the flow often becomes impractical. Balanced plugs have holes through the plug. Advantages include easier shut off as the plug does not have to overcome static forces. However, a second leak path is created between the plug and the cage, and cost is generally higher.|$|R

5000|$|When used in {{high-pressure}} applications, for example, as admission valves on steam engines, {{the same}} pressure that helps seal poppet valves also contributes {{significantly to the}} force required to open them.
