40|$|I {{have called}} this brief {{presentation}} Dynamic Cooperation network [...] and beyond because I wish to highlight what this TECT research project has meant to all historians {{involved in the}} DynCoopNet team - this proposal planned {{to break through the}} barriers of nationalistic historical studies by researching a Pan-European topic: early modern trade network, and with a true interdisciplinary <b>vision.</b> <b>History</b> is a discipline that can now look forward to some perspectives of analysis which are more scientific and post-nationalist. In this presentation I would highlight two main questions among our objectives. 1) 	This project supposes an innovation that allows History to move away from its traditional teleological framework. This is important because members {{of a new generation of}} digital humanists argue that is necessary to start exploring how technology is changing our understanding of the Humanities. 2) 	The latest frontier is about method: using powerful technologies and vast stores of digitized materials that previous humanities scholars did not have. In our case This can offer to the researcher an authentic historic data architecture on human cooperation to be made available to historians as well as to all members in the scientific community. This will help to undertake interdisciplinary studies and visualize and analyze these processes in a historical GIS tool. Building a Geo-Sociology of cooperation in its historical evolution.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the role that internal marketing and internal communications play in transferring the corporate identity {{to the members of}} the organization Background: Having a strong corporate identity can be a competitive advantage. However, few organizations are willing to devote the time and money it takes to ensure that everyone within the organization are fully aware of the corporate identity. One way to spread the corporate identity within the organization is through internal marketing. Many different activities fall under the concept internal marketing one of them being internal communications. One problem with this is that most organizations are more willing to make sure that their external stakeholders know of their corporate identity and they willingly throw money into advertising campaigns without informing the employees. Method: The investigation is based on a qualitative method in form of a case study where Riksbyggen was used. Five employees were interviewed and the results are presented in the empirical findings. Later the data was analyzed along with the frame of reference. Conclusion: The research found that Riksbyggen does not use their internal marketing to a large extent to spread their corporate identity. They use other internal marketing activities, e. g. internal training, bonus system, health care and funding to take courses that are unrelated to their work. The evidence that those activities actually spread the corporate identity might not be clearly visible to everyone. However, when analyzing Riksbyggen’s values, <b>vision,</b> <b>history</b> and through interviewing the employees it was clear that they embodied the corporate identity of Riksbyggen...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} extent to which eschatology shapes {{temporal}} existence. The interlocutors are Alexander Schmemann and Joseph Ratzinger. The first part of the thesis examines (1) Schmemann’s account of eschatology, (2) how this shapes temporality, and (3) {{what it means to be}} a person in time. Schmemann’s account is based upon a dualistic conception of temporality in which ‘this world’, the ‘old’ aeon, finds its meaning and life in the ‘new’ aeon. Thus, meaning is found anagogically and teleologically, and human persons are called not only to ascend and leave the ‘old’ aeon but, as priests, to instil meaning into the world by offering it to God. It is argued that although Schmemann’s anthropology is Christocentric and relational, it remains, like his view of temporality, teleologically unidirectional. The second part of the thesis addresses the same questions as are raised in part one but of Ratzinger’s theological approach. For Ratzinger eschatology is absorbed into Christology, and thus it is understood relationally as is also the case with his account of history. The Logos as dia-Logos works within history ‘wooing’ humankind into relationship with the trinitarian God. As a result of Ratzinger’s relation <b>vision,</b> <b>history</b> is undivided––there is no ‘old’ and ‘new’ aeon––and history succeeding Christ continues to be Advent history. As historical creatures, human persons are relational beings who must be understood as both ‘with’ and ‘for’ the other. Temporality as relational ‘space’ is central to his account and interpreted as grounded in the eternal being of the relational God. The thesis concludes that for Ratzinger God’s triune relationality shapes eschatology and what it means to be a person in time. Whereas, for Schmemann, the converse is the case: eschatology informs his conception of relationality, temporality, and personhood. As a result of the primacy of eschatology in Schmemann’s theology human temporal existence is ultimately denigrated...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} and compare the gaze behaviour patterns of expert and near expert under 19 level rugby union players during one-on-one defensive play. Gaze characteristics such as the areas of interest visited, the number of fixations, the duration of each fixation, the starting and last fixations; and the order of fixations adopted were used to achieve the aim of the study. In addition, biographical data, including sporting and <b>vision</b> <b>history,</b> were collected. Data of the two groups were described and compared with statistically and practically significant differences been highlighted. Inferential statistics were used and the following significant levels set: p<. 05 for t-tests and Chi-sq'ared - tests while Cohen's d (absolute value) ≥ 0. 20 and Cramér‟s V ≥ 0. 10 were used to determine the practical significance for statistically significant results, respectively. An exploratory and quasi-experimental design was used, in which 81 participants (16 – 19 years of age) were sampled for differences between experts' and near experts' visual-search strategies and gaze behaviour patterns when anticipating the direction of deceptive running skills in rugby union, however, only 68 participants had eye tracker data analyzed due to the strict calibration criteria. The expert players correctly anticipated significantly (t-stat = - 3. 16, p =. 002, d = 0. 71) more than the near expert players on average (75. 76 % compared to 66. 46 %), and therefore, were less susceptible to deceptive running skills. The near expert players were, however, more aware of their fixation location than expert players. Both expert and near expert players fixated considerably more on the knees and hips than any other area of interest, however expert players had fewer, but longer fixations than near expert players per run with 4. 29 ± 1. 89 fixations (χ 2 = 3. 90, p =. 048, V = 0. 24) of 0. 420 ± 0. 140 seconds (χ 2 = 3. 97, p =. 046, V = 0. 24) compared to 5. 34 ± 2. 39 fixations of 0. 350 ± 0. 150 seconds. Both the expert and near expert groups fixated more on the lower body than the upper body on average, however, the near expert players fixated significantly more off the body for all correct runs than the expert players (t-stat = 2. 17, p =. 034, d = 0. 53). The expert players start fixating more on the knees at the start of each trial, whereas the near expert players start fixating more on the knees and hips, and considerably off-target. The expert players fixate significantly more on the knees (t-stat = - 2. 56, p =. 013, d = 0. 63) at the end of each trial than the near expert players on average, whereas the near expert players fixate more on the hips. The orders of fixation did not yield any discernable patterns between expert and near expert players for correctly anticipated runs. Experts exhibit superior visual-search strategies and gaze behaviour control, presumably using the top-down approach, to successfully anticipate an opponent's intended direction. This information could help coaches teach perceptual tackling skills to enhance motor learning and performance...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{historical}} imaginations {{exhibited by the}} key political architects of the Northern Ireland Peace Process: Gerry Adams, John Hume and David Trimble. It compares and contrasts ways in which each has engaged the ideological resource of history throughout their respective biographies, exploring the various <b>visions</b> of <b>history,</b> both Irish and otherwise, that have intrigued them, and the environments and experiences that moulded {{their view of the}} past. Exploiting a wide range of archival sources, along with original interviews and conversations with the ‘peacemakers’ themselves, it considers how Adams, Hume and Trimble learnt about history; how they subsequently imagined and wrote about it, and how they ultimately applied it within their influential political thinking. It is a study of the relationship between historical and political imagination, delivering fresh and revealing intellectual profiles of the ‘peacemakers’. Significantly, it demonstrates how ideas and <b>visions</b> of <b>history,</b> commonly perceived as somehow to blame for conflict in Northern Ireland, were put to positive use by Adams, Hume and Trimble. It therefore considers how <b>visions</b> of <b>history</b> contributed to the ideological evolution of peace and political stability on the island...|$|R

40|$|In the {{following}} remarks I intend {{to point out}} the place of the <b>vision</b> of <b>history</b> presented by Giambattista Vico within the Enlightment's cultural turn through the presenting of the attempt made by this philosopher on one hand to liberate himself from traditional historicism, and on the other from the ahistoricism of the carthesian type, which was particularly popular in his circles. However, we may hardly recognize the <b>vision</b> of <b>history</b> drawn by him as fulfilling the standards of modern historicism, but it could be regarded as an important step towards this direction.
