40|$|Headlamps provide {{guidance}} and visibility {{to the driver}} at night, but they also cause glare to oncoming drivers. While providing maximum visibility to the driver without disabling other road users is a challenge for vehicle lighting designers, {{it is also the}} responsibility of highway operators to monitor their network and implement countermeasures where visibility or glare problems are diagnosed. In this paper, we describe two complementary monitoring tools to help road operators assess headlight visibility and glare levels. The Nighttime <b>Visibility</b> <b>Meter</b> Tool addresses secondary highways devoid of roadway lighting. It is based on a conventional driving scenario, a standard computational target visibility model, and a widely used retroreflectivity monitoring apparatus. It takes pavement retroreflected luminance coefficient profiles as input, and produces small target visibility distance profiles as output. Such profiles can serve to locate local discontinuities where an obstacle on the roadway might surprise the drivers at night under headlight illumination. The Nighttime <b>Visibility</b> <b>Meter</b> Tool can take disability glare from headlight of oncoming traffic into account. Preliminary tests have demonstrated it can benefit road inspection, but as it is based on a conventional scenario, it relies on somehow arbitrary assumptions which still need to be validated, and its output needs to be calibrated in field experiments. The Glare Meter Tool was designed for in the field assessment of the level of glare from headlights of opposing vehicles in a variety of situations, without relying on subjective reports of observers. Both disability glare and discomfort glare were addressed. The net result is an instrument that is capable of acquiring an image of a scene with glare, then analyzing the image to output a number on the standard, widely-used De Boer Rating Scale for Evaluation of Discomfort Glare, and also an equivalent veiling luminance {{that can be used to}} assess the level of disability glare. The Glare Meter Tool has been demonstrated to provide accurate results in both laboratory and field experiments, but at the current level of development, its practical use in the field is compromised by dynamic range limitations and exposure time requirements. The Night Time <b>Visibility</b> <b>Meter</b> Tool is intended for monitoring whole itineraries to detect potentially low visibility situations, while the Glare Meter Tool is intended for accurately assessing the severity of glare at pre-identified spots. They complement each other because the <b>Visibility</b> <b>Meter</b> can help decide where to deploy the Glare Meter Tool. This is the reason why disability glare was introduced into the <b>Visibility</b> <b>Meter</b> Tool, while it originally considered situations without oncoming vehicles, and into the Glare Meter Tool, while it originally considered discomfort glare only.

40|$|A digital optical method "DOM-Vis" was {{developed}} to measure atmospheric visibility. In this method, two digital pictures were taken of the same target at two different distances along the same straight line. The pictures were analyzed to determine the optical contrasts between the target and its sky background and, subsequently, visibility is calculated. A light transfer scheme for DOM-Vis was delineated, based upon which algorithms were developed for both daytime and nighttime scenarios. A series of field tests were carried out under different weather and meteorological conditions to study the impacts of such operational parameters as exposure, optical zoom, distance between the two camera locations, and distance of the target. This method was validated by comparing the DOM-Vis results with those measured using a co-located Vaisala ® <b>visibility</b> <b>meter.</b> The visibility under which this study was carried out ranged from 1 to 20 km. This digital-photography-based method possesses a number of advantages compared with traditional methods. Pre-calibration of the detector with a <b>visibility</b> <b>meter</b> is not required. In addition, the application of DOM-Vis is independent of several factors like the exact distance of the target and several camera setting parameters.

40|$|Information on the {{occurrence}} of blowing snow is useful in enabling drivers to select safer and more appropriate routes. <b>Visibility</b> <b>meters</b> {{have been used to}} measure the intensity of blowing snow on roads. However, the area covered by the presently installed <b>visibility</b> <b>meters</b> is too limited to obtain region-wide information on blowing snow. This led us to seek methods of estimating the intensity of blowing snow using wind velocity, snowfall intensity and other parameters, all of which are obtained relatively easily. First, based on past studies on mass flux of snow (Mf) and visibility (Vis), we established that log(Vis) =- 0. 773 log(Mf) + 2. 845 for visibility up to 3000 m. Considering that mass flux of snow is snow concentration multiplied by wind velocity, we then attempted to establish methods to estimate snow concentration. For this, two conditions were examined to estimate snow concentration using wind velocity and snowfall intensity. In one condition, the wind velocity at 10 m above the ground was 8. 5 m/s or greater and the temperature was less than- 2 ℃; in the other condition, the wind velocity at 10 m above the ground was less than 8. 5 m/s or the temperature was- 2 ℃ or higher. The visibility estimated using related equations agreed closely with the measured visibility, which indicates that our visibility estimation methods can be applied to region-wide monitoring of blowing snow on roads...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to apply a new microphysical parameterization for fog visibility for potential use in numerical weather forecast simulations, and to compare the results with ground base observations. The observations from the Fog Remote Sensing And Modeling (FRAM) field {{took place during the}} winter of 2005 - 2006 over southern Ontario (Phase I) were used in the analysis. The liquid water content (LWC), droplet number concentration (Nd), and temperature (T) were obtained from the hot-wire probes, fog measuring device (FMD) spectra, and Rosemount probe, correspondingly. The visibility (Vis) from a <b>visibility</b> <b>meter,</b> liquid water path from microwave radiometers (MWR), and inferred fog properties such as mean volume diameter, LWC, and Nd were also used in the analysis.

40|$|Although drivers use various sensory {{channels}} {{to control and}} navigate their vehicles, they acquire most of all driving-related information visually. In fog, no matter what visual acuity is, the visual channel is useless due to the induced poor visibility. Driv-ers react differently to the adverse weather, resulting in high speed variation. That is why it has the high fatal rate during foggy conditions. Then, {{it is imperative to}} provide drivers positive guidance in fog. In this study, the Fog Detect and Warning System (FDWS), being called as the fog lighthouse, was conceived to inform drivers of safety speeds and distances between each vehicle. FDWS includes <b>visibility</b> <b>meters,</b> light bars, and vehicle detectors. The <b>visibility</b> <b>meters</b> calculate sight distances when fog occurs and the estimated sight distances inform drivers through the light bars which are installed at every 30 m intervals. The light bars which display red warning lights inform a following vehicle of the position of the leading vehicle to keep the safety distance between the two vehicles. Since the main lights with the high-bright LED (Light Emitting Diode) have high visibilities, drivers can easily recognize far away. Also microwave sensors together with the light bars are installed to detect the presence of vehicles at every 30 m intervals. The aim of this paper was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the fog system on driver behavior and con-sciousness. As a pilot study, FDWS was implemented on a 1 km section of National Highway No. 37 with a divided four-lane, rural highway.

Furthermore, the dust {{origins of the}} event occurred during 9 – 14 March 2013 were accurately identified in this study using HYSPLIT (Hybrid-Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) trajectory model and multiple satellite data, including AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol properties from CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations). It is found that the total {{suspended particulate}} matter mass concentration larger than 8 000 µg m- 3 on 9 March was the highest among seven dust days with the visibility lower than 500 m. The dust at low levels (500 and 1 000 m AGL) mainly originated from the Hexi (River West) Corridor and Western and Central Inner Mongolia Plateau, which moved very slowly and circulated around the desert regions in Western and Central Inner Mongolia before arriving at Lanzhou. While the air masses at higher altitudes (2 000 and 3 000 m AGL) were transported from the Taklamakan Desert and the Qaidam basin, and arrived at Lanzhou. Most interesting, the air masses from Badain Jaran and Tengger Deserts and their outer edges brought dust particles on the transport pathways into atmosphere led to increase of particle pollutant concentrations due to tightly adherent ground movement of air masses...|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong's surface {{visibility}} has decreased {{in recent years}} due to air pollution from rapid social and economic development in the region. In addition to deteriorating health standards, reduced visibility disrupts routine civil and public operations, most notably transportation and aviation. Regional estimates of visibility solved operationally using available ground and satellite-based estimates of aerosol optical properties and vertical distribution may prove more effective than standard reliance on a few existing {{surface visibility}} monitoring stations. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} such satellite measurements correlate well with near-surface optical properties, despite these sensors do not consider range-resolved information and indirect parameterizations necessary to solve relevant parameters. By expanding such analysis to include vertically resolved aerosol profile information from an autonomous ground-based lidar instrument, this work develops six models for automated assessment of surface visibility. Regional visibility is estimated using co-incident ground-based lidar, sun photometer, <b>visibility</b> <b>meter,</b> and MODerate-resolution maging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth data sets. Using a 355 nm extinction coefficient profile solved from the lidar, MODIS AOD (aerosol optical depth) is scaled down to the surface to generate a regional composite depiction of surface visibility. These results demonstrate the potential for applying passive satellite depictions of broad-scale aerosol optical properties together with a ground-based surface lidar and zenith-viewing sun photometer for improving quantitative assessments of visibility in a city such as Hong Kong. The study presents methods to estimate surface level visibility using remote sensing techniques, thus reducing the cost and effort required to estimate visibility at regional level. This helps to address environmental and health effects of ambient air pollution related to visibility for areas with no existing air quality monitoring stations. Policy regulation and hazard assessments impacting transportation and navigation can be improved by integrating the remotely estimated surface visibility with a real-time environmental data network.

40|$|The FATMOSE trial (FAlse-bay ATMOSpheric Experiment) {{running over}} a period from November 2009 to July 2010, was a {{continuation}} of the cooperation between TNO and IMT on atmospheric propagation and point target detection and identification in a maritime environment. Instruments were installed for measuring scintillation, blurring- and refraction effects over a 15. 7 km path over sea. Simultaneously, a set of instruments was installed on a mid-path lighthouse for collecting local meteorological data, including scintillation, sea surface temperature and visibility. The measurements covered summer and winter conditions with a prevailing high wind speed from the South East, bringing in maritime air masses. The weather conditions included variations in the Air-Sea Temperature Difference (ASTD), that may affect the vertical temperature gradient in the atmospheric boundary layer, causing refraction effects in the lightpath. This was measured with a theodolite camera, providing absolute Angles of Arrival (AOA). Blur data were collected with a high resolution camera system with 10 bits dynamic range. Specially designed image analysis software allows determination of the atmospheric blur, while simultaneously providing information on the Scintillation Index (S. I.). This S. I. was also measured by using the Multiband Spectral Radiometer Transmissometer (MSRT). The ratio of the transmission levels of this instrument contains information on the size distribution of the aerosols along the path. In the paper, experimental details on the set-up and the instrumentation are given as well as the methods of analysis. Preliminary results are shown, including a comparison of measured blur and scintillation data with Cn 2 data from the scintillometer, correlation between AOA and ASTD and comparison of transmission data with data from the <b>visibility</b> <b>meter.</b> Blur and scintillation data are compared with predictions from standard turbulence model predictions, using Cn 2.

40|$|Multi-axis {{differential}} {{optical absorption}} spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations of trace gases can be {{strongly influenced by}} clouds and aerosols. Thus it is important to identify clouds and characterize their properties. In a recent study Wagner et al. (2014) developed a cloud classification scheme based on the MAX-DOAS measurements themselves with which different "sky conditions" (e. g., clear sky, continuous clouds, broken clouds) can be distinguished. Here we apply this scheme to long-term MAX-DOAS measurements from 2011 to 2013 in Wuxi, China (31. 57 ° N, 120. 31 ° E). The original algorithm has been adapted to the characteristics of the Wuxi instrument, and extended towards smaller solar zenith angles (SZA). Moreover, a method for the determination and correction of instrumental degradation is developed to avoid artificial trends of the cloud classification results. We compared the results of the MAX-DOAS cloud classification scheme to several independent measurements: aerosol optical depth from a nearby Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) station and from two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, visibility derived from a <b>visibility</b> <b>meter</b> and various cloud parameters from different satellite instruments (MODIS, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME- 2)). Here {{it should be noted that}} no quantitative comparison between the MAX-DOAS results and the independent data sets is possible, because (a) not exactly the same quantities are measured, and (b) the spatial and temporal sampling is quite different. Thus our comparison is performed in a semi-quantitative way: the MAX-DOAS cloud classification results are studied as a function of the external quantities. The most important findings from these comparisons are as follows: (1) most cases characterized as clear sky with low or high aerosol load were associated with the respective aerosol optical depth (AOD) ranges obtained by AERONET and MODIS; (2) the observed dependences of MAX-DOAS results on cloud optical thickness and effective cloud fraction from satellite confirm that the MAX-DOAS cloud classification scheme is sensitive to cloud (optical) properties; (3) the separation of cloudy scenes by cloud pressure shows that the MAX-DOAS cloud classification scheme is also capable of detecting high clouds; (4) for some cloud-free conditions, especially with high aerosol load, the coincident satellite observations indicated optically thin and low clouds. This finding indicates that the satellite cloud products contain valuable information on aerosols...|$|E
40|$|Road {{accidents}} {{at night}} are disproportionately high in numbers and severity compared to day, {{and the major}} factor contributing to this problem is darkness because of its great influence on the driver's behaviour and ability. To provide visibility to the driver in unlit areas, vehicles are equipped with headlamps which illuminate the road ahead. But {{in the presence of}} oncoming traffic, using low beam is compulsory to minimize headlight glare. Hence, designing headlamps which maximize roadway visibility for the driver and minimize the nuisance to other road users at the same time is a challenge. There are at least two different approaches to evaluate the performance of front-lighting systems. Those who design and manufacture headlamps use standard criteria which are directly related to the headlamp beam pattern. Some of these criteria are related to safety, such as the 3 -lux line, and others are related to comfort, such as the beam spread. Those who use the headlamps (or their representatives) prefer criteria which are directly based on visibility range. They tend to focus on specific targets which are critical in terms of safety, namely pedestrians, pavement markings and signs. Implementing the latter, driver-oriented approach involves conventional traffic scenarios, which actually form the basis of the standard criteria of the former, vehicle-oriented approach. Visibility Level (VL) is the index which is most often used to assess the performance of lighting systems in a driver-oriented approach, not only for vehicle lighting systems, but for road lighting systems as well. VL is the ratio between the actual contrast of a target and the threshold contrast which is needed to detect to target. The threshold is usually computed by means of an empirical vision model based on laboratory data, and the operational viewing conditions are accounted for by means of a field factor based on road tests. In this paper we focus on the impact of the road environment on the VL-based performance of a lighting system. After reviewing the VL-based approaches to evaluate lighting systems, we present a night-time <b>visibility</b> <b>meter</b> based on measured pavement reflection properties, developed for road operators to evaluate the quality of service of their network in terms of the visibility offered to the drivers. We discuss how the data from this system could feed advanced front-lighting systems or infrastructure-vehicle cooperative systems to improve road safety at night...|$|E
40|$|Complementary to a {{measurement}} campaign of small surface {{targets in the}} False Bay, South Africa [1], a set-up could be arranged of atmospheric propagation experiments. This opportunity allowed us to collect another set of transmission data in a coastal area, where the environmental conditions are generally non-homogeneous and rapidly changing. It was found before, that the validity of models, predicting the aerosol size distribution, the vertical temperature profile or the structure constant for the refractive index Cn 2 tends to be questionable {{in this type of}} areas [2, 3]. Proper knowledge of the relation between the range performance of electro-optical and infrared sensors and in-situ weather parameters is however of key importance for operational use of this type of sensors, so the collection of additional propagation data was very relevant. Refraction data were collected continuously by using a geodetic theodolite with camera system over a 15. 7 km path in the False Bay. Transmission- and scintillation data were collected over a 9. 6 km path by means of our MSRT (Multi- Spectral Radiometer Transmissometer) and a Celestron telescope (with camera) with a focal length of 1. 25 m. Weather parameters were measured at a shore station and on a rock in the bay. The weather was greatly variable with many showers, while the visibility, cloudiness and ASTD (Air-Sea Temperature Difference) conditions were continuously changing. Analysis of the theodolite data delivered absolute AOA (Angle of Arrival) data, which have been compared with predictions from the bulk model for marine boundary layers and from two empirical two-parameter temperature profiles. Transmission data, collected in three spectral bands (around 0. 6, 0. 9 and 1. 5 m), provided information on the particle size distribution, assumed to be of a Junge type. Knowledge of this information allows the prediction of the atmospheric transmission in other spectral bands, including the IR. The transmission data were compared with the data from a <b>visibility</b> <b>meter</b> {{on the roof of the}} IMT building. Both data sets correlated reasonably well. From the high speed MSRT transmission data (integration time 10 ms, sampling rate 30 Hz) the scintillation index (SI) was calculated, which showed a reduction in SI value when it starts to rain, while the SI came back to normal shortly after the shower. The measured SI data were transformed into Cn 2 values (the atmospheric refractive index structure function) and compared with predictions from the bulk model with different type of stability functions for a selected set of measurement periods. The model predictions show deficiences for conditions with small ASTD. The SI data from the MSRT were compared with the scintillation data, collected with the Celestron imaging system, which showed interesting correspondences and differences, which are discussed in the paper. From the Celestron data also the beam wander was determined, providing, similar to the SI, a source of information on Cn 2. It was shown, that the beam wander (blur) also correlates with ASTD...|$|E

40|$|Poor {{visibility}} conditions {{often lead to}} large-scale chain accidents causing human fatalities and property damage. Such visibility-related vehicle accidents {{could have been prevented}} if motorists were warned ahead of time to reduce speed and remain cautious before moving into the poor visibility zone. The objective of this research was to advance the visibility measurement technologies that compute visibility through processing images captured by video cameras. There are two fundamental difficulties in measuring visibility. The first is that visibility is a complex multivariable function of many parameters such as objects available, light sources, light scatter, light absorption, etc., so that measurements of one or two parameters (as in most of today’s <b>visibility</b> <b>meters)</b> cannot accurately estimate the true human-perceived visibility. On the other hand, any attempt to measure every possible atmospheric parameter to derive human perceived visibility is simply too complex and costly. The second source of difficulty is contributed by an attempt to express the spatially variant nature of atmospheric visibility using a single representative value, distance. It works only if the atmosphere is uniform, which rarely happens. A solution presented in this report is to measure visibility using visual properties of video images (perceived information) instead of indirectly measuring physical properties of atmosphere and converting them to visibility. The spatial variance problem in visibility was solved by introducing a new concept of relative measurement of visua...|$|R
40|$|The MAPTIP (Marine Aerosol Properties and Thermal Imager Performance) {{experiment}} was organised {{as part of}} a project to assess atmospheric effects on the performance of electro-optical sensor systems in coastal areas. The main issue was the detection and identification of targets.

Platforms included a beach station, ship, research airplane, P 3 Orion, helicopter and three buoys.

MAPTIP was the first validation of some recently developed atmospheric propagation models, including aerosol models, in a coastal environment MAPTIP has yielded a wealth of data for the development of advanced aerosol models, description of horizontal variability, improvement of point target detection algorithms, validation of detection range models, and EOTDA validation...|$|R
