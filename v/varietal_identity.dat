40|$|Varietal purity is an {{important}} commercial driver in the trade of malting barley. Receival standards for malting barley across Australia specify a minimum of 95 % varietal purity. Current variety identification methods within the grain trade rely on differentiation by protein molecular weights, but increasingly the industry is confronted with different varieties demonstrating identical protein patterns and inhibiting conclusive <b>varietal</b> <b>identity</b> of a parcel of grain. DNA based technology, and particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are potentially a useful commercial tool for conducting variety identification and this project was established to test the feasibility of developing a cost effective commercial test for <b>varietal</b> <b>identity</b> and varietal purity in barley, using SNPs...|$|E
40|$|Microsatellites {{were applied}} to confirm the <b>varietal</b> <b>identity</b> of {{thirteen}} olive samples from a private nursery. Allelic profiles of samples were compared to genotyped reference varieties from three olive germplasm collections. Genotyping data of two microsatellite loci (ssrOeUA-DCA 3 and ssrOeUA-DCA 16) allowed discrimination of ten olive samples and the identification of six olive varieties (Koreneiki, Manaki, Tsounati, Kalamon, Ascolana Tenera, Picual). Mislabelling of two olive accessions (Manyanilla de Sevilla, Coratina) was observed {{and the lack of}} reference varieties Nostrana Bitontina and Miloelia hindered the identification of two accessions from the nursery. Accessions denominated as Miloelia and Gaiduroelia were of identical genotype. Different allelic profiles of the Frantoio reference variety were observed from two national olive germplasm collections. Microsatellites were found to be a valuable tool for <b>varietal</b> <b>identity</b> confirmation, in nurseries as well as for screening and managing olive germplasm collections...|$|E

40|$|Previous work on Gentianella {{and related}} genera is reviewed, {{particularly}} the taxonomic {{history of the}} New Zealand gentians and their generic placement. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences show the New Zealand gentians belong in Gentianella. Thirty species are recognised, including seven species (G. angustifolia, G. calcis, G. decumbens, G. luteoalba, G. impressinenJia, G. scopulorum, and G. stellata) described as new, and one (G. magnifica) raised from <b>varietal</b> status. The <b>identity</b> of G. patula is clarified. The specific status of G. amabilis is affirmed. Thirteen subspecies are recognised, including a new subspecies within G. astonii (subsp. arduana) and four within a new species G. calcis (subsp. calcis, subsp. waipara, subsp. manahune, subsp. taiko). New subspecies are also made in G. corymbifera (subsp. gracilis), G. montana (subsp. ionostigma), and G. chathamica (subsp. nemorosa). G. montana var. stolonifera Cheeseman is the only existing variety that this treatment continues to recognise. Four species recognised by Allan (1961) are reduced to synonymy (G. gracilifolia, G. matthewsii, G. tereticaulis, and G. townsonii). Descriptions and keys are provided for all species and subspecies recognised. Evidence is limited, but Gentianella appears to have arrived in New Zealand from South America once and has probably dispersed once from New Zealand to Australia. The place of the first establishment of Gentianella in New Zealand {{appears to be in}} the southern half of the South Island. An initial radiation in the lower South Island was followed by northward range extensions and dispersal events. A second radiation occurred in the Nelson and Marlborough mountains...|$|R

40|$|The Sequenom {{platform}} {{has been}} used successfully {{in a wide range}} of plant genotyping applications. Modern sequencing technology such as the 454 platform has identified large numbers of SNP for analysis in plant populations using the Sequenom system. The well characterised rice genome is delivering a growing number of SNP for important traits for use in plant improvement. Multiplexed assays for key SNP in rice have been developed for use in marker assisted selection in plant breeding. The analysis of SNP in genes in the highly polyploidy sugarcane genome has allowed the mapping of single dose markers. A barley genotyping protocol has been produced to allow both <b>varietal</b> <b>identity</b> and purity to be assessed in seed production and grain marketing. The platform provides low cost per sample and per SNP and is especially suited to analysis of mixed samples, heterozygotes and polyploids...|$|E

The main objective of the Re. Ge. Vi. P., Re. Ger. OP, and Re. Ge. Fru. P., projects is to provide, through an integrated multidisciplinary approach, an effective recovery and study of the germplasm as a prerequisite to the exploitation of regional agro biodiversity. The first step of the work consists of a deep literature search for published and unpublished sources, and also through the recovery of traditional uses and the historical memory of the farmers, the knowledge about the customs and traditions concerning the old varieties of Apulia region. The research, detection and geotagging on the territory of germplasm are going to allow {{the recovery of the}} material will enrich the existing ex situ collections.

40|$|This study uses PCR-derived marker {{systems to}} {{investigate}} the extent and distribution of genetic variability of 53 Garnacha accessions coming from Italy, France and Spain. The samples studied include 28 Italian accessions (named Tocai rosso in Vicenza area; Alicante in Sicily and Elba island; Gamay perugino in Perugia province; Cannonau in Sardinia), 19 Spanish accessions of different types (named Garnacha tinta, Garnacha blanca, Garnacha peluda, Garnacha roja, Garnacha erguida, Garnacha roya) and 6 French accessions (named Grenache and Grenache noir). In order to verify the <b>varietal</b> <b>identity</b> of the samples, analyses based on 14 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were performed. The presence of an additional allele at ISV 3 locus (151 bp) was found in four Tocai rosso accessions and in a Sardinian Cannonau clone, that are, incidentally, chimeras. In addition to microsatellite analysis, intravarietal variability study was performed using AFLP, SAMPL and M-AFLP molecular markers. AFLPs could discriminate among several Garnacha samples; SAMPLs allowed distinguishing few genotypes {{on the basis of}} their geographic origin, whereas M-AFLPs revealed plant-specific markers, differentiating all accessions. Italian samples showed the greatest variability among themselves, especially {{on the basis of their}} different provenance, while Spanish samples were the most similar, in spite of their morphological diversity...|$|E
40|$|This study uses PCR-derived marker {{systems to}} {{investigate}} the extent and distribution of genetic variability of 80 Italian Prosecco accessions coming from Prosecco DOC area (north-east area of Italy). The studied samples include genotypes from Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia region. In order to verify the <b>varietal</b> <b>identity</b> of the samples, analyses based on 22 SSR loci were performed, and two grape varieties were found: Prosecco tondo and Prosecco lungo. In addition to microsatellite analysis, intra-varietal variability study was performed using AFLP, SAMPL, ISSR, and M-AFLP molecular markers. This molecular approach could discriminate different Prosecco tondo accessions coming from Treviso hills, from Veneto plain, from Friuli Venezia Giulia region, and from Padua hills (Serprina samples). As concerning Prosecco lungo variety, {{it was possible to}} discriminate molecularly the accessions from Veneto region and those from Friuli Venezia Giulia region. The molecular analysis allowed a distinction of the Prosecco genotypes {{on the basis of their}} geographic origins with plant-specific markers able to differentiate all Prosecco accessions. In this paper, the studied grape variety is termed Prosecco and not Glera (which is the present name) because the sampled vineyards were established many years ago when the name of the variety was Prosecco. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media...|$|E
40|$|Co-existence {{is defined}} as the farmers being able to choose between conventional, organic and genetically {{modified}} (GM) crop production, in compliance with the relevant legislation on labelling rules and purity standards. Genes of cultivated plants spread in time and space through pollen and seed dispersal, and in addition handling during transport and processing may also disperse seeds. Consequently, suitable measures during cultivation, harvest, transport, storage, and processing are necessary to ensure co-existence in the supply chain of propagated seed. With the increasing area of GM-crop production {{as well as in the}} number of crops in which GM-varieties are available the need for guidelines to ensure coexistence are becoming increasingly essential. In organic farming systems only organically produced seed should be used. Within the European Union (EU) the regulation 2092 / 91 states that only organically produced seed can be used in organic farming systems. However, in a number of species organic seed is not available, and for the moment derogations are made that conventionally produced seed may be used in such circumstances. Seed of cultivated crops are often multiplied in specific regions – due to climatic conditions, growers expertise, the infrastructure of the seed industry etc. and hence seed is often moved cross borders, and therefore an internationally approved regulatory system, which guarantee the level of <b>varietal</b> <b>identity</b> and purity, is needed. ...|$|E

Therefore, by individual reselection method, used both to chek OriginaIity of the selected material and to produce foundation seed, it was possible to isolate reselections in the Original type, with increased as indicated in Tables 3 and 4. Results further refer one to conclude that varieties generally developed by selection,in „early generations“ usually aren 2 ̆ 7 t genetically uniform in characters being inherited polygenically, and specially in those traits which are complex in their nature. Thus, maintaining selection of the varietal source material, applied at maintenance of variety and at production of basic seed, should have the twofold aim: 1) maintenance of <b>varietal</b> <b>identity,</b> and 2) improvement of variety in some characters. Result of these,studios indicate that applying "lndividual reselection method " VARIETY MIGHT BE MAINTAINED IN THE Original morphological type - but improved in some characters...|$|E

Molecular genetic approach {{is expected to}} help the breeder in identification of mungbean varieties in more detail and to protect intellectual property right. This study aimed to identify Indonesian mungbean varieties based on DNA fingerprint profile using a marker set to support morphological characters. A total of 22 Indonesian mungbean accessions were characterized based on 21 morphological traits and 55 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) primers. Of the total 22 mungbean varieties {{used in the present}} study, 16 varieties were improved varieties and remaining six varieties were local varieties originated from Java, Nusa Tenggara and Sulawesi collected in GeneBank of ICABIOGRAD. The results showed that the 21 morphological characters were not sufficient to differentiate 22 mungbean varieties, while SSR analysis revealed that eight multi-alleles markers and high polymorphic information content (PIC) values have been successfully selected for varietal identification. The selected markers enabled to differentiate each mungbean variety according to their genetic marker with the lowest distance of 0. 125, demonstrating the robustness of the selected marker set as a tool to identify a specific DNA fingerprint profile as a <b>varietal</b> <b>identity</b> (ID). The genetic identity of a variety was shown by digital barcoding which represented a series of alleles produced by corresponding markers. The DNA fingerprint profile of each variety would be beneficial as reference identities of a mungbean variety.   </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of farmers {{to the creation}} and maintenance of genetic diversity is beginning to receive more recognition in developed countries. Although the use of landraces and historic varieties has largely disappeared in countries with industrialized agricultural systems and formal seed markets, certain varieties with particular cultural significance have been continuously cultivated by farmers and other varieties have been preserved ex situ in genebanks. Recently, associations of organic farmers have {{become involved in the}} conservation and use of landraces and historic varieties (called farmer varieties in this article) because these varieties possess agronomic and quality traits that they have not found in modern varieties. In this study, eight farmer varieties of bread wheat from Europe selected by participating farmers were evaluated in on-farm trials during 3 years of cultivation. Each variety was grown on each farm, and phenotypic changes in each variety were measured the third year in a replicated split-plot trial on each farm comparing the version of each variety the farmer had multiplied to a sample of each variety from the region of origin. All varieties, including the two modern pureline varieties used as checks, showed statistically significant phenotypic changes over 3 years of multiplication. However, the magnitude of these changes was moderate and did not call into question <b>varietal</b> <b>identity</b> or distinctness. In addition, some traits of putative agronomic and adaptive importance, such as grain weight per spike and thousand kernel weight, did not respond positively to natural selection (environmental conditions and management practices) which suggests the necessity of farmer selection to maintain and improve varietal performance...|$|E
