Response time is critical for MTBE. A quick response to a release greatly increases the ability to check the spread of the MTBE and to clean up the mass of the release.

40|$|Nous proposons d'étudier et d'interpréter les données diagraphiques issues de macro-dispositifs en tenant compte, pour chaque mesure, du volume investi. Les macrodispositifs, {{en raison de}} leur géométrie, ont un effet intégrateur {{important}} sur la mesure diagraphique. Ceci se traduit pour ces dispositifs par une définition ou résolution verticale médiocre. De plus, dans la plupart des cas, le pas d'échantillonnage de la mesure le long du forage est inférieur à la résolution verticale de l'outil : les volumes investis se chevauchent, d'où des données qui ne sont plus additives. Une approche géostatistique des données diagraphiques nous permet d'étudier l'influence de l'effet intégrateur de l'outil sur la valeur de la mesure et de proposer trois méthodes de régularisation des données. Leur objectif est de rendre les données additives par une transformation des supports de mesure (volumes investis). Nous montrerons ainsi par une étude sur des signaux réels et synthétiques puis par l'intermédiaire d'une interprétation combinée de plusieurs diagraphies, qu'une simple régularisation des supports de mesure permet d'une part d'obtenir une information plus rigoureuse avec la mesure diagraphique, et d'autre part d'accroître les possibilités des macrodispositifs et tout particulièrement leur résolution verticale. We {{propose to}} study macro logging techniques data by taking into account for each measure the volume affected by the physical process. The volume of sediment affected by a measure carried out with a logging tool (sonic logs, density logs, etc.) depends {{on the nature of}} the surrounding formations and on the setting of the instrument. The various parameters which influence the measurement are: the source-detector spacing, the spacing between detectors, the sampling interval along a well, and the volume of material considered (the measured entity). Depending on the tool, the measured entity can be either cylindrical, spherical or ellipsoidal. Three main groups of measured entities have been identified : jointed entities, overlapping entities and disjoined entities. When the length of the measured entities exceeds the sampling interval, there is an overlapping of the entities (macro logging tools). In that case, each measurement on an entity is partially correlated to the measurement on a neighbour entity, addition of data is unmeaningful and <b>vertical</b> <b>definition</b> is low. Simple statistical treatments, geostatistics or multivariate analysis are then biased, and the bias increase with the ratio between the length of the measured entity and the sampling interval increases. Starting from the assumption that, for a given logging tool, the measured entity remains stable throughout a well, it is possible to make the data additive by transforming the measured entities. A geostatistical approach allows to study the integrator effect of the tool on logging data and three methods to homogenize logging techniques data are proposed. The interest of these techniques for the homogenization of data is shown in several cases (synthetics and actuals logs data). The homogenization technique can give more rigorous log data, which can then be treated without bias. These methods also give the opportunity to increase the vertical resolution of logging tools : the improvement really depending of the sampling interval...|$|E

The preserved photoreceptor outer segment (PROS) length was measured at the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> high <b>definition</b> line scans. The PROS area was calculated from slab image and line scans simultaneously. The visual field area (VFA) was quantified. Each retinal thickness was measured: inner retina (IRT), outer retina (ORT), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), and central retinal thickness (CRT). Results. The PROS area values acquired differently were consistent. The VFA was related significantly to the CRT, ORT, PROS length (vertical and horizontal), and PROS area (line scan and slab image). Visual acuity was correlated with the CRT, ORT, IRT, PROS length (horizontal and vertical), and PROS area (line scan and slab image) significantly. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the PROS horizontal length and ORTwere related to the VFA and visual acuity, respectively. Conclusion.

This paper deals with two questions: (i) when it is stated that a DTM has a given vertical accuracy, is this assertion univocal? (ii) when DTM vertical accuracy is assessed by means of checkpoints, does their location influence results? First, the paper illustrates that two <b>vertical</b> accuracy <b>definitions</b> are conceivable: <b>Vertical</b> Accuracy at the Nodes (VAN, the average vertical distance between the model and the terrain, evaluated at the DTM's nodes) and Vertical Accuracy at the interpolated Points (VAP, in which the vertical distance is evaluated at the generic points). These two quantities are not coincident and, when they are calculated for the same DTM, different numeric values are reached. Unfortunately, the two quantities are often interchanged, but this is misleading. Second, the paper shows a simulated example of a DTM vertical accuracy assessment, highlighting that the checkpoints’ location plays a key role: when checkpoints coincide with the DTM nodes, VAN is estimated; when checkpoints are randomly located, VAP is estimated, instead. Third, an in-depth, theoretical characterization of the two considered quantities is performed, based on symbolic computation, and suitable standardization coefficients are proposed. Finally, our discussion has a well-defined frame: it doesn't deal with all the items of the DTM vertical accuracy budget, which would require a much longer essay, but only with one, usually called fundamental vertical accuracy...|$|R

The frames under evaluation comprise vertical and/or plan irregularities and were designed for gravity loads only. Nonlinear time history analysis using scaled ground motions and pushover procedure as a supplement method are performed in this study. With the adoption of plastic hinge method, damage levels are addressed according to FEMA 356 definitions. Pivot model is considered for hysteresis behavior. The damage stage and number of formed hinges are classified for the beams and columns. In case of observed plastic hinge with collapse damage level stage, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method is applied to investigate the possible reason. Story drift is obtained based on inelastic behavior throughout of all story levels of archetype model inventories. Comparison between models demonstrates that the first story of symmetric plan models may suffer very minor up to moderate damage levels under low seismic intensity. However, the severity of damages to the asymmetric plan models can be noticeable, specifically for the lower structural models. The result of pushover method shows close to the results of time history analysis only for the vertical irregular frames without plan irregularity. Story drift illustrates that the lower structures suffer some degree of damage levels, especially for unsymmetrical plan models, while the taller models undergo lower drifts. As far as this study alone concerns, lightly reinforced concrete frame buildings may resist seismic events for the taller structures properly, whereas the lower structural models may suffer higher level of damages. The inherent frequency content of applied records affects the models' response more than their vertical and /or plan irregularity formations.

O estudo foi realizado com base em dados provenientes de oito parcelas amostrais permanentes, instaladas nos municípios de General Carneiro, Coronel Domingos Soares e Bituruna, para duas formações distintas sendo: campo com sub-bosque pouco desenvolvido e ralo e floresta densa. Para que o estudo da estratificação se tornasse possível, foram estimadas alturas para as araucárias e para o grupo das folhosas. A estimativa deu-se com base no ajuste de equações para as araucárias e folhosas independentemente. Para a representação da estratificação vertical da floresta, utilizou-se o método h-M, levando em consideração dados de diâmetro e altura coletados em 1998 e 2003. Em trabalhos anteriores o mesmo apresentou dificuldades na visualização da estratificação, não gerando picos abruptos entre um estrato e outro. Foi elaborada, portanto, uma metodologia que proporcionasse uma divisão mais abrupta entre os estratos, através da divisão do banco de dados em três grupos. A metodologia proposta indicou para a formação de campo com sub-bosques pouco desenvolvidos, a existência de três estratos em 1998 e quatro em 2003. Para a floresta densa foram observados para ambos os anos cinco estratos verticais. AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper was to assess the vertical stratification of an Araucaria Forest in the south of Paraná. The study was based on data from eight permanent sample plots, established in the counties of General Carneiro, Coronel Domingos Soares and Bituruna, which are comprised of two different forest types: woodland (open canopy with grassland in the understory) and closed canopy. In order to enable the stratification, heights were estimated for the araucaria trees and broad-leaved species. The tree height estimation was based on the adjustment of independent equations for araucaria and broad-leaved trees. For the representation of the vertical forest stratification the h-M method was applied, taking into consideration DBH and height data, collected in 1998 and 2003. Previous studies, which used this method, have shown some practical difficulties regarding <b>vertical</b> stratification <b>definition,</b> considering that the peaks between a stratum and another could not be easily identified. Therefore, an improvement of the h-M method was proposed in this research, which allowed a more visible and abrupt separation between strata, through the division of the data bank into three groups.

Researchers distinguish from these approaches narrowdisciplinary (biologizing, sociological, historicalcultural), inter-disciplinary (linguistic-psychological, socio-phenomenological) and over-disciplinary. The main methodological strategy of research of a sociality are analyzed (sociological, biological, psychological and philosophical). Degree of their efficiency is estimated. The attention to that circumstance that researches of a sociality need to be begun with demarcation of the basic concepts used in the social theory is paid. In particular, {{it is necessary to}} distinguish the term "sociality" from the terms "culture", "communication" "the public contract". It is specified that definitions of a sociality can be given both through public, and through individual, anthropological.

40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{in-depth}} analysis of the concept of equity in the British health visiting service and thus facilitate understanding of the term. An attempt has been made to apply the analytical process to the context of health visiting. Background. Equity has been discussed at some length in the health literature. Much of this including the health visiting literature discusses inequality and inequalities in health at the same time as discussing equity. Increasingly, poverty and inequalities have become accepted as determinants in poor health. It seemed appropriate therefore to analyse these topical and seemingly related concepts. Methods. A well established method of concept analysis has been utilized to facilitate the process of analysis. Results. Confusion between the meaning and application of the concepts of equity and equality was found. Much of the health visiting and health care literature related to addressing the needs of groups who experience inequality in terms of service provision, and access to services. Following an in-depth critical analysis of the literature three critical attributes of the concept were identified: equal opportunity of access to services; a high standard of service for everyone; and unequal distribution of services to meet unequal need. These relate to two distinct forms of equity: horizontal and <b>vertical</b> equity. A <b>definition</b> of equity has been proposed. framework is suggested as a means to evaluate equity in service provision and uptake. Conclusions. Most of the literature examines equity at a macro level, that is service level. Nurses and health visitors are urged to examine the services that they are involved in to determine the level of equity that is achieved or not attained. Suggestions have been offered as to how this task may be undertaken. A definition has been proposed to stimulate debate and discussion about the concept within nursing contexts...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{material}} structuring is wide and diverse. Historically, this blooming ample field first sparked {{with the emergence}} of man, who has evolved over the ages of civilization through shaping materials. Today, this field encompasses processes and techniques capable of providing products of high quality that meet both the simplest and the most complex needs of our modern daily life. Through all stages of technological progress, man sought the way to make best use of materials by structuring them to emphasize their properties, as nature itself did to evolve its self-ordered structure. In the last decades, a new great range of structuring technologies have been developed to provide and to exploit combinations of properties, enabling for entirely new devices to be made or quite new effects to be achieved. This colorful scenario of potential applications is further widened by remarkable and, sometimes, unpredictable phenomena arising from scaling down structuring technologies to the micrometer and nanometer scale. Micro and nanofabrication, in fact, are increasingly central in modern science, industry and technology for reasons spanning from empowering Microelectronics mass-production, to providing fast and portable diagnostic tools, to allowing multifunctionality integration into the same device. In this work, the integration of novel and avant-garde polymer, silicon and composite materials microstructuring technologies is used for the fabrication of microstructures and microsystems suitable {{for a wide range of}} applications, ranging from the fields of Microfluidics and Biosensing, to Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS), to Microtagging, and Sensing. In particular, the design, fabrication, characterization, and preliminary testing of an SU- 8 on-glass microfluidic platform for multi-analyte optical detection is reported. SU- 8 is a photosensitive polymer that has recently gained prominence for its easy processing by standard photolithography, allowing for the fabrication of high-aspect-ratio structures with nearly <b>vertical</b> sidewall. Upon <b>definition</b> and optimization of a proper structuring protocol with resolution of ~ 5 μm, on both silicon and glass, the designed microfluidic platform was successfully fabricated and tested. Silicon is the most used substrate for MEMS fabrication by standard photolithographic techniques. In this work, the design, simulation and fabrication of a high-aspect-ratio all-silicon in-plane optical accelerometer by silicon Electrochemical Micromachining (ECM) technology is reported. Electrochemical Micromachining (ECM) is a novel wet etching technology based on the controlled electrochemical dissolution of silicon in Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) -based aqueous solutions allowing for high-aspect-ratio and for high-complexity microsystem fabrication in any lab at low cost. In the reference frame of silicon microstructuring technologies, moreover, the fabrication by back-side illumination electrochemical etching (BIEE) at high anodic voltage of ordered macropore arrays featuring spatial periods of 2 μm and submicrometric size is successfully achieved and reported. This result could represent the first step toward low-doped n-type silicon nanofabrication at low HF concentration by BIEE. Integrating both silicon and polymer microstructuring technologies, a high-yield (> 95 %) top-down parallel and facile polymer structuring technique for the fabrication of two-dimensional (2 D) arrays of micrometric-sized (down to ~ 3 μm 2) polymeric freestanding membranes integrated into microstructured silicon is demonstrated by drop-casting technology. The technique versatility is proved by reporting the successful fabrication of 2 D membrane arrays arranged in either regular or non-regular patterns, using both conjugated and non-conjugated polymers, and their application for Microtagging is detailed. Conjugated polymers have been widely investigated over the last decades for their unique optical and semiconducting properties, although their use for hybrid polymer/silicon microstructured platforms has been somehow overlooked. Finally, the design, fabrication, characterization, and preliminary testing of luminescent porous silicon-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite micropillar arrays for oxygen sensing applications is reported in the last section. Luminescent porous silicon is shown to quench upon exposure to molecular oxygen, though suffering from permanent loss of sensing capabilities and drift in the baseline due to photo-oxidation. The concept of this work relies upon the use of a composite material embedding luminescent porous silicon in a PDMS matrix in order to exploit quenching of porous silicon luminescence for oxygen sensing, PDMS as both a baseline-drift-stabilizer and an oxygen-permeable substrate, and micropillar array structure for the high surface area and the sensitivity-enhancing waveguide effect...|$|R

Bu yüklerden sabit yükler herhangi bir yönetmeliğe ihtiyaç duyulmaksızın tasarımda kullanılacak malzemelere göre belirlenebilirken hareketli yüklerin alt limitleri ASCE 7 - 10 tarafından belirlenmiştir. Yatay yük kapsamında ele alınan rüzgar ve deprem yükleri de ASCE 7 - 10 'a göre belirlenmiştir. Analiz sonucunda yapı düzensizliklerinden, stabilite faktörüne kadar yönetmelikte belirtilen ilgili tüm kontroller yapılmıştır. Dışmerkez çaprazlı çelik çerçevelerin boyutlandırılmasında bağ kiriş plastikleştiğinde bağ kirişi dışında kalan kiriş, kolon ve çaprazların elastik bölgede kalması beklenmektedir. Bu durumun sağlanabilmesi için bağ kirişi dışındaki elemanların üzerinde deprem etkisiyle oluşan kuvvetler, bağ kirişinin beklenen kesme kuvveti kapasitesinin deprem yükleri dolayısıyla bağ kirişi üzerinde oluşan kesme kuvvetine oranı nispetinde artırılmıştır. Kesitleri belirlenen sistemler OpenSEES programında modellenirken SAP 2000 'de kurulan modellere uygunluğu periyotların karşılaştırılması ile kontrol edilmiştir. Modellemenin ardından doğrusal olmayan statik itme analizi ile tüm sistemler için taban kesme kuvveti ve tepe noktasının göreli kat ötelemesi grafikleri ile sistem elemanları için istem/kapasite oranları elde edilmiştir. Kapasite, yerdeğiştirme, bağ kirişi plastik dönme açıları belirlenip karşılaştırmaları yapılmıştır. Five {{different}} {{samples of}} eccentrically braced frames by a vertical plane with {{a height of}} 30. 5 m and a length of 35 m at each direction in the horizontal plane were modeled using SAP 2000 computer program and analyzed and designed based on ASCE 7 - 10, AISC 360 - 10, and AISC 341 - 10. In determining the models, the same link length and all the loads, with no period effect were used to rule out potential effects of circumstances excluding the configuration. Then, based on the nonlinear pushover analysis via OpenSEES program, and using base shear- roof drift curves, the behaviors, capacity, and overstrength factors of these systems were compared. In {{the light of the}} literature review provided in Part 2, the systems defined in earlier studies have been limited to typical eccentrically braced frames. Thus, this study may provide important information on different systems. In describing the models of eccentrically braced frames, the definition of eccentricity in AISC 341 - 10 has been influential, and all the models have been based on this definition. Yielding of the link beam in eccentrically braced frame occurs in three forms due to variations in the elements; shear yielding, flexural yielding and combination of shear and flexural yielding. In this study, modeling was made according to shear yielding state and hence, the systems were designed. Length of the link beam is smaller than 1. 6 Mp/Vp, it is contained that the strain hardening effects of moment and shear capacity of the beam. Furthermore, AISC 360 - 10 advocates involvement of second order effects in element sizing. There are three types of design methods in AISC 360 - 10 : direct analysis method, effective length method and first-order analysis method. Second order effects were considered within amplification factors and one of the three methods, effective length method, has been used as described in the regulations. To be able to use this method, it was proven that the ratio of maximum second-order drift to maximum first order drift is less than 1. 5 for all type of eccentrically braced frame structures. Morover, all deformations (axial member, flexural member and shear member), uncertainity in stiffness and strength, stiffness reductions (residual stress and plasticity) and geometric imperfections were considered. According to AISC 360 - 10 the effective length factor,K, was taken as 1. 0 because of braced frames system. Initial imperfections were taken into account by applying notional loads as mentioned in the regulation (AISC 360 - 10). It is considered 0. 2 % of the total gravity load (LRFD) at each level. Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) and Allowable Stress Design (ASD) are the two methods which are presented by AISC. Load and resistance factor design approach was used. Load combinations were determined based on LRFD in ASCE 7 - 10. All connections of columns and braceds to their foundations are pinned. Braced to link beam connections are rigid (fixed). ASTM A 992 was used as a material. Secondary beams have pinned connections. Floor diaphragms are assumed and modeled as a rigid diaphragm without any discontinuities. The loads used have been categorized as horizontal and <b>vertical.</b> The <b>definition</b> of <b>vertical</b> load involves loads of dead and live. While the dead loads can be used based on the materials {{to be used in the}} design without a requirement for regulations, the lower limits of live loads are defined by ASCE 7 - 10. The calculations of earthquake and wind loads considered horizontal loads are also defined in the relevant sections of ASCE 7 - 10. All structures were thought in the same seismic and wind region, so all of the parameters related to wind and seismic calculation were assumed the same. 5 % additional eccentricity at each story was taken into account in 3 D analysis. Seismic design category was determined as E for the models. The earthquake loads contain 100 % of forces for one direction (x or y) plus 30 % of forces for another direction (y or x). Directional procedure was used for wind loads. Basic wind speed was determined from a given map in ASCE 7 - 10 and taken into account as a 100 mph. It was checked that displacements and second order effects are within the limits of the regulations based on the results of analyses. The definition of irregularities contains vertical and horizontal structural irregularities. Also, all irregularities which is defined in ASCE 7 - 10 were checked. Lateral load resisting systems have different energy dissipation mechanisms. In eccentrically braced frame which is one of the lateral load resisting systems, ductility and energy dissipation capacity depends on link beams. Inelastic deformation of link beam will be expected during an earthquake occurs, therefore plastic link rotation capacity is an important property of eccentrically braced frame structures. In sizing of the eccentrically braced frames, when the plasticity of link beam parts occur, the beam that remains outside the link beam, column, and braced are expected to remain in the elastic area. To ensure this, the forces that occur on the elements except link beam have been increased at ratio of expected shear capacity over shear force that develops on the link beam due to earthquake effects. Because of this, B 2 was equal to 1. Since all sections used as a column and braced have to ensure highly ductile section property, these sections were controlled in according to AISC 341 - 10. According to AISC 341 - 10 links whose length are smaller than 1. 6 Mp/Vp are permitted to meet moderately ductile members' section requirement. The link beam had been designed and its section had been determined. Then the expected shear capacity of the link was determined using with Ry, the ratio of expected yield strength to minimum specified yield strength, and ratio of expected shear capacity over shear force that develops on the link beam due to earthquake effects were determined. At the same time, columns' axial forces were estimated based on the failure mode of the structures. To built up nonlinear model in 3 D (6 degree of freedom); coordinate system was defined, and node coordinates of models were determined in this system. Material and section properties were defined. After determining which elements should be used, elements with convenient sections were defined by connecting the relevant nodes. Before the pushover loads had been defined, static vertical loads and mass were assigned. As the systems, the sections of which were determined, were modeled by OpenSEES computer program, their conformity to the model set by SAP 2000 computer program was checked by comparison of the periods. After model development, using nonlinear static pushover analysis, base shear- roof displacement curves for all the systems and demand/capacity ratios for system elements were obtained. Demand/capacity ratio of column and braced were determined under compression force and moment interaction. As a results, it occurred that some of link rotations are larger than 0. 08 rad which is determined by AISC 341 - 10. It had been observed in different academic studies before. As it has been assumed before, inelastic behavior of link beam was controlled by shear yielding and all parts of structures were remain elastic. Overstregth factors of these eccentrically braced frames were determined and compared to each other. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
