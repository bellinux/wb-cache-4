50|$|In 1992, a new {{optional}} door {{form was}} introduced, colloquially known as Dutch doors. This form was two <b>bi-parting</b> <b>doors</b> with a flip-up window above. Previously, Astro and Safari vans were equipped only with <b>bi-parting</b> <b>doors.</b> An optional 4.3 L (RPO L35) engine with central port injection and a balance shaft was phased in.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bi-parting</b> <b>doors</b> {{typically}} {{feature a}} longer {{front door and}} a short rear door, without a pillar in between. The configuration offers both a more 'sporty' aesthetic than compared to a traditional sedan, and the utility of 4-doors, though the doors operate inter-subdependently. This means that the forward door must always be opened before the rear-door (which opens in a rear-hinged fashion) can be opened.|$|R
50|$|The Chevrolet Astro is a {{rear-wheel drive}} mid-sized van {{manufactured}} and marketed by Chevrolet from 1985-2005 and over two build generations. Along with its rebadged variant, the GMC Safari, the Astro was marketed in passenger {{as well as}} cargo and livery configurations—featuring a V6 engine, unibody construction with a separate front engine/suspension sub-frame, leaf-spring rear suspension, rear <b>bi-parting</b> <b>doors,</b> and a seating capacity of up to eight passengers.|$|R
5000|$|A quad coupé is a {{car body}} style {{featuring}} <b>bi-parting</b> side <b>doors</b> [...] - [...] located either {{on one or}} {{both sides of the}} vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|The Clubman {{features}} {{access to}} its cargo space via <b>bi-parting</b> rear <b>doors,</b> known as barn doors or splitdoors. Also, all Clubman models feature a single backwards opening side door to access the rear seats. It is marketed singlarly as the Clubdoor, and is always located on its {{right side of the}} body [...] - [...] irrespective of market. It is much smaller in comparison to the regular driver and passenger side doors. This in turn creates differences between right and left-hand driver markets. In right-hand markets, the steering wheel won't allow the driver's seat from folding as far forward as the passenger seat. This means that left-hand drive markets feature increased access to the rear seat. For right-hand drive markets, including the car's home market, the <b>bi-parting</b> <b>door</b> is located on the road side of the car, requiring rear passengers to exit into the road.|$|R
5000|$|At {{ground floor}} level, the {{original}} main {{core of the}} house is made up of four rooms, a central hallway and a staircase. Large double <b>bi-parting</b> <b>doors</b> separate two of the main rooms ( [...] original dining and drawing rooms). The hallway leads to an original lavatory box room and cellar. a doorway from the original dining room leads to the original detached kitchen wing and service entry, and subsequent 1896 attached kitchen and rear access. There are three fireplaces, one with marbled paintwork on timber. The chimneys for these fireplaces were been closed up, with all cleaned and two reopened during the conservation.|$|R
5000|$|A cargo {{version of}} the Caravan, called the Mini Ram Van, was also {{introduced}} in 1984, renamed the Caravan C/V for 1989 and discontinued after 1995. It was available either with the short- or long-wheelbase models. Unique to the Caravan C/V was the option of either having the traditional hatch door in the back or the optional swing-out <b>bi-parting</b> <b>doors</b> (with or without windows), {{similar to those of}} more traditional cargo vans. These doors were made of fiberglass and required the C/V vans to be [...] "drop shipped", as these doors were custom installed by another vendor. Also based on the Mini Ram and C/V were aftermarket conversion vans sold through official Chrysler dealers and from the conversion companies themselves.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Mini Clubman, which {{features}} a pair of <b>bi-parting</b> side <b>doors</b> that are always located {{on the right of}} the car (irrespective of the market), the Veloster has different left and right hand drive configurations. The larger single door is always on the driver's side, and the two smaller doors are always on the passenger side. As a result, the rear passenger always exits on the curb side of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Line 1 was allotted 64 coaches. Fourteen trains (of four cars) are {{in service}} during rush hour, and {{seven or eight}} in non-peak hours. All coaches are {{air-conditioned}} and have humidity control, and designed to reduce noise and vibration. Each coach is approximately 2.9 m wide and has 48 seats. A coach has a capacity of 375 passengers, and a single four car train has a total capacity of 1500 passengers. The coach body is made of lightweight stainless steel, with fire resistant metal doors. Coaches have metallic silver colour exteriors, and can be covered with vinyl sheets to display advertisements. The interior features anti-skid floors, and longitudinal seats with dedicated space to accommodate wheelchairs. Trains on Line 1 are fitted with the VTS Firetide 7010 video transmission system. Coaches are also fitted with LED displays showing dynamic route map, and LCD TVs for entertainment, information and advertising. Windows in coaches are made of double glazed laminated glass to shut out noise. Each coach has 8 externally hung, sliding <b>bi-parting</b> <b>doors</b> except the pilot cabin which has only 2. Doors are broad to enable wheelchair access. The maximum gap between the station platform and the doors is 85 mm. Trains are outfitted {{with a number of}} features for safety and convenience, including 3D route maps, first-aid kits, fire-fighting equipment and intercom systems permitting communication with the train driver. Each coach contains a black box to assist in accident investigations.|$|R
2500|$|Montreal's Metro {{trains are}} made of {{low-alloy}} high-tensile steel, painted blue with a thick white stripe running lengthwise. Trains are assembled in three-, six- or nine-car lengths. Each three-car segment element consists of two motor cab cars encompassing a trailer car (M-T-M). Each car is [...] wide and has three (MPM-10) or four (MR-63, MR-73) wide <b>bi-parting</b> leaf <b>doors</b> on each side for rapid passenger entry and egress. Design specifications called for station dwell times of typically 8 to 15 seconds. In response to overcrowding on the Orange Line, a redesign of the MR-73 cars removed some seats to provide more standing room. The newest Bombardier MPM-10 trains allow people to move between cars once on board, so that the passenger load is more evenly distributed.|$|R
25|$|Airtrans {{was built}} to serve 53 passenger, {{employee}} and service stations around the airport, 33 of those for passengers and employees. Each terminal contained 3 passenger stations corresponding to that terminal's section (for example, Terminal 2E Section 1) located adjacent to the lower level terminal drive. These passenger stations contained an enclosed waiting area, destination signage, two sets of <b>bi-parting</b> automatic <b>doors</b> (with room for a third) and elevators to upper level ticketing/baggage claim. In early years of operation entry to the station was gained by placing a quarter in and passing through entry turnstiles. An employee station for each terminal section was located on a separate guideway adjacent to the terminal's ramp area, and screened from passenger view. These stations were more primitive, containing an outdoor waiting area with a fence and no automatic doors preventing access to the electrified guideway.|$|R
5000|$|A cargo {{version of}} the Caravan, called the Mini Ram Van, was also {{introduced}} in 1984, renamed the Caravan C/V for 1989 and discontinued after 1995. It was available either with the short- or long-wheelbase models. Unique to the Caravan C/V was the option of either having the traditional hatch door in the back or the optional swing-out <b>bi-parting</b> <b>doors</b> (with or without windows), {{similar to those of}} more traditional cargo vans. These doors were made of fiberglass and required the C/V vans to be [...] "drop shipped", as these doors were custom installed by another vendor. Also based on the Mini Ram and C/V were aftermarket conversion vans sold through official Chrysler dealers and from the conversion companies themselves.The vans were updated for 1987, receiving new headlamps, a new grille and new taillamps, with some minor interior revisions and a new optional V6 engine. Seating arrangements were now limited to seating for five standard and for seven optional on the base and SE, and seating for seven with high-back front buckets standard on the LE, Grand SE, and Grand LE. Deluxe cloth upholstery was now standard on base and all SE models, with the luxury vinyl optional on SEs. On LEs, luxury cloth came standard and for the first time, leather seats were available on the LE models. Additionally, the vans were now available in a long wheelbase variant, marketed as the Grand Voyager and Grand Caravan, which allowed more cargo space behind the rear seat. The Grand Caravan was available in all trim levels, while the Grand Voyager was only available in SE and LE trims. later in 1987, for the 1988 model year, the Chrysler began exporting the minivans to Europe, where it was sold as the Chrysler Voyager. Despite the name, the European Voyager was a rebranded Dodge Caravan, with all the Caravan's trim and styling features, that was adopted to meet European safety and emissions standards. The European Voyager had all the same options and equipment as the Caravan, though the V6 engine was not available as it didn't meet European emission standards. In 1989, the Caravan and Voyager received new front and rear bumpers, as well as new top-of-the-line trims of ES and LX, respectively. Additionally, a luxury Chrysler Town & Country model was launched. Originally intended to be a 1989 model, the Chrysler Town & Country minivan was ultimately introduced as a 1990 model in the spring of 1989. The S-platform Town & Country was the first 1990 model year Chrysler minivan as the Dodge and Plymouth counterparts produced alongside the Town & Country continued under the previous model year until June 1989. Sharing the body of the long-wheelbase (LWB) Grand Voyager/Grand Caravan's Chrysler S platform, the Town & Country was externally distinguished by its chrome waterfall grille, crystal pentastar hood ornament, standard woodgrain applique, grooved lower body cladding (a stretched version of that found on the Caravan ES), and 15" [...] lace-spoke aluminum wheels. Additionally, Town & Country was only available in two exterior colors. Initially, it was available exclusively in Bright White Clearcoat; Black Clearcoat was added in June 1989, coinciding with the release of the 1990 Caravans and Voyagers. As the Chrysler Corporation's most luxurious minivan, the Town & Country came standard with nearly every feature available on Plymouth and Dodge minivans in addition to some exclusive amenities of its own. This included unique gathered leather seating surfaces and door trim panels, front and rear air conditioning, power windows, power locks, an Infinity sound system, seven-passenger seating, luggage rack, and an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Early vehicles were equipped with 3.0 L Mitsubishi 6G72 V6 engines, while those produced from June 1989 onward received an upgrade to Chrysler's in-house 3.3 L EGA V6. As all vehicles equipped with the 3.0 L engine were produced alongside 1989 Dodge and Plymouth models, the United States Environmental Protection Agency classifies such vans as 1989 models rather than 1990s, despite the VINs indicating otherwise. Total S-platform Town & Country production was 1,789 units in 1989 and 3,615 in 1990, making this model of the Town & Country as the most obscure of all the Chrysler minivans.|$|R
