50|$|The U.S. Army {{plans to}} replace the LCM-8 with the Maneuver Support <b>Vessel</b> (<b>Light)</b> (MSV(L)). Two dozen boats are planned that will be larger and faster, with a longer range and twice the {{capacity}} over Mike Boats. The MSV(L) will be roughly 100 ft long, with a draft of less than four feet, a speed of 18 knots {{and the capacity to}} carry either an M1 Abrams tank, two Strykers with add-on armor, or four Joint Light Tactical Vehicles. It also may be used in defended waters, being fitted with a subsurface surveillance device, protection from small arms fire, two Common Remotely Operated Weapon Stations, and mitigated detection through reduction of thermal and acoustic signature. Testing of the new vessel is to take place until 2019.|$|E

40|$|Differences {{were shown}} in the {{environmental}} conditions inside four types of non-ventilated culture vessels (glass baby-food jars capped with metal steel or Magenta B-caps, jam glass jars capped with metal steel caps, and Magenta GA 7 culture vessels) that were incubated in the same external growth room conditions. <b>Vessel</b> <b>light</b> transmittance varied from 83 % to 53 % and determined the availability of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) for explants. The mean of medium desiccation in the culture period (30 d) was from 2. 8 g in vessels with the lowest rate of gas exchange (0. 02 h− 1) to 10. 4 g in vessels with the highest (1. 1 h− 1). In all cases, the temperature inside the culture vessel increased during the light period and decreased during the dark period, and relative humidity was close to 100 %. Results of in vitro growth and morphogenesis of Dianthus caryophyllus L. evs. Scania, White Sim, Angeline, and Pink Calypso provided evidence that the environmental differences detected inside these four types of non-ventilated culture vessels was sufficient to affect micropropagation, mainly related with the specific sensitivity of each cultivar to the gas exchange and medium desiccation determined by the vessel type...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} detect {{low-energy}} neutrinos, {{for example the}} solar neutrinos from the ppchain (with the maximum neutrino energy of approximately 400 keV) requires that the intrinsic ¹⁴C content in a liquid scintillator is at extremely low level. In the Borexino detector, a 300 -ton liquid scintillation detector at Gran Sasso, Italy, the ratio of ¹⁴C to ¹²C of approximately 2 &# 215; 10 − 18 has been achieved. It is the lowest value ever measured. The detector situates underground at the depth of 3200 mwe (1200 m). ¹⁴C cannot be removed from liquid scintillators by chemical methods, or by other methods in large quantities (liters). In principle, the older is the oil or gas source that the liquid scintillator is made of and the deeper it situates, the smaller should be the ¹⁴C-to-¹²C ratio. This, however, is not generally the case, and the ratio depends on the activity (U and Th content) in {{the environment of the}} source. We have started a series of measurements where the ¹⁴C-to-¹²C ratio will be measured from liquid scintillator samples. The measurements take place in two underground laboratories: in the Pyhäsalmi mine, Finland, at the depth of 4000 mwe (1400 meters) and at the Baksan Underground Laboratory, Russia at 4800 mwe, for reducing and better understanding systematical uncertainties. There will be about ten samples with the known origin, each of them 2 litres. The liquid scintillator <b>vessel,</b> <b>light</b> quides and low-active PMTs will be shielded with thick layers copper and lead. Nitrogen flow is used to reduce the radon background. The aim is to measure ratios smaller than 10 − 18, if such samples exists. One measurement takes several weeks...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{vascular}} and hematopoietic systems during organogenesis {{occurs at}} the same time. During vasculogenesis, {{a small part of}} cells does not undergo complete differentiation but stays on this level, “anchored” in tissue structures described as stem cell niches. The presence of blood vessels within tissue stem cell niches is typical and led to identification of niches and ensures that they are functioning. The three-layer biostructure of vessel walls for artery and vein, tunica: intima, media and adventitia, for a long time was defined as a mechanical barrier between <b>vessel</b> <b>light</b> and the local tissue environment. Recent findings from vascular biology studies indicate that vessel walls are dynamic biostructures, which are equipped with stem and progenitor cells, described as vascular wall-resident stem cells/progenitor cells (VW-SC/PC). Distinct zones for vessel wall harbor heterogeneous subpopulations of VW-SC/PC, which are described as “subendothelial or vasculogenic zones”. Recent evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies show that prenatal activity of stem and progenitor cells is not only limited to organogenesis but also exists in postnatal life, where it is responsible for vessel wall homeostasis, remodeling and regeneration. It is believed that VW-SC/PC could be engaged in progression of vascular disorders and development of neointima. We would like to summarize current knowledge about mesenchymal and progenitor stem cell phenotype with special attention to distribution and biological properties of VW-SC/PC in biostructures of intima, media and adventitia niches. It is postulated that in the near future, niches for VW-SC/PC could be a good source of stem and progenitor cells, especially in the context of vessel tissue bioengineering as a new alternative to traditional revascularization therapies...|$|E
30|$|While {{blood vessel}} imaging using {{negative}} contrast CLI {{could possibly be}} performed with other radiotracers, [68 Ga]GaCl 3 was optimal for blood vessel imaging for a few reasons. One reason is that 68 Ga has very high light output with nearly 12 times the light output of 18 F, which allowed for imaging with high sensitivity. As seen in Figure  5, the blood <b>vessel</b> <b>light</b> attenuation was observed using both [68 Ga]GaCl 3 and [18 F]FDG, but the image quality was much better using [68 Ga]GaCl 3 with much more extensive vasculature visible. The poor image quality of [18 F]FDG was likely due to the greatly reduced radiance {{that could only be}} partially compensated with longer exposure time (20  min vs. 5  min). Using the same imaging parameters as [68 Ga]GaCl 3 (5  min exposure and small binning) resulted in no discernible blood vessels when [18 F]FDG was injected. The data suggest that other radiotracers with high Cerenkov light output, such as 90 Y and 32 P, could also be used for negative contrast imaging of the blood vessels. Another reason for using [68 Ga]GaCl 3 for blood vessel imaging is that the radiotracer remains in the blood for a long period after injection as observed in the biodistribution shown in Figure  2. Moreover, the dynamic PET/CT in Figure  4 shows a high signal in the heart even though the biodistribution shows fairly low uptake in the heart, so it can be concluded that 68 Ga stayed in the blood with minimal uptake in the myocardium. Since light is scattered and attenuated by the tissue, the radiance at the surface as observed by the IVIS camera was fairly evenly distributed even though the distribution observed using PET was not as uniform. The distribution of radiotracer allowed for an adequate amount of light to visualize blood vessels near the surface of the skin from the neck to flank.|$|E
