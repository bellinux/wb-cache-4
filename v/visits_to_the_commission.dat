40|$|This article {{contains}} {{an interview with}} Edmond Malinvaud. Professor Malinvaud describes the origins of his interest in economics, teachers who had {{a major influence on}} his development as an economist, his <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cowles <b>Commission</b> in 1950, <b>the</b> substance of his research, and the contributions he made as a policy maker. Among the interesting tidbits in the interview is that Professor Malinvaud's popular textbooks in microeconomic theory, macroeconomics and econometrics were a direct outgrowth of courses he taught at INSEE. "I am not good at speaking," he said, "when not constrained by a written text. "...|$|R

NY Life did not agree with Fulda’s methods for success and he left the company soon after.|$|R
50|$|The {{establishment}} of a state university, Kogi State University Anyigba, is another testimony <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vision and resourcefulness. The foundation stone was laid on 30 November 1999, when former President Olusegun Obasanjo, visited the state. About a year later, <b>the</b> President returned <b>to</b> Anyigba during a state <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>commission</b> <b>the</b> University complex. According to a report of a visitation panel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> university from <b>the</b> Nigeria University <b>Commission,</b> <b>the</b> institution was then described as the fastest growing university in the country. The university received tremendous international support, which included an affiliation programme to Morgan State University Baltimore. Also, seven visiting professors from various universities in the United States were at <b>the</b> university <b>to</b> review its curriculum and align it with their own universities and prepare the students for exchange programme <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> university an international acceptability.|$|R
40|$|The {{essays in}} this volume were {{presented}} to Professor Isamu Yamada {{in honor of his}} seventy-third birthday. In view of his many professional contributions and associations, a single volume of essays is really insufficient <b>to</b> house <b>the</b> works of all those who wish {{to be part of a}} venture of this kind. Therefore, the editors would like to apologize to those friends and well-wishers of Professor Yamada who could not be accommodated {{in this volume}}. Born in Nagoya in 1909, Professor Yamada began his brilliant career at Nagoya Commercial College where he studied economics, statistics, mathematics and physics. After serving as a Professor of Economics and Statistics at Yokohama College between 1939 - 1940, Professor Yamada moved to Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, where he served as a Professor of Econometrics until his retirement in 1973. Currently, he is teaching at Asia University as a Professor of Economics and Statistics. During his long tenure at Hitotsubashi University (where Professor Ichiro Nakayama, a "Japanese Schumpeter", served as President of the University), Professor Yamada was instrumental in introducing several generation of students <b>to</b> <b>the</b> methods of modern econometrics. One of the editors (Ryuzo Sato) of this volume is a direct beneficiary of his lectures on modern econometric techniques. In the 1950 's, Professor Yamada was one of several prominent Japanese economists who were selected for study abroad. It was during this time, on a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cowles <b>Commission</b> at <b>the</b> University of Chicago, that Professor Yamada met the other editor of this volume...|$|R
40|$|I {{first visited}} St. Luke's in 1966 {{and for some}} years {{previously}} 'screened' Maltese patients referred to UX, for possible cardiac surgery. As they came individually, accompanied by a doctor and nurse, I proposed {{that it might be}} more economic if I saw a large number by paying a <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Malta. <b>The</b> High <b>Commission</b> in London doubted if I would have more than six patients so I only arranged to stay two nights and one day. I still recall 7 p. m. that one day, when after seeing 30 plus patients and feeling distinctly hypoglycaemic, Or. Captur arrived with a contingent of seven cyanosed children with complex, congenital heart lesions to round off my day's visit. Thereafter, these visits have lasted a week during which time I have been reviewing 200 - 240 patients annually. My surgical colleague Mr. Bromley started accompanying me to review postoperative patients, and now his successor, Mr. Rex Stanbridge, has taken over this task. As of 1983 I have also called in Or. Hallidie Smith as well to help with paediatric cardiology. N/...|$|R
