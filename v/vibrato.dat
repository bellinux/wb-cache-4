5|$|Hammond organs have a {{built-in}} <b>vibrato</b> effect {{that provides a}} small variation in pitch while a note is being played, and a chorus effect where a note's sound is combined with another sound at a slightly different and varying pitch. The best known <b>vibrato</b> and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of <b>vibrato</b> and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. <b>Vibrato</b> / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.|$|E
5|$|Since {{approximately}} 1850, clarinets {{have been}} nominally tuned according to twelve-tone equal temperament. Older clarinets were nominally tuned to meantone. A skilled performer can use {{his or her}} embouchure to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or produce <b>vibrato,</b> a pulsating change of pitch often employed in jazz. <b>Vibrato</b> is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as Richard Stoltzman, use <b>vibrato</b> in classical music. Special fingerings {{may be used to}} play quarter tones and other microtonal intervals.|$|E
5|$|The L-100 series entered {{production}} {{at the same time}} as the M-100. It was an economy version, with various cost-cutting changes so the organ could retail for under $1000. The <b>vibrato</b> was a simpler circuit than on other consoles and spinets. Two variations of the <b>vibrato</b> were provided, plus a chorus that mixed various <b>vibrato</b> signals together. The expression pedal, based on a cheaper design, was not as sophisticated as on the other organs. The L-100 was particularly popular in the UK and sold well, with several notable British musicians using it instead of a B-3 or C-3.|$|E

50|$|The {{story of}} The Enemys begins in Buffalo, New York in the mid-1960s, when vocalist Cory Wells joined a band called The <b>Vibratos</b> {{after leaving the}} U.S. Air Force. With the {{encouragement}} of the group’s manager, Wells headed to Los Angeles along with <b>Vibratos</b> guitar player Mike Lustan and drummer Dave Treiger. The trio recruited bass player Cal Titus and renamed themselves Cory Wells & The Enemys.|$|R

5|$|In the group's early career, Townshend favoured Rickenbacker guitars as {{they allowed}} him to fret rhythm guitar chords easily and move the neck back and {{forwards}} to create <b>vibrato.</b> From 1968 to 1973, he favoured a Gibson SG Special live, and later used customised Les Pauls in different tunings.|$|E
5|$|The B-2 and C-2, {{introduced}} in 1949, allowed <b>vibrato</b> to be enabled or disabled on each manual separately. In 1954, the B-3 and C-3 models were introduced {{with the additional}} harmonic percussion feature. Despite several attempts by Hammond to replace them, these two models remained popular and stayed in continuous production through early 1975.|$|E
5|$|The contact call {{is a very}} quiet, {{thin and}} high-pitched sit, but the most {{distinctive}} call is a penetrating tsree, with a <b>vibrato</b> quality, sometimes repeated {{as a series of}} notes. The male's song begins with srrih, srrih followed in turn by a few twittering notes, a longer descending ripple, and a whistle that falls and then rises.|$|E

5000|$|The JazzTimes {{review by}} Lyn Horton notes [...] "Distinguishing Tyler, from Ayler, is the sourness of his flourishes. He avoids lengthy arpeggios, but tends towards eerie high tension phrases, <b>vibratos</b> and nearly {{realized}} melodies." ...|$|R

5|$|The song is a {{love song}} {{composed}} in the key of E major. It is written in common time and moves slowly at 69 beats per minute. Stefani avoids the heavy vocal <b>vibrato</b> that she often uses. Her vocal range spans under an octave and a half during the song, from F#3 to B4.|$|E
5|$|The song {{begins with}} austere, {{classical}} strings while the chord progression emphasizes tonic, submediant and flattened leading-tone chords. For the second phrase, {{which includes a}} dramatic crescendo, rhythm and ambient electronic effects are added gradually. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors from Madonna's Drowned Worlds, commented that the song is strongly inspired by different forms of classical music, notably contemporary classical music such as neoromanticism, as well as Italian opera composers and pieces such as Puccini's Madama Butterfly and Verdi's Aïda. Madonna's vocals throughout the song lack <b>vibrato,</b> and have drawn comparisons to medieval music.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} team undertook {{a study in}} 2016 to understand the appeal behind Mercury's voice. Led by Professor Christian Herbst, the team identified his notably faster <b>vibrato</b> and use of subharmonics as unique characteristics of Mercury's voice, particularly in comparison to opera singers, and confirmed a vocal range from F#2 to G5 (just over 3 octaves) but were unable to confirm claims of a 4-octave range. The {{research team}} studied vocal samples from 23 commercially available Queen recordings, his solo work, {{and a series of}} interviews of the late artist. They also used an endoscopic video camera to study a rock singer brought in to imitate Mercury's singing voice.|$|E
5000|$|The {{performance}} {{also includes}} {{what is often}} referred to as the 'speaking in tongues' version of [...] "Sisters of the Moon", in which Nicks delivers the song's coda in such intense gravelly <b>vibratos</b> that her words are rendered mysteriously indecipherable.|$|R
5000|$|Ibanez Edge is Ibanezs Floyd Rose variant. There are 4 primary versions: Edge, LoPro Edge, EdgePro, and EdgeZero with {{numbered}} variants denoting budget {{models of}} the main lines, and also [...] "Double" [...] variants of many of these, the moniker denoting the inclusion of Piezo pickups. The Edge and LoPro Edge were discontinued in 2003 but were subsequently reintroduced on the signature models of Steve Vai and Joe Satriani. (Some special edition guitars used these trems prior to their reintroduction, however the <b>vibratos</b> used were NOS, rather than production runs) These two <b>vibratos,</b> whether old or new, bear a mark of Floyd Rose Licensing, as they are produced using the same tooling, by Japanese guitar parts manufacturer Gotoh.|$|R
50|$|Warren’s own label, Waffles Music, has {{released}} three albums by his band The <b>Vibratos</b> (The Ghost Of Old Compton Street, Tornado Alley and The Cappuccino Kid), collaborations with Mark Griffiths (Close To The Hedge) and Ben Marvin (Zookeeper) and a solo album 'Left To My Own Devices'.|$|R
5|$|After {{returning}} to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup {{in the neck}} position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose <b>vibrato</b> unit (for Open C and Open B tuning, respectively).|$|E
5|$|The basic {{component}} {{sound of a}} Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a sine wave. When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the <b>vibrato</b> system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups, it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vibrato</b> is a {{technique}} in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. <b>Vibrato</b> is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. <b>Vibrato</b> occurs naturally and {{is the result of}} proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus. Some studies have shown that <b>vibrato</b> {{is the result of a}} neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of <b>vibrato</b> to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge. Some singers use <b>vibrato</b> as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich <b>vibrato.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "scooped out" [...] {{nature of}} {{scalloped}} fingerboards creates {{a number of}} changes in the way the guitar plays. Most obvious, is that the fingertip only contacts the string, not the fingerboard itself, creating less friction for bends and <b>vibratos,</b> which results in more overall control while playing.|$|R
5000|$|Raymond Burke {{played in}} the Dixieland style. According to Charles Suhor, Dixieland is {{characterized}} by [...] "more conventional tones of wind instruments, rejection of rapid <b>vibratos,</b> greater instrumental facility, and considerable attention to solos, which are routinely 'passed around' in between opening and closing ensemble choruses." [...] Burke's repertoire consisted primarily of old standards.|$|R
5000|$|Following his {{military}} tour of duty, Wells returned to Buffalo and {{was asked to}} join a band named the <b>Vibratos.</b> Gene Jacobs, the brother-in-law of the <b>Vibratos</b> guitar player, Mike Lustan, suggested {{to him that the}} <b>Vibratos</b> travel to California if they were serious about making it in music. They took his advice and changed the name of the band to [...] "The Enemys." [...] They soon began working the clubs in Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas and Sacramento, and they became the house band at the Whisky a Go Go. They were also featured in the television shows The Beverly Hillbillies, Burke's Law, Riot on Sunset Strip, and the film Harper, with Paul Newman and Shelley Winters. While at the Whisky a Go Go, Cher asked the band to tour with Sonny & Cher. It was on this tour that Wells met Danny Hutton, a former songwriter/performer for Hanna-Barbera Productions who became his future partner in the rock band Three Dog Night. The Enemys had minor hits with recordings of [...] "Hey Joe" [...] and [...] "Sinner Man". Wells moved to Phoenix in 1967 where he formed The Cory Wells Blues Band, whose bass player was future Three Dog Night bass player, Joe Schermetzler (stage name Joe Schermie). In 1968, Wells returned to Hollywood where he [...] "couch-surfed" [...] while Danny Hutton worked to convince him of the feasibility of forming a group with three lead singers and a back-up band.|$|R
25|$|<b>Vibrato</b> is a {{technique}} of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies subtly in a pulsating rhythm. While {{various parts of the}} hand or arm may be involved in the motion, the end result is a movement of the fingertip bringing about a slight change in vibrating string length, which causes an undulation in pitch. Some violinists oscillate backwards, or lower in pitch from the actual note when using <b>vibrato,</b> since it is believed that perception favors the highest pitch in a varying sound. <b>Vibrato</b> does little, if anything, to disguise an out-of-tune note; in other words, misapplied <b>vibrato</b> is a poor substitute for good intonation. Scales and other exercises meant to work on intonation are typically played without <b>vibrato</b> to make the work easier and more effective. Music students are often taught that unless otherwise marked in music, <b>vibrato</b> is assumed. However, it has to be noted that this is only a trend; there is nothing on the sheet music that compels violinists to add <b>vibrato.</b> This can be an obstacle to a classically trained violinist wishing to play in a style that uses little or no <b>vibrato</b> at all, such as baroque music played in period style and many traditional fiddling styles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vibrato</b> {{can also}} be used for a fast trill. A trill {{initiated}} from just hammering the finger {{up and down on the}} fingerboard will create a harsher quality than with a <b>vibrato</b> trill. For example, if trilling on the first finger, the second finger is placed very slightly off the string and <b>vibrato</b> is implemented. The second finger will lightly touch the string above the first finger causing the pitch to change. This has a softer quality and many think it is nicer-sounding than a hammered trill. Note: this trill technique only works well for semi-tonal trills, it is far more difficult to <b>vibrato</b> trill for an interval of a tone or more.|$|E
25|$|As regards effects, he {{has made}} {{significant}} use of modulation and <b>vibrato</b> type effects pedals, most notably the Univibe and emulations thereof.|$|E
50|$|Nicholson used a flute made by George Astor & Co., a London-based firm {{operating}} from c1778 to c1831. His father, also a celebrated flautist, modified the instrument, lining the headpiece with metal, enlarging the embouchure and toneholes {{with a view}} to making the flute's tone more powerful, yet still delicate, permitting the usual fingerings in the third octave, facilitating glides and <b>vibratos.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{favorable}} review from CD Universe said, [...] "The Jets' gem 'You've Got It All' shines brightly as ever with Britney's girlish allure. Take note, however, that Britney's not all bubbles—with {{an obvious}} influence from Mariah Carey, she glides quite ably through the key changes and delivers octave leaps and <b>vibratos</b> that should melt {{just about any}} heart, young or old." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{actual sound}} that is {{produced}} by playing {{is different from the}} strict and predesignated sound of most music. Shout band music is made to closely emulate the exact sound and techniques used by the voices of singers and choirs, including but not limited to <b>vibratos,</b> slurs, and glissandi. This is the primary reason that a trombone is typically found as the lead instrument.|$|R
25|$|The violin {{had four}} strings, with an octave {{available}} on each string, and could reproduce 64 notes. All four strings could be played simultaneously. This allowed {{the possibility of}} four-part independent counterpoint. A <b>vibrato</b> could be produced.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the samples}} are {{recorded}} in different pitches, pitch conversion is required when concatenating the samples. The engine calculates a desired pitch from the notes, attack time, and <b>vibrato</b> parameters, and then selects the necessary {{samples from the}} library.|$|E
25|$|Earliest {{examples}} of tracker chiptunes {{date back to}} 1989 and are attributed to the demoscene musicians 4mat, Baroque, TDK, Turtle and Duz. Tracker chiptunes are based on very short looped waveforms which are modulated by tracker effects such as arpeggio, <b>vibrato,</b> and portamento.|$|E
5000|$|Celine Dion {{played in}} May 1995 where she sold out {{and many people}} waited outside to hear her perform {{this was also the}} show that debued her first ever show in London She {{performed}} I Can't Help Falling In Love With You a cover of Elvis Presley's classic song where she hit a stunning G5 with sustained <b>vibratos</b> and melismas although her Glasgow concert was widely regarded as her finest on her tour.|$|R
5000|$|On {{both sides}} of the yangqin, aside from the tuning screws, are {{numerous}} cylindrical metal Nuts that can be moved for fine tuning the strings or to raise the strings slightly to eliminate unwanted vibrations that may occur. More modern designs also have moveable ball-shaped nuts that can be adjusted on the fly with the fingers; this provides some microtuning and additional dynamics during performances, such as portamentos and <b>vibratos</b> (see below: [...] "Manner of Performance").|$|R
5000|$|Vietnamese-Australian music {{includes}} tân nhạc, a form {{of popular}} music that {{has been part of}} the music of Vietnam since the late 1930s. Elements of the vocal style, such as the use of <b>vibratos</b> and bent tones, are common Vietnamese techniques, while Western meter, rhythms, tonal harmony, temperament and song form (ABA) are also used [...] Ensembles are generally made up of electric guitars, keyboards and a drum kit. Rhythms often used Latin or European dance rhythms like the tango, cha cha cha, waltz or bolero.|$|R
