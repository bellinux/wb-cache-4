40|$|The austenite-to-ferrite phase transformation, {{which is}} an {{inherent}} feature of low-alloyed ultra low carbon steels, has scarcely been investigated to control surface texture and microstructure evolution. This paper investigates the systematic evolution of texture and microstructure at the metal-vapour interface during <b>interrupted</b> annealing in <b>vacuum.</b> <b>Interrupted</b> annealing experiments were carried out on three ultra low carbon steel sheets alloyed with Mn, Al and Si. The texture and microstructures have been investigated by X-ray diffraction and SEM-EBSD techniques. These results reveal a very clear variation in the surface texture components {{as well as in}} the surface microstructure after BCC recrystallisation and double α−γ−α transformation interrupted annealing. The recrystallisation texture consists mainly of a //ND fibre, while the transformation texture at the surface exhibits a / / ND fibre in combination with components of the //ND fibre. It has been revealed that the latter specific surface texture was present in a monolayer of outer surface grains which were in direct contact with the vapour atmosphere. This observed phenomenon could be explained by considering the role of surface energy anisotropy occurring during phase transformation annealing. ITRODUCTIO...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{disclosure}} {{is to provide a}} vacuum hold-down for holding thin sheets to a support surface, which permits the thin sheet to change dimensions as it is held down. The hold-down includes numerous holes in the support surface, through which a vacuum is applied from a vacuum source. The holes are arranged in zones. The <b>vacuum</b> is repeatedly <b>interrupted</b> at only one or a few zones, while it continues to be applied to other zones, to allow the workpiece to creep along that <b>interrupted</b> zone. The <b>vacuum</b> to different zones is interrupted at different times, as by a slowly turning valve number, to allow each zone of the workpiece to creep. A positive pressure may be applied from a pressured air source to a zone when the <b>vacuum</b> is <b>interrupted</b> there, to help lift the corresponding workpiece zone off the surface to aid in creeping. The workpiece may undergo dimensional changes because of heating, cooling, drying, or other procedure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{results of}} {{electro-discharge}} proc-esses in vacuum arc interrupters on the developed and constructed synthetic test stand are described. The stand ensures a current amplitude up to 100 kA {{with a duration}} of 10 ± 1 ms at a voltage up to 5 kV and an amplitude of transient recovery voltage up to 40 kV. It contains two circuits working synchro-nously: a current pulse generator with the total capacity of 0. 073 F (with a power of ~ 0. 9 MJ at 5 kV) and a voltage pulse generator with an operating volt-age 40 kV (with the power equal to 0. 32 MJ at 40 kV). There is also a complex of control and measuring equipment which allows one to register current through the circuit-breaker being tested, measure arc voltage when the circuit-breaker contacts are opened and determine the form of the transient recovery voltage curve. The research carried out has allowed constructing a <b>vacuum</b> arc <b>interrupter</b> with a rated voltage of 10 kV, a rated current of 3, 150 A, a rated short-circuit breaking current of 40 kA and a vacuum circuit breaker VVE-(S) M- 10 - 40 / 3150 on its basis. We have also constructed a small-sized <b>vacuum</b> arc <b>interrupter</b> with an oper-ating voltage of 10 kV, a rated current of 1000 A, a rated short-circuit breaking current of 20 kA and on its basis a small-sized vacuum circuit-breaker of the VBSK- 10 - 20 / 1000 kind weighing 36 kg. 1...|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> can {{abruptly}} terminate {{current flow}} in a circuit, special measures {{may be required}} to prevent transient over voltages from current chopping.|$|E
50|$|Since the arc {{is entirely}} {{contained}} within the interrupter, switch-gear using vacuum interrupters can be very compact compared with switch-gear using air or oil as the arc suppression medium. New metal-clad medium-voltage switch-gear now predominantly uses vacuum interrupters, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> retrofits for air circuit breaker switch-gear are available. Vacuum interrupters {{can be used for}} circuit breakers and load switches. Circuit breaker vacuum interrupters are mainly used in the power sector in the substation and power grid facilities, while load switching <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> is mainly used for power grid of the end user.|$|E
50|$|Components of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> must be {{thoroughly}} cleaned before assembly since any contaminants could emit gas into the vacuum envelope.

40|$|An {{effective}} and fast procedure is presented for mak-ing transparent casts of hard substrates such as bones, rock, shells, and wood. The procedure {{is based on}} a two-component epoxy (Epofix) that is especially suitable for cold mounting, avoiding heat, and limiting pressure impregnation that might damage fragile substrates. Crit-ical to successful casting is the use of a vacuum cham-ber or a vacuum desiccator during early hardening to eliminate air bubbles. The <b>vacuum</b> is <b>interrupted</b> and turned on again to force air out and epoxy into blind-ending cavities; this action may be repeated. Afterward, the hardening takes place at atmospheric pressure. Unlike other embedding procedures, neither infiltration phases nor acetone “boiling ” are necessary to produce detailed casts that are suitable for studies at micron scale and for long-term use...|$|R

The parasitic higher order modes (HOM) resonances excited by the beam may lead to multiturn instability phenomena in small storage rings, which limit the performance of the machine in terms of stored current. In this paper I calculate the possible parasitic resonances in the DAΦNE accumulator ring and discuss their impact on the beam dynamics. I also suggest a method to fight a dangerous parasitic HOM, if necessary...|$|R

5|$|Between 1877 and 1931, Albert A. Michelson made {{multiple}} {{measurements of}} the speed of light. His 1877–79 measurements were performed under the auspices of Simon Newcomb, who was also working on measuring the speed of light. Michelson's setup incorporated several refinements on Foucault's original arrangement. As seen in Figure5, Michelson placed the rotating mirror R near the principal focus of lens L (i.e. the focal point given incident parallel rays of light). If the rotating mirror R were exactly at the principal focus, the moving image of the slit would remain upon the distant plane mirror M (equal in diameter to lens L) as long as the axis of the pencil of light remained on the lens, this being true regardless of the RM distance. Michelson was thus able to increase the RM distance to nearly 2000feet. To achieve a reasonable value for the RS distance, Michelson used an extremely long focal length lens (150feet) and compromised on the design by placing R about 15feet closer to L than the principal focus. This allowed an RS distance of between 28.5 to 33.3feet. He used carefully calibrated tuning forks to monitor the rotation rate of the air-turbine-powered mirror R, and he would typically measure displacements of the slit image on the order of 115mm. His 1879 figure for the speed of light, 299944±51km/s, was within about 0.05% of the modern value. His 1926 repeat of the experiment incorporated still further refinements {{such as the use of}} polygonal prism-shaped rotating mirrors (enabling a brighter image) having from eight through sixteen facets and a 22mile baseline surveyed to fractional parts-per-million accuracy. His figure of 299,796±4km/s was only about 4km/s higher than the current accepted value. Michelson's final 1931 attempt to measure the speed of light in <b>vacuum</b> was <b>interrupted</b> by his death. Although his experiment was completed posthumously by F.G.Pease and F.Pearson, various factors militated against a measurement of highest accuracy, including an earthquake which disturbed the baseline measurement.|$|R

40|$|Vacuum interrupters {{occasionally}} show unexpected (late) breakdown after current interruption. As a result, the interrupter conducts briefly, {{carrying a}} high-frequency current {{due to the}} discharge of various (stray) capacitances {{in the vicinity of}} the interrupter. Thanks to the capability of <b>vacuum</b> interrupters to <b>interrupt</b> such high-frequency current, the conduction period is normally very short (normally in the order of 10 µs). In the discussion around the assessment of such late breakdowns (often termed nonsustained disruptive discharges in the standardization literature) regarding the possibility of generation of overvoltage in capacitive circuits, the duration of the conductive period is an important parameter. Experiments were carried out, in which discharges of various single frequencies (72 kHz- 1. 1 MHz) were generated following breakdown (spontaneous breakdowns as well as prestrike) of two commercial vacuum breakers. It is demonstrated that the duration of the discharge depends strongly on the discharge current frequency. At higher frequencies, the duration of the discharge tends to be shorter than at lower frequencies. For practical circuits, allowing simultaneous discharge from various circuit parts, it was observed that the highest frequency component determines the arc duration. Duration of up to 15 µs was observed. This duration is too short to allow significant overvoltages to develop in standard capacitive power delivery circuits...|$|R
50|$|In circuit breakers, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> contact {{materials}} are mostly copper-chromium alloy, copper and chromium each 50%. These {{may be made}} by welding a copper-chrome alloy sheet on {{the upper and lower}} contacts surface over a contact seat made of oxygen-free copper. Other {{materials are}} used in other interrupter designs, such as silver, tungsten and tungsten compounds, and others.|$|E
50|$|The {{contacts}} {{carry the}} circuit current when closed, and form the terminals of the arc when opening the circuit. Contacts {{are made of}} different materials depending on {{the application of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> and selection of the design for long contact life, rapid recovery of voltage withstand rating, and control of over-voltage due to current chopping.|$|E
50|$|Glass-ceramic-to-metal seals offer {{superior}} properties {{over their}} glass equivalents including more refractory behaviour, {{in addition to}} their ability to seal successfully to many different metals and alloys. They have been used in electrical feed-through seals for such applications as <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> envelopes and pyrotechnic actuators, in addition to many applications where a higher temperature capability than is possible with glass-to-metal seals is required, including solid oxide fuel cells.|$|E
50|$|Some {{designs of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> have simple butt contacts, but {{generally}} the contacts are shaped {{to improve their}} ability to break very heavy currents. Slots, ridges, or grooves are formed in the contacts. Arc current flowing through the shaped contacts generate magnetic forces on the arc column which cause the arc contact spot to move rapidly {{over the surface of}} the contact. This reduces contact wear due to erosion by the arc, which melts the contact metal at the point of contact.|$|E
5000|$|Now {{the main}} {{manufacturers}} of <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> are General Electric (GE), Westinghouse Electric (WH), Jucro Electric, Cooper Electric and Jenning ELectric.GEC company (later incorporated into France Alsthom, AREVA)Seimens company, AEG (later incorporated into France Alsthom, AREVA) and Calor-Emag (later incorporated into ABB), the technology source come from United States and United Kingdom.Toshiba company, MEIDENSHA CORPORATION, Fuji company, Hitachi and Mitsubishi etc., their products are longitudinal magnetic field structure, but {{each has its}} own characteristics, but which Toshiba is the most representative.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} requirements {{apply to}} contact materials:1. High breaking ability. Requirements excellent conductivity of the material, small thermal conductivity, bigger heat capacity, low hot electron emission capability.2. Requirements High breakdown voltage. 3. High resistance to electrical erosion. 4. Resistance to welding.5. Low cutoff current value.6. Low gas content. The low gas content {{is a requirement}} for all materials used inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> Especially copper, must require low air content of the special process to deal with oxygen-free copper. While the solder is used silver-copper alloy.|$|E
50|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> {{will have}} {{internal}} shields around the contacts {{and at the}} ends of the interrupter. The shields stop any contact material vaporized during the arc from condensing {{on the inside of the}} vacuum envelope. This would reduce the insulation strength of the envelope and ultimately would result in a flash-over of the interrupter when open. The shield material also helps control the shape of the electric field distribution inside the interrupter, which contributes to a higher open-circuit withstand voltage rating. Additionally, the shield system helps absorb some of the energy produced in the arc, increasing the interrupting rating of the device.|$|E
50|$|Many {{manufacturing}} variations exist, but {{in general}} a <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> will have a fixed contact, a moving contact, a flexible bellows to allow movement of the moving contact, and arc shields, enclosed in a hermetic glass, ceramic or metal housing that is evacuated to a high vacuum. The moving contact is connected by a flexible braid to the external circuit, and is moved by an actuating mechanism when the device is required to open or close. Since air pressure tends to close the contacts, the operating mechanism must hold the contacts open against the inherent closing force of air pressure on the bellows.|$|E
50|$|The {{enclosure}} of the interrupter is made {{of glass}} or ceramic. To ensure that the interrupter vacuum is maintained {{over the life of}} the device, there must be hermetic seals between metal and ceramic components. The enclosure material must be impermeable to gas and must not give off trapped gas over its lifetime. The function of the stainless steel bellows not only isolates the vacuum state inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> from the external atmosphere, but also moves the movable contact with the conductor within a specified range to complete the closing and breaking of the vacuum switch operating.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> uses a {{high vacuum}} to {{extinguish}} the arc between {{a pair of}} contacts. As the contacts move apart, the current flows through a small area. There is {{a sharp increase in}} resistance between the contacts and the temperature at the contact surface increases rapidly until the occurrence of electrode metal evaporation. At the same time, the electric field is very high across the small contact gap. The breakdown of the gap produces a vacuum arc. As the alternating current passes through a zero, and the gap between the fixed and moving contact widens, the conductive plasma produced by the arc moves away from the gap and becomes non-conductive. The current is interrupted, unless the impressed voltage is large enough to break down the wider gap of the open contacts.|$|E
40|$|A {{resistive}} superconducting {{fault-current limiter}} (SFCL) {{has been developed}} using round magnesium diboride (MgB 2) wire. The SFCL coil was wound using an interleaved coil arrangement to minimize the total coil inductance. The SFCL coil demonstrated reliable and repeatable current-limiting properties during testing. However, the wire temperature of the SFCL coil increases quickly during quench tests, and several minutes are required for temperature recovery after the fault is cleared. The SFCL coil therefore was fully integrated with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> to quickly remove the SFCL coil from the circuit once a fault occurred. This allowed the SFCL coil to recover quickly while a bypass resistor acted as the current limiting resistance. A fast-acting actuator and its control circuit were designed and built to provide automatic control for {{the operation of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> The SFCL with the prototype <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> was successfully tested. The energy dissipated in the SFCL coil was significantly reduced by integrating the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> The fault tests with different potential fault currents also proved that the operation of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> is independent of the fault current level. This prototype demonstrated the potential of a cost-effective and compact integrated SFCL and <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> for power system applications...|$|E

40|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> is {{extensively}} {{employed in}} the medium voltage switchgear for the interruption of the short-circuit current. The voltage across the arc during current interruption is termed as the arc voltage. The nature and magnitude of this arc voltage {{is indicative of the}} performance of the contacts and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> as a whole. Also, the arc voltage depends on the parameters like the magnitude of short-circuit current, the arcing time, the point of opening of the contacts, the geometry and area of the contacts and the type of magnetic field. This paper investigates the dependency of the arc voltage on some of these parameters. The paper also discusses the usefulness of the arc voltage in diagnosing the performance of the contacts...|$|E
40|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> is a {{switching}} device used in vacuum circuit breakers, which are widely employed in medium voltage circuits for interrupting the short-circuit fault currents. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> is the chamber {{in which the}} arc extinction and hence the current interruption takes place. On the occurrence of a fault, the breaker mechanism separates the contacts of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> As the contacts separate, an arc is established between the contacts. The arc evolves in the contact space and extinguishes {{at or near the}} current zero, thus interrupting the current. The processes of arc ignition, evolution and extinction are very complex. These processes are fundamental to the design and the performance of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> and hence the circuit breaker. The evolution of the arc predominantly depends on the short-circuit current, the design and metallurgy of the contacts. The evolution of the vacuum arc has been the focal point of considerable research activity. Significant effort has been concentrated to understand the various modes of the arc, the transition between the modes, the arc movement and the dependency on the contact design and finally the effect of the arc evolution on the current interruption performance of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> The voltage across the contacts during the arcing, termed as the arc voltage, has been a focal point of several research projects. Research has shown that the arc voltage depends strongly on the mode and the evolution process of the arc. The dependency is observed with respect to the magnitude {{and the nature of the}} arc voltage. This dependency has been established through the comparison of the arc voltage trace and the actual arc photographs. The arc voltage is thus an important parameter in understanding the arcing process in the interrupter. Arc voltage could also be utilised to compare the arcing behaviour in vacuum interrupters with different contact geometries and metallurgies. Having understood how the arc voltage depends on the arc modes and how it can be used to analyse the arcing performance of the interrupter, this work aims to establish experimentally the dependency of the arc voltage on fundamental parameters of the short-circuit current and the contact design. The variation of the arc voltage is studied with respect to the magnitude of the short-circuit current. It is seen that the magnitude of the arc voltage is higher, for a higher short-circuit current. This dependency is also reflected in the nature of the arc voltage waveform. The effect of cumulative short- circuit operations has been understood through the study of arc voltage variation with respect to the accumulated arcing time. It has been found that the arc voltage consistently decreases as the accumulated arcing time increases. The effect of the contact diameter on the arc evolution has been studied by comparing the arc voltage variations for contacts of different diameters for the same short-circuit current. It is observed that the variation of arc voltage with respect to the contact diameter depends on the type of contact. In the case of radial magnetic field contacts, it has been observed that the arc voltage is lower for a contact with lower diameter. Whereas in the case of axial magnetic field contacts there is an inverse relation between the contact diameter and the arc voltage. Finally, the effect of the type and distribution of the magnetic field on the arc voltage variation as well as the contact erosion has been studied. In general, the observations show that the arc voltage magnitude for the radial magnetic field geometry is higher than the axial magnetic field geometry. Also, there is a significant difference in the appearance of the arc voltage waveforms for the arcs under the two types of magnetic fields. Finite element simulations and short-circuit evaluations have shown that the axial magnetic field contact system with 90 deg coil orientations yield a more uniform distribution of the flux density and hence lower erosion of the contacts. These results show a clear dependence of the arc voltage on the various above mentioned parameters. Thus the arc voltage could be utilised as a diagnostic parameter during the evaluation of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter.</b> In the present scenario, significant research is being done to increase the breaking capacity of the interrupters. This calls for optimization of design of the existing contacts and the design of novel contact geometries. The arc voltage would be used as an important diagnostic tool in this process. Also, the utilization of <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> in high voltage and extra high voltage circuits is being explored. This application requires increase in the contact gap or series connection of gaps. The arc behaviour in longer gaps and gaps connected in series would be an important research area. Again the arc voltage could be used to study the arc evolution in these specialised conditions. The experiments in this research work have been performed on commercial vacuum interrupters. For a dedicated research on vacuum arcs and <b>vacuum</b> <b>interrupter</b> contacts, development of a vacuum arc research facility has also been attempted as a part of this research work...|$|E
