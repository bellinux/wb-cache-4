This paper proposes to use extended histograms (so-called VUlists) for characterizing model parameters that are associated with workload uncertainty and/or variability. Existing analysis techniques have to be extended to allow VU-lists as input parameters. A requirement for an algorithm to handle VU-lists is its capability to analyze interval parameterized models.

Except in a few instances, mean concentrations are typically between 0 and 5 ppb. Significant <b>variabilities</b> <b>in</b> atmospheric concentrations associated with intense sources and adverse meteorological conditions are shown to exist.

It is natural to expect that the mechanism driving <b>variabilities</b> <b>in</b> BHBs and AGNs may operate in a black hole hyper-accretion disk, which is believed to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

It is found that the variabilities of jet power and the temporal profile of erratic spikes in this scenario are similar to those in observed light curves of prompt gamma-ray emission of GRBs.
