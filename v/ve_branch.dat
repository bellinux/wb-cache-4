Estas aves tiveram seu sistema {{arterial}} preenchido com solução aquosa a 50 % de Neoprene Látex “ 450 ”, corada com pigmento específi co, em seguida foram fi xadas em solução aquosa de formol a 10 % e submetidas à dissecação. Verifi cou-se que a bolsa cloacal é suprida por ramos diretos das artérias bursocloacal direita, em 29 casos (96, 67 %), bursocloacal esquerda, em 28 casos (93, 33 %), cloacal direita, em 13 casos (43, 33 %) e cloacal esquerda, em 15 casos (50 %). O número de ramos cedidos pelas artérias, independente da sua origem, variou de 2 a 6 ramos, sendo dois ramos em 5 casos (16, 67 %), três ramos em 14 casos (46, 67 %), quatro ramos em 3 casos (10 %), cinco ramos em 6 casos (20 %) e seis ramos em 1 caso (3, 33 %). Foi possível observar que a distribuição dos vasos arteriais que suprem a bolsa cloacal deu-se de maneira própria para cada um dos exemplares investigados. _________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTA {{study has}} been carried out on the origin, number and disposition of the arterial branches supplying the cloacal bursas of 30 female fowl (Gallus gallus) of the Lhoman White LSL lineage, aged between eight and ten weeks. The right isquiadic artery was cannulated and injected with a 50 % colored solution of Neoprene latex “ 450 ”. Next, the samples were fi xed with a 10 % formalin solution through deep intramuscular, subcutaneous and intracavitary injections for a period of at least 48 hours. Dissections confi rmed that the cloacal bursa was supplied by direct branches from the right bursocloacal arteries in 29 cases (96. 67 %), the left bursocloacal arteries in 28 cases (93. 33 %), the right cloacal arteries in 13 cases (43. 33 %), and the left cloacal arteries in 15 cases (50 %). The number of branches from the arteries, independent of their origin, varied from two to six. There were two branches in 5 cases (16. 67 %), three branches in 14 cases (46. 67 %), four branches in 3 cases (10 %), fi <b>ve</b> <b>branches</b> in 6 cases (20 %), and six branches in 1 case (3. 33 %).

The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] trade union Solidarity, {{formerly known as the}} South African Mine Workers’ Union, is apparently the fi rst union in the country to create its own, private welfare department. Established in 1949, the original aim of the Helping Hand fund was to fi nancially assist Afrikaner mineworkers who became unfi t for work due to work-related disabilities. Between 1949 and 1997, the department’s welfare assistance schemes had had varied successes although its welfare fund grew steadily, and at times, even spectacularly. One of these early enterprises, which had limited success, was the founding of the Transvaal Doll and Ornament Company in Alberton. The proceeds of this dollmaking factory were utilised as a supplementary income for widows whose husbands had become victims of miners’ phthisis. However, {{due to a lack of}} entrepreneurial experience and capital the company was liquidated in 1951. Since 1997, under the management of Flip Buys, the union had been restructured and subsequently it was renamed Solidarity. The restructuring of the welfare department in particular was based on the Israeli Histadrut. The Histadrut is a labour service delivery organisation with interests in education, job creation, general services, sports, trade and industry, insurance and health and pension schemes. Although there were many differences between the Israeli labour situation and that of South Africa, Buys was convinced that Solidarity could learn from the experience of the Histadrut and base its own plans for the future on that model. In 2001 Solidarity’s welfare department was relaunched as Solidarity Helping Hand. Various factors contributed to this initiative. State welfare spending became racially biased. In Gauteng Province, for instance, welfare subsidies to organisations which had catered for poor whites were phased out. Affi rmative action policies contributed to a renewed poor white problem. This in turn aggravated the housing and food needs of such persons. In its new structure the Helping Hand initiated various innovative projects and also extended its scope of welfare assistance to the wider Afrikaans-speaking community. In terms of social welfare it has been transformed into a successful community based welfare organisation. In 2005 Solidarity Helping Hand was registered with the Department of Welfare as a non-profi t Article 21 company. Among other things, its projects included food relief schemes for white squatter camps and school feeding schemes for Afrikaner poor white children, as well as material assistance to old age and children’s homes. For instance, in 2005, with the liquidation of the DRD goldmine at Stilfontein, Solidarity Helping Hand became involved, in conjunction with the Stilfontein community, in a food relief scheme that supported approximately 3000 persons for fi ve months. A Solidarity Helping Hand Bursary Fund was established in 2003. By 2007 bursaries to the value of R 1. 2 million had already been paid out to 377 students whose parents were members of Solidarity. In 2009 the bursary scheme was extended. A Solidarity Helping Hand Afrikaans Bursary and Professional Training Institute were launched in order to give prospective Afrikaans students access to a larger variety of bursaries. By 2009, 60 years after its humble beginnings in 1949, Solidarity Helping Hand had grown into an organisation with 21 staff members employed both in its head offi ce in Pretoria and a regional offi ce in the Western Cape. Twenty fi <b>ve</b> <b>branches</b> have also been established all over South Africa. In an era of inadequate service delivery by the state, also in terms of welfare services, the Helping Hand has achieved a proud track record of comprehensive and praiseworthy welfare projects. Its stated objective is to be a future-driven organisation which functions within a Christian value system and strives to break the circle of poverty. Afrikaans communities should be equipped to fi nd solutions for the welfare needs in their environment. According to Buys, people should be empowered rather than become part of a welfare state and dependent on state welfare. For Solidarity’s Helping Hand the solution, therefore, is self-help.

40|$|Rehabilitation {{of major}} resections {{of the tongue}} has always posed a serious problem. This paper {{presents}} the feasibility and rationale of rehabilitating partial glossectomies {{by the use of}} the pectoralis major myocutaneous fl ap and the fabrication of a “new tongue ” by the use of this fl ap. The criteria for these techniques in benign and malignant tumors of the tongue are outlined. The segmental innervation of the pectoralis major muscle from a variety of three to fi <b>ve</b> nerve <b>branches</b> permits the development of a skin-muscle fl ap that may be transposed with its nerve supply intact or totally denervated, depending upon the status of the hypoglossal nerves and tongue in the operative fi eld. This presents the possibility of transposing a skin-muscle fl ap into a glossal wound with a completely intact nerve supply where the new fl ap is under constant instruction in its new physiologic environ-ment. It also presents the possibility of neurotization of the denervated section of the muscle fl ap by axones from the intact segment of tongue. A third possibility is the fabrication of a “new tongue ” by the transfer of the hypo glossal nerves into the denervated segment of the peripheral aspect of the myocutaneous fl ap. This variety and combi-nation of rehabilitative techniques introduces a new phase into the rehabilitation of the tongue The tounge is the most essential organ in the oral cavity. It is re-sponsible for moving the blous for food or liquid through the oral cavity into the mesopharynx. It assists in molding and beautify-ing the human voice. It is essentially a mass of highly specialized muscle, covered with epithelium, nourished by a rich blood su-plly through the lingual arteries, and contains the sensibilities of taste and contact. Although the tounge has an astounding capaci-ty for adaption after injury or resection, there are well-recognized circumstances that may cause severe crippling. Its physiologic essentiality is matched by a strong emotional interest {{on the part of the}} surgeon in preserving its integrity. There are criteria that support the operationg of partial nd total glossectomy, and this paper will deal with this problem and propose a new method of rehabilitation...|$|R
