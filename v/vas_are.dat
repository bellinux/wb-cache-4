Other studies uncovered the potential of VA to interfere with multiple regulatory mechanisms besides HDACs, as the GSK 3 alpha and beta, Akt, ERK and phosphoinositol pathways, tricarboxylic acid cycle, GABA and OXPHOS system. The review focuses on the mechanisms of action of VA, showing that HDAC inhibitors, as <b>VA,</b> can <b>be</b> successfully used in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. This molecule, whose biological activities range from interactions with receptors and ion channels to the regulation of many catalytic reactions, has a central role in cellular cascades that regulate gene expression. Thus, inhibitors of HDACs, by positively affecting both neuronal degeneration and cognitive deficits, appear as promising drugs against various pathological conditions and neurodegenerative diseases. <b>VA</b> <b>is</b> known to present anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties.

40|$|Stable self-trapped vortex annuli (VAs) {{with large}} values of topological charge S (giant <b>VAs)</b> <b>are</b> {{not only a}} subject of {{fundamental}} interest, but are also sought for various applications, such as quantum information processing and storage. However, in conventional atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) VAs with S> 1 are unstable. Here, we demonstrate that robust self-trapped fundamental solitons (with S= 0) and bright VAs (with the stability checked up to S= 5), can be created in the free space {{by means of the}} local-field effect (the feedback of the BEC on the propagation of electromagnetic waves) in a condensate of two-level atoms coupled by a microwave (MW) field, as well as in a gas of MW-coupled fermions with spin 1 / 2. The fundamental solitons and VAs remain stable in the presence of an arbitrarily strong repulsive contact interaction (in that case, the solitons are constructed analytically by means of the Thomas-Fermi approximation). Under the action of the moderate attractive contact interaction which, by itself, would lead to collapse, the fundamental solitons and VAs exist and are stable, respectively; it is interesting that higher-order <b>VAs</b> <b>are</b> more robust than their lower-order couterparts, on the contrary to what is known in other systems that may support stable self-trapped vortices.

The goal {{of this study was}} to assess the accuracy and validity of data on HIV status and antiretroviral therapy (ART) usage reported in VAs and their influence on physician attribution of cause of death. Design: This was a prospective cohort study. Methods: The Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance Site monitors demographic events in a population in a rural area of northern Malawi; a VA is attempted on all deaths reported. <b>VAs</b> <b>are</b> reviewed by clinicians, who, with additional HIV test information collected pre-mortem, assign a cause of death. We linked HIV/ART information reported by respondents during adult VAs to database information on HIV testing and ART use and analysed agreement using chi-square and kappa statistics. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyse factors associated with agreement. Results: From 2003 to 2014, out of a total of 1, 952 VAs, 80 % of respondents reported the HIV status of the deceased. In 2013 – 2014, this figure was 99 %. Of those with an HIV status known to the study, there was 89 % agreement on HIV status between the VA and pre-mortem data, higher for HIV-negative people (92 %) than HIV-positive people (83 %). There was 84 % agreement on whether the deceased had started ART, and 72 % of ART initiation dates matched within 1 year. Conclusions: In this population, HIV/ART information was often disclosed during a VA and matched well with other data sources.
