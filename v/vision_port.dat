500|$|During its {{production}} run from March 1942 to June 1943, the Panzer IV Ausf.G went through further modifications, including another armor upgrade {{which consisted of}} a [...] face-hardened appliqué steel plate welded (later bolted) to the glacis—in total, frontal armor was now [...] thick. This decision to increase frontal armor was favorably received according to troop reports on 8 November 1942, despite technical problems of the driving system due to added weight. At this point, {{it was decided that}} 50% of Panzer IV production would be fitted with [...] thick additional armor plates. On 5 January 1943, Hitler decided that all Panzer IV should have [...] frontal armor. To simplify production, the vision ports {{on either side of the}} turret and the loader's forward <b>vision</b> <b>port</b> in the turret front were removed, while a rack for two spare road wheels was installed on the track guard on the left side of the hull. Complementing this, brackets for seven spare track links were added to the glacis plate.|$|E

The hull machine gun was between the driver and radio operator in a ball mount with 30° of traverse. It could elevate 25° and depress 10°. Most of the machine gun's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armored trough. The mount had a spotting telescope or open sights could be used if the plug {{at the top of the}} ball mount was removed.

500|$|Despite {{addressing}} the mobility problems {{introduced by the}} previous model, the final production version of the Panzer IV—the Ausf.J—was considered a retrograde from the Ausf.H. Born of necessity, to replace heavy losses, it was greatly simplified to speed production. The electric generator that powered the tank's turret traverse was removed, so the turret had to be rotated manually. The turret traversing mechanism was modified and fitted with a second gear which made hand-operation easier when the vehicle was on sloping terrain. On reasonably level ground, hand operation at 4 seconds to traverse to 12.5° and 29.5 seconds to traverse to 120° was achieved. The resulting space was later used for the installation of an auxiliary [...] fuel tank; road range was thereby increased to , The remaining pistol and vision ports on the turret side hatches were removed, and the engine's radiator housing was simplified by changing the slanted sides to straight sides. Three sockets with screw threads for mounting a 2-ton jib boom crane were welded on the turret roof while the hull roof was thickened from [...] to [...] In addition, the cylindrical muffler was replaced by two flame-suppressing mufflers. On June 1944 Wa Prüf 6 had decided that because bomb damage at Panzerfirma Krupp in Essen had seriously jeopardized tank production, all plates which should have been face-hardened for the Panzer IV were instead made with rolled homogeneous armour plate. By late 1944, Zimmerit was no longer being applied to German armored vehicles, and the Panzer IV's side-skirts {{had been replaced by}} wire mesh, while the gunner's forward <b>vision</b> <b>port</b> in the turret front was eliminated and the number of return rollers was reduced from four to three to further speed-up production.|$|E
2500|$|The Tančík vz. 33 was {{assembled}} from {{a framework}} of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams, to which armor plates were riveted.
