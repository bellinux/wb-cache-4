5|$|The {{freeway and}} {{expressway}} sections of M-53 are officially {{known as the}} Christopher Columbus Freeway as a nod to Macomb County's large Italian American population. This designation {{was approved by the}} Michigan Legislature in 1978. The remainder has been named <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> Avenue or <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> Road. That name honors James A. <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke,</b> a prominent attorney in Detroit in the 19th century. <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> was the prosecutor for Wayne County, as well as both city attorney and mayor of Detroit. The street through Detroit was named in his honor, and as the highway was extended northward, the name was carried with it.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke's</b> {{salamander}} (Plethodon vandyke,) is a {{rare species}} endemic to Washington State. It {{has been found in}} cool moist microhabitats along streams, splash zones of waterfalls, and headwater seeps. We explored the association of the <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke's</b> salamander with hydrologic condition, geomorphology, disturbance characteristics, and vegetation structure in first- and second-order streams, and headwater seeps in the Cascade Range of Washington. We conducted salamander surveys and measured habitat characteristics at 50 streams and 40 seeps May-October 2000 - 2002. We described <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke's</b> salamander occurrence in stream and seep sites at three spatial scales: between sites, within sites, and between microhabitat sites. Using presence and absence as the response, we fit logistic regression models predicting <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke's</b> salamander occurrence. To identify the model that best fit the data, we ranked a priori models using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Results were consistent for both stream and seep sites, at all three spatial scales. Best approximating models indicated that <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke's</b> salamander occurrence at sites was related to geological and hydrological habitat characteristics that provided hydnc and thermal stability. The probability of <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke's</b> salamander occurrence along streams was associated with habitat characteristics that protected salamanders from exposure, provided a source cover, and stream habitat types providing splash zone areas. Between streams, <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke's</b> salamander occurrence was positively associated with the proportion of valley walls with canopy cover < 5...|$|R

5|$|M-53 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that connects Detroit to The Thumb region. The highway starts in Detroit at {{a connection with}} M-3 and ends in Port Austin, Michigan at M-25. In between, the trunkline passes through the northern suburbs of Metro Detroit, connects to freeways like Interstate69 (I-69) and provides access to rural farmland. In Macomb County, M-53 follows the Christopher Columbus Freeway, while {{the remainder of the}} highway is known as <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> Avenue in the metro area or <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> Road elsewhere. The highway has also been named the Earle Memorial Highway for one of the pioneers of the Good Roads Movement and Michigan's highway system.|$|E

5|$|Starting at the {{intersection}} between <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> Avenue and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue), M-53 runs north-northwesterly along <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> {{in the city of}} Detroit. The four-lane roadway passes through residential neighborhoods on the city's east side. About a half mile (0.8km) north of its start, M-53 meets I-94 at the latter's exit218. On {{the opposite side of the}} freeway interchange, <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> Avenue turns due north and continues through a mix of residential and industrial areas near Coleman A. Young International Airport. In this area, the highway crosses branch lines for both the Conrail Shared Assets Operations and the Canadian National Railway. M-53 continues northward through residential areas north of 6Mile Road and crosses from Detroit into Warren at the junction with 8Mile Road; that road also marks the Wayne–Macomb county line. The highway passes through the middle of Center Line, an enclave surrounded by Warren. On the northern edge of Center Line, M-53 meets exit23 along I-696, the Walter Reuther Freeway. North of this interchange, <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> Avenue crosses back into Warren and continues northward. The highway is paralleled by a Conrail line as they both pass through the northern Detroit suburbs. Between 12Mile and 14Mile roads, M-53 passes next to the General Motors Technical Center and through the center of a suburban shopping district. The roadway widens out into a divided highway as it continues northward, crossing into Sterling Heights at 14Mile Road. The highway is bounded by additional commercial and light industrial properties as it intersects Metropolitan Parkway (16Mile Road).|$|E
5|$|North of Romeo, the {{trunkline}} {{passes through}} agricultural areas of The Thumb {{region of the}} state. M-53 crosses into Lapeer County south of Almont. Further north, <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> Road meets I-69 in Imlay City, running through the downtown area north of the Interstate; Imlay City is also {{the location of a}} crossing of the Canadian National Railway line that carries Amtrak's Blue Water service between Flint and Port Huron. In the unincorporated community of Burnside, M-53 intersects M-90. The two highways run concurrently for about {{a mile and a half}} (2.4km) before separating. M-53 continues northward and crosses into Sanilac County near Marlette. In that city, the highway crosses a branch line of the Huron and Eastern Railway (HESR) before continuing through downtown. From Marlette northward, M-53 runs parallel to, and about a mile east of, the Sanilac–Tuscola county line. The highway follows <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> Road through rural farming country past intersections with M-46 and M-81 and across the Cass River before crossing into Huron County.|$|E

5|$|Stromberg demanded {{complete}} authenticity in casting, language, and {{the depiction}} of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray Wise, the actor and cameraman (who later {{changed his name to}} Ray Mala), as the star of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. Wise was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian Jew who previously starred in the 1932 documentary film Igloo. <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected Wise. A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but he walked off the set in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> turned to Ray Wise. Not only could Wise perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as an immensely realistic actor. Wise came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on Igloo was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was able to offer his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state that professional actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume.|$|E
5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Dyke</b> {{intended}} {{the picture to}} depict the corrupting influence white culture had on the Eskimos, much {{as he had done}} in White Shadows in the South Seas. The script originally ended with Mala and Iva escaping onto the ice, only to drown. But producer Hunt Stromberg felt this ending was too downbeat, and changed it in April 1932 to the ending now seen on film.|$|E
5|$|While Garland {{herself was}} popular with critics, the initial variety format and her co-star, Jerry <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke,</b> were not.

5|$|At one point, {{most of the}} Native Alaskans in {{the film}} went on strike. They were paid $5 per day for being extras, {{participating}} in hunts or tribal ceremonies, or for acting in minor roles.

5|$|Crawford {{continued}} her reign {{as a popular}} movie actress well into the mid-1930s. No More Ladies (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM's head Louis B. Mayer to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama I Live My Life (1935), directed by W.S. <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke.</b> It was well received by critics and made a larger profit than the studio had expected.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Dyke's</b> Salamander (Plethodon vandykei) is a {{salamander}} in {{the order}} Caudata and the family Plethodontidae. Like most terrestrial salamanders <b>Van</b> <b>Dyke's</b> Salamander lives near lakes, rivers, and streams under various objects such as rocks, logs, and bark. Salamanders' habitat range from wide open lowlands up to heavily wooded mountains. It is in this wood that they lay their eggs.
