Experiments involving the substitution of citrulline and ornithine for arginine, together with amino acid analyses of culture supernatant fluids and cells, indicate that most of the arginine is broken down by a dihydrolase enzyme system through citrulline to ornithine. The second step in this reaction series, the degradation of citrulline, appears to be essential to sporulation. The absence of citrulline or ornithine in either growing cells or spores suggests that another product of the arginine dihydrolase system, adenosine triphosphate, may be responsible for the observed stimulation of sporulation...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} centuries, habitat {{fragmentation}} through human activities, resulting in small and isolated plant populations, are major threats to plant-pollinator networks. The degree {{of response to}} habitat fragmentation, depending from one species to another, is related to specific life traits like reproductive system, adaptability or pollination mode. Plants can propagate through <b>vegetative</b> <b>multiplication,</b> sexual reproduction or both. <b>Vegetative</b> <b>multiplication</b> leads to clonal patches within population enhancing the risk of self-pollination through geitonogamy between inflorescences of the same genet, depending on pollinator behaviour.
