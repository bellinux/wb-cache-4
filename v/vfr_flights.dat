5|$|An FAA {{study in}} 1968 {{had found that}} {{a quarter of the}} 2,230 {{near-miss}} aircraft encounters reported that year had involved a military aircraft. Following the in-flight collision of Flight 706, the FAA and the US Military agreed to cut down on <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> and operate instead under IFR. This transition would require military aircraft to file flight plans and obey civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
500|$|VFR and the [...] "see and avoid" [...] {{doctrine}} faced sharp {{criticism in}} the press. Oscar M. Laurel, {{a member of the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) team investigating the crash, was widely quoted saying that now [...] "may {{be a good time to}} take another look" [...] at <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> near metropolitan areas.|$|E
50|$|Class C {{airspace}} {{is defined}} below 8100 m and allows IFR and VFR operations. Both IFR and VFR operations {{are required to}} have permanent two-way radio contact with ATC. IFR flights are separated {{from each other and}} from <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are separated from IFR flights and are provided traffic information about other <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> Permission for using airspace is required except for the special cases listed in clause 114 of the Federal rules for using Russian air space.|$|E
50|$|The ICAO {{definition}} of Special <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> is a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> cleared by {{air traffic control}} to operate within a control zone in meteorological conditions below visual meteorological conditions.|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} the use of SVFR is when a flight wishes to leave an airport in a control zone, to fly VFR in {{uncontrolled}} airspace, when the visibility is below the minimum for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in the control zone but not below the lower minimum for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in uncontrolled airspace. SVFR is never offered by Air Traffic Control. It must be requested by the Pilot in Command.|$|R
5000|$|Flights on visual <b>flight</b> rules (<b>VFR),</b> when in {{uncontrolled}} airspace, will [...] "squawk VFR" [...] (or conspicuity code in the UK, 1200 in the U.S., 7000 in Europe). Upon {{contact with}} an ATC unit, they will be told to squawk a certain unique code. When changing frequency, for instance because the <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> leaves controlled airspace or changes to another ATC unit, the <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> will be told to [...] "squawk VFR" [...] again.|$|R

50|$|Class C: Operations may be {{conducted}} under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All aircraft {{are subject to}} ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated {{from each other and}} from flights operating under VFR, but <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are not separated from each other. Flights operating under VFR are given traffic information in respect of other <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{airport is}} open 24 hours and offers Pilot Controlled Lighting for Night <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the UK, airways are all class A below FL195 and {{therefore}} <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are prohibited.|$|E
50|$|The {{division}} operate their <b>flights</b> as <b>VFR</b> and use <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> rules {{throughout the}} majority of their flights. Some flights however, either operating/ferrying internationally or for longer distances fly using IFR rules.|$|R
50|$|VFR Terminal area charts {{are created}} with a scale and {{coverage}} {{appropriate for the}} general vicinity of a large airport (1:250,000). They may depict preferred <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> routes within areas of congested airspace.|$|R

2500|$|At 06:56 of the {{following}} morning, the Swift aircraft departed Denton, Texas on a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> for Dallasâ€“Love Field, and as it neared its destination the pilot contacted Love tower for landing instructions, requesting a [...] "straight-in" [...] approach.|$|R
50|$|Once {{a flight}} {{plan has been}} entered, it can be sent {{directly}} into the FAA flight plan database using DUATS. After a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> has been completed, DUATS {{can also be used}} to report the flight plan as closed to the FAA.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport is}} also {{equipped}} with a fuel pump, light maintenance equipment, and a guest house. The airport has no control tower, and is open to <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> only; pilots {{communicate with each other}} on the frequency 128.30 MHz.|$|E
50|$|All {{aircraft}} entering class B airspace must obtain ATC clearance {{prior to}} entry {{and must be}} prepared for denial of clearance. Aircraft must be equipped with a two-way radio for communications with ATC and an operating Mode C transponder, furthermore aircraft overflying the upper limit of any class B airspace must have an operating Mode C transponder. Visual flight rules (<b>VFR)</b> <b>flights</b> may proceed under their own navigation after obtaining clearance but must obey any explicit instructions given by ATC. Some class B airspaces include special transition routes for VFR flight that require communication with ATC but may not require an explicit clearance. Other class B airspaces include VFR corridors through which <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> may pass without clearance (and without technically entering the class B airspace).|$|E
50|$|Flights must be {{conducted}} according to Visual Flight Rules (i.e. {{in sight of}} the ground and away from cloud). This includes both controlled and uncontrolled airspace. Special <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> may be permitted on request of air traffic control, enabling transit through a control zone which would otherwise be out of bounds.|$|E
40|$|<b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> into IMC {{conditions}} {{accounts for}} over 10 % of general aviation fatalities each year. Recent {{research suggests that}} pilots may not properly assess weather conditions. New graphical weather information systems (GWISs) may positively or negatively influence pilot weather-related judgments. Since GWIS information is not always current {{it may not be}} veritical. In the current investigation twenty-four GA pilots made visibility and ceiling estimates of simulated weather conditions either with or without a GWIS display. Pilots generally overestimated weather conditions and their judgments were influenced by the GWIS. The results revealed an interaction between ceiling and visibility that suggests a new model for understanding <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> into IMC. The current results suggest an important area for future research into understanding pilots decisions to continue into deteriorating weather conditions. Results are discussed in terms of advancing aviation decision making models for understanding <b>VFR</b> into IMC <b>flight,</b> and the design of GWIS symbology to foster accurate assessments...|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> is permitted at night, {{and is known}} as Night VFR. This is generally permitted only under more restrictive conditions, such as maintaining minimum safe altitudes, and may require additional training as a pilot at night {{may not be able}} to see and avoid obstacles.|$|R
50|$|If {{the weather}} is below VMC, pilots are {{required}} to use instrument flight rules, and operation of the aircraft will primarily be through referencing the instruments rather than visual reference. In a control zone, a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> may obtain a clearance from air traffic control to operate as Special VFR.|$|R
50|$|Class E: Operations may be {{conducted}} under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR {{are separated from}} each other, and are subject to ATC clearance. Flights under VFR {{are not subject to}} ATC clearance. As far as is practical, traffic information is given to all flights in respect of <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|E
5000|$|VFR and the [...] "see and avoid" [...] {{doctrine}} faced sharp {{criticism in}} the press. Oscar M.

Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other, and are given traffic information in respect of <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> Flights operating under VFR are given traffic information in respect of all other flights.|$|E
2500|$|Visual {{meteorological}} conditions predominantly prevailed {{along the route}} of flight, and a company visual <b>flight</b> rules (<b>VFR)</b> <b>flight</b> plan had been filed. The Cajon Pass area is known for high wind, turbulence and fog. Fog was heavy due to a marine layer that rolled in at [...] and winds {{were said to be}} erratic.|$|R
50|$|In many countries, <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> {{at night}} is not permitted, {{in which case}} night flying is by {{instrument}} flight rules (IFR) only which, in almost all countries, requires an instrument rating. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, Finland, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.|$|R
50|$|On 2008, {{prior to}} the Tukums Air Show, YL-CCX (cn 31-647) a Piper PA-31-310 Navajo, was flown on a Visual <b>flight</b> rules (<b>VFR)</b> <b>flight</b> from Riga-Spilve airport to the Tukums Air Show in deteriorating weather. The {{aircraft}} crashed near Tukums killing the pilot and injuring seven student pilots who were passengers on the aircraft.|$|R
