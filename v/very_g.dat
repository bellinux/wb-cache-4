40|$|Based {{on a local}} spatial/frequency representation, {{we propose}} a {{spectral}} histogram as a feature statistic for characterizing texture appearance. The spectral histogram consists of marginal distributions of responses of a bank of filters and encodes implicitly the structure of images. The distance between two spectral histograms is measured using 2 -statistic. The spectral histogram with the associated distance measure exhibits several properties that are necessary for texture discrimination and classification. The spectral histogram provides a generic feature for texture as well as non-texture images, where the uniform image is a special case with a unique pattern. The spectral histogram is a nonlinear operator, consistent with the nonlinearity in human perception. Our classification experiments reveal that it can generalize well even with {{a small number of}} training samples and the classification result does not depend on a particular form of distance measure.

The model is low-level {{enough so that}} we can express communication, allocation and garbage collection, but otherwise hides many of the lower-level details of an actual implementation. Recently, such formal models have been developed for memory management in a functional, sequential setting [8]. The models are rewriting systems whose terms are programs. Programs have both the "code" (control string) and the "store" syntactically apparent. Evaluation is expressed as conditional rewriting and includes store operations. Garbage collection becomes a rewriting relation that removes part of the store without affecting the behavior of the program. Distribution adds another dimension to an already complex problem. By using techniques developed for communicating and concurrent systems [7], we extend their work to a distributed environment. Sending and receiving messages is also made apparent at the syntactic level. A <b>very</b> <b>g</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} first 156 residues from the left end and the first 134 residues from the right end of adenovirus- 2 DNA have been determined by direct DNA sequencing techniques. The inverted terminal repetition is 102 nucleotide pairs long. The 5 ′-ends of the intact DNA are resistant to the action of T 4 polynucleotide kinase and the 5 ′ → 3 ′ exonucleases from phages lambda and T 7. This resistance is most likely due to the covalent attachment of the 5 ′-terminal C residue to the terminal protein. No significant self-complementarity exists within the inverted terminal repetition, making terminal initiation of DNA replication via a self-priming mechanism unlikely. However, the terminal A + T-rich region followed immediately by a <b>very</b> <b>G</b> + C-rich region is consistent with other schemes for adenovirus- 2 DNA replication.

The proximal promoter region is <b>very</b> <b>G</b> + C-rich and does not contain a canonical TATA box or a CAAT box. Transient expression assays with a set of human PC 2 gene fragments containing progressive 5 ' deletions demonstrate that the proximal promoter region is capable of directing high levels of neuroendocrine-specific expression of reporter gene constructs. In addition, we show that the transcription factor EGR- 1 interacts with two distinct elements within the proximal human PC 2 promoter region.

Nuclease protection and primer extension analyses served to identify the location of multiple transcription initiation sites at the 5 ' end of the structural gene. Promoter activity was found by functional analyses to reside within a 240 -base-pair fragment which contains the transcription initiation sites. Sequences upstream of the transcription initiation sites are <b>very</b> <b>G</b> + C rich (77 %) and include a 22 nucleotide stretch of deoxyguanylate residues and two potential Sp 1 transcription factor-binding sites.

While its goals are laudable, significant barriers persist.

40|$|Human {{fibronectin}} (FN) genomic clones {{were isolated}} by screening a human genomic library with a 75 -base oligonucleotide. The {{sequence of the}} oligonucleotide corresponds to a region near the 5 ' end of the human FN cDNA clone pFH 6 that contains the amino-terminal coding sequences but does not extend to the 5 ' end of the mRNA [Kornblihtt, A. R., Umezawa, K., Vibe-Pedersen, K. & Baralle, F. E. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 1755 - 1759]. The 5 ' end of the FN gene is found on a 3. 7 -kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment that contains about 2. 7 kilobase pairs of flanking sequence. The first exon is 414 base pairs long, with a 5 ' untranslated region of 267 base pairs. As deduced {{on the basis of}} the position of the initiation codon, FN is synthesized with a 31 -residue amino acid extension on the amino terminus that is not present in the mature polypeptide. This amino-terminal extension appears to contain both a signal peptide and a propeptide. The first 200 base pairs of 5 '-flanking sequence is <b>very</b> <b>G</b> + C rich.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the nucleotide sequences of Amy 32 b, a type A alpha-amylase gene, {{and of the}} gene for aleurain, a thiol protease closely related to mammalian cathepsin H. Both are expressed in barley aleurone cells under control of the plant hormones gibberellic acid and abscisic acid, but only aleurain is expressed at high levels in other barley tissues. Sequence analysis indicates that the 5 ' end of the aleurain gene, comprising 3 exons and 2 introns, may have become associated with {{the remainder of the}} gene, encoding the protease domain of the protein, by some sort of recombination event. This 5 ' domain of the gene is <b>very</b> <b>G</b> + C-rich and is flanked by inverted repetitive sequences. We found two different groups of homologous sequence elements. The first group consists of four blocks of sequences conserved in the same spatial arrangement in both genes; these are arranged at similar intervals upstream from the Amy 32 b TATA box and from a TATA box present in intron 3 of aleurain, outside of the 5 ' domain and upstream from the protease domain. A part of two of these conserved sequences is similar to the core sequence of certain enhancer elements characterized from mammalian cells. The second group of homologous elements is present in the upstream region of both genes. We speculate that these conserved sets of sequences may have some role in either the tissue specificity of expression of the genes or in some part of the hormonal regulation imposed on them...|$|E

40|$|A {{sequence}} of 10, 621 base-pairs from the α-like globin gene cluster of rabbit has been determined. It includes the {{sequence of}} gene ζ (a pseudogene for the rabbit embryonic ζ-globin), the functional rabbit α-globin gene, and the θ 1 psuedogene, along with the sequences of eight C repeats (short interspersed repeats in rabbit) and a J sequence implicated in recombination. The region is quite G + C-rich (62 %) and contains two CpG islands. As expected for a <b>very</b> <b>G</b> + C-rich region, it has an abundance of open reading frames, but few of the long open reading frames {{are associated with the}} coding regions of genes. Alignments between the sequences of the rabbit and human α-like globin gene clusters reveal matches primarily in the immediate vicinity of genes and CpG islands, while the intergenic regions of these gene clusters have many fewer matches than are seen between the β-like globin gene clusters of these two species. Furthermore, the non-coding sequences in this portion of the rabbit α-like globin gene cluster are shorter than in human, indicating a strong tendency either for sequence contraction in the rabbit gene cluster or for expansion in the human gene cluster. Thus, the intergenic regions of the α-like globin gene clusters have evolved in a relatively fast mode since the mammalian radiation, but not exclusively by nucleotide substitution. Despite this rapid mode of evolution, some strong matches are found 5 ′ to the start sites of the human and rabbit α genes, perhaps indicating conservation of a regulatory element. The rabbit J sequence is over 1000 base-pairs long; it contains a C repeat at its 5 ′ end and an internal region of homology to the 3 ′-untranslated region of the α-globin gene. Part of the rabbit J sequence matches with sequences within the X homology block in human. Both of these regions have been implicated as hot-spots for recombination, hence the matching sequences are good candidates for such a function. All the interspersed repeats within both gene clusters are retroposon SINEs that appear to have inserted independently in the rabbit and human lineages...|$|E
