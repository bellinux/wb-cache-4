Llaima is a closed vent volcano with constant seismic activity, while Villarrica is an open vent volcano with a constantly degassing lava lake at the summit. Since 2009, seismic networks have been deployed at Llaima and Villarrica, and mini-DOAS stations continuously recording SO 2 degassing were installed in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The response of Llaima and Villarrica volcanoes to local volcano-seismic activity, to regional events, and also to the tectonic activity related to the great Maule earthquake (M 8. 8) in February 2010 are investigated. Time series for tremors, long period and <b>volcano</b> <b>tectonic</b> events were obtained from the catalogue of the Volcanic Observatory of the Southern Andes (OVDAS in Spanish) and from the continuous record of the SFB 574 temporary volcanic network. At Villarrica volcano, peaks of activity of tremor and long period events were observed months prior to and after the earthquake, which is consistent with an increase in the activity related to fluids (gas and magma). Degassing at Villarrica followed a complex pattern, where increased degassing rates preceded the M 8. 8 Maule earthquake by three months. Days before the earthquake, there was a strong decrease in degassing, and finally by a persistent degassing maximum about one month after the earthquake. At Llaima, a high increase in the <b>volcano</b> <b>tectonic</b> activity was observed directly after the earthquake, consistent with a possible structural adjustment response.

40|$|The Pliocene-Holocene Newer Volcanic Province in Victoria, {{southeast}} Australia, {{is a wide}} volcanic field site of {{the most}} recent volcanic activity of Australia. The intraplate signature and the localization on the northern side of the Southern Ocean have been used in the past to ascribe the volcanic activity either to the presence of a mantle hot spot or to thermal anomalies inherited from the seafloor spreading that separated Australia from Antarctica during the Gondwana breakup. The spacing and distribution of groups of eruption points suggests the presence of a 32 km deep mantle thermal anomaly. Alignments of eruption points indicate a strong tectonic control on magma emplacement mainly along NW-SE Mesozoic-Cenozoic structures and along N-S Palaeozoic and E-W Late Cretaceous structures.

30|$|We {{analyzed}} seismicity {{linked to}} the 2014 phreatic eruption of Mount Ontake, Japan, on 27 September 2014. We first relocated shallow <b>volcano</b> <b>tectonic</b> (VT) earthquakes and long-period (LP) events from August to September 2014. By applying a matched-filter technique to continuous waveforms using these relocated earthquakes, we detected numerous additional micro-earthquakes beneath the craters. The relocated VT earthquakes aligned on a near-vertical plane oriented NNW–SSE, suggesting they occurred around a conduit related to the intrusion of magmatic–hydrothermal fluids into the craters. The frequency of VT earthquakes gradually increased from 6 September 2014 and reached a peak on 11 September 2014. After the peak, seismicity levels remained elevated until the eruption. b-values gradually increased from 1.2 to 1.7 from 11 to 16 September 2014 then declined gradually and dropped to 0.8 just before the eruption. During the 10 -min period immediately preceding the phreatic eruption, VT earthquakes migrated in the up-dip direction as well as laterally along the NNW–SSE feature. The migrating seismicity coincided with an accelerated increase of pre-eruptive tremor amplitude and with an anomalous tiltmeter signal that indicated summit upheaval. Therefore, the migrating seismicity suggests that the vertical conduit was filled with pressurized fluids, which rapidly propagated to the surface during the final 10  min before the eruption.|$|R

They used the method developed by Battaglia and Aki (2003) and Kumagai et al. (2010) to analyze three tremors occurring on September 29, November 16, and November 17 – 19. According to their results, despite the site amplification correction using coda waves of local earthquakes, the estimated locations of the tremor sources were shifted southward about 1 km from the summit rather than appearing just below the Pon-Machineshiri crater (e.g., Figure 15 in Ogiso and Yomogita 2012). They examined the shift by using the dataset of <b>volcano</b> <b>tectonic</b> (VT) earthquakes that are routinely analyzed by manual selection of P and S arrivals and confirmed that a similar location shift appeared when they applied the same analysis to VT earthquakes estimated below the Pon-Machineshiri crater (Figure 8 in Ogiso and Yomogita 2012). In light of this location shift, the source location of the volcanic tremor on November 16 shown in Figure 15 in Ogiso and Yomogita (2012) {{can be regarded as}} close to the Pon-Machineshiri crater, which is the assumed location of the centroid of the dike in this study.|$|R

40|$|Eruptions are fed by dikes; therefore, better {{knowledge}} of dike propagation {{is necessary to}} improve {{our understanding of how}} magma is transferred and extruded at volcanoes. This study presents an overview of dike patterns and the factors controlling dike propagation within volcanic edifices. Largely based on published data, three main types of dikes (regional, circumferential and radial) are illustrated and discussed. Dike pattern data from 25 volcanic edifices in different settings are compared to derive semi-quantitative relationships between the topography (relief, shape, height, and presence of sector collapses) of the <b>volcano,</b> <b>tectonic</b> setting (presence of a regional stress field), and mean composition (SiO 2 content). The overview demonstrates how dike propagation in a volcano is not a random process; rather, it depends from the following factors (listed in order of importance) : the presence of relief, the shape of the edifice and regional tectonic control. We find that taller volcanoes develop longer radial dikes, whose (mainly lateral) propagation is independent of the composition of magma or the aspect ratio of the edifice. Future research, starting from these preliminary evaluations, should be devoted to identifying dike propagation paths and likely locations of vent formation at specific volcanoes, to better aid hazards assessment...|$|R

The model was built using a new 3 -D inversion of the available high-precision gravity data, and a new digital terrain and marine model. The inversion procedure, based on a variable-depth lumped assembling of the subsurface gravity distribution via cell aggregation, gives better defined insights into the internal caldera architecture, that well agree with the available geological, geophysical, and geochemical data. The adopted 3 -D gravity method is highly efficient for characterizing the shallow caldera structure (down to 3 km depth) and defining features related to regional or <b>volcano</b> <b>tectonic</b> lineaments and dynamics. In particular, the resulting density distribution highlights a pronounced density low in correspondence of the central portion of the caldera with a detail not available till now. The joint interpretation of the available data suggests a subsurface structural setting that supports a piecemeal collapse of the caldera, and allows the identification of its headwall. Positive gravity anomalies localize dense intrusions (presently covered by late volcanic deposits) along the caldera marginal faults, and the main structural lineaments both bordering the resurgent block and cutting the caldera floor. These results allow us to both refine the current geological-structural framework and propose a new structural map that highlights the caldera boundary and its internal setting. This map is useful to interpret the phenomena occurring during unrest, and to improve both short-term and long-term volcanic hazards assessment...|$|R
40|$|Deception Island {{is a large}} {{volcanic}} centre in Bransfield Strait, a {{very young}} marginal basin between the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula. It has a historical record of volcanic activity, with the most recent eruption occurring in 1970. The island is a stratovolcano with a large flooded caldera forming a natural harbour known as Port Foster. It has been a focus of human activity since early last century, {{as a base for}} whaling and sealing expeditions and the locus of several scientific stations. During that period, many bathymetric surveys were carried out, the earliest in 1829 and the most recent in 1993. This study concentrates on surveys from 1948 onwards. Because Port Foster can be classified as a restless caldera, the bathymetric records were analysed for evidence of volcano-tectonic deformation, particularly caldera resurgence (uplift) which could have significant consequences for hazard and risk assessments of the volcano. The results show that a distinctive pattern of shallowing and uplift is present, correlating well with known and inferred volcanic and volcanotectonic processes on the island. In particular, bathymetric records between 1949 and 1993 show uplift rates as high as 0. 3 – 0. 5 m a− 1, far exceeding normal sedimentation rates in a caldera this size. Rapid uplift in an arcuate offshore area not affected by the sedimentation of recent eruptions suggests that <b>volcano</b> <b>tectonic</b> resurgence or tectono-magmatic effects of an upward migrating magma chamber present a significant risk to the considerable human activity taking place in the region...|$|R
