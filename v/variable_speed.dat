5|$|A {{variable-frequency}} drive (VFD; also termed adjustable-frequency drive, <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drive, AC drive, micro drive or inverter drive) {{is a type}} of adjustable-speed drive used in electro-mechanical drive systems to control AC motor speed and torque by varying motor input frequency and voltage.|$|E
5|$|Today these {{generators}} aren't used {{any more}} in modern turbines. Instead today most turbines use <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system, which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have Low voltage ride through-capabilities. Modern concepts use either doubly fed machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full scale converters.|$|E
5|$|Many fixed-speed {{motor load}} {{applications}} that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy {{when they are}} operated at <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and cube, respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with affinity laws that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.|$|E

5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels. Boron {{is used in}} pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide {{has been identified as}} a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares and fireworks. Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E

25|$|The exact {{amount of}} raw {{materials}} is very important. Semolina dosing is done by two methods: volumetric feed (measurement by volume), and gravimetric feed (measurement by weight). In volumetric feed, a specific volume of semolina is measured by <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> screws or rotary air-lock valves. This method is not very accurate since the amount depends on {{the density of the}} semolina. In gravimetric feed, semolina is weighed by a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> transport system, which is equipped with a device measuring the flow. Although this method is more accurate, it is more expensive and needs to be isolated.|$|E

40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} damping {{is one of}} {{key factors}} that affect vehicle vibration. It has been demonstrated that fractional derivative model can accurately model this kind of fre-quency dependence damping very well. Generally, the excitation of rough road can be acted as a stationary ran-dom vibration process in time domain when a vehicle is traveling at constant speeds. But the road roughness {{should be considered as}} a non-stationary random vibration proc-ess when traveling at <b>variable</b> <b>speeds.</b> In this paper, the vehicle non-stationary process is investigated by using the fractional damping model. The road roughness is built using PSD (power spectral density) in space domain by Laplace transform. The proposed method is validated by simulating a vehicle running with <b>variable</b> <b>speeds</b> in time domain. The vehicle non-stationary random response in frequency domain are also acquired by FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm...|$|R
