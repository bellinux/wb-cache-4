25|$|Parthenocissus quinquefolia, {{known as}} Virginia creeper, Victoria creeper, five-leaved ivy, or five-finger, is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} plant in the grape family, <b>Vitaceae.</b> It is native to eastern and central North America, from southeastern Canada and the eastern United States west to Manitoba and Utah, and south to eastern Mexico and Guatemala.|$|E
60|$|We {{have seen}} that the tendrils {{in the last three}} families, namely, the <b>Vitaceae,</b> Sapindaceae and Passifloraceae, are {{modified}} flower- peduncles. This is likewise the case, according to De Candolle (as quoted by Mohl), with the tendrils of Brunnichia, one of the Polygonaceae. In two or three species of Modecca, one of the Papayaceae, the tendrils, as I hear from Prof. Oliver, occasionally bear flowers and fruit; so that they are axial in their nature.|$|E
60|$|The rapid {{development}} of these adherent discs {{is one of the}} most remarkable peculiarities possessed by any tendrils. We have seen that such discs are formed by two species of Bignonia, by Ampelopsis, and, according to Naudin, {37} by the Cucurbitaceous genus Peponopsis adhaerens. In Anguria the lower surface of the tendril, after it has wound round a stick, forms a coarsely cellular layer, which closely fits the wood, but is not adherent; whilst in Hanburya a similar layer is adherent. The growth of these cellular out-growths depends, (except in the case of the Haplolophium and of one species of Ampelopsis,) on the stimulus from contact. It is a singular fact that three families, so widely distinct as the Bignoniaceae, <b>Vitaceae,</b> and Cucurbitaceae, should possess species with tendrils having this remarkable power.|$|E

6000|$|By tendrils I mean {{filamentary}} organs, {{sensitive to}} contact and used exclusively for climbing. By this definition, spines, hooks and rootlets, {{all of which}} are used for climbing, are excluded. True tendrils are formed by the modification of leaves with their petioles, of flower-peduncles, branches, {24} and perhaps stipules. Mohl, who includes under the name of tendrils various organs having a similar external appearance, classes them according to their homological nature, as being modified leaves, flower-peduncles, &c. This would be an excellent scheme; but I observe that botanists are by no means unanimous on the homological nature of certain tendrils. Consequently I will describe tendril-bearing plants by natural families, following Lindley's classification; and this will in most cases keep those of the same nature together. The species to be described belong to ten families, and will be given in the following order: --Bignoniaceae, Polemoniaceae, Leguminosae, Compositae, Smilaceae, Fumariaceae, Cucurbitaceae, <b>Vitaceae,</b> Sapindaceae, Passifloraceae. {25} ...|$|E
60|$|From {{analogous}} reasons, it {{is probable}} that all tendril-bearers were primordially twiners, that is, are the descendants of plants having this power and habit. For the internodes of the majority revolve; and, in a few species, the flexible stem still retains the capacity of spirally twining round an upright stick. Tendril-bearers have undergone much more modification than leaf-climbers; hence {{it is not surprising that}} their supposed primordial habits of revolving and twining have been more frequently lost or modified than in the case of leaf-climbers. The three great tendril-bearing families in which this loss has occurred in the most marked manner, are the Cucurbitaceae, Passifloraceae, and <b>Vitaceae.</b> In the first, the internodes revolve; but I have heard of no twining form, with the exception (according to Palm, p. 29. 52) of Momordica balsamina, and this is only an imperfect twiner. In the two other families I can hear of no twiners; and the internodes rarely have the power of revolving, this power being confined to the tendrils. The internodes, however, of Passiflora gracilis have the power in a perfect manner, and those of the common Vine in an imperfect degree: so that at least a trace of the supposed primordial habit has been retained by some members of all the larger tendril-bearing groups.|$|E
60|$|The spiral {{contraction}} of tendrils is quite independent {{of their power}} of spontaneously revolving, for it occurs in tendrils, {{such as those of}} Lathyrus grandiflorus and Ampelopsis hederacea, which do not revolve. It is not necessarily related to the curling of the tips round a support, as we see with the Ampelopsis and Bignonia capreolata, in which the development of adherent discs suffices to cause spiral contraction. Yet in some cases this contraction seems connected with the curling or clasping movement, due to contact with a support; for not only does it soon follow this act, but the contraction generally begins close to the curled extremity, and travels downwards to the base. If, however, a tendril be very slack, the whole length almost simultaneously becomes at first flexuous and then spiral. Again, the tendrils of some few plants never contract spirally unless they have first seized hold of some object; if they catch nothing they hang down, remaining straight, until they wither and drop off: this is the case with the tendrils of Bignonia, which consist of modified leaves, and with those of three genera of the <b>Vitaceae,</b> which are modified flower-peduncles. But in the great majority of cases, tendrils which have never come in contact with any object, after a time contract spirally. All these facts taken together, show that the act of clasping a support and the spiral {{contraction of}} the whole length of the tendril, are phenomena not necessarily connected.|$|E

40|$|All the {{traditional}} grapevine varieties used in Europe are very susceptible to downy mildew which causes dramatic damage to leaves and to bunches. Breeding for resistant varieties {{is an alternative}} to the intensive applications of fungicides used to control this disease. A lot of resistance sources are available in the <b>Vitacea</b> family. But few of them have been well studied for the genetic determination of resistance. The strategy for creating new varieties with a long term resistance (more than 30 years) is to combine genes or QTLs to avoid the overcoming of the resistance factors by the pathogen. The practical application of pyramiding QTLs by using molecular markers was investigated in a pseudo-F 1 progeny. This population derived from a cross between two partially resistant parents (a BC 4 from Muscadinia rotundifolia and “Regent”, a German variety obtained by different crosses between American resistant Vitis species). Rpv 1 is a major resistance QTL derived from Muscadinia rotundifolia. Another resistance QTL has been described in “Regent”. The parents and about 40 genotypes of the F 1 population have been planted in 2 locations in France (INRA Bordeaux and Colmar) for several years. Among these genotypes, four genotypic combinations carrying +/- resistance QTLs have been characterized with flanking molecular markers. One of the parents, the BC 4 from Muscadinia rotundifolia has been planted in Hungary for several years. The resistance to downy mildew of all the 40 genotypes and the parents (in France) and of the parent derived from Muscadinia rotundifolia (in Hungary) will be evaluated with visual notations using the same scale. For each location, isolates of Plasmopara viticola will be collected on the four genotypic combinations, on both parents and on susceptible controls. Genotyping of the isolates will be performed using microsatellites and SNP markers. We expect to have a better knowledge about the effect of different combinations of QTLs on Plasmopara viticola populations in different geographic contexts. These data would help us to do an efficient breeding {{in order to ensure that}} the resistance will be efficient and durable in the vineyard...|$|R
