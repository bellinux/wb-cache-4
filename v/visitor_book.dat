5000|$|In a {{description}} of Ludendorff's funeral at the Feldherrnhalle in 1937 (which Hitler attended but without speaking) William L. Shirer wrote: [...] "The World War One hero Ludendorff had refused {{to have anything to}} do with him Hitler ever since he had fled from in front of the Feldherrnhalle after the volley of bullets during the Beer Hall Putsch." [...] However, when a consignment of papers relating to Landsberg prison (including the <b>visitor</b> <b>book)</b> were later sold at auction, it was noted that Ludendorff had visited Hitler a number of times. The case of the resurfacing papers was reported in Der Spiegel ("The Mirror", German news magazine) on 23 June 2006; the new information (which came out more than 30 years after Shirer wrote his book, and which Shirer did not have access to) nullifies Shirer's statement.|$|E
40|$|Visitor {{books have}} been used at rock art sites both {{as a means for}} visitor control and for public education. Various claims have been made about their {{usefulness}} in the management of rock art, including the determination of visitor numbers and origins, the assessment of visitor attitudes to rock art sites and management practices, as evidence of an official management presence and a means to redirect graffiti away from rock surfaces, and as an interpretive medium for the public. 1 bis paper evaluates these claims through an analysis of visitor books from two rock art sites in Carnarvon Gorge, central Queensland, and a comparison with other <b>visitor</b> <b>book</b> studies. It was found that most of the claims could be upheld, although it is argued that in some instances additional independent analyses are required to confirm results...|$|E

40|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} study {{brings together}} research on audiences’ {{participation in the}} media, and an up-close exploration of communicative entitlement of and for such participation. Viewing visitor books as situated, public media, the study asks two related questions: how museums and institutions that employ this medium frame participation of ‘ordinary’ people in the public sphere, and how, in return, visitors variously articulate their participation. The article first examines {{the context in which}} visitor books mediate participation, and how museums frame them so as to invite ‘authentic’ expressions by ‘ordinary’ visitors. The analysis depicts a taxonomy of participation, evincing five types of entitlements found in <b>visitor</b> <b>book</b> texts. These entitlements shed light on how participation in the public sphere is both understood and pursued (performed). The article responds to calls for empirically rich studies on mediation practices and processes. It adds to the literature on communicative entitlements by examining an under-researched hitherto public medium and by illuminating a shift from talk-in-interaction to the context of text-in-interaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{collection}} {{consists of}} memorabilia and research materials Hyman Bogen collected regarding the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York and its alumni association, the Seligman Solomon Society. A {{wide range of}} documents exist, such as orphanage and alumni publications, personal and academic histories, souvenir programs, articles and newslcippings, reports, files on certain individual alumni, correspondence, completed alumni questionnaires, photographs, veteran and census documents, a scrapbook, and banners and towels. The collection includes many HOA publications, the HOA annual reports, commemorative booklets, a centenial souvenir book, a farewell dinner program, camp Wehaha and Wakitan songbook, and evaluation reports. The collection contains several personal and academic histories as well as informal recollections of HOA written by alumni and graduate students of the Graduate School for Jewish Social Work. Burial lists of children interred at Beth El (1930 s) and Salem Fields (1988) Cemeteries can be accessed as well. Of unusual interest are research files Hyman Bogen gathered for his book The Luckiest Orphans: A History of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York and a possible book on the Franco and Goldman families. These include Samson Simpson (1780 - 1857) {{as well as the}} musical prodigies Franco and Goldman families who had ties to HOA. Another appealing item is the <b>visitor</b> <b>book</b> to Moses Ezekiel's Rome Studio (1896). HOA photographs are numerous and consist of the Broadway and Amsterdam building, individual groups, camps, boys scout troop, the band, HOA staff, confirmation classes, the 1941 farewell dinner, a 1945 seder, and a memorial to HOA plaque dedication. A scrapbook compiled by HOA librarian Mildred Stember offers a detailed view of HOA life in the 1920 's.

40|$|This {{research}} encompasses seemingly divergent disciplines, including scientific ethics, {{social science}} studies, environmental history, {{public policy and}} creative arts. It finds that, {{where there has been}} a vacuum that cannot be addressed through the established methodology of mainstream research frameworks, the use of practice based research has provided an alternative pathway for the exploration and resolution of research questions, expanding existing knowledge and developing new research pathways. This has necessitated the development of new skills and knowledge to resolve problems and more effectively integrate the theoretical and practical elements of the project. Ultimately, this research proposes a revised visual methodology via integrating visuacy into social research while, from a practice base, it has both rediscovered and reinterpreted a traditional medium. Hence, visual strategies are employed in order to probe societal perceptions of ubiquitous, introduced species that engender strong, albeit divergent, emotional reactions. The research also reviews the influence perceptions have on environmental management and public policy, and questions the validity of these perceptions in relation to scientific fact. It also examines why some species are vilified, while others (often far more destructive) are ignored, or even encouraged. The methodology focuses on a selection of four introduced, ubiquitous species endemic in suburban areas of the Townsville/Thuringowa region. These are the feral/stray cat, the Common Indian Mynah bird, the Asian house gecko and the Cane Toad. In order to both evaluate and challenge popular perceptions of these species, artworks that both reflect and contest common perceptions of the selected subjects (through a visual framework that presents the four subjects in both objective and subjective styles) are exhibited for public review and reaction. The objective works emphasise the aesthetics of biology and form through the style of natural history illustration, with reference to the great illustrators of the 17 ᵗʰ – 19 ᵗʰ centuries. In contrast, the subjective works are derived from the encounters that people have had with these species, presenting them in a style of heightened narrative. Perspectives are slightly surreal, underpinning the emotional underpinning of the entire experience. The artworks were exhibited at Perc Tucker Regional Gallery in 2004. Visitor reactions to the works were recorded via the <b>Visitor</b> <b>book</b> in the gallery; these were analysed to provide feedback {{on the extent to which}} the artworks had achieved their aim of both representing, and challenging, perceptions of the subjects. In terms of art practice, the practical works also provided an opportunity for experimentation with a variety of media and techniques. The artworks were in a variety of media, with paintings (in watercolour, gouache), fine art prints (lithographs and etchings) and drawings. Of these, the most notable works proved to be those on vellum. Once a traditional support of natural history artists and derived from animal skin, it is now a medium rarely used except by a few specialist artists (mostly in botanical illustration). No contemporary zoological artists were found to work on vellum although, historically, it was once popular. Used extensively throughout the exhibition, this research determined the most appropriate applications and techniques for working on vellum as well as the types of vellum best suited to painting. In applying visual methodologies, this research provides an alternative pathway for research via a creative arts framework (in this case, the application of visuacy). Specifically, the research questions the impact of public perceptions on environmental management and public policy through alternative methodologies. It also advances current knowledge and understanding of creative arts practice. Finally, while this study draws upon new and established theories within the cognitive sciences regarding advocacy of the use of visual methodologies, it also ensures that the visual works retain both authenticity and purpose, and are not minor elements within a broader research framework, but provide the mechanism by which research questions may be both asked and answered...|$|E
