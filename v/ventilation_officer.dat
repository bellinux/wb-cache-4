40|$|There {{is still}} debate about who should {{ultimately}} {{be responsible for}} the ventilation system in an underground mine. The Queensland Coal Mining Safety and Health Regulation 2001, states that a dedicated <b>ventilation</b> <b>officer</b> is the person, while Western Australian Mines Safety and Inspection Regulation 1995 states that it is the mine manager who is responsible; the <b>ventilation</b> <b>officer</b> acts as the manager’s principal ventilation advisor. This paper outlines a comparison between both approaches. Upprättat; 2012; 20160310 (adrhal...|$|E
40|$|Legislation {{introduced}} for Queensland and New South Wales Coal mines provides {{different levels}} of prescription regarding specification of mine seals – generally in relation to capacity to withstand overpressure. In Queensland, the Coal Mining Safety and Health Regulation (2001), Section 341 (d) places a further onus on the statutory <b>ventilation</b> <b>officer</b> to ‘ensure all ventilation control devices at the mine are properly constructed and maintained’ and that the <b>ventilation</b> <b>officer</b> ‘must ensure a ventilation control device mentioned in the regulation … and installed at the mine meets the design criteria stated’ for the ‘type of device’. There is limited or no prescription in regard to: • standards and methods for design; • standards and methods for testing of seals in the ‘lab’ and relating results to field conditions (albeit limited recognised standard test facilities exist); • standards and methods for testing of seals in the field; • requirement to consider specific product types {{in light of the}} particular application and specific locational environment; • site selection for the seal; • consideration of the operational environment of the seal; • consideration of potential water head applied to the seal; • control and state of the ground surrounding the seal; • testing/acceptance criteria for a given seal, identification of defects in installation eg filling voids, etc (other than generic product tests in regard to overpressure/leakage, {{which may or may not}} bear relevance to the specific coal mine application, environment and service duty); • seal leakage limits (although NSW uses the term ‘airtight’); • requirement for and systems to maintain the seal, whether at design rating or otherwise; • guidance in regard to criteria for decisions to repair or identify the need to replace seals; • acceptable and effective methods to complete repair of seals; and • need for methods to assess effectiveness of repair in regard to both leakage and overpressure rating. Based on the experience of the author, it appears that risk management and life cycle approach to seals has not been adopted to the same extent as for other aspects of operations. Further, because of the number of disciplines and personnel involved that may influence various factors affecting seal integrity, the opportunity for oversight or unclear allocation of responsibility is considerable. While suppliers can provide explosion or design rated seals, this should only be a starting point for application of the product in a coal mine. Application is often considered by mine planning staff (taking into consideration mine environment parameters such as water, control of gas, spontaneous combustion risk, etc) in conjunction with the colliery <b>ventilation</b> <b>officer,</b> and then construction completed by contractors under supervision of operational staff. After construction, seals often are managed by operational personnel with input from the <b>ventilation</b> <b>officer.</b> Input of the geotechnical engineer into pillar design, roadway opening size, ground support specification and most stable seal location is also required. The need for a customised design approach for each seal site is proposed in order to take into account the many and variable factors that may influence a site so that improved seal performance reliability and predictability can be developed. A program of quantitative as well as qualitative monitoring of performance and triggers for rectification or maintenance action is required, and would provide support to the aforementioned proposal. Many mines rely on visual/audible inspection and periodic bag sampling as the primary means of assessment. Other significant factors such as seal material properties, rib degradation, convergence, floor heave, effects of water on both structural integrity of the seal as well as the air tightness of the seal do not generally receive the same level of attention. Based on the above observations, the author has compiled a reference checklist in regard to the above matters, including aspects of and approaches to mine and pillar design, geotechnical modelling and data collection, civil engineering design, site evaluation and practical options available. It is apparent that while some research has in isolation examined issues such as overpressure resistance, leakage performance, seal materials, rib sealing, effects of longwall mining and assessment of seal construction and integrity, further research may be required to deliver answers to many of the issues identified above to assist the industry and service providers develop and improve standards...|$|E
40|$|This {{method has}} been applied to the {{analysis}} of a spontaneous combustion event for the five year mine plan of the new Abel Mine, Newcastle, Australia. A team of people with diverse backgrounds provided input to the analysis, which was facilitated by a risk management consultant. The team consisted of the Technical Services Manager – Underground Operations, the Project Manager, The Undermanager, the <b>Ventilation</b> <b>Officer,</b> the local Check Inspector (representing the underground operators), a ventilation consultant and a coal spontaneous combustion expert. The resulting fault tree has provided the mine with a clear set of controls that can be incorporated into a spontaneous combustion management plan. This approach sets a new benchmark for the coal industry and produces a generic model that is robust enough to be transferable to any mine by adjustment of the site specific parameters. Some of the branches of the fault tree will be presented in this paper to raise the awareness of the coal industry to the comprehensive nature of this approach to risk management...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades there has been {{significant}} technological change in both coal mine monitoring and ventilation modelling capabilities in the underground coal industry. During this time there have been substantial changes in statutory ventilation monitoring requirements to reflect such changes in our industry’s monitoring capability. Somewhat contrastingly, there has been very little change in the mandatory regulatory requirements relating to ventilation quantity and gas contamination readings that need to be taken on a monthly basis. On top of that there has been no official mention made of any requirements to model or predict ventilation circuit changes in the mine office, before attempting such procedures underground. Using the NSW coal mines regulations {{as the basis for the}} opinion it is the writer’s belief that whilst the skill level requirements of minesite <b>ventilation</b> <b>officers</b> has been substantially elevated over the last quarter of a century there has been no step change in the mandatory output requirement of the monthly statutory ventilation survey and accompanying report. In the 20 th century it was not uncommon for the mine ventilation survey to comprise a handful of readings which were then entered into a pro-forma book and then hidden away until the next survey. The data measured was insufficient to accurately delineate the circuit and little or no thought was given to utilising the data to build a mimicked model of the ventilation circuit. Unfortunately in the 21 st century there has been insufficient regulatory change to date to ensure such basic practices are elevated to a higher level. Current ventilation modelling software programs are very user friendly and relatively simple to maintain and update but even the most recent changes in the regulations have all but ignored the value of such tools. With some careful planning the ventilation surveyor should set up both his quantity and pressure survey stations in a manner which will afford not only statutory compliance but allow him to accurately define the ventilation circuit to a level that will allow him to maintain an accurate ventilation model of the circuit. The maintenance of such a tool will afford far safer change procedures relating to ongoing circuit adjustments. The final ventilation report that is assembled should be a useful tool and ideally communicated to the frontline supervisors to assist them with their ongoing understanding of the circuit in which they work. It is hoped that some of the tips contained in this paper relating to report inclusions and representation of such data may help at least some <b>ventilation</b> <b>officers</b> streamline their monthly data collection/collation process and with a minimum amount of work. The output is an accurate snapshot of the circuit to utilise for model validation that should double as a useful training tool. The Australian coal industry has an outstanding safety reputation and we must ensure we properly utilise all available technologies to keep it that way...|$|R
