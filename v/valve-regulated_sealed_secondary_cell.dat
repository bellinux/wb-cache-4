In order to create ideal energy crops, the regulation and deposition of cell wall polysaccharides must first be fully understood. Improved understanding of cell wall regulation will enable selection of traits that can optimize biofuel feedstocks. Herein, I utilize the grass model system Brachypodium distachyon in order to understand the transcriptional regulation of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall deposition. Gene expression profiling was used to elucidate transcription factors that regulate <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall biosynthesis. Through this method, WALL REGULATOR INTERACTING bHLH (WRIB) was identified and its role as a <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall regulator was tested. Yeast-one- and yeast-two-hybrid assays showed that WRIB is capable of binding to promoters of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall biosynthesis genes, as well as interacting with known <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall transcription factor proteins and also Phytochrome B.

40|$|Forward genetic screens {{have led}} to the {{isolation}} of several genes involved in <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall formation. A variety of evidence, however, suggests that the list of genes identified is not exhaustive. To address this problem, microarray data have been generated from tissue undergoing <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall formation and used to identify genes that exhibit a similar expression pattern to the <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall–specific cellulose synthase genes IRREGULAR XYLEM 1 (IRX 1) and IRX 3. Crossreferencing this analysis with publicly available microarray data resulted in the selection of 16 genes for reverse genetic analysis.

Only one line, containing an insertion in a member of the COBRA gene family, exhibited a large decrease in cellulose content.

40|$|Tracheary element {{differentiation}} requires strict {{coordination of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis and {{programmed cell death}} (PCD) to produce a functional cell corpse. The execution of cell death involves an influx of Ca 2 + into the cell and is manifested by rapid collapse of the large hydrolytic vacuole and cessation of cytoplasmic streaming. This precise means of effecting cell death {{is a prerequisite for}} postmortem developmental events, including autolysis and chromatin degradation. A 40 -kD serine protease is secreted during <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis, which may be the coordinating factor between <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis and PCD. Specific proteolysis of the extracellular matrix is necessary and sufficient to trigger Ca 2 + influx, vacuole collapse, cell death, and chromatin degradation, suggesting that extracellular proteolysis plays a key regulatory role during PCD. We propose a model in which <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis and cell death are coordinated by the concomitant secretion of the 40 -kD protease and <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall precursors.

Each of the two lobes of the accessory gland is composed of two types of binucleate cell: about 1, 000 main <b>cells</b> and 40 <b>secondary</b> <b>cells.</b> A well-known accessory gland protein, sex peptide, is secreted from the main cells and induces female postmating response to increase progeny production, whereas little is known about physiological significance of the <b>secondary</b> <b>cells.</b> The homeodomain transcriptional repressor Defective proventriculus (Dve) is strongly expressed in adult <b>secondary</b> <b>cells,</b> and its mutation resulted in loss of <b>secondary</b> <b>cells,</b> mononucleation of main cells, and reduced size of the accessory gland. dve mutant males had low fecundity despite the presence of sex peptide, and failed to induce the female postmating responses of increased egg laying and reduced sexual receptivity. RNAi-mediated dve knockdown males also had low fecundity with normally binucleate main cells.

40|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> {{walls of}} tracheary {{elements}} and fibers {{are rich in}} cellulose microfibrils that are helically oriented and laterally aggregated. Support cells within the leaf midribs of mosses deposit cellulose-rich <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls, but their biosynthesis and microfibril organization have not been examined. Although the Cellulose Synthase (CESA) gene families of mosses and seed plants diversified independently, CESA knockout analysis in the moss Physcomitrella patens revealed parallels in CESA functional specialization of Arabidopsis and P. patens, with roles for both sub-functionalization and neo-functionalization. The similarities include use of different CESAs for primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis, a requirement for two or more functionally distinct CESA isoforms for <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall synthesis, interchangeability of some primary and secondary CESAs, and some CESA redundancy. The cellulose-deficient midribs of ppcesa 3 / 8 knockouts provided negative controls for structural characterization of stereid <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls in wild type P. patens. Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent with cellulose microfibril aggregation, and polarization microscopy revealed helical microfibril orientation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary walls are structurally distinct from primary cell walls, and they share structural characteristics with the secondary walls of tracheary elements and fibers. A link between uncoupling of secondary CESAs from the regulatory constraints associated with primary cell wall deposition through sub-functionalization {{and the capacity to}} synthesize cellulose-rich <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls with aggregated and helically oriented microfibrils is discussed with respect to convergent evolution of structurally similar <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> walls...|$|R

With {{the exception of}} OsMYB 58 / 63 -RNAi plants, all transgenic plants showed phenotypes possibly related to <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall alteration, such as dwarfism, narrow and dark green leaves, and also altered rice cinnamyl alcohol dehydro-genase 2 (OsCAD 2) gene expression and lignin content. These results suggest {{that many of the}} 123 candidate <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall-regulating TFs are likely to function in <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall formation in rice. Further analyses were performed for the OsMYB 55 / 61 and OsBLH 6 TFs, the former being a TF in which the Arabidopsis ortholog is known to participate in lignin biosynthesis (AtMYB 61) and the latter being one for which no previous involvement in cell wall formation has been reported even in Arabidopsis (BLH 6). OsMYB 55 / 61 and OsBLH 6 –GFP fusion proteins localized to the nucleus of onion epidermal cells. Moreover, expression of a reporter gene driven by the OsCAD 2 promoter was enhanced in rice calli when OsMYB 55 / 61 or OsBLH 6 was transiently ex-pressed, demonstrating that they function in <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall formation.

Our results suggested that CWA 1 /BC 1 {{plays a role in}} assembling <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall materials at appropriate sites, enabling synthesis of highly ordered <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall structure with solid and flexible internodes in rice. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of CWA 1 /BC 1, as well as its orthologs (COBL 4, Bk 2) and other BC 1 -like proteins in rice, shows weak similarity to a family II carbohydrate-binding module (CBM 2) of several bacterial cellulases. To investigate the importance of the CBM-like sequence of CWA 1 /BC 1 in the assembly of <b>secondary</b> <b>cell</b> wall materials, Trp residues in the CBM-like sequence, which is important for carbohydrate binding, were substituted for Val residues and introduced into the cwa 1 mutant.

40|$|The paired male {{accessory}} glands of Drosophila melanogaster enhance sperm function, stimulate egg production, {{and reduce}} female receptivity to other males by releasing a complex mixture of glycoproteins from a secretory epithelium into seminal fluid. A small subpopulation of about 40 specialized secretory <b>cells,</b> called <b>secondary</b> <b>cells,</b> resides at the distal tip of each gland. We show that these cells grow via mechanisms promoted by mating. If aging males mate repeatedly, {{a subset of}} these cells delaminates from and migrates along the apical surface of the glandular epithelium toward the proximal end of the gland. Remarkably, these secretory cells can transfer to females with sperm during mating.
