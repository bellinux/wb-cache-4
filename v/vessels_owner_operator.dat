30|$|While this {{achievement}} {{depends on}} low growth rates, {{it is possible}} to claim that in the situation with high costs for emission permits the polluter (<b>vessel</b> <b>owners,</b> <b>operators,</b> etc.) may have a different incentive to reduce emissions, in order to achieve the METS program’s goals.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, a low {{marginal}} abatement cost combined with low emission reduction targets and high growth rates (FC) renders the maritime emission trading mechanism non-effective, and may prompt excess purchase (from <b>vessel</b> <b>owners,</b> <b>operators,</b> etc.) of emission permits instead {{of investing in}} reduction technologies that {{are estimated to be}} higher in cost.|$|R

50|$|President Bush also {{predicted}} that {{the enactment of the}} OPA could lead to larger oil shipping companies being replaced by the smaller shipping companies to avoid liability. In particular, smaller companies with limited resources would lack the finances to remediate oil spills disasters. Not just the oil industry, but also the <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> and <b>operators</b> would be held liable for an oil spill, facing a significant increase in financial responsibility. The OPA's liability increase for <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> raised fears and concerns from {{the vast majority of the}} shipping industry. <b>Vessel</b> <b>owners</b> objected that additional oil spill penalties imposed by the states are free from OPA limitations of the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851. Ultimately, the threat of unlimited liability under the OPA and other state statutes has led countless oil shipping companies to reduce oil trade to and from the ports of the United States.|$|R

40|$|Collision {{accident}} {{remains a}} big threat to coastal water transportation operation. Occurrence of a collision event exposes <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> and <b>operators</b> {{as well as}} the public to risk. The nature of the threat can be worrisome; it may lead to loss of life, damage to the environment, disruption of operation, and injuries. This makes hybrid analysis of accident frequency and consequence for risk quantification of accident scenarios through stochastic tools very imperative for reliable design and exercise of technocrat stewardship of safety and safeguard of the environmental. The study involves a predictive model for collision risk and mitigation option for aversion of collision incident. Accident frequency and consequence are obtained using probability tools. Validity of the result is checked with reliability tools. Findings of the study were checked with subsystem and uncertainty risk-contributing factors in order to arrive at a sustainable decision support for collision aversion for inland water transportation. This chapter discusses the result and validation of implementation of the Safety and Environmental Risk and Reliability Model (SERM) for aversion of collision accident for vessel navigating for inland waterways...|$|R
40|$|Under {{existing}} regulations, recreational anglers {{fishing in}} {{waters of the}} Ocean and San Francisco Bay District (described in Section 27. 00, Title 14, CCR) (ocean waters) are subject to individual daily bag and possession limits that include a general 20 -finfish daily bag and possession limit overall and other daily bag and possession limits specific to individual species of finfish [Sections 27. 60 and 27. 85 through 28. 59, Title 14, California Code of Regulations (CCR) ]. Also, under existing regulations, some species of fish have no daily bag limit (any number may be taken) [Subsection 27. 60 (d), Title 14, CCR]. Once a person has caught an authorized daily bag limit of fish, that person is supposed to stop fishing for that species. However, while not presently authorized, it has been common practice for anglers that have already caught a daily bag limit of a finfish aboard a boat to keep fishing to help fill the daily bag limit of other anglers aboard {{that have not yet}} caught a limit of fish. Also, existing regulations require <b>owners</b> and <b>operators</b> of commercial passenger fishing vessels (CPFVs) to record information about each fishing trip, including numbers of anglers, fishing location, and fish caught aboard the CPFVs on logbooks, and provide that information to the Department (Section 195, Title 14, CCR).

40|$|Overall, oil {{spillage}} from vessels throughout the US has decreased significantly since 1990 and {{the enactment of}} the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). Nearly 20 times more oil was being spilled annually by vessels in before 1990 than is currently being spilled. The number of spills of 500 gallons or more have decreased since 1990. The reporting of smaller spills has increased since 1985, but the incidence of these spills has decreased since 1990. The reasons for spill reductions with OPA 90 are varied and complex. There are reductions noted even before some of the prevention measures associated with OPA 90 have been implemented. There is speculation that these spill reductions {{may be related to the}} increasing costs of oil spills and unlimited liability, and the resulting greater “care ” that <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> and <b>operators</b> are exercising, as well as the higher class of vessels transiting US waters based on financial and insurance requirements. The vast majority of vessel spills are very small. Nearly 65 percent of spills are less than 10 gallons, 90 percent are less than 100 gallons. Smaller spills (under 100 gallons) make up only 0. 7 percent of the total volume spilled. The very rare larger spills of one million gallons or more (less than one tenth of one percent in frequency) make up over 42 percent of the total volume spilled...|$|R
40|$|Collisions of {{commercial}} ships cover the largest part of accidents scenario in waterways. Waterways accidents expose <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> and <b>operators,</b> {{as well as}} the public to risk. They attract possibility of losses such as vessel cargo damage, injuries, loss of life, environmental damage, and obstruction of waterways. Collision risk {{is a product of the}} probability of the physical event its occurrence as well as losses of various nature including economic losses. Environmental problem and need for system reliability call for innovative methods and tools to assess and analyze extreme operational, accidental and catastrophic scenarios as well as accounting for the human element, and integrate these into a design environments part of design objectives. This paper discusses modeling of waterways collision risk frequency in waterways. The analysis consider mainly the waterways dimensions and other related variables of risk factors like operator skill, vessel characteristics, traffic characteristics, topographic, environmental difficulty of the transit, and quality of operator's information in transit which are required for decision support related to efficient, reliable and sustainable waterways developments. 5. 3 accidents in 10, 000 years is observed for Langat River, this considered acceptable in maritime and offshore industry, but for a channel using less number of expected traffic, it could be considered high. Providing safety facilities like traffic separation, vessel traffic management could restore maximize sustainable use of the channel...|$|R
30|$|Today the {{sea freight}} tariff {{mechanism}} {{is based on}} partial tariff that doesn’t include the external costs arising from CO 2 emission damage, which are a global problem regardless of the source and location the emissions were emitted. In an attempt to find an economic equilibrium that optimally includes all the constraints while taking into consideration the external costs, we selected a market-based approach, based on the motivation that the shipper must pay “the real” cost for the service that he provides (i.e., – sea freight). The use of a market-based method in this study, allows the producer’s (i.e., - <b>owner,</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>operator,</b> etc.) surplus and that the market equilibrium point is economically efficient despite the constraints mentioned before, and eventually to maximize the consumer’s (i.e., - shipper) surplus.|$|R
40|$|This volume {{contains}} {{material that}} {{was presented at}} the Second International Fishing Industry Safety and Health Conference in Sitka, Alaska, on September 22 through September 24, 2003. IFISH II was sponsored by NIOSHs Alaska Field Station and convened {{with the help of the}} Alaska Marine Safety Education Association of Sitka. More than 125 participants attended sessions on various aspects of commercial fishing safety. Forty speakers addressed topics ranging from deck safety needs for crabbers working in northern waters to policy changes for Pacific Island States. Among the presenters were seven speakers sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organization who provided overviews of commercial fishing safety programs in developing countries, including Tonga, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, Senegal, and Chile. An emphasis on practical solutions for fishing safety emerged in presentations given throughout the conference. Speakers discussed slip-resistant footwear, orientation and safety programs for new seafood processor workers from rural Alaska, and programs for increasing physical fitness for Faroese Islander fishermen. Other speakers focused on findings from recent fishing vessel disasters and discussed ways that fishing <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> and crew could prevent such events. All had the opportunity to present their findings and answer questions from the audience. IFISH IIs focus on safer working environments for commercial fishermen is part of a growing international emphasis on the need for collaboration among governments, nongovernmental entities, <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> and <b>operators,</b> and fishermen themselves to develop effective safety programs. Our hope is that these proceedings contribute to these efforts by underscoring the hazards that commercial fishermen face each day at work and by illustrating the many ways in which collaborative partnerships can help promote safer fishing throughout the world.
