No album was released in 2001, but Lohan had begun recording demo tracks with Emilio Estefan, Jr.. He and his wife, Gloria Estefan, signed Lohan to a five-album production deal in September 2002. [...] "I am extremely excited to be working with Emilio.

Lohan recorded a song for the film, [...] "Ultimate," [...] which was released to Radio Disney to help promote the film. The song peaked at #18 on Radio Disney's Top 30. Lohan announced that the song was separate from her singing career, since many teen idols such as Hilary Duff and Raven-Symoné were expanding their careers from acting to singing. In 2003, Lohan recorded four songs including a Radio Disney hit, [...] "Drama Queen (That Girl)," [...] that were released for the soundtrack to Lohan's film, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.|$|E

5000|$|Moskowitz has {{referred}} to the band's [...] "internal conflicts, fisticuffs and power struggles." [...] Byrd has claimed that [...] "Columbia dumped me from the band"; [...] specifically, that Rubinson and the band's manager Malcolm Terrence manoeuvered to remove him, and promote Moskowitz as the band's figurehead and potential solo star. [...] Though Moskowitz disputes that claim, [...] she also said that [...] "although I didn't agree with David Rubinson aesthetically, I felt loyal to him. He was, after all, {{the one who had}} put us on the map." [...] In any event, Byrd announced that he was leaving, and, according to Moskowitz, when he changed his mind, [...] "the manager pleaded with me to accept him back, but I wouldn't. There was never a conspiracy towards a solo career or some 'back story' between Rubinson and myself. It was primarily intransigence and anger about band governance on my part that propelled the final train wreck." [...] Byrd subsequently commented: [...] "The idea was to create a radical experience. It didn't succeed. For one thing, I had assembled too many personalities; every rehearsal became group therapy. A band that wants to succeed needs a single, mutually acceptable identity. I tried to do it democratically, and it was not successful." [...] Rubinson said: [...] "Joe Byrd {{was one of the most}} insane examples of control freak that I've, to this day, ever experienced... he was really bizarre, and a very, very difficult person to deal with. So there were constant personality conflicts in and among the band. People quitting, people getting replaced, arguments, yelling about intonation, and so forth. They were <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> <b>people,</b> and I don't think they liked being dictated to. But he had a vision of what he wanted." ...|$|E

Obtaining range from radio has the advantage that line of sight between the beacons and the transponder is not required, and the data association problem can be completely avoided.

The extended Kalman filter is also applied to the SLAM problem.

40|$|In {{this time}} of {{extremely}} large data sets that come from, say, the internet or biological research, the need for efficient algorithms is particularly important. Of course this means that we need <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> <b>people</b> working on algorithms for individual problems, but these conditions also underscore {{the need for a}} theory of algorithms. The era of simple, elegant and efficient algorithms is largely over; modern algorithms often use very powerful machinery, are sometimes highly heuristic, and may guarantee only approximately optimal solutions. All the more reason to continue to introduce science into the art and engineering of algorithm design, so that we can negotiate this expanded view of what constitutes a viable algorithm. The first goal of such a theory should be to describe which problems can be solved by efficient algorithms, and, therefore, which cannot. Unfortunately there is currently a great divide between our ability to design algorithms and our ability to explain the limitations of algorithms. Part of this state of affairs is due to the inherent difficulty of the question, but another part is surely due to methodology. For one thing, {{the two sides of the}} coin have been decoupled and relegated to two different research communities: algorithm analysis and complexity theory. Not surprisingly, these communities have diverged and lost a lot of their compatibility. My version of the story goes a little like this: in the beginning, there were simple algorithms and lots of real-world problems people couldn’t solve efficiently. Elegant complexity classes, such as P and NP, wer...|$|E

The ability {{to take the time to}} reflect upon a problem and begin to see what others have done before me {{required}} time to acquire. Going from what I could do to what can be done requires a different mindset, but offers greater rewards and more elaborate opportunities. My industrial experience provided me with good practical skills before I decided to pursue graduate studies. My academic experience showed me countless ways to approach a problem and gave me appreciation for how much has been done before and how many <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> <b>people</b> have solved so many problems. It also showed me that by taking the risk to try fundamentally different approaches, even if they appeared to be very difficult, turned out to be the most profitable experiences. I would like to express my gratitude towards my supervisor Professor Zeljko Zilic for his guidance, trust and patience through all the years I spent in the In-tegrated Microsystems Laboratory, first towards the completion of my Masters of Engineering and now for this doctoral thesis. His constant support and under-standing made a great difference and by far exceeded all my expectations of what a supervisor can provide to his students. I want to highlight the help of my good friend and colleague Stephan Bourduas for our collaboration on Network-on-Chip development, our many co-authored publications, and more recently for his insight on the verification methodology used at his work for the largest microprocessor company in the world. Marc Boule was also a key player in the work presented. His inspiring work on the MBAC hardware assertion compiler provided the foundation for many of the ideas pre-iii sented in this thesis.

This presentation discusses the present situation of Horchin Mongolian folk narrative songs, based on my fieldwork carried out in the spring of 2010. Most Horchin Mongolian songs are narratives based on actual events, and are a combination of storytelling and singing accompanied by the Mongol huur, a four stringed fiddle. Only bards known as huurchi and a small number of <b>very</b> <b>talented</b> <b>people</b> can perform them in the proper fashion, a process that lasts several hours. While the Horchin Mongolian song tradition still exists, it is at the verge of disappearing and most modern bards now perform their songs in a very changed or fractured form. I begin by describing the current status of the huurchi and folk narrative traditions and then address the historical, social, cultural and political reasons for the present, perilous situation of Horchin Mongolian songs. I conclude by discussing the future prospects for Horchin Mongolian songs, and their preservation and dissemination...|$|E
