25|$|Lentiviruses are a {{subclass}} of Retroviruses. They {{are sometimes}} used as vectors for gene therapy {{thanks to their}} ability to integrate into the genome of non-dividing cells, which is the unique feature of Lentiviruses as other Retroviruses can infect only dividing cells. The viral genome in the form of RNA is reverse-transcribed when the virus enters the cell to produce DNA, which is then inserted into the genome at a random position (recent findings actually suggest that the insertion of viral DNA is not random but directed to specific active genes and related to genome organisation) by the <b>viral</b> <b>integrase</b> enzyme. The vector, now called a provirus, remains in the genome and is passed on to the progeny of the cell when it divides. The site of integration is unpredictable, which can pose a problem. The provirus can disturb the function of cellular genes and lead to activation of oncogenes promoting the development of cancer, which raises concerns for possible applications of lentiviruses in gene therapy. However, studies have shown that lentivirus vectors have a lower tendency to integrate in places that potentially cause cancer than gamma-retroviral vectors. More specifically, one study found that lentiviral vectors did not cause either an increase in tumor incidence or an earlier onset of tumors in a mouse strain with a much higher incidence of tumors. Moreover, clinical trials that utilized lentiviral vectors to deliver gene therapy for the treatment of HIV experienced no increase in mutagenic or oncologic events.|$|E
50|$|HTLV-I is an {{abbreviation}} for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, also called human T-cell leukemia type 1, {{a virus that}} has been implicated in several kinds of diseases, including HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, and as a virus cancer link for leukemia (see adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).HTLV-1 has six reported subtypes (subtypes A to F). The great majority of infections are caused by the cosmopolitan subtype A. HTLV was discovered by Robert Gallo and colleagues in 1980. Between 1 in 20 and 1 in 25 infected people are thought to develop cancer {{as a result of}} the virus. HTLV-1 infection is thought to spread only through dividing cells since reverse transcriptase generates proviral DNA from genomic viral RNA, and the provirus is integrated into the host genome by <b>viral</b> <b>integrase</b> after transmission. Therefore, the quantification of provirus reflects the number of HTLV-1-infected cells. So, an increase in numbers of HTLV-1-infected cells using cell division, by actions of accessory viral genes, especially tax, may provide an enhancement of infectivity tax expression induces proliferation, inhibits the apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected cells and, conversely, evokes the host immune response, including cytotoxic T cells, to kill virus-infected cells.|$|E

50|$|Retroviruses (Group VI) have a {{single-stranded}} RNA genome but, in general, are {{not considered}} RNA viruses because they use DNA intermediates to replicate. Reverse transcriptase, a viral enzyme {{that comes from the}} virus itself after it is uncoated, converts the viral RNA into a complementary strand of DNA, which is copied to produce a double-stranded molecule of viral DNA. After this DNA is integrated into the host genome using the <b>viral</b> enzyme <b>integrase,</b> expression of the encoded genes may lead to the formation of new virions.|$|R
2500|$|Integrase inhibitors (also {{known as}} {{integrase}} nuclear strand transfer inhibitors or INSTIs) inhibit the <b>viral</b> enzyme <b>integrase,</b> {{which is responsible}} for integration of viral DNA into the DNA of the infected cell. There are several integrase inhibitors currently under clinical trial, and raltegravir became the first to receive FDA approval in October 2007. [...] Raltegravir has two metal binding groups that compete for substrate with two Mg2+ ions at the metal binding site of integrase. As of early 2014, two other clinically approved integrase inhibitors are elvitegravir and dolutegravir.|$|R
50|$|Retroviruses are RNA viruses {{with two}} {{positive}} (directly encode viral proteins) single-strand genomes. They are enveloped viruses (i.e. have a non-rigid lipid outer membrane surface) with embedded ligands for binding to cell surface target molecules. The cell and viral membranes fuse, releasing the virus inner core particle which packages the RNA genomes, the reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes. Once inside the target cell, the reverse transcriptase copies the RNA into DNA {{and then to}} double stranded DNA, the complex moves to the nucleus and the DNA is inserted into the host genome by the <b>viral</b> <b>integrase.</b> Toca 511 is a RRV derived from a mouse gammaretrovirus and has an amphotropic envelope, meaning that it can infect both mouse cells and cells of other species, including human cells. RRVs selectively infect and integrate into the DNA of cancer cells, which then serve as factories to produce more RRVs by budding. These progeny RRVs infect neighboring cancer cells, providing long-term presence of the encoded therapeutic gene or genes.Toca 511 infects human cells with selectivity for cancer cells in vivo, because genome integration is dependent on cell division and viral replication is inhibited by innate and adaptive immune responses, defective in malignant tissues. Toca 511 spreads through cancer cells and stably delivers the transgene CD. The CD enzyme therefore converts courses of the oral prodrug Toca FC into high concentrations of 5-FU only in the infected tumor cell microenvironment, thus avoiding toxic side-effects. In addition to the direct killing of Toca 511-infected cancer cells, 5-FU can kill neighboring uninfected cancer cells and immune-suppressive myeloid cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as well as tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Cancer cell death releases previously immune-invisible cancer antigens, and causes release of inflammatory damage-associated molecular signals, resulting in antigen presentation and activation of CD4 (helper) and CD8 (killer) T cells. This activation results in acquired anti-tumor immunity, with further induction and harnessing of the T cells against the tumor, and provides durable control of the cancer. This approach is designed to selectively destroy cancer cells and the surrounding immune suppressed tumor microenvironment, while leaving healthy cells unharmed. This proposed dual mechanism of action is supported by emerging clinical and preclinical data2-5.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s an {{infectious}} disease started to plague human civilization. The coexistence of viruses and humans {{is a fight}} for survival for both because the invaders can kill the human but in doing so eliminate their own host. The body uses its immune system to protect itself from bacteria, viruses and other disease-causing beings, and when it fails to do so immunodeficiency diseases occur. One such disease is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) which is most commonly {{a result of an}} infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Two closely related types of HIV have been identified, HIV-1 and HIV-2. While HIV-2 is spreading in India and West Africa, HIV-1 is more virulent and the number one cause of AIDS worldwide. Though some of the patients have different results in most cases people infected with HIV go on to develop AIDS and ultimately die of opportunistic infections or cancer.Integration to the retroviral genome is critical for gene expression and viral replication. The viral genome is reversely transcribed into the DNA of the infected cell by viral reverse transcriptase, the DNA is then integrated into the host-cell chromosomes with the aid of the <b>viral</b> <b>integrase.</b> RNA transcripts are produced from integrated viral DNA and serve both as mRNAs to direct the synthesis of viral proteins and later as RNA genomes of the new viral particles.Viral particles escape from the cell by budding from the plasma membrane, each enclosed in a membrane envelope. In this process HIV-1 integrase is essential and therefore a very promising target for anti-AIDS drug design. Selective drug design is a possibility as HIV-1 integrase has no known cellular equivalent. Many integrase inhibitors have been discovered and designed but {{only a few of the}} molecules were developed further and got as far as phase II or phase III of clinical trials. Raltegravir (brand name Isentress) was granted accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2007 and from EMEA (now EMA) in December 2007. [...] It was marketed as an antiretroviral drug (ARV) for HIV-1 infected adults who had already been exposed to a minimum of three ARV classes and showed multi-drug resistance. In general there are two main groups of integrase inhibitors; Integrase Strand Transfer inhibitors (INSTI) and Integrase Binding Inhibitors (INBI). INSTIs restrain the binding of pre-integration complex (PIC) and host DNA and INBIs restrain integrase and viral DNA binding. Raltegravir is an INSTI integrase inhibitor which inhibits both HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication. It is more potent than other previously known integrase inhibitors as well as causing less side effects. Raltegravir, Elvitegravir, and Dolutegravir are the only HIV-1 integrase inhibitor being used to treat HIV infections elvitegravir and S/GSK1349572.|$|E

40|$|The genus Sinorhizobium/Ensifer mostly groups nitrogen-fixing {{bacteria}} that create root or stem nodules on leguminous plants and transform atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which improves {{the productivity of}} the plants. Although these biotechnologically-important bacteria are commonly found in various soil environments, {{little is known about}} their phages. In this study, the genome of Sinorhizobium sp. LM 21 isolated from a heavy-metal-contaminated copper mine in Poland was investigated for the presence of prophages and DNA methyltransferase-encoding genes. In addition to the previously identified temperate phage, ΦLM 21, and the phage-plasmid, pLM 21 S 1, the analysis revealed the presence of three prophage regions. Moreover, four novel phage-encoded DNA methyltransferase (MTase) genes were identified and the enzymes were characterized. It was shown that two of the identified viral MTases methylated the same target sequence (GANTC) as cell cycle-regulated methyltransferase (CcrM) of the bacterial host strain, LM 21. This discovery was recognized {{as an example of the}} evolutionary convergence between enzymes of sinorhizobial viruses and their host, which may play an important role in virus cycle. In the last part of the study, thorough comparative analyses of 31 sinorhizobial (pro) phages (including active sinorhizobial phages and novel putative prophages retrieved and manually re-annotated from Sinorhizobium spp. genomes) were performed. The networking analysis revealed the presence of highly conserved proteins (e. g., holins and endolysins) and a high diversity of <b>viral</b> <b>integrases.</b> The analysis also revealed a large number of viral DNA MTases, whose genes were frequently located within the predicted replication modules of analyzed prophages, which may suggest their important regulatory role. Summarizing, complex analysis of the phage protein similarity network enabled a new insight into overall sinorhizobial virome diversity...|$|R
50|$|There are {{multiple}} steps {{involved in the}} infection and replication of a Lentivirus in a host cell. In the first step the virus uses its surface glycoproteins for attachment to the outer surface of a cell. More specifically, Lentiviruses attach to the CD40 ligand glycoproteins {{on the surface of}} T-lymphocyte cells. The viral material is then injected into the host cell's cytoplasm. Within the cytoplasm the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme performs reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome to create a viral DNA genome. The viral DNA is then sent into the nucleus of the host cell where it is then incorporated into the host cell's genome {{with the help of the}} <b>viral</b> enzyme <b>integrase.</b> From there the host cell performs transcription and translation to create viral particles and assemble virions which then burst from the host cell when enough are made.|$|R
40|$|The Nef protein plays a {{major role}} in vivo in {{promoting}} HIV and SIV replication and pathogenesis. In vitro, Nef has been shown to down-regulate cell surface molecules, such as CD 4 and MHC-I, alter T cell signaling, and enhance virion infectivity. These effects are attributed to interactions of Nef with cellular proteins. In addition, HIV Nef is incorporated into viral particles, mainly localizing in the virion cores. However, no report has been published to date regarding Nef interactions with virion proteins. By immunoprecipitation, Nef was found to bind to viral enzymes. Using yeast two-hybrid and GST pulldown procedures to find out direct potential partners of Nef, Nef was consistently found to interact with <b>viral</b> <b>integrase</b> (IN). The interaction between Nef and IN was stronger when Nef was present as the viral protease-cleaved isoform. We hypothesize that the interaction of Nef with <b>viral</b> <b>integrase</b> or other virion proteins may explain the presence of Nef in viral cores. In addition, this interaction suggests that Nef may accompany the reverse transcription and the preintegration complexes during the early steps of the infection cycle and potentially affect infectivity during these steps...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The genetic {{barrier to}} {{development}} of raltegravir resistance {{is considered to}} be low, requiring at least one primary integrase mutation: Y 143 C, Q 148 H/K/R or N 155 H to confer raltegravir therapy failure. However, during continued raltegravir treatment failure, additional mutations may be selected. In a patient failing raltegravir therapy, we investigated the impact of multiple integrase mutations on resistance and viral replication. Furthermore, in vivo fitness was investigated during failure of raltegravir-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy and after raltegravir was discontinued from the regimen. Methods: Patient-derived <b>viral</b> <b>integrase</b> genes were cloned into a reference strain. These recombinant viruses were used to determine the contribution of individual integrase mutations to raltegravir resistance and replica-tion capacity in vitro. To determine in vivo fitness, the relative proportion of specific integrase mutations was monitored over time by in-depth clonal analysis of the <b>viral</b> <b>integrase</b> at baseline, during and after raltegravir treatment. Results: Raltegravir therapy failure was associated with the initial selection of primary resistance mutation N 155 H. This mutation conferred a 3. 8 -fold reduction in raltegravir susceptibility and a severe reduction in viral replication. Acquisition of integrase mutation Q 95 K increased resistance (6. 2 -fold) and partly restored viral replication.

We have found that p 300 directly binds IN both in vitro and in the cells, as also specifically demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique analysis. This interaction results in the acetylation of three specific lysines (K 264, K 266, K 273) in the carboxy-terminus of IN, a region that is required for DNA binding. Acetylation increases IN affinity to DNA, and promotes the DNA strand transfer activity of the protein.

Furthermore, the IN-independent integration could be enhanced by the pretreatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents suggesting that integration is mediated by a DNA repair system.

Counterscreening of these and other integrase inhibitors against additional DNA-modifying enzymes revealed that none of the polyhydroxylated aromatic compounds are active against enzymes that do not require metals (methylases, a pox virus topoisomerase). However, all were cross-reactive with metal-requiring enzymes (restriction enzymes, a reverse transcriptase), implicating metal atoms in the inhibitory mechanism.

Here we identify Phe 187 as a critical dimerization determinant of IN from feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a nonprimate lentivirus that causes AIDS in the natural host, and report, in addition to a canonical dimeric structure of the FIV IN core-domain, a monomeric structure revealing the preservation of the backbone structure between the two multimeric forms and suggest a role for Phe 187 in “hinging” the flexible IN dimer...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{persistence}} of a latent reservoir containing transcriptionally silent, but replication-competent, integrated provirus {{is a serious}} challenge to HIV eradication. HIV integration is {{under the control of}} LEDGF/p 75, the cellular cofactor of <b>viral</b> <b>integrase.</b> Investigating possible postintegration roles for LEDGF/p 75, we find that LEDGF/p 75 represses HIV expression in latently infected cells. LEDGF/p 75 associated with two proteins involved in the control of gene expression and chromatin structure, Spt 6 and Iws 1, to form a stable complex. Iws 1 plays a role in the establishment of latent infection, whereas Spt 6 functions to recruit Iws 1 and LEDGF/p 75 to the silenced provirus and maintains histone occupancy at the HIV promoter. In latently infected cells, depletion of the complex results in reactivation of HIV expression Altogether, our results indicate that a complex containing LEDGF/p 75, Iws 1, and Spt 6 participates in regulating postintegration steps of HIV latency...|$|E
40|$|The key DNA {{cutting and}} joining steps of {{retroviral}} DNA integration {{are carried out}} by the <b>viral</b> <b>integrase</b> protein. Structures of the individual domains of integrase have been determined, but their organization in the active complex with viral DNA is unknown. We show that HIV- 1 integrase forms stable synaptic complexes in which a tetramer of integrase is stably associated with a pair of viral DNA ends. The viral DNA is processed within these complexes, which go on to capture the target DNA and integrate the viral DNA ends. The joining of the two viral DNA ends to target DNA occurs sequentially, with a stable intermediate complex in which only one DNA end is joined. The integration product also remains stably associated with integrase and likely requires disassembly before completion of the integration process by cellular enzymes. The results define the series of stable nucleoprotein complexes that mediate retroviral DNA integration...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of the viral DNA into the host genome {{is one of the}} essential steps in the HIV replication cycle. This multistep process mediated by the <b>viral</b> enzyme <b>integrase</b> (IN) allows identification and development of inhibitors targeting different integrase activities. Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p 75) has recently been identified as a crucial cellular co-factor of integration that acts by tethering IN to the cellular chromatin. Small molecules inhibiting the LEDGF/p 75 -IN interaction may become new and highly active antiretroviral therapeutic agents. In this paper we report the rational design, synthesis and evaluation of inhibitors that target the LEDGF/p 75 protein and compete with IN binding. These molecules are designed to mimic the integrase alpha- 3 helix, which interacts with LEDGF/p 75, using pharmacophore guided scaffold replacement. The inhibitor 3 -(1 H-indol- 3 -ylthio) -N-(2 -isopropoxy- 6 -methoxypyridin- 3 -yl) benzamide (CAB 1) and its derivatives (CAB 2 - 13) inhibit the LEDGF/p 75 -IN protein-protein interaction with moderate potency. These CAB inhibitors are the first reported example of small molecules targeting the LEDGF/p 75 partner of the protein-protein interaction, in contrast to the previously reported compounds which target the integrase partner. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Drugs {{targeting}} the <b>viral</b> enzyme <b>integrase</b> {{have been in}} use for several years {{as part of the}} treatment regimen for patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), and similar classes of compounds have been shown to inhibit human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) integration in vitro. The current study shows that the clinically approved HIV- 1 integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, as well as the more recent diketo acid derivative, MK- 2048, are active inhibitors of HTLV- 1 infection in vitro. These agents were effective in inhibiting cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV- 1 in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells. The drugs also inhibited HTLV- 1 immortalization of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A novel adaptation of the Alu assay for viral integration was used to show that the drugs inhibit viral integration without affecting reverse transcrip-tion. These data support the administration of raltegravir and other integrase inhibitors as treatments for patients with HTLV- 1 -associated diseases. The retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) is the etiologic agent of the malignancy adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and the neurological disorder HTLV- 1 -associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV- 1 is endemic in Southern Japan, the Caribbean, and parts of Africa. There ar...|$|R
40|$|In {{retroviral}} infections, {{a copy of}} the viral DNA {{is first}} synthesized from genomic RNA by reverse transcription and subsequently integrated into host chromatin. This integration step, executed by the <b>viral</b> enzyme <b>integrase</b> (IN), is one of the hallmarks of retroviral infection. Although an obligate role for IN in retroviral integration has been clearly defined by numerous biochemical analysis of its recombinant protein and genetic analysis of the viral IN gene, several host cellular proteins have also been implicated as key factors involved in the integration step during viral replication. Although studies on integration cofactors have mostly emphasized factors that aid the integration process either through direct or indirect association with IN, it has become apparent that host cells may also harbor proteins that act as inhibitors of retroviral integration. Intriguingly, some of these inhibitory proteins appear to hamper the integration process via posttranslational modifications of the components of the preintegration complex including IN. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to the inhibition of integration will provide us with clues for the development of new strategies for treating retroviral infections. In this review, we draw attention to recent insights regarding potential host cellular factors that restrict integration, and illustrate how these inhibitory effects are achieved...|$|R
