40|$|Background: No {{recommendation}} {{exists on}} the amount of petrolatum (pet.) preparation to be applied in a Finn Chamber (R) or <b>van</b> der <b>Bend</b> Chamber. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the appropriate amount of pet. preparation to apply in the Finn and <b>van</b> der <b>Bend</b> chambers. Methods: 12 volunteers were patch tested with green-coloured pet. in Finn and <b>van</b> der <b>Bend</b> chambers on the back on 3 occasions. Doses were 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg initially and on second and third occasion, 10 mg was removed in <b>van</b> der <b>Bend</b> Chambers and 35 mg was added. On day 2, the test sites were scored. A negative test equalled a test area not covered to 100 %. A positive test meant a completely green-coloured test area. Minor and major spreading was noted. The amount of pet. preparation yielding at most 5 % negative reactions and having the least number of reactions with major spreading equalled the appropriate amount. Results: For <b>van</b> der <b>Bend</b> Chambers, all doses yielded more than 5 % negative reactions. For the Finn Chamber (R), 30, 25, and 20 mg pet. yielded less than 5 % negative reactions and with major spreading in 60 %, 40 %, and 25 % of test sites. Conclusions: 20 mg pet. preparation was the optimal dose for the Finn Chambers (R) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{evaluate}} the protective effect of a new silicone-containing barrier-cream (Anthydro) and its vehicle (Anthydro without silicone) {{in the prevention of}} cutaneous irritation by detergents. We therefore planned a study in several stages, using an anionic surfactant well known for its irritant properties: sodium laurylsulphate (SLS) in aqueous solution. In a first series of experiments, the protective effect of the Anthydro cream against SLS was studied by invasive methods on guinea-pigs in order to determine histologically the protective effect of the cream when a 10 p. 100 SLS solution was applied on the skin under occlusion during 24 hours (Square chambers, <b>Van</b> der <b>Bend).</b> Typical and reproducible lesions were apparent, and the protected sites were compared with the unprotected sites. In parallel, we used non-invasive methods (conductivity, transepidermal water loss and cutaneous blood flow) to determine in humans the protective effect of Anthydro cream in comparison with unprotected sites after application during 24 hours of patches soaked with a 5 p. 100 SLS solution on the forearms of 13 adult and healthy volunteers (Silver patch tests, <b>Van</b> der <b>Bend).</b> In both experiments the Anthydro cream was effective in reducing the SLS-induced cutaneous irritation. In a second series of experiments, the Anthydro barrier-cream was compared with its "base" (Anthydro without silicone) in terms of effectiveness, following the same experimental procedure (invasive on guinea-pigs, and non-invasive on humans). The base was shown to be effective in protecting against irritation. However, the histological lesions were less intense when the skin was protected by Anthydro than by its vehicle. Concerning the non-invasive methods in humans, no significant statistical differences appeared in the measurement of various parameters between the sites protected by Anthydro and the sites protected by the vehicle. These results lead us to suggest the existence of an essentially mechanical protective effect in which the silicone plays a very small part in terms of effectiveness. These experimental results necessitates further investigations to be extrapolated to occupational conditions without tests performed in industries and well-conducted epidemiological investigations...|$|R

The submillimeter radiation was {{generated by a}} phase-stabilized backward wave oscillator source. Fourteen transitions of the P and R branch of the bending vibration were measured with an accuracy of about 100 kHz. The frequencies were fitted using effective molecular parameters including the band origin and the rotational constants for the ground state and for the excited bending vibrational state. © 1997 Academic Press.

40|$|The van der Waals bound {{states of}} Ar-tetrazine are {{calculated}} by a method which treats the tetrazine fragment as a rigid rotor, {{but which is}} otherwise exact within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The results are used to obtain frequencies and intensities for transitions between van der Waals states in the S 1 ← S 0 electronic spectrum of the complex. Selection rules for such transitions are derived using permutation-inversion symmetry arguments. The normal rigid molecule selection rules are relaxed due to coupling between the low frequency van der Waals vibrations and the overall rotation of the complex, leading {{to the possibility of}} observing single excitation of the nontotally symmetric <b>van</b> der Waals <b>bending</b> modes. Transition intensities for van der Waals stretching excitation are predicted much smaller than experiment and various possible explanations for this disagreement are discussed. © 1990 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|IgE-mediated contact {{urticaria}} syndrome (CUS) {{is one of}} the manifestations of allergy in childhood atopic dermatitis (AD). Allergens such as foods and animal products penetrate the skin easily. They can then cause urticarial reactions in sensitized individuals. A provocation test system for foods, called the skin application food test (SAFT), has been developed. Over more than 5 years, a group of 175 patients with AD was built-up and investigated in a prospective follow-up study with SAFT. SAFT was more frequently positive in AD children aged 6 – 2 years than in older children. In several children of this population (Group 1), we repeated SAFT within a period of 1 year. In another unrelated group of children (Group 2 – 1), we compared the results of ‘original’ SAFT and SAFT using square chambers (<b>Van</b> der <b>Bend)</b> or Silver patches. In the 3 rd group (Group 2 – 2) we compared‘original' SAFT with SAFT using big Finn Chambers. The agreement between the tests was high: in Group 1, we observed 88 to 93 % concordant scores, and in Group 2, the scores were 96 % to 100 %. Statistically, the K coefficient ranged from 0. 71 – 0. 87 in Group 1, and from 0. 83 – 1. 00 in Group 2. SAFT is therefore highly reproducible. Agreement was at least geqslant R: gt-or-equal, slanted 88 % between the scores (the lowest K value observed was at least 0. 71) ...|$|R
40|$|UVA 1 {{therapy is}} a {{relatively}} new form of light therapy for atopic dermatitis. We describe that after 4 weeks of UVA- 1 patients were better capable to maintain clinical improvement than after 3 weeks of therapy. Furthermore, UVA 1 therapy proved to be better than placebo therapy in patients with dyshidrotic eczema. Also, we described the favorable effect of UVA 1 therapy in chronic, generalized lichen ruber planus. Because of deep penetration of UVA 1, it could not only influence dermal inflammatory infiltrates in T-cell mediated diseases mentioned above, but also reach circulating activated B-cells in dermal capillaries in SLE. We investigated the effect of 6 and 12 J/cm 2 UVA 1 in SLE patients, in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross over study. Three weeks of 12 J/cm 2 resulted in improved disease activity and proved to be more effective than placebo. Furthermore, a decrease of auto-antibody titers was observed in several patients. In vitro we showed that 40 % of UVA 1 reached the dermis and increasing numbers of PBMCs died after rising doses of UVA- 1. Also, immunoglobulin production by activated B cells decreased after increasing doses of UVA 1. It would be interesting to investigate UVA 1 therapy for other auto immune diseases. Promotor: R.

5000|$|High Tops- These vans have {{a portion}} of the {{original}} factory roof cut away and a fiberglass [...] "high top" [...] or [...] "elk roof" [...] or [...] "high-raised roof" [...] added. This has become the signature feature of a conversion van. A high top allows occupants to stand in the <b>van</b> without <b>bending</b> over. For structural purposes, a section of the roof is often left at the front and back of the van. Modern vans, which have heavier frames, use less roof section than older vans. These fore and aft sections often have lights, storage shelves, stereo components, and, on older models, TVs and VCRs, much of which sits on the original roof section. The high top is a signature inclusion on disability vans because a wheelchair occupant can be lifted into the van without ducking. It has also become a requirement on campervans. The high top also allows for vastly more storage. Also, the early TVs and VCRs could be mounted in the ceiling, so they did not inhibit movement and leg room in the van. The first high tops started not much higher than the factory roof, then raised aft of the driver's seat with two skylights mounted in this section, typically flanking a TV antenna. This soon fell out of favor due to leaking and light hitting the occupants. High tops began to rise at a gentle angle with a steeply raked center spine section. The center section housed an internally mounted antenna and allowed for larger 13" [...] TVs. With the advent of flat panel TVs and small DVD players replacing VCRs, the need for high tops has been reduced. However, the increased space is highly desired by customers, especially since conversion vans have moved toward the luxury end of the automotive spectrum, and the majority of conversion vans are still produced with a high top.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new submillimeter wave pulsed molecular beam spectrometer with phase stabilized backward wave oscillators (BWOs). In the frequency ranges of 260 - 380 and 440 - 630 GHz, the BWOs output power varies between 3 and 60 mW. Part of the radiation was coupled to a novel designed harmonic mixer for submillimeter wavelength operation, which consists of an advanced whiskerless Schottky diode driven by a harmonic of the reference synthesizer and the BWO radiation. The resulting intermediate frequency of 350 MHz passed a low noise high electron mobility transistor amplifier, feeding the phase lock loop (PLL) circuit. The loop parameters of the PLL have been carefully adjusted for low phase noise. The half power bandwidth of the BWO radiation at 330 GHz {{was determined to be}} as small as 80 MHz, impressively demonstrating the low phase noise operation of a phase locked BWO. A double modulation technique was employed by combining an 80 Hz pulsed jet modulation and a 10 - 20 kHz source modulation of the BWO and reaching a minimum detectable fractional absorption of 2 × 10 - 7. For the first time, a number of pure rotational (Ka= 3 ← 2, Ka= 4 ← 3) and rovibrational transitions in the <b>van</b> der Waals <b>bending</b> and stretching bands of the Ar-CO complex were recorded. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|Converged {{three-dimensional}} quantum mechanical calculations for photofragmentation of the Ne··ICl van der Waals molecule in {{the energy}} region of the electronically excited B(3 Π 0 +) state of ICl are presented and compared with experiments. Lifetimes and final state distributions for the ICl fragments were determined for vibrational predissociation from the lowest van der Waals level in the B(v′ = 2) channel. Good agreement between theory and experiment was achieved using a sum of atom-atom pairwise potentials. This potential energy surface predicts the equilibrium geometry of the complex to be bent at 140 ° with the Ne atom towards the Cl end of ICl. The diabatic vibrational golden rule (DVGR) approximation, {{as well as the}} rotational infinite order sudden approximation (RIOSA), have been tested again the full 3 D calculations. Analysis of the quasibound wave function reveals that the highly inverted rotational distribution of the ICl fragments observed in the experiment, is not due to zero-point bending motion. It {{is more likely to be}} due to a rotational rainbow effect enhanced by the favorable initial geometry of the complex. The effect of the excitation of the <b>bending</b> <b>van</b> der Waals mode in the complex has also been studied. As compared with the lowest level, a longer lifetime and a different rotational distribution of the fragments is predicted. The results presented in this work not only elucidates many dynamical aspects of vibrational predissociation for the Ne⋯ICl complex, but also provide benchmark data for the study of other theoretical methods and approximations. © 1990 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|The two {{asymptotically}} degenerate {{potential energy}} surfaces of argon {{interacting with the}} X (2) E(1 g) ground state benzene(+) cation were calculated ab initio from the interaction energy of the neutral Ar-benzene complex given by Koch et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 198 (1999) ] and the difference of the geometry-dependent ionization energies of the complex and the benzene monomer computed by the outer valence Green's function method. Coinciding minima in the two potential surfaces of the ionic complex occur for Ar on the C(6 v) symmetry axis of benzene(+) (the z axis) at z(e) = 3. 506 A. The binding energy D(e) of 520 cm(- 1) is only 34 % larger than the value for the neutral Ar-benzene complex. The higher {{one of the two}} surfaces is similar in shape to the neutral Ar-benzene potential, the lower potential is much flatter in the (x,y) bend direction. Nonadiabatic (Jahn-Teller) coupling was taken into account by transformation of the two adiabatic potentials to a two-by-two matrix of diabatic potentials. This transformation {{is based on the assumption}} that the adiabatic states of the Ar-benzene(+) complex geometrically follow the Ar atom. Ab initio calculations of the nonadiabatic coupling matrix element between the adiabatic states with the two-state-averaged CAS-SCF(5, 6) method confirmed the validity of this assumption. The bound vibronic states of both Ar-C(6) H(6) (+) and Ar-C(6) D(6) (+) were computed with this two-state diabatic model in a basis of three-dimensional harmonic oscillator functions for the van der Waals modes. The binding energy D(0) = 480 cm(- 1) of the perdeuterated complex agrees well with the experimental upper bound of 485 cm(- 1). The ground and excited vibronic levels and wave functions were used, with a simple model dipole function, to generate a theoretical far-infrared spectrum. Strong absorption lines were found at 10. 1 cm(- 1) (bend) and 47. 9 cm(- 1) (stretch) that agree well with measurements. The unusually low bend frequency is related to the flatness of the lower adiabatic potential in the (x,y) direction. The <b>van</b> der Waals <b>bend</b> mode of e(1) symmetry is quadratically Jahn-Teller active and shows a large splitting, with vibronic levels of A(1), E(2), and A(2) symmetry at 1. 3, 10. 1, and 50. 2 cm(- 1). The level at 1. 3 cm(- 1) leads to a strong absorption line as well, which could not be measured because it is too close to the monomer line. The level at 50. 2 cm(- 1) gives rise to weaker absorption. Several other weak lines in the frequency range of 10 to 60 cm(- 1) were found...|$|R
