25|$|Another popular {{reactor type}} is the flow through reactor (continuous flow reactor), {{which also has}} {{internal}} electrodes, but this reactor allows monomer gas to flow through the reaction chamber as its name implies, which should give a more even coating for polymer film deposition. It has the advantage that more monomer keeps flowing into the reactor in order to deposit more polymer. It has the disadvantage of forming what is called “tail flame,” which is when polymerization extends into the <b>vacuum</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} offline {{preparation for}} the conversion is combustion over CuO at > 800°C in sealed quartz tubes, followed by the isolation of resulting water and the reduction to H2 over hot metal at 400 ~1000 oC on a <b>vacuum</b> <b>line.</b> The produced gas is then directly injected into the dual-inlet mass spectrometer for measurement. The metals used for the reduction to H2 includes U, Zn, Cr, Mg and Mn, etc. U and Zn had been widely used since the 1950s until Cr was successfully employed in the late 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reaction}} needs heat, irradiation, or {{an electrical}} discharge. The product is a solid. [...] It is purified by fractional distillation or selective condensation using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

50|$|One {{class of}} {{diffusion}} vacuum pumps is the multistage compressed-air driven ejector. It {{is very popular}} in applications where objects are moved around using suction cups and <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cold traps {{can also}} be used for {{experiments}} involving <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines</b> such as small-scale very low temperature distillations/condensations. This is accomplished {{through the use of a}} coolant such as liquid nitrogen or a freezing mixture of dry ice in acetone or a similar solvent with a low melting point.|$|R
50|$|The Büchner flask {{can also}} be used as a vacuum trap in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>line</b> to ensure that no fluids are carried over from the {{aspirator}} or vacuum pump (or other vacuum source) to the evacuated apparatus or vice versa.|$|E
50|$|The {{processor}} in the ECU is an Intel AN87C196KD {{running at}} 12 MHz and featuring 8KB of on-chip ROM for storage of code and data and 232 bytes of general-purpose RAM. The main connector is a 36-pin TE Connectivity 344108 ("Econoseal"), and its mating connector (used in the wiring harness) is a TE Connectivity 344111. On {{earlier versions of}} the system, a MAP sensor was internal to the ECU, requiring that an inlet manifold <b>vacuum</b> <b>line</b> be run to the ECU enclosure. In MEMS 1.6, this MAP sensor is the Motorola 5141550T02, and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>line</b> feeding it passes through a vapor trap to prevent admission of fuel vapor into the ECU.|$|E
50|$|When {{multiple}} {{parts are}} processed, {{it may be}} beneficial to have a separate <b>vacuum</b> <b>line</b> for each, reducing the potential loss if one vacuum bag leaks during cure. This is easily accommodated with multiple supply tubes from a single manifold {{on the outside of}} the autoclave.|$|E
40|$|Compact-vibration damping systems, {{consisting}} of rubber-coated metal bellows with a sliding O-ring connector, {{are used in}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines.</b> The device presents a metallic surface to the vacuum system and combines flexibility with the necessary stiffness. It protects against physical damage, reduces fatigue failure, and provides easy mating of nonparallel lines...|$|R
50|$|Stopcocks are {{generally}} available individually with some length of glass tubing at the ports {{so that they}} can be joined by a glass blower into custom apparatus at the point of use. This is especially common for the large glass manifolds used in high <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines.</b> Many additional variations exist in both plug boring and joint assembly.|$|R
50|$|The vacuum is {{delivered}} to the work-pieces by manifolds and individual tubes fitted with quick-disconnects on the interior walls. The simplest vacuum system consists of a pump and gauge {{on the outside and}} a single quick-disconnect port on the inside. In more elaborate arrangements, there may be a dozen or more individual <b>vacuum</b> supply <b>lines</b> going into the machine, each to a separate QD port, with as many gauge lines coming back out to vacuum sensors wired to the control system, and an inert gas backfill under controlled pressure for when the pump is shut off and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines</b> vented during the cure cycle.|$|R

50|$|The German chemist Alfred Stock first {{characterized}} boron-hydrogen compounds. His group {{developed the}} glass <b>vacuum</b> <b>line</b> and techniques for handling these compounds. These efforts {{led to the}} development of the Schlenkline. The chemical bonding of the boranes was a matter of debate. The correct structure was deduced by H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins. Lipscomb was awarded the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1976 for work on boron hydrides. PSEPT (Wades rules) can be used to predict the structures of boranes.|$|E
5000|$|A foreline is a <b>vacuum</b> <b>line</b> {{between the}} pumps of a [...] vacuum system. No longer {{exclusively}} used by scientists in research, vacuum systems {{are used in}} numerous industries that include food production and the manufacturing of electronic components. A classic foreline is a hose or tube that connects a rotary vane pump to the [...] of an oil diffusion pump, although vacuum technology now uses {{a vast array of}} roughing pumps and high vacuum pumps.|$|E

50|$|Locking hubs are {{obtrusive}} {{and damage}} can occur {{that can cause}} the four wheel drive system to fail — damage {{that would not be}} an issue in a CAD system. However CAD systems are mostly vacuum controlled and damage can occur to the vacuum system and to the CAD itself. Rotting of <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines</b> will cause the four wheel drive system to fail — damage that would not be an issue with locking hubs.|$|R
50|$|Corrugated hoses {{are used}} as economical, {{flexible}} connecting elements that permit movement, thermal expansion and vibrations, {{and that can be}} used as filling hoses. The starting material is a seamless or longitudinally welded, thin-walled tube into which corrugations are introduced by mechanical or hydraulic means using special tools. Corrugated hoses are absolutely leak-tight and are used to convey liquids or gases under pressure or as <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines.</b> They are also referred to as pressure hoses. Their special design achieves both flexibility and pressure resistance.|$|R

50|$|The GB1 Hero proton packs were {{fiberglass}} shells {{mounted on}} aluminum motherboards with LC-1 ALICE Frames and straps. These packs had many aluminum parts on them, including: aluminum Ion Arm and cap, booster tube, injector tubes, HGA, <b>vacuum</b> <b>line,</b> PPD, Beamline and filler tube, {{as well as}} the N-Filter. The wands for these packs were also fully aluminum, minus the resin grips. All these external parts were pop riveted to the shell, which was then, in turn, mounted to the motherboard via L-Brackets and bolts at the four corners of the pack.|$|E
40|$|The use of vacuum {{resources}} {{is integral to}} a number of proposed concepts for gas disposal from Space Staton Freedom. These include both direct overboard venting and onboard collection and storage of waste gases. A methodology is presented for determining flowrates through proposed <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines.</b> The flowrates through overboard vents are used to calculate number column densities, which are compared with current Freedom program requirements. The results are combined with discussions about the relative merits of some proposed and alternate concepts for providing vacuum resources...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of LEGO Pneumatics ran from 1984 through 1988. This generation is characterised by single port pneumatic cylinders and the more complex plumbing including a three port distribution block with a pressure and vacuum outlet port. These pressure and <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines</b> ran to a switch to provide pressure for extension or vacuum for retraction of the pneumatic cylinders. These are often falsely compared to single acting hydraulic cylinders that require gravity to retract. The difference is that these units retract on the application of vacuum.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, it is {{necessary}} to decide whether each line is to be monitored individually and how this is to be done. If there is a single vacuum sensor, whether an electronic transducer connected to the control computer or only a sensitive gauge checked visually, determining which vacuum bag is leaking means shutting each one off in turn and watching for a slight change in vacuum manifold pressure. Given the airflow restrictions in the average lay-up and <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines,</b> even a complete vacuum bag failure may show up {{as little more than a}} small change in vacuum level.|$|R
50|$|Powder Deaerators {{consist of}} two {{parallel}} drums - a filter drum and a pressure drum - which rotate in opposite directions. The drums are driven via drive motor and spur gear. The filter drum is {{coated with a}} porous sinter metal layer. It is connected to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>line</b> via a hollow shaft creating a negative pressure within the filter drum. An adjusting device serves for {{the setting of the}} gap width between the rollers. On the adjusting device there are spring assemblies to generate the necessary pressure.|$|E
50|$|As {{an option}} with this arrangement, if the vacuum is shut off prior to cure completion, as {{is called for}} in some applications, before the supply line is vented to atmosphere, the gauge line is backfilled with {{nitrogen}} from a zero-pressure gas regulator, thus preventing atmospheric contaminants from entering the breather/bleeder fabric. Individual monitoring of each <b>vacuum</b> <b>line</b> does not necessarily require gauge lines, nor does inert gas backfill. However, the extra cost of providing for gauge lines is not much. If vacuum bag pressure control is used, then the appropriate valves and regulators must be built in.|$|E
50|$|In June, 2008, Dirt Devil {{introduced}} {{a line of}} cordless handheld vacuums with AccuCharge Technology. AccuCharge is the first cordless <b>vacuum</b> <b>line</b> that is Energy Star approved and reduces 70% in energy consumption compared to most cordless vacuums. The cordless hand vac & stick vac are {{the first in the}} AccuCharge lineup. The Dirt Devil AccuCharge Cordless Hand Vac and Cordless Stick Vac use 15.6 Volt Nickel Cadmium batteries. Charging time for both units is 6 hours. The Hand Vac has a unique flip-down crevice tool built into the nozzle and it weighs 3.25 lbs. The Stick Vac weighs 5.85 lbs and has a motorized brushbar that can be turned on or off.|$|E
50|$|The vacuum can be {{generated}} in two distinct methods, dependent {{on the type of}} internal combustion engine, or other motive force (as in electric vehicles). In naturally-aspirated petrol engines, the manifold vacuum is used, whereas in turbo charged, diesel engines, and electric/hybrid vehicles a separate vacuum pump is used (or in certain high altitude places, naturally-aspirated vehicles are not capable of producing enough vacuum for the booster. The vacuum pump can be driven mechanically (from the engine) or by means of an electric motor. The vacuum is transferred to the servo along non-collapsible <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines,</b> and is stored in the servo by using a non-return valve.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum sewer {{systems are}} {{considered}} to be free of ex- and infiltration which allows their use even in water protection areas. For this reason, <b>vacuum</b> sewer <b>lines</b> may even be laid in the same trench as potable water lines (depending on local guidelines).|$|R
40|$|The 48 -inch {{detonation}} sphere confined {{the gaseous}} products {{resulting from the}} discharge of approximately one-half pound (225 g) of an HE (PETN) under investigation. Product analysis, combined with calorimetric measurements will provide data regarding the detonation processes. Results of the initial HE detonation {{are still in the}} process of evaluation and tabulation. The final summary of this information will be instrumental in the direction of future experimental endeavor. Investigation at Pantex will be in collaboration with and guided by the research in progress at LRL. A new lid, still in the design stage, must be fabricated to make the detonation sphere compatible with the anticipated need in the testing of future explosives. This will necessitate the modification of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines,</b> but the extent of this modification is not known at this time...|$|R
50|$|Putting {{a sensor}} in each <b>vacuum</b> <b>line</b> {{takes care of}} this, but costs an {{additional}} several hundred dollars per line. Some applications involve two vacuum lines per bag. One is connected to a bag penetration {{at one end of}} the part being processed and supplies vacuum from the pump and manifold. The other line returns from a separate bag penetration at the other end of the vacuum bag and through a line back through the vessel wall to a sensor which measures the vacuum level in the bag rather than the level at the manifold. This is preferred, since it provides an accurate indication of the real vacuum seen by the part as a whole.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCompounds {{enriched in}} the rare {{isotopes}} of light elements, such as (18) O, (17) O, (13) C or (15) N, {{are used in}} a very large variety of isotopic tracing studies including investigating the microscopic mechanisms of the movements of atoms in solids. Owing to their very high cost or limited availability these products must be handled in gram amounts or less. Handling such compounds in small quantities in the liquid or gaseous state, purifying and recovering them for further use require special techniques that are described in detail in this paper. Dedicated <b>vacuum</b> <b>lines</b> are used for labelled water, special high vacuum furnace installations are required for thermal treatments with labelled gases that must be used under static conditions while remaining pure. Ion beam analysis is systematically used to investigate the wide spectrum of applications of isotopic tracing in electrochemistry and in applied physics. A number of typical experiments are outlined briefly providing examples for future experimental development in this field. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
