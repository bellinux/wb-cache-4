It encompasses reaction discovery and optimisation, determination of the scope of the method through nucleophile and substrate screens as well as investigations into the mechanism by which the reaction takes place. Chapter 1 gives a general overview of the industrial relevance of pyridine functionalisation as well as the synthetic methods for the synthesis of ring functionalised pyridines, covering traditional stoichiometric aromatic substitution methods, transition metal catalysed cyclisations, standard catalytic methods for the functionalisation of pyridines: Buchwald-Hartwig and Ulmann reactions, as well as a précis of some recent transition metal catalysed methods for C-H functionalisation of pyridines. It also reviews classical and transition metal catalysed methods for conjugate addition and Diels–Alder reactions of <b>vinylpyridines.</b> Chapter 2 involves reaction discovery for the use of Lewis acids for the activation of pyridines towards nucleophilic aromatic substitutions, reaction optimisations, kinetic investigations and an examination of the scope in substrates and incoming groups.

40|$|Weakly basic {{molecules}} containing a double bond, such as 2 - and 4 -vinylpyridine, {{are able to}} react and selectively alkylate –SH groups in proteins, thus preventing their re-oxidation to disulphide bridges. In contrast to conventional alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide and non-charged acrylamide derivatives, such molecules achieve 100 % alkylation of all –SH residues, even in complex proteins, without reacting with other functional groups. Their use is particularly effective in proteome analysis and more generally for analyzing proteins in which the –SH groups should be blocked.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to utilize {{polymers}} as macromolecular ligands for the construction of catalysts by formation of coordination complexes with transition metals with the main focus on complexes of Cu(II) and Fe(III) and further determine (a) their catalytic efficiency (b) mechanism of action (c) similarities to enzymatic systems and synthetic metal complexes. The reactions of interest are (1) hydrolytic cleavage of a series of phosphoesters(2) oxidation of catechol type of substrates (3) hydroxylation of phenolic substrates and chlorinated phenols (4) activation of molecular oxygen and/ or hydrogen peroxide (5) oxidative cleavage of DNA plasmid. The major premise of the study is that by mimicking the macromolecular nature and some structural features of enzymes, polymers can in principle, catalyze chemical transformations with similar efficiencies and specificities and can offer alternatives to peptide based catalysts or simple metal complexes with the advantage of a wider range of building blocks, increased stability and the potential of reusability. The crosslinked resins used contained the functional groups iminodiacetate (chelex resin), diethylenetriamine and tris(2 -aminomethylamine) and were based on styrene-divinylbenzene backbone. The catalytic proficiencies of the Fe(III) and the Cu(II) complexes of chelex resin and diethylenetriamine approached 100 and 1000 respectively towards the model phosphodiester BNPP at pH 8. 0 and 25 Â°C. Moreover, the Fe(III) complexes of linear copolymers with repeating unit of three <b>vinylpyridines</b> to one acrylamide (P 1) showed selectivity towards phosphodiester hydrolysis over monoesters and phosphonate esters and exhibited catalytic proficiencies approaching 50, 000 towards BNPP hydrolysis. Further exploration of the catalytic capabilities of copolymer P 1 revealed that Cu(II) complexes of this macromolecular ligand are potentially capable of assembling to active dicopper intermediates found in the catalytic pathways of copper oxygenases like tyrosinase and catechol oxidase and thus were able to accelerate catechol oxidation to ortho-quinones with rate accelerations approaching 10, 000 and hydroxylate phenols with rate accelerations close to one million.

Alkene insertion does not proceed via the traditional route as proposed by experimental and theoretical research related to intermolecular hydroamination catalyzed by alkaline earth or lanthanide complexes. In contrast, for the hydrophosphination mechanism, insertion proceeds via outer sphere, conjugative addition {{where there is no}} direct interaction of Ca with the vinyl functionality. Following the initial rate-determining alkene insertion, two distinct mechanisms emerge, protonolysis or polymerization. Polymerization of styrene is energetically less favorable than protonolysis, whereas the reverse is determined for 2 -vinylpyridine, thereby providing strong evidence of outcomes observed experimentally. The vinylarene ring is important as it allows for preferential coordination of the unsaturated substrate through numerous noncovalent Ca···π, CH···π, and Ca ← E (E = P or N) interactions; moreover, the vinylarene ring counteracts unfavorable charge localization within the activated transition state.

The NMR spectrum and the computational study are in agreement with an equilibrium in CD 3 CN solution between two isomers of the trans structure. The reaction of the palladium complex with quinuclidine in CH 3 CN, at 25 degrees C, leads to competing elimination and displacement reactions with formation of <b>vinylpyridine</b> and chloroethylpyridine in a ratio of 1. 5 : 1. However, the rate constant for formation of uncoordinated (vinyl) pyridine monitored by HPLC (k(Q) (HPLC) = 2. 3 x 10 (- 3) M- 1 s(- 1)) is nearly 3 times slower than a rate constant monitored spectrophotometrically (k(Q) = 6. 5 x 10 (- 3) M- 1 s(- 1)). This suggests that the initial product of elimination is a palladium complex of <b>vinylpyridine</b> and that displacement from this complex is partially rate determining {{in the formation of the}} uncoordinated product. A study by UV spectroscopy at lambda = 295 nm of trans-bis [2 -(2 -chloroethyl) pyridine-d(2) ] palladium chloride with quinuclidine (Q) has shown the presence of a significant primary kinetic isotope effect, k(Q) (H) /k(Q) (D) = 1. 8, for the elimination reaction within the Pd complex, 1.

The glass transition temperatures of such materials can be predicted {{on the basis of the}} <b>vinylpyridine</b> content and the iodoalkane chain length. Plasticisation of the random ionomers with nonpolar additives, either internally, via alkylation of the phenyl ring with 1 -decene, or externally, by the addition of diethylbenzene, results in the phase separation of the material into a multiplet-containing phase and clusters. In the internally plasticised ionomers, the multiplet phase predominated at low levels of alkylation, and the cluster phase predominated when more than 20 mole % of the styrene had been alkylated. The cluster phase was always dominant in the externally plasticised ionomers. ABA triblocks of styrene (B) and <b>vinylpyridine</b> (A) are phase separated even in the nonionic state.

OsCl(2) (PPh(3)) (3) reacts with 2 -vinylpyridine/Cs(2) CO(3) {{at room temperature}} to give the analogous cyclometalated complex OsCl(CHCHC(5) H(4) N) (CH(2) CHC(5) H(4) N) (PPh(3)). In the presence of NaBF(4), the reaction produces [Os(CHCHC(5) H(4) N) (CH(2) CHC(5) H(4) N) (PPh(3)) (2) ]BF(4). The dihydrogen complex Os(H(2)) Cl(CHCHC(5) H(4) N) (PPh(3)) (2) is produced from the reaction of OsHCl(PPh(3)) (3) with 2 -vinylpyridine.

40|$|A {{combined}} theoretical study, density functional theory (DFT) and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method, {{was performed}} to investigate intrinsic mechanism for self-assembly of poly(styrene) -block-poly(4 - <b>vinylpyridine)</b> (PS-b-P 4 VP) and poly(4, 4 ′-oxydiphenylenepyromellitamic acid) (POAA) blends in both microscopic and mesoscopic scales. The geometric structures, bonding energies and infrared (IR) spectra for the potential hydrogen bonding in the blends were obtained using the Becke-three Lee-Yang-Parr (B 3 LYP) method, and the morphologies for different blends were investigated by DPD simulations. From the quantum-chemical calculations, the hydrogen bonding between P 4 VP and POAA chains, and among POAA chains are confirmed. Due to different bonding strength, competitive hydrogen bonding is caused, the hydrogen bonding brought by POAA governs the morphology evolution, from lamellar to sphere. This report provides good understanding {{for the formation of}} morphology involved with competitive hydrogen-bonding interactions. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{sequential}} {{process of}} elaboration of hybrid nanostructured composite films has been proposed. The combination of phase separation in poly(styrene-block- 4 <b>vinylpyridine)</b> (PS-P 4 VP) block copolymer {{leading to the}} formation of nanopores, and gold nanocolloids synthesis confined in the nanoholes has allowed the facile fabrication of hexagonally arranged gold nanoparticles (NPs) onto silicon wafer. In particular, the nucleation and growth of gold nanoparticles took place within the nanopores, where they are confined in both size and shape the formed Au NPs. The resulting hybrid nanoscomposite has been characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and X-Ray Spectroscopy (XPS). This facile and simple process represents an opened pathway to several technologically important materials fabrication such as hierarchical and ordered crystal architectures. Indeed, the approach based on solvent phase, which is particularly attractive due to its low energy requirement, and the safety and environmentally gentle processing conditions...|$|E
