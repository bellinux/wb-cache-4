25|$|Bangladesh is {{a unitary}} state and {{parliamentary}} democracy.

Although Bangladesh's legal code is secular, more citizens are embracing a conservative version of Islam, with some pushing for sharia law, analysts say. Experts say that the rise in conservatism reflects the influence of foreign-financed Islamic charities and the more austere version of Islam brought home by migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries.|$|E

40|$|A {{qualitative}} study regarding {{the situation of}} an extensive {{number of people who}} have joined <b>violent</b> Islamic <b>extremism</b> groups, such as the Islamic state, from the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. The study is based on previous research and relevant material on <b>violent</b> islamic <b>extremism</b> as well as interviews conducted with experts in the field. The study sheds light towards the growing problem that individuals from Gothenburg have traveled and are currently travelling to mainly Syria and fight for organizations like the Islamic state. The study aims to investigate the present situation in Gothenburg, trends that have been noted by experts, as well as who the people whom have joined violent Islamic extremist organizations in Gothenburg are. The result of the study indicates that it is legitimate to say that the city of Gothenburg are facing big issues with <b>violent</b> Islamic <b>extremism.</b> Contributing factors are, among many others, segregation, unemployment, low income, exclusion and individuals failure in work and education. Aspects such as propaganda in social media and networks of friends who think alike are expected to be two reasons why young individuals in Gothenburg have been radicalized. It is problematic to determine a typical case or stereotype of individuals in Gothenburg who have been radicalized or are in the risk zone of radicalization. However, some aspects such as a troublesome background and residing in a segregated suburbian area may increase the risk. The reason that the study focuses on <b>violent</b> Islamic <b>extremism</b> is that Swedish security police officials presently classify it as the most security threatening form of extremism in Sweden. The study focuses on Gothenburg due to the fact that it has been pointed out to be the hub for <b>violent</b> Islamic <b>extremism</b> in Sweden...|$|R

Overview In September 2014 the terrorism threat level was raised from ‘medium’ to ‘high’ – the first change in 13 years. This year, the government estimated that the number of high risk terrorist threats being monitored by security agencies had doubled and that more than 100 Australians were fighting for groups in Syria and Iraq. A team of ASPI analysts has examined the scope and nature of terrorism motivated by <b>violent</b> Islamist <b>extremism</b> in Australia through a comprehensive database of the high-profile Australians identified as foreign fighters and those that have come to the attention of authorities in Australia.

Based upon the idea that a retrospective analysis of previous presidential speeches could provide guidance for future strategic communications of U. S. government officials, this thesis identifies the nature of the message delivered by U. S. Presidents to foreign audiences since the 9 / 11 attacks through a qualitative analysis of a purposeful sampling of 50 speeches and statements. The analysis examines the position of the United States government in the ideological debate with violent Islamic extremists to determine whether the United States has taken a largely defensive stance, in which the United States constantly strives to counter the narrative of violent extremist adversaries, or a more forward-leaning posture, in which the United States remains primarily concerned with presenting its own narrative based on its values and ideals. The results of this analysis are then utilized to offer recommendations on modifying the message to better support U.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{challenges}} conventional {{views of}} <b>violent</b> religious <b>extremism,</b> {{particularly those that}} emphasize militant theology. We offer an alternative analysis that helps explain the persistent demand for religion, {{the different types of}} religions that naturally arise, and the special attributes of the “sectarian ” type. Sects are adept at producing club goods – both spiritual and material. Where governments and economies function poorly, sects often become major suppliers of social services, political action, and coercive force. Their success as providers is much more due to the advantages of their organizational structure than it is to their theology. Religious militancy is most effectively controlled through a combination of policies that raise the direct costs of violence, foster religious competition, improve social services, and encourage private enterprise...|$|R
