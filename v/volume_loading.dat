A number of analytical techniques led to the conclusion that this circulating molecule was ouabain and that humans were producing it as an endogenous hormone. A large portion of the scientific community agreed that this inhibitor was endogenous ouabain and that there was strong evidence to indicate that it was synthesized in the adrenal gland. One early speculative interpretation of the analytical data led to the proposal that endogenous ouabain may have been the 11 epimer, i.e., an isomer of plant ouabain. However, this possibility was excluded by various methods including the synthesis of the 11 epimer and the demonstration that it has different chromatographic behavior from ouabain. Critically, the primary observations concerning the identification of ouabain in mammals were repeated and confirmed using a variety of tissue sources on three different continents with advanced analytical methods as summarized elsewhere ...|$|E

BackgroundPercutaneous LAA closure is increasingly performed in patients with atrial fibrillation and contraindications to anticoagulation, to lower their stroke and systemic embolism risk. The safety and efficacy of LAA closure relies on accurate device sizing, which necessitates accurate measurement of LAA dimensions. LAA size may change with volume status, and because patients are fasting for these procedures, intraprocedural measurements may not be representative of true LAA size. MethodsThirty-one consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous LAA closure who received <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> during the procedure were included in this study. After an overnight fast and induction of general anesthesia, patients had their LAA dimensions (orifice and depth) measured by transesophageal echocardiography before and after 500 to 1, 000 ml of intravenous normal saline, aiming for a left atrial pressure > 12 mm Hg. ResultsSuccessful implantation of LAA closure device was achieved in all patients. The average orifice size of the LAA at baseline was 20. 5 mm at 90 °, and 22. 5 mm at 135 °. Following <b>volume</b> <b>loading,</b> the average orifice size of the LAA increased to 22. 5 mm at 90 °, and 23. 5 mm at 135 °. The average increase in orifice was 1. 9 mm (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|A {{critical}} need in developing thermal interface materials (TIMs) is {{an understanding of}} the effect of particle/matrix conductivities, <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> of the particles, the size distribution, and the random arrangement of the particles in the matrix on the homogenized thermal conductivity. Commonly, TIM systems contain random spatial distributions of particles of a polydisperse (usually bimodal) nature. A detailed analysis of the microstructural characteristics that influence the effective thermal conductivity of TIMs is the goal of this paper. Random microstructural arrangements consisting of lognormal size-distributions of alumina particles in silicone matrix were generated using a drop-fall-shake algorithm. The generated microstructures were statistically characterized using the matrix-exclusion probability function. The filler particle <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> was varied over a range of 40 - 55 %. For a given filler <b>volume</b> <b>loading,</b> the effect of polydispersivity in the microstructures was captured by varying the standard deviation(s) of the filler particle size distribution function. For each particle arrangement, the effective thermal conductivity of the microstructures was evaluated through numerical simulations using a network model previously developed by the authors. Counter to expectation, increased polydispersivity was observed to increase the effective conductivity up to a <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> of 50 %. However, at a <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> of 55 %, beyond a limiting standard deviation of 0. 9, the effective thermal conductivity decreased with increased standard deviation suggesting that the observed effects are a trade-off between resistance to transport through the particles versus transport through the inter-particle matrix gap in a percolation chain...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that intravesical <b>volume</b> <b>load</b> increases amplitude and frequency of autonomous bladder contractions [1]. Thus local afferent-efferent reflexes, free from spinal and central neuronal pathways, seem {{to be involved in}} stretch-contractile responses in bladder. However the mechanisms underlying these stretch-evoked reflexes are still poorly understood. In the present study we looked at the role of the vanilloid transient receptor potential channel subtype- 1 (TRPV 1) in local stretch-evoked rat bladder contractility. MATERIAL & METHODS: Wistar rat bladders were used. Each bladder was excised,a pressure catheter was inserted and the bladder preparation was placed in a heated organ bath, where intravesical pressures were measured. The effects on autonomous bladder contractility of intravesical <b>volume</b> <b>load</b> (Krebs solution, 20 ml/min, 15 min) and of the TRPV 1 agonist piperine [2] (PIP, 10 mM) were studied. The effects of extravesical pre-treatment with TRP-antagonist ruthenium red (RR, 10 mM)) and TRPV 1 -antagonist capsazepine (CZP, 10 mM) on the stretch-contractile response were studied. These contractile responses were compared with data from untreated bladders. RESULTS: Intravesical <b>volume</b> <b>load</b> induced an increase in amplitude and frequency of autonomous bladder contractions. The TRPV 1 -agonist PIP provoked similar effects,which were effectively antagonized by CZP. CZP and RR induced a decreased rise in amplitude of contractions after intravesical <b>volume</b> <b>load,</b> compared with the control group (p< 0, 05). Intravesical <b>volume</b> <b>load</b> provoked an increase in duration of contractions in CZP-treated bladders (p< 0, 05), but not in RR-bladders or controls. Intravesical <b>volume</b> <b>load</b> induced a decrease in frequency of contractions in RR-treated bladders (p< 0, 05), but not in CZP-bladders or controls. The effects of <b>volume</b> <b>load</b> on baseline and on superimposed contractile activity were unaffected by CZP and RR CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for involvement of TRP-channels and TRPV 1 in particular in stretch-contractile responses in isolated rat bladders. TRPV 1 seems to act as a pressure-sensing molecule, necessary for evoking contractile responses on intravesical <b>volume</b> <b>load.</b> The pressure-contractile response can be modified in patients with overactive bladder disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of TRPV 1 in affected bladder sensing, and to look for possible therapeutical perspectives of interacting on TRPV 1 in functional bladder disorders. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> in the low output state associated with right ventricular infarction, isolated right ventricular infarction was produced in seven dogs with the pericardium intact. <b>Volume</b> <b>loading</b> and pericardiotomy were then sequentially performed. After the production of right ventricular infarction, right ventricular systolic pressure decreased by 25 %, aortic pressure by 36 % and cardiac output by 32 %. Right ventricular ejection fraction decreased by 57 %, but left ventricular ejection fraction did not change significantly. Left ventricular transmural pressure and diastolic size decreased, and right ventricular diastolic size increased. Intrapericardial pressure increased and equalization of diastolic pressures was noted. <b>Volume</b> <b>loading</b> resulted in increased right ventricular systolic pressure and stroke work, increased aortic pressure and cardiac output and increased transmural pressure and diastolic size in both ventricles. Pericardiotomy resulted in further increases in right and left ventricular filling, stroke work and cardiac output, as well as resolution of equalized diastolic pressures. These results indicate that cardiac output in experimental right ventricular infarction increases with <b>volume</b> <b>loading,</b> which enhances left ventricular preload by augmenting right ventricular output.

In addition to this stage, a calibrated amount of additional pulmonary blood flow may be preserved to promote pulmonary artery growth and increase {{the length of the}} interval preceding the total cavopulmonary connection. However, additional pulmonary blood flow can be deleterious for ventricular functioning and development as it increases functional ventricular volume load. Methods. Using the Fick principle we devised a theoretic framework to estimate the ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> caused by additional pulmonary and collateral aortopulmonary flow. To use this framework, blood samples need to be taken intraoperatively from the aorta, pulmonary veins, and inferior caval vein to determine oxygen saturations. The oxygen saturation samples have to be taken sequentially with and without additional pulmonary blood flow. Results. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a theoretic framework to estimate the ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> caused by collateral aortopulmonary flow and additional pulmonary blood flow in the context of a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt in the staged palliation of univentricular hemodynamics.

40|$|Cardiac stress {{produced}} by hypertension or excess <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> results {{in different types}} of hypertrophy. Elevated left ventricular pressure rapidly results in increased myocardial protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro, but such rapid alterations are not consistently seen in <b>volume</b> <b>loading.</b> The difference in response is difficult to clarify since {{it is not possible}} to effect alterations in left ventricular pressure or perfusion without profoundly affecting coronary perfusion. The present study describes cardiac protein synthesis in the right ventricle of the young guinea pig heart in vitro by utilizing a perfusion model in which the right ventricle could be stressed by elevations of pressure or <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> in the presence of constant and restricted coronary perfusion. With coronary flow maintained at 4 ml/min per heart equivalent to 25 ml/min/g dry wt, an increase in right ventricular pressure from normal levels of 3 mm Hg to 11 mm Hg resulted in a 60 percent increase of myocardial incorporation of (14 C) lysine into protein. However, with further increases of right ventricular pressure to 22 mm Hg, protein synthesis dropped back to normal levels. The falloff in protein synthesis was not due to decreased contractility, alterations in intracellular lysine pool specific activity, or alterations in distribution of coronary flow. a 60 percent increase in coronary perfusion was again associated with a similar response of protein synthesis to progressive elevations of pressure despite a rise in the ATP levels and a fall in lactate production. Thus, a deficiency of O 2 did not entirely explain the decline of protein synthesis with maximal pressures. At all levels of coronary perfusion, <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> for 3 h did not result in increased protein incorporation of (14 C) lysine. The studies support a relationship between ventricular pressure and protein synthesis unrelated to coronary flow per se.

In 10 intact, tranquilized baboons, rapid <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> with saline increased LV end-diastolic pressure by 23. 7 ± 2. 6 mm Hg, LV end-diastolic diameter by 7. 8 ± 1. 5 %, LV stroke work by 37. 5 ± 7. 8 %, while {{mean arterial pressure}} and peak LV wall stress did not change significantly. Despite the increase in preload and activation of the Frank-Starling mechanism, LV dP/dtmax and the maximum velocity of myocardial fiber shortening (LV dD/dtmax) did not change. <b>Volume</b> <b>loading</b> after β-adrenergic or combined β-adrenergic and cholinergic blockades or <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> with blood instead of saline also failed to augment LV dP/dtmax and LV dD/dtmax despite the increase in preload. In order to volume load the baboons in the conscious state, a radiofrequency (RF) interrogator system was devised, which upon receipt of a radio command, activated a battery operated pump to infuse 1, 000 ml of saline i. v. to the baboons.

In addition, the effect of <b>volume</b> <b>load</b> on inducing ventricular arrhythmias was studied at one to six sites in 11 hearts. Differences in refractoriness and inducibility at low (22 ± 5 ml) and high (48 ± 6 ml) end-diastolic volumes were compared. At control sites, <b>volume</b> <b>load</b> reduced the absolute refractory period from 178 ± 16. 5 to 175 ± 16. 7 msec (p < 0. 05), but no {{significant change in the}} relative refractory period occurred.

We sought to assess the effect of volume administration during ablation on left atrial (LA) pressure and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Methods LA pressure was measured via transseptal sheath {{at the beginning and}} end of 44 LA ablation procedures in 42 patients. BNP plasma levels were measured before and after 10 procedures. Results A median of 3, 255 (interquartile range [IQR], 2, 014) -mL saline was administered during the procedure. During LA ablation, the median fluid balance was + 1, 438 (IQR, 1, 109) mL and LA pressure increased by median 3. 7 (IQR, 5. 9) mm Hg (P < 0. 001). LA pressure did not change in the 19 procedures with furosemide administration (median ΔP = − 0. 3 [IQR, 7. 1] mm Hg, P = 0. 334). The correlation of LA pressure and fluid balance was weak (rs = 0. 383, P = 0. 021). BNP decreased in all four procedures starting in AF or atrial tachycardia and then converting to sinus rhythm (P = 0. 068), and increased in all six procedures starting and finishing in sinus rhythm (P = 0. 028).

40|$|Several {{studies have}} linked {{increased}} myocardial strain (wall stretch) with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Although the precise mechanisms for these loading related rhythm disturbances remain unclear, the predominant mechanism underlying ventricular arrhythmias associated with mechanical dysfunction is reentrant conduction, which is promoted and sustained by slowed conduction. Passive ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> in the Langendorff-perfused isolated rabbit heart {{has been shown}} to slow conduction. Optical mapping was used to image myocardial conduction. A phase-shifting filtering technique was previously developed to enhance optical maps of myocardial electrical activity. The improvements of the phase-shifting scheme were validated by processing a known data set taken from a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model, to which comparable noise was added. Further improvements were made to the filtering and analysis routines to improve efficiency and accuracy. Conduction slowing in response to ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> was validated by excluding several potentially confounding factors. Improved oxygen delivery with a synthetic oxygen carrier, indicated that the effect is not a result of global ischemia. Measurement of regional tissue perfusion with microspheres suggested that the load effect is not due to regional ischemia. Conduction slowing was not significantly attributable to a decrease in epicardial surface temperature during loading. Measurements with epicardial electrodes were performed without two reagents used during optical mapping: di- 4 - ANEPPS and 2, 3 -butanedione monoxime. These measurements indicated that incremental loading within a physiological range still led to incrementally longer activation times (slowed conduction). Several potential physiological mechanisms of conduction slowing during ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> were investigated. Inclusion of the stretch- activated channel blocker gadolinium 3 + in the perfusate attenuated the reversible increase in action potential duration during <b>volume</b> <b>loading,</b> but did not alter the reversible slowing of conduction. <b>Volume</b> <b>loading</b> reduced conduction despite changes in membrane excitability caused by varying perfusate potassium concentrations. Effective cross-fiber space and time constants, assessed by optical mapping of the tissue response to a cathodal-break point stimulus, increased significantly, indicating that loading may reduce intercellular resistance and increase effective membrane capacitance, resulting in a net slowing of conduction due to the greater sensitivity of conduction velocity to a change in capacitanc...|$|E

Infusing isotonic solution intravenously resulted in linear increases in stroke volume index for stages 18 (y= 388 x+ 6. 89), 24 (y= 466 x+ 7. 86), and 29 (y= 549 x+ 4. 96).

RESULTS: During <b>volume</b> <b>loading,</b> patients differed from controls by a larger rise in alpha-ANP, pulse rate, and cardiac output, and by a lower estimated venous capacitance. The concomitant response of stroke volume and APRC did not differ appreciably between groups. CONCLUSION: Formerly preeclamptic women with a subnormal plasma volume differ from controls with a normal plasma volume by a reduced venous capacitance. These results support our hypothesis that, in these women, a subnormal plasma volume indicates {{the presence of a}} subnormal venous capacitance...|$|E
40|$|Background. Perioperative {{intestinal}} hypoperfusion {{is a major}} {{contributing factor}} leading to organ dysfunction. It {{can be caused by}} stress as a result of surgical manipulation or hypoxia. Additionally, anaesthesia can affect intestinal oxygenation. This animal study was designed to assess the effects of reduced regional sympathetic nervous activity induced by thoracic epidural anaesthesia on intestinal oxygenation. Methods. After ethical approval, 16 anaesthetized and acutely instrumented pigs were ran-domly assigned to two groups (epidural anaesthesia alone vs epidural anaesthesia plus <b>volume</b> <b>loading).</b> The epidural anaesthesia aimed for a T 5 ±T 12 block. Measurements were at baseline and after 1 and 2 h. Results. Epidural anaesthesia was associated with a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure and pronounced mesenteric vasodilatation. Mesenteric blood ¯ow did not change. Intestinal oxygen uptake, mucosal tissue oxygen partial pressure and tissue carbon dioxide partial pres-sure remained unchanged. Conclusions. Despite marked systemic hypotension, epidural anaesthesia did not affect intes-tinal oxygenation. There was no bene®t obtained from <b>volume</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|E

40|$|Extracellular fluid {{volume is}} highly regulated, {{at least in}} part, by {{peripheral}} resistance and renal function. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by NO synthase type 3 (NOS 3) in the nonrenal vasculature may promote fluid retention by reducing systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure. In contrast, NO produced by renal NOS 3 promotes water excretion by reducing renal vascular resistance, increasing glomerular filtration, and inhibiting reabsorption along the nephron. Thus, {{the net effect of}} NO from NOS 3 on urinary volume (UV) is unclear. We hypothesized that NO produced by NOS 3 promotes water excretion primarily due to renal tubular effects. We gave conscious wild-type and NOS 3 −/− mice an acute <b>volume</b> <b>load</b> and measured UV, blood pressure, plasma renin concentration (PRC), Na+, vasopressin, and urinary Na+ and creatinine concentrations. To give the acute <b>volume</b> <b>load,</b> we trained mice to drink a large volume of water while in metabolic cages. On the day of the experiment, water was replaced with 1 % sucrose, and mice had access to it for 1 h. Volume intake was similar in both groups. Over 3 h, wild-type mice excreted 62 ± 10 % of the <b>volume</b> <b>load,</b> but NOS 3 −/− excreted only 42 ± 5 % (P < 0. 05). Blood pressure in NOS 3 −/− was 118 ± 3 compared with 110 ± 2 mmHg in wild-type mice (P < 0. 05), but it did not change following <b>volume</b> <b>load</b> in either strain. PRC, vasopressin, and glomerular filtration rate were similar between groups. Urinary Na+ excretion was 49. 3 ± 7. 0 in wild-type vs. 37. 8 ± 6. 4 μmol/ 3 h in NOS 3 −/− mice (P < 0. 05). Bumetanide administration eliminated the difference in volume excretion between wild-type and NOS 3 −/− mice. We conclude that 1) NO produced by NOS 3 promotes water and Na+ excretion and 2) the renal epithelial actions of NO produced by NOS 3 supersede the systemic and renal vascular actions...|$|R
40|$|Our aim was {{to analyze}} left {{ventricular}} fractional shortening during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation {{under the influence of}} changing <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> conditions induced by a ductal left-to-right shunt. In all patients, the fractional shortening was observed using echocardiography before, during, and after bypass, irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} the ductal left-to-right shunt. During membrane oxygenation, there was a significant decrease in fractional shortening (p less than 0. 001), with no difference before and after membrane oxygenation. A greater decrease in fractional shortening was observed in the group with a ductal left-to-right shunt when compared to patients lacking the ductal shunt (p less than 0. 006). The diastolic diameter of the left ventricle also increased significantly during the membrane oxygenation in those patients with left-to-right ductal shunting. Moreover, the patients with left-to-right shunting showed a very severe decreased fractional shortening, lower than 10 per cent, with significantly greater frequency (p less than 0. 05) during the course of membrane oxygenation. Conclusion: An important decrease in left ventricular fractional shortening is observed during veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Left-to-right shunting during bypass, as seen in the patients with patency of the arterial duct, increases the loading conditions on the left ventricle, and produces a significant increase in left ventricular diastolic dimensions. Despite the effects of <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> produced by the ductal shunt during bypass, the decrease in fractional shortening is significantly more pronounced for these patients. Therefore, during membrane oxygenation the <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> produced by the ductal shunt is unable to prevent a decrease in left ventricular fractional shortening...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Volume</b> <b>loading</b> is {{commonly}} used to adjust preload and optimise cardiac output. It is difficult to monitor preload at the bedside because filling affects ventricular diastolic function and consequently end diastolic pressure, which is the variable used to monitor preload. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of gradual <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> on the different components of left ventricular diastolic function [...] -filling velocities, relaxation, and chamber compliance [...] -to identify how excessive loading produces diastolic dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight mongrel dogs, anaesthetised and mechanically ventilated with both the chest and the pericardium closed, were studied during basal conditions (B), during gradual <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> with physiological saline [...] - 5 ml/kg (VL 5), 10 ml/kg (VL 10), and 15 ml/kg (VL 15) [...] -and during infusion of isosorbide dinitrate (10 g/kg/min) started after the VL 15 load was achieved. Dogs were monitored haemodynamically and by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to assess peak modal velocities of the E and A waves, E/A ratios, and the deceleration time of the E wave. M mode recordings of aligned mitral and aortic valve motion were also obtained to calculate the isovolumic relaxation time. Effects of <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> on ventricular diastolic function seemed to occur in two phases. Small and moderate volume loads (VL 5 and VL 10) promoted early ventricular filling, increasing E wave velocities, improving the mean (SD) E/A ratio from 1. 95 (0. 3) (B) to 2. 0 (0. 27) (VL 5) and 2. 6 (0. 3) (VL 10) (P < 0. 00005), prolonging the E wave deceleration time, and only slightly increasing ventricular diastolic pressures. These changes suggest an improvement in ventricular compliance. Extreme volume loads (VL 15) produced an abrupt reduction in early ventricular filling, which was transfered to late in diastole, by decreasing E wave velocity, by increasing A wave velocity, and by decreasing E/A ratio from 2. 6 (0. 3) (VL 10) to 0. 8 (0. 05) (VL 15) (P < 0. 00005). The E wave deceleration time was shortened and left ventricular diastolic pressures were much increased, all suggesting a deterioration in chamber compliance. All these restrictive changes were promptly reversed by the perfusion of isosorbide dinitrate. The isovolumic relaxation time steadily increased with <b>volume</b> <b>loading.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Small and moderate volume loads improved ventricular diastolic function by promoting early ventricular filling and increasing ventricular compliance. Extreme volume loads promptly induced a diastolic restrictive pattern, transferring filling to {{the second part of}} diastole (increasing dependence on atrial contraction) and reducing ventricular compliance. These changes in ventricular diastolic function were independent of simultaneously measured haemodynamic systolic performance and were promptly reversed by isosorbide dinitrate, which after extreme loading promoted early filling, myocardial relaxation, and improved chamber compliance...|$|E
40|$|In animal experiments, {{elevating}} systolic pressures induces diastolic dysfunction and {{may contribute}} to congestion, a finding not yet translated to humans. Coronary surgery patients (63 ± 8 years) were studied with left ventricular (LV) pressure (n = 17) or pressure-volume (n = 3) catheters, immediately before cardiopulmonary bypass. Single-beat graded pressure elevations were induced by clamping the ascending aorta. Protocol was repeated after <b>volume</b> <b>loading</b> (n = 7). Consecutive patients {{with a wide range}} of systolic function were included. Peak isovolumetric LV pressure (LVP(iso)) ranged from 113 to 261 mmHg. With preserved systolic function, LVP elevations neither delayed relaxation nor increased filling pressures. With decreasing systolic function, diastolic tolerance to afterload progressively disappeared: relaxation slowed and filling pressures increased (diastolic dysfunction). In severely depressed systolic function, filling pressures increased even with minor LVP elevations, suggesting baseline load-dependent elevation of diastolic pressures. The magnitude of filling pressure elevation induced in isovolumetric heartbeats was closely and inversely related to systolic performance, evaluated by LVP(iso) (r = - 0. 96), and directly related to changes in the time constant of relaxation τ (r = 0. 95). The maximum tolerated systolic LVP (without diastolic dysfunction) was similarly correlated with LVP(iso) (r = 0. 99). <b>Volume</b> <b>loading</b> itself accelerated relaxation, but augmented afterload-induced upward shift of filling pressures (7. 9 ± 3. 7 vs. 3. 0 ± 1. 5; P < 0. 01). The normal human response to even markedly increased systolic pressures is no slowing of relaxation and preservation of normal filling pressures. When cardiac function deteriorates, the LV becomes less tolerant, responding with slowed relaxation and increased filling pressures. This increase is exacerbated by <b>volume</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|E
