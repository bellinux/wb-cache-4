At present, {{there are still}} very few systematic studies on <b>vacuum</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> theory and equipment design. On {{the basis of the}} existing theories of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> pumping and venting systems, a simplified model is established in this research. The model has an aggregate unit consisted of "vacuum pump + buffer tank" and a cylindrical container (including the shot sleeve, cavity and exhaust channel). The theoretical analysis is carried out between the cavity pressure and the pumping time under different volume models. An auxiliary system for high <b>vacuum</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> is designed based on the above analysis. This system is composed of a vacuum control machine and a new vacuum stop valve. The machine has a human-computer control mode with "programmable logic controller(PLC) + touch screen" and a real-time monitoring function of vacuum degree for buffer tank and die cavity. The vacuum stop valve with the "compressed gas + piston rod + labyrinth groove" structure can realize the function of whole-process vacuum venting. The new system shows great advantages on vacuuming the cavity with a much faster speed by making tests on an existing die casting mold and a 250 t die casting machine. A die cavity pressure less than 10 kPa can be reached within 0. 8 s in the experiment and the porosity of castings can be greatly decreased. The systematic studies on <b>vacuum</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> theory and equipment have a great guiding significance for high <b>vacuum</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting,</b> and can also be applied to other high vacuum forming in related theoretical and practical research...|$|E

In {{this study}} {{a number of}} thermal {{treatment}} schemes {{over a wide range}} of temperatures between 120 ˚ to 350 ˚ C and times (30 – 120 minutes) have been experimented in an effort to understand the effect of thermal treatment on tensile properties of <b>vacuum</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> modified aluminum alloy A 356. The results show that, the morphology of eutectic silicon has a sound effect on the tensile properties of the tested alloy. The content of magnesium-based intermetallic phases, their morphology and distribution throughout the matrix affect the mechanical properties of the aged alloy as well. The reduction in the strengths of the alloy treated at 350 ˚C for two hours should be at least attributed partly to the absence of the magnesium-based intermetallic phase.

40|$|The {{effect of}} stress {{triaxiality}} on failure strain of as-cast magnesium alloy AM 60 B is examined. Experiments {{were performed on}} one uniaxial tension, two notched tension, and one near-biaxial hemispherical dome sample geometries to study the effect of stress triaxiality on the quasi-static constitutive and failure response of super <b>vacuum</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> AM 60 B castings. Two sample material origins were used, introducing another variable; they were termed Phase I and Phase II. For all tests, local strains, failure location, and specimen elongation were tracked using two or three-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC) analysis. The uniaxial specimens were tested in two orthogonal directions to evaluate the anisotropy of the casting. The uniaxial and notched tensile specimens were tested at strain rates of 0. 001 and 10 s- 1 {{to determine the effect}} of strain rate on the constitutive response. Finite element models were developed to estimate effective plastic strain histories and stress state (triaxiality) as a function of notch severity. Samples of all three tensile sample geometries consistently failed beginning at the notch root as opposed to the centre. They failed after accruing on average 14 - 16 % effective plastic strain, and they also showed a marked lack of repeatability in the failure strain distribution, with a standard deviation on average 18 % of the mean failure strain of each sample geometry. The Phase II samples showed significantly lower elongations to failure, which was attributed to elevated levels of porosity and segregated porosity bands. It was found that there is some degree of transverse anisotropy present in the AM 60 B castings (r-values of 1. 0 - 1. 1). The AM 60 B castings exhibit mild positive strain rate sensitivity, evidenced by an increase in maximum stress of 4 - 8 % with a change in strain rate from 0. 001 to 10 s- 1. Finally, higher stress triaxiality levels caused increases in maximum stress and decreases in elongation and local effective plastic strain at failure.

Magnesium casting technology was well developed during and after World War II, both in gravity sand and permanent mold casting as well as high-pressure die casting, for aerospace, defense and automotive applications. In the last 20 years, most of the development has been focused on thin-wall die casting applications in the automotive industry, taking advantages of the excellent castability of modern magnesium alloys.

40|$|Selection of {{materials}} with the expected, application-dependent characteristics constitutes {{a very important}} point in any industrial application. In the automotive and aeronautical industries, the current tendency is to use light metals and their alloys for production of various components. For example, some of the problems related to fuel consumption and weight reduction could be partially solved by using such alloys as an alternative to traditional iron-based alloy components. Due to their very attractive properties, the most commonly employed light materials for producing high-stressed components are aluminium, magnesium and their alloys. Al-based alloys have a high strength/weight ratio, good formability, excellent combination of castability and mechanical properties which together with an excellent corrosion resistance make them very appropriate for a large variety of applications. There are two important families of aluminium alloys: (i) wrought alloys, firstly cast as ingots and/or billets and then mechanically hot- and/or cold-worked into the preferred shape, and (ii) cast alloys, directly cast into their final form through different traditional or innovative processes. At the same time, there is continuing interest in Mg alloys for engineering proposals because of their lowest density directly connected to a weight saving of about 40 % compared to steel and cast iron and 20 % compared to aluminium for the same component performance. Their high specific strength, good castability and machinability, high thermal conductivity, high dimensional stability, good electromagnetic shielding property, high damping characteristics and full recyclability place them in a particular position for production of different types of components. High-pressure die casting is the most widely used technique and represents about 50 % of all light alloy casting production. The tendency to use low-pressure die casting is increasing (it accounts for about 20 % of all production). Gravity die casting, a small but growing contribution derived from a <b>vacuum</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> and squeeze casting process, represents the remaining share of manufacturing processes. Generally, during solidification in a traditional manufacturing process, volume contraction is observed. This is due to the wrong feeding system and/or gas development, which in turn generate some voids or cavities within a casting, which are in turn responsible for the presence of defects in the casting components. For these reasons, the research community and manufacturing industries are giving a high level of attention to the development of innovative production procedures. In this context, semi-solid metal processing is able to attain at least the same level of properties and performances as those obtained by conventional techniques. Progresses in materials development represent a valid support for enhancing the life of an engineering component and its reliability. In this chapter, a general overview of the actual scenario concerning the production and use of light alloys will be presented, including a short history and description of state-of-the-art techniques integrated with some results of the current research in this field carried out by the author...|$|E
