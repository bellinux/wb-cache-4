5|$|Supporting Imperial War Museum North's {{educational}} goals, {{the museum}} has operated a volunteer programme since opening in 2002. The programme seeks to engage local people at risk of social exclusion. Originally based on a National <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualification,</b> the programme was revised and relaunched in 2004, and consisted of a basic cultural heritage course, providing opportunities to develop academic skills and improve confidence, and to support individuals seeking to return to employment. In return volunteers work in the museum's public spaces {{as part of the}} front of house teams. In January 2007 the museum launched the in Touch volunteer programme, in partnership with Manchester Museum and supported by £425,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The programme was recognised by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport as a case study of its kind, in the department's Third Sector Strategy.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the start}} of the CSM, eight {{categories}} of CARICOM nationals have been eligible for free movement throughout the CSME without the need for work permits. They are: University Graduates, Media Workers, Artistes, Musicians, Sportspersons, Managers, Technical and Supervisory Staff attached to a company and Self-Employed Persons/Service Providers. In addition the spouses and immediate dependent family members of these nationals will also be exempt from work permit requirements. At the July 2006 CARICOM Summit, it was agreed to allow for free movement of two more categories of skilled persons; tertiary-trained Teachers and Nurses. It was also agreed that higglers, artisans, domestic workers and hospitality workers are {{to be added to the}} categories of labour allowed free movement at a later date, pending the agreement of an appropriate certification. This envisioned extension for the latter categories of workers such as artisans was achieved in October 2007 with the launch of the Caribbean <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualification</b> (CVQ). In 2009 Antigua and Barbuda was granted a five-year exemption to the extension of free movement to domestic workers, and in 2015 it was seeking the continuation of this exemption for a further 5 years.|$|E
25|$|Region-wide {{accreditation}} {{has also}} been planned for vocational skills. Currently local training agencies award National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) or national Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) certification, which are not valid across Member States. However, in 2003, the Caribbean Association of National Agencies (CANTA) was formed as an umbrella organization of the various local training agencies including Trinidad and Tobago's National Training Agency, the Barbados TVET Council and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States TVET agency and the HEART Trust/NTA of Jamaica. Since 2005, the member organizations of CANTA have been working together to ensure a uniformed level of certified skilled labour under the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) and CANTA itself has established a regional certification scheme that awards the Caribbean <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualification</b> (CVQ), which is to replace NVQs and national TVET certifications. The CVQ will be school-based and although based on the certification scheme of CANTA, will be awarded by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) which will be collaborating with CANTA on the CVQ programme. At the February 9–10, 2007 meeting of the Regional Coordinating Mechanism for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, officials discussed arrangements for the award of the CVQ which {{was approved by the}} Council for Human and Social Development (COHSOD) in October 2006. It was expected that the CVQ programme may be in place by mid-2007, if all the requirements are met and that provisions were being made for the holders of current NVQs to have them converted into the regionally accepted type (although no clear mandate is yet in place). This deadline was met and in October 2007, the CVQ programme was officially launched. The CVQ now facilitates the movement of artisans and other skilled persons in the CSME. This qualification will be accessible to persons already in the workforce as well as students in secondary schools across the Caribbean region. Those already in the work force will be required to attend designated centres for assessment.|$|E

40|$|There is no parity of esteem between {{academic}} and <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications</b> in the labour market. Data from the Labour Force Survey show that on average {{men and women}} working full-time with academic qualifications at one level in the national qualifications framework earn {{about the same as}} men and women with <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications</b> set notionally one level higher. So those with A levels have earnings similar to those with higher or level 4 <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications,</b> those with 5 or more O levels or higher grade GCSEs have earnings similar to those with level 3 <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications,</b> and those with 1 - 4 O levels or higher grade GCSEs have earnings similar to those with level 2 <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications.</b> These higher earnings occur firstly because academic qualifications at a given level are more successful in buying access to more highly paid occupations. Secondly, within the most highly paid managerial, professional and technical occupations, academic qualifications are associated with higher earnings.

40|$|Background : In Germany, almost 15 {{per cent}} of all first-year {{students}} leave higher education without obtaining a degree. The German post-secondary educational system is tracked however, and many dropouts enter the labour market with pre-tertiary vocational training certificates. We therefore examine if higher education dropouts benefit from these <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications</b> obtained outside {{higher education and}} use vocational credentials as a safety net. Methods Using data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS Starting Cohort 6), this study employs Cox and OLS regression models to examine the labour market transition of higher education dropouts. We distinguish the actual transitions (finding a job) from the occupational status of the first job. Results : Our results suggest that higher education dropouts without pre-tertiary <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications</b> have more difficulties finding a job, compared to dropouts with pre-tertiary <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications.</b> Comparing the occupational status of dropouts with and without pre-tertiary <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications,</b> we find {{that these are not}} associated with a higher occupational status. Conclusions : We conclude that pre-tertiary <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications</b> do serve as a safety net in case of drop out, because they protect from protracted pathways into the labour market. Apart from this we do not find evidence for additional returns of vocational certificates in terms of occupational status...|$|R
