40|$|The project PC/Microcontroller based {{drilling}} machine is an on going project which originally {{began as an}} EN 300 project in semester 2, 2001 at the Department of Engineering, USP. The <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> which is {{a component of the}} {{drilling machine}} was not fully functional at the completion of the EN 300 project. Also, many of the amplifier circuits and feedback circuits were either not fully functional or not done at all. This project report focuses on troubleshooting and improving the existing <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> design so that data can be accurately communicated between the PC or microcontroller and the various hardware associated with the drilling machine. The report also describes how an output from the interfacing card is amplified so that it can energize the solenoids that would hold the work piece in place during drilling. In addition to this, the report also explains how the feedback circuits of the drilling machine are connected to the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board.</b> An <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> prototype has been produced that communicates data accurately between the PC and the various drilling machine hardware. To validate this testing has been carried out using switches, LED’s and laboratory power supplies in the first instance and then via connections to the PC’s parallel port and running test programs from the PC to read and write data from the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board.</b> Final testing has been carried out by integrating the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> {{with the rest of the}} drilling machine components. An amplifier circuit has also been produced that facilitates the correct operation of the clamping solenoids to hold a work piece in place during the drilling process. To validate this testing has also been carried out using laboratory power supplies as well as connecting the amplifier circuit to an output of the <b>interfacing</b> <b>board</b> and running test programs from the PC and eventually testing its performance with the rest of the drilling machine components. The feedback circuits designed for the various limit switches and work piece detector associated with the drilling machine are fully operational and functional. Testing very much similar to that for the amplifier circuit for the clamping solenoids has been carried out to validate this. ...|$|R
