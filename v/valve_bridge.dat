40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} a thermo-mechanical {{analysis}} of a natural gas, internal combustion engine cylinder head are presented in this paper. The results are pertinent to the evaluation of overheating damage in critical areas. The three-dimensional geometries of the cylinder head and the water jacket were modeled {{by means of a}} computer-aided engineering tool. Commercial finite element and computational fluid dynamics codes were used to compute details of mechanical stress in the head and flow details in the cylinder and cooling jacket, respectively. A six-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine and a spark-ignition natural gas engine were modeled over a range of speeds at full load. Computed results, such as maximum allowable cylinder pressure, output power, BMEP and BSFC, were validated by experimented data in the diesel engine model. The results were in good agreement with experimental data. The results show high stresses at the <b>valve</b> <b>bridge.</b> Cylinder head temperatures and comparison of output power with high stress measurements, often exceeding the elastic limit, were found at the <b>valve</b> <b>bridge...</b>|$|E
40|$|Loading {{conditions}} and complex geometry have led cylinder heads {{to become the}} most chal-lenging parts of diesel engines. One of the most important durability problems in diesel engines is due to cracks in the <b>valves</b> <b>bridge</b> area. The {{purpose of this study is}} thermo [...] mechanical analysis of cylinder heads of diesel engines using a two-layer viscoplasticity mo-del. The results of the thermo-mechanical analysis indicate that the maximum temperature and stress occurr in the <b>valves</b> <b>bridge.</b> The results of the finite element analysis correspond with the experimental tests carried out by researchers, and illustrate cracks in cylinder heads in this region. The results of the thermo-mechanical analysis show that when the engine is running, the stress in the region is compressive, caused by thermal loading and combustion pressure. When the engine is shut off, the compressive stress turns into tensile stress because of assembly loads. The <b>valves</b> <b>bridge</b> is under cyclic tensile and compressive stress state and thus is subject to low cycle fatigue. After several cycles fatigue cracks will appear in this region. The lifetime of this part can be determined through finite element analysis inste- ad of experimental tests. The viscous strain is greater than the plastic strain which is not negligible...|$|R

40|$|Consequently, {{many other}} main circuit components, in {{addition}} to the filter components, such as switching equipment, CTs, etc, must be installed. The filters will therefore take up considerable space in a converter sta-tion. 2. 2 De-coupling of filtering and reactive power supply The development of new, effective AC filters, described in a separate section of this paper, makes it possible to perform the filtering function through a single filter bank with small Mvar rating. The new AC filter thus allows de-coupling of the functions of the filtering and the reactive power generation to a large extent. In this situation, the traditional way of generating the required reactive power would be to install a number of shunt capacitor banks.

40|$|AbstractTMF loading in diesel {{cylinder}} heads made of cast aluminium alloys {{is expected to}} steadily become more severe in the future. This increasing loading condition will lead to an early crack initialization and eventually determine component life. Against this background several cast aluminium alloys have been studied {{with respect to their}} thermal and mechanical properties. In addition to standardized specimens, near component-shaped samples were tested under thermomechanical fatigue conditions in a testing device which represents near-service conditions, in order to characterize life until a long crack is formed. The sample geometry tries to represent the <b>valve</b> <b>bridge</b> of a diesel cylinder head, which is known to be the most thermomechanically loaded and hence critical part in this component. The results of the TMF tests with this new type of sample were compared with the results obtained on standardized specimens. The experimental results formed a sound basis to improve the thermomechanical life prediction methodology for cast aluminium alloys. Two different life prediction models were used to assess the TMF life of the near-component samples. Furthermore, an aging model for cast aluminium alloys was derived from the experimental results including the pronounced change of the mechanical properties which result from the combined effects of aging and cyclic plastic deformation. The comparison of the experimental and predicted results clearly shows that the new model leads to an improvement of the TMF life prediction...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{evolution}} of cracks in the cylinder heads of a large V 8 Diesel engine during cyclic engine tests. The observations are compared with the predictions of a lifetime model for combined thermo-mechanical (TMF) and high cycle fatigue (HCF) loading, which is based on a fracture mechanics analysis of microcrack growth in viscoplastic solids and assumes that the crack advance per cycle is proportional to the cyclic crack tip opening displacement. Since the material of the cylinder heads, the cast iron EN-GJV 450, exhibits the typical features of cast iron, namely pressure dependence of the yield stress, dilatancy and tension-compression asymmetry, the Gurson model is applied and combined with the viscoplastic Chaboche model. This constitutive model together with the lifetime model is implemented into a finite element code as a user defined material routine. Published model parameters for the considered cast iron are used to carry out the simulation of the engine test. This simulation comprises a CFD analysis to determine the heat transfer coefficients, a thermal analysis of the load cycle and the mechanical analysis. The thermal analysis reproduces the temperatures at various measuring points sufficiently accurately. Finally, the mechanical analysis predicts the location and orientation of the cracks in the valve bridges correctly in all cases. However, the lifetime predictions are rather conservative compared to the tests (by a factor of 1 to 5 in lifetime). This is discussed and {{explained by the fact that}} the cracks were detected in the tests only when they had already spread over a substantial fraction of the <b>valve</b> <b>bridge</b> width. To describe this situation a long-crack analysis would be necessary, which is not yet included in the applied lifetime model...|$|E

Novel voltage and current source converter configurations, based on voltage and current reinjection concepts are proposed. These converter configurations are thoroughly analyzed in their ac and dc system sides. The fundamentals of the reinjection concept is discussed briefly, which lead to the derivation of the ideal reinjection waveform for complete harmonic cancellation and approximations for practical implementation. The concept of multi level voltage reinjection VSC is demonstrated through two types of configurations, based on standard 12 -pulse parallel and series connected VSC modified with reinjection bridges and transformers. Firing control strategies and steady state waveform analysis are presented and verified by EMTDC simulations. The multi level current reinjection CSC is also described using two configurations based on standard 12 -pulse parallel and series connected CSC modified with associated reinjection circuitry.

40|$|The human larynx is a {{versatile}} organ. Main functions are phonation, protection and {{regulation of the}} air ways. Patients suffer severely from the diagnosis of a laryngeal carcinoma of the stages T 3 and T 4.

The postoperative consequences include the loss of the native voice, the loss of regular air ways via mouth and nose, sense of smell, and the inability to build up an abdominal pressure. In this paper we focus on the feasibility of a modular larynx prosthesis which enables the laryngectomee to talk with his native voice, to breathe via the regular air ways, and to build up abdominal pressure.

40|$|A hybrid {{hydraulic}} {{actuation system}} is proposed {{as an active}} pitch link for rotorcraft applications. Such an active pitch link {{can be used to}} implement Individual Blade Control (IBC) techniques for vibration and noise reduction, in addition to providing primary control for the helicopter. Conventional technologies like electric motors and hydraulic actuators have major disadvantages when it come to applications on a rotating environment. Centralized hydraulic system require the use of mechanically complex hydraulic slip rings and electric motors have high precision mechanical moving parts that make them unattractive in application with high centrifugal load. The high energy density of smart materials can be used to design hydraulic actuators in a compact package. MagnetoRheological (MR) fluids can be used as the working fluid in such a hybrid hydraulic actuation system to implement a valving system with no moving parts. Thus, such an actuation system can be theoretically well-suited for application in a rotating environment. To develop an actuation system based on an active material stack and MR fluidic valves, a fundamental understanding of the hydraulic circuit is essential. In order to address this issue, a theoretical model was developed to understand the effect of pumping chamber geometry on the pressure losses in the pumping chamber. Three dimensional analytical models were developed for steady and unsteady flow and the results were correlated to results obtained from Computation Fluid Dynamic simulation of fluid flow inside the pumping chamber. Fundamental understanding regarding the pressure losses in a pumping chamber are obtained from the modeling process. Vortices that form in the pumping chamber (during intake) and the discharge tube (during discharge) are identified as a major cause of pressure loss in the chamber. The role of vortices during dynamic operation is also captured through a frequency domain model. Extensive experimental studies were conducted on a hybrid hydraulic system driven by a pump (actuated by a 2 " long and 1 / 4 " diameter Terfenol-D rod) and a Wheatstone bridge network of MR fluidic <b>valves.</b> The Wheatstone <b>bridge</b> network is used to provide bi-directionality to the load. Through a variety of experimental studies, the main performance metrics of the actuation system, like output power, blocked force, maximum no-load velocity and efficiency, are obtained. The actuation system exhibits a blocked force of 30 N and a maximum no-load velocity of 50 mm/s. Extensive bi-directional tests were also done for cases of no-load, inertial load and spring load to establish the frequency bandwidth of the actuator. The actuation system can output a stroke of 9 mm at an output actuator frequency of 4 Hz. An analytical model was developed to predict the performance of the hybrid hydraulic actuation system. A state space representation of the system was derived using equations derived from the control volume considerations. The results of the analytical model show that the model predicts the frequency peak of the system to within 20 Hz of the actual resonance frequency. In the third part of this dissertation, the effectiveness of the hybrid hydraulic actuation system is evaluated in a rotating environment. A piezoelectric stack that is driven by three PI- 804. 10 stacks was attached {{at the end of a}} spin bar. After balancing the spin bar using a counterweight, the spin bar is spun to an RPM of 300. This simulates a centrifugal loading of 400 g, which is slightly higher than the full-scale centrifugal loads experienced by a pitch link on a UH- 60. The performance of the actuator was measured in terms of velocity of an output cylinder shaft. Since some deterioration of performance was expected at 300 RPM, the output cylinder was redesigned to include roller bearings to support the excess force. Through no load and load tests, the effectiveness of the current hybrid actuation system design was shown as the performance of the system did not deteriorate in performance with greater centrifugal acceleration...|$|R
