40|$|In the 2013 {{negotiations}} on the ‘new CAP’ (Common Agricultural Policy), the option of <b>voluntary</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>support</b> (VCS) for sugar beet growing was introduced, which has been implemented from 2015 onwards by ten and from 2017 by eleven Member States. In 2017, a great change {{took place in the}} EU sugar sector through the abolishment of the sugar quota system, leading to an increase of competition between sugar companies and more fluctuating sugar prices than before. In such a dynamic context, questions were raised about potentially destabilising production and market effects of a VCS-regulation and about its legitimacy...|$|E
30|$|The {{models are}} static, meaning that crop {{adaptation}} to income support policies (e.g., cross compliance and greening) is not considered. More generally, any behavioral model that predicts changes {{induced by the}} new structure of the payments is implemented, but the adaptation strategies of farmers are not taken into account. Since the dataset used for the ex-ante analysis for 2019 is obtained from {{the first year of}} implementation of the CAP 2013 reform (2015), the changes induced by the new DP structure (such as <b>voluntary</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>support</b> and greening that may affect choices in terms of crop mix or the scale of livestock activities) are already contained in the FADN dataset for 2015.|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} policy implications, {{the present study}} {{suggests}} {{that the decision to}} opt for a partial convergence model (instead of a flat rate model) as well as for degressivity and capping mechanisms (instead of activating the redistributive payment) has somewhat limited the redistributive effect of direct payments in Italy. In this regard, recent evidence confirms that the impact of the application of these specific redistributive tools (such as degressivity and capping) in Italy is limited. On the other hand, if Italy had used the same amount of public resources used for the <b>voluntary</b> <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> (which is concentrated in the upper decile of the population by farm income) for the redistributive payments and/or for the payments for mountain areas, it is likely that a more equitable distribution of DPs could have been obtained.|$|R

According to actual engineering of the Fifth Coal Mine of Hemei, the reasonable <b>coupling</b> <b>support</b> structure of anchor-mesh-cable+ bottom-anchor + truss under high stress has been analyzed.

Field observations and experiments analysis show that an exhaust air roadway, level 100 of the Xiajing Coal Mine in Guangxi, China, {{is located in}} an intumescing rock with high in situ stress. Then we designed a bolt-mesh-anchor <b>coupling</b> <b>support</b> for the roadway repair and reinforcement, which consists of a first <b>coupling</b> <b>support</b> with bolt-mesh and secondary reinforcement with anchor cables.

30|$|Furthermore, the {{allocation}} of national resources across the seven components of direct payments was as follows: the BPS received 58 % of resources, greening payment (GR) received 30 % of the budget (as established by Reg. 1307 / 2013), the young farmer payments (YFPs) received 1 % of national funds, the <b>voluntary</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>support</b> (VCS) received 11 % of funding, and the small farmers scheme (SFS) was activated. It {{must be noted that}} even though the GR refers to environmental concerns, the value of this payment in Italy depends on the value of the BPS (due to the application of the tunnel model of internal convergence, i.e., partial convergence of entitlement values). Therefore, since this aid varies based on the value of the entitlements associated with the land, its redistributive effect on farm income must be properly considered. Lastly, the redistributive payment and payment for areas with natural constraints were not activated. Other decisions are reported in Table  1.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} is a two-paper {{investigation of}} observed naturalistic marital support {{behavior in a}} sample of 30 dual-earner middle-class couples with school-aged children who were videotaped in their homes over 4 days (two weekdays, two weekend days). Couples also self-reported on marital satisfaction, job stress, and emotional distress, as well as provided salivary cortisol samples that permitted analysis of diurnal cortisol slopes. Study 1 entails the conceptualization, development, and implementation of a novel observational coding system for naturalistic marital support behavior that provides a comprehensive descriptive analysis of <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> interactions as they unfold in everyday contexts. Analyses indicate that support interactions were relatively rare, predominantly brief (< 30 seconds long), more often solicited than offered, mostly instrumental compared to emotional in content, and overwhelmingly positive versus negative in emotional quality. In addition, patterns were examined among the different support variables; in particular, findings counter the Support Gap Hypothesis and suggest that wives receive more support than husbands, due specifically to wives soliciting more support. Study 2 examines the predictors and outcomes of <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> behavior using the self-reported individual variables and diurnal cortisol slopes. Findings support the notion that emotional distress and job stress predict the support behavior of both spouses. Interesting sex differences emerged, whereby wives' depressive symptoms, wives' job stress, and husbands' neuroticism appeared to have the strongest influence on supportive behavior. However, analyses indicate little evidence for <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> behavior as a predictor of marital satisfaction and diurnal cortisol slopes. The dissertation provides first insights into <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> processes as they spontaneously unfold in naturalistic settings, highlighting the utility of naturalistic observation to shed light on real-life social behavior and its links with health and well-being...|$|R
