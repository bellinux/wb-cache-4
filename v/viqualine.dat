50|$|<b>Viqualine</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} PK-5078) is an {{antidepressant}} and anxiolytic drug {{that was never}} marketed. It acts as a potent and selective serotonin releasing agent and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In addition, <b>viqualine</b> displaces diazepam from the GABAA receptor and produces benzodiazepine-like effects, indicating that {{it is also a}} positive allosteric modulator of the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. The drug has mainly been researched as a potential treatment for alcoholism.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, zimelidine {{had been}} {{withdrawn}} soon after its marketing in 1983 {{due to the}} emergence of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a serious neurological disease. With lingering concerns among some Common Market countries and activist groups about the potential of SSRIs to induce adverse effects, and the reported association between indalpine and hematological effects, which emerged in the aftermath of Pharmuka's take over by Rhône Poulenc, indalpine was abruptly taken off the market by Rhône Poulenc, to the surprise of others. Irish psychiatrist David Healy characterized indalpine as being [...] "born at the wrong time" [...] during a period when [...] "indalpine and psychiatry was under siege" [...] by different interest groups in some of the Common Market countries. In line with indalpine's fate, research and development was halted relating to the 2 other 4-alkyl-piperidine derivatives developed by Pharmuka, <b>viqualine</b> (a serotonin releasing agent) and pipequaline (a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator), both in different stages of development at the time.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aejaz_Ahmed/publication/270512329_Available_online_www_The_Importance_of_Six_Membered_Saturated_Nitrogen_Containing_Ring_in_Psychological_disorders/links/54acc5430cf21c47713a73a6.pdf ...|$|E
