In this study we examined the impact of an interactive Virtual Environment (<b>VE)</b> feedback <b>task</b> <b>on</b> the EEG patterns during robot assisted walking. We compared walking in the VE modality to two control conditions: walking with a visual attention paradigm, in which visual stimuli were unrelated to the motor task; and walking with mirror feedback, in which participants observed their own movements. Eleven healthy participants were considered. Application of independent component analysis to the EEG revealed three independent component clusters in premotor and parietal areas showing increased activity during walking with the adaptive VE training paradigm compared to the control conditions. During the interactive <b>VE</b> walking <b>task</b> spectral power in frequency ranges 8 - 12 Hz, 15 - 20 Hz and 23 - 40 Hz was significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) decreased. This power decrease is interpreted as a correlate of an active cortical area. Furthermore activity in the premotor cortex revealed gait cycle related modulations significantly different (p ≤ 0. 05) from baseline in the frequency range 23 - 40 Hz during walking. These modulations were significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) reduced depending on gait cycle phases in the interactive <b>VE</b> walking <b>task</b> compared to the control conditions. We demonstrate that premotor and parietal areas show increased activity during walking with the adaptive VE training paradigm, when compared to walking with mirror- and movement unrelated feedback. Previous research has related a premotor-parietal network to motor planning and motor intention. We argue that movement related interactive feedback enhances motor planning and motor intention.

Therefore, a higher chance exists that the current price {{is lower than the}} acceptable price, leading to an earlier completion time. An earlier completion time results in losing the chance to avoid the peak price, and the rental cost increases. However, this increase does not mean that smaller value of δ is better. When the value of δ is very small, it is unwilling to rent resources unless the price is very low. Therefore, other things being equal, the acceptable price declines while δ decreases. Because the chance is too small that the current price is lower than the acceptable price, the task is always suspended. As time goes by, to complete the <b>task</b> <b>on</b> <b>time,</b> the acceptable price increases as task urgency dramatically increases.

The DUA-CLA algorithm’s message complexity (O(fn)), lower time complexity bound (O(D + fd + nk)), and failure-free execution time (O(D + nk)) are established, where D is the worst-case communication delay, d {{is the failure}} detection bound, n {{is the number of}} nodes, and f is the number of failures. DUA-CLA is shown to have the “lazy-abort ” property — abortion of currently-infeasible tasks is deferred until there is no possibility of completing the <b>task</b> <b>on</b> <b>time.</b> Further, it exhibits “schedule-safety ” — segments (and therefore, threads) proposed as feasible for execution by a node which fails during the consensus decision will be removed from the consensus set and will not cause an otherwise-feasible segment to be excluded.

Finally, we present our implementation of DUA-CLA in a DRTSJ-compliant Java virtual machine, and quantitative results are presented validating fundamental properties of the algorithm. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Researchers and {{practitioners}} have long regarded procrastination as a self-handicapping and dysfunctional behavior. In the present study, the authors proposed {{that not all}} procrastination behaviors either are harmful or lead to negative consequences. Specifically, the authors differentiated two types of procrastinators: passive procrastinators versus active procrastinators. Passive procrastinators are procrastinators in the traditional sense. They are paralyzed by their indecision to act and fail to complete <b>tasks</b> <b>on</b> <b>time.</b> In contrast, active procrastinators are a “positive ” type of procrastinator. They prefer to work under pressure, and they make deliberate decisions to procrastinate. The present results showed that although active procrastinators procrastinate {{to the same degree}} as passive pro-crastinators, they are more similar to nonprocrastinators than to passive procrastinators in terms of purposive use of time, control of time, self-efficacy belief, coping styles, and out-comes including academic performance. The present findings offer a more sophisticated understanding of procrastination behavior and indicate a need to reevaluate its implications for outcomes of individuals.
