30|$|Similar to {{the case}} of FLIWAS, the initial {{proposal}} for Program VIKING did not include any plan to develop an IS for the collaborative program itself. In {{the early stages of the}} program, the alliance partners shared information with each other via physical group meetings and presentations, printed documents, and emails. However, as the number of partners steadily increased, these means of information sharing quickly turned inefficient, and issues such as document versioning, format compatibility and security started to gain priority on the meeting agendum. After multiple requests from partners for a shared document repository, the steering committee decided to initiate the development of a <b>collaboration</b> <b>portal,</b> which resulted in a new IS named VIKING Cockpit. VIKING Cockpit collects and provides access to all essential information of Program VIKING. There were three initial requirements for the VIKING cockpit. First, this cockpit should be able to store a large amount of data in various formats, ranging from geographical maps to meeting reports. Second, access to this portal should be secured as the stored data may contain sensitive information. Finally, the portal should be available in both Dutch and German. Later, another requirement was added to the list: the portal should be able to invoke FLIWAS. Consequently, the VIKING Cockpit now has a link to a light version of FLIWAS and thus can play the role of a DMIS during disaster, in addition to the role of a <b>collaboration</b> <b>portal</b> for the program during a non-disaster time.|$|R

40|$|Problem Statement: Each semester, the OMIS 498 Capstone course {{creates a}} new SharePoint site in order to {{facilitate}} team collaboration, causing wasted time and lost resources. When a new site is created, it a standard, featureless site that must be rebuilt from the ground up. The gap that my work addressed was to find ways to easier facilitate the SharePoint site in such a way to better utilize its features, and make transitions to future semesters more seamless. Methods: My work consisted of a four-phase process. It started with envisioning an optimal state of functionality. This was done by working with Dr. Aase to determine a desired state, and working with team leaders within our class. Then I planned my approach, which included research and working to get the SharePoint web server configured to allow features and maximum functionality. Next, I developed team sites, pages, templates and started enabling features such as alerts and calendars to improve class productivity. The class began using the SharePoint site early in the development phase. Finally, during the stabilization phase, I troubleshot any quirks, took requests for added features and made sure optimal features were being used. Results: As a result of the above process, the team <b>collaboration</b> <b>portal</b> has been used successfully by our class {{for the majority of the}} semester. Large quantities of data have been uploaded to the SharePoint site without issue, alerts and calendars are working and information is flowing as it should through the site. We also used the website to coordinate community service efforts with a local soup kitchen, Feed em' Soup. Conclusion: Overall, I am very satisfied with the results of the SharePoint team <b>collaboration</b> <b>portal.</b> There were some kinks in the beginning of the project relating to server configuration and settings within SharePoint itself. Once these issues were addressed, operations ran very smoothly. Ultimately, the class was able to fully utilize the team sites and its features, creating a better, more efficient flow of information for the teams. B. A. (Bachelor of Arts...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in cross-border disaster management is the {{development and use of}} information systems that cater the needs of heterogeneous relief agencies, policies, activities and cultures. Drawing upon activity theory, this paper examines cross-border information systems development for disaster management. We infuse the concept of boundary objects into activity theory by the characterization of the artifacts. This allows articulating how the socio-technical objects are meshed with the process of cross-border collaboration for systems development. Our longitudinal ethnographic field study on a cross-border flood management project, VIKING, revealed how the project was empowered and developed by four key boundary objects, i.e. the governance structure of the program, two information systems (a disaster management information system and an online <b>collaboration</b> <b>portal),</b> and recurring cross-border exercises as an evaluation and feedback mechanism. The selective institutionalizations of these key boundary objects helped the participants overcome various contradictions existed in the systems development. The study results also show that both goal-oriented actions and boundary objects can affect the outcomes of long-term large-scale disaster management systems development.|$|R

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} such as {{the earthquake}} and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan in 2011 can have catastrophic effects on businesses. This type of unexpected event can cause {{millions of dollars in}} damages, lost sales and can impact company stock performance. With 39 % of supply disruptions occurring at indirect suppliers, companies can no longer ignore their supply networks when determining supply chain risk. Unlike measuring risk within a single company, measuring the risk of a network requires collaboration amongst all players. This research aims to mitigate the complexity of data collection through the understanding of the factors that influence supply chain risk data collection. Factors vary throughout different players in the networks. Internally, supply chain transparency must be indoctrinated in the culture of the executing company. Necessary parties must be well informed and incentivized to take part in this labor intensive exercise. By indoctrinating transparency into the culture, companies legitimize this initiative to both employees and suppliers. Through a series of conversations held with suppliers, the research conducted in this thesis identifies the internal and external factors that determine success in supply chain risk data collection.

When the personal portal was converted into the first business product, a Team <b>Collaboration</b> <b>Portal</b> (TCP), all {{efforts were made to}} identify patterns of similar design recurring across the portal, and unify them using conventional methods. By exploiting reuse opportunities across the portal, we wanted to cut the development cost and facilitate future enhancements. Building a Web portal product line was not our business or technical goal yet. Despite our efforts to maximize reuse, we were aware of much counter-productive repetition in portal design and implementation that could not be avoided with the design methods we used. At the same time, new business opportunities appeared that required us to build other portals, for seemingly very diverse applications, in a very short time. To meet the challenge, we applied XVCL on top of TCP, converting it into a product line architecture. Our solution allowed us to manage multiple (nine by now) portals from a base of common code smaller than the original TCP, and facilitated rapid development of new Web portals. In the paper, we describe the process that led to building a product line. We explain the difficulties in building an effective generic portal solution using conventional techniques.

40|$|Building an {{aircraft}} carrier {{is one of the}} most complex manufacturing undertakings in the world. Each component must be designed, tested and manufactured to not only Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding's (NGSB) exceptionally high standards, but also to the standards, requirements and approvals of both the Navy and the US Federal Government. As a result of these standards and requirements, lead times for construction materials can exceed two years, while a similar component, purchased for industrial use may have a lead time of 90 days. To add to the complexity, the scheduled delivery date for the carrier is fixed, and compressed so that engineering design and construction must take place concurrently. In essence, the ship is under construction years before the design is complete. As a result of concurrent engineering, a complex procurement process and a limited vendor base, some material is chronically late to the Required-in-Yard (RIY) date, causing deviations from the optimal construction schedule and impacting the cost of the ship. This thesis analyzes the current CVN 78 valve purchasing process to identify opportunities to leverage the product model and existing process infrastructure to improve material delivery to schedule and decrease construction costs for CVN 79. It is the goal of this research to improve the supply chain to support the preferred construction schedule, while reducing cost and risk associated with component acquisition. This thesis begins with an analysis of the current supply chain system within NGSB New Carrier Construction. (cont.) It then explores the current state of vendor relations between NGSB and the supply base. The cost impact for delaying construction due to delinquent valves is identified and presented. Then specific vendor management strategies are examined. This thesis proposes a framework for improving on-time delivery of the component and lowering overall supply chain cost by (1) pursuing strategic alliances with valve vendors, (2) providing greater visibility of demand earlier in the engineering design cycle and (3) using this visibility to drive procurement timing to improve delivery to scheduled need date. The thesis presents a case study in <b>vendor</b> <b>collaboration</b> and provides recommendations. Finally, it discusses the impact of applying the framework to similar components within the New Carrier Construction Program and the potential application of the framework to NGSB's other active programs and shipbuilding locations. by Lory Hammer.
