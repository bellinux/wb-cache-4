5|$|In April 1942, Brigadier General Spencer Akin and his Australian {{counterpart}} at LHQ, Major General Colin Simpson, {{agreed to}} pool their resources {{and establish a}} combined intelligence organisation, known as the Central Bureau. The Australian, British, and US Armies, {{as well as the}} RAAF and the RAN all supplied personnel for this formation, which worked on codebreaking and decrypting Japanese message traffic. This Magic and Ultra intelligence was <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> to operations in SWPA.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example of}} a dinitrogen complex to be {{discovered}} was 2+ (see figure at right), and soon many other such complexes were discovered. These complexes, in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one {{lone pair of electrons}} to a central metal cation, illustrate how N2 might bind to the metal(s) in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the Haber process: these processes involving dinitrogen activation are <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> in biology and in the production of fertilisers.|$|E
5|$|Emil Pagliarulo, {{a former}} writer at Looking Glass Studios, was {{commissioned}} by Bethesda to write the main script of Fallout 3; although he worked in part to 's script. Pagliarulo took charge of writing the incipit of Fallout 3, then played by Ron Perlman, {{and he tried to}} be inspired by first Fallout's incipit, in 1997, which he considered <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> to describe the story that Fallout 3 would have to tell. To succeed in making this script effective, Pagliarulo, had to go in the opposite direction to his previous work on Oblivion, which both for setting and characters, represented an extreme Fallout inverse.|$|E
5|$|Scouts South Africa is {{actively}} involved in community work, particularly {{in the rural areas}} of South Africa. In some rural areas, such as the greater Tzaneen area, there are Troops with over 100 Scouts. Rural Troops are often limited in their activities by funding and lack of equipment. Their programme focuses on educating the Scouts in becoming good citizens and in the dangers of HIV. Educating Scouts in HIV and AIDS is <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> due to the large number of infections in both rural and urban areas of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The Congo {{was also}} a <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> {{economic}} asset to the Allied powers. The Congo's gold alone contributed some $28.5 million to the Allied war effort, while its exports of rubber and uranium provided vital sources of raw materials. Most of the uranium used during the American Manhattan Project – including that used for the nuclear weapons dropped on the Japanese towns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – was supplied by the Belgian firm Union Minière du Haut Katanga from Katanga Province in the Belgian Congo.|$|E
5|$|Trucks are <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> to U.S. industry, however, {{measuring}} {{the impact of}} trucking on the economy is more difficult, because trucking services are so intertwined with all sectors of the economy. According to the measurable share of the economy that trucking represents, the industry directly contributes about 5 percent to {{the gross domestic product}} annually. In addition, the industry plays a critical support role for other transportation modes and for other sectors of the economy such as the resource, manufacturing, construction, and wholesale and retail trade industries.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War II on December 7, 1941, the Federal {{government}} {{set up the}} War Shipping Administration {{to manage}} the <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> maritime shipping and Naval support needs of the U.S. and its Allies, including the power to expropriate civilian-owned boats. On April 1, 1942, the government acquired the Old Bay Line's State of Virginia and State of Maryland. On July 13, the President Warfield and Yorktown were also taken over. Thus, by mid-1942, four of the Old Bay Line's six ships had become government property, leaving the company only the two oldest and smallest ships in its fleet {{for the duration of}} the war, the City of Norfolk and City of Richmond.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December, Vandermaesen made a {{stand before}} Port Napoleon, {{defending}} {{the entrance to}} the town with his available regular troops and some small cannon. Keating attacked him, engaging the French front while a second attack by Madras sepoys outflanked the French line and disrupted it, allowing a successful frontal assault. With their defences breached the French fell back and on 2 December Decaen proposed a ceasefire, which was accepted. The following day Decaen surrendered, although with guarantees that he and the garrison would be repatriated and allowed to retain their personal arms and Eagles. Although some in the British force were unhappy with the terms of the surrender, the British commanders were relieved to have the invasion complete before the hurricane season began later in the month. The danger to the 70 ships in the British fleet from such a storm was serious and it was <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> that they be in a safe harbour when the hurricane season began.|$|E
5|$|Transferred to the Channel Fleet, Leviathan was {{attached}} to service under Lord Howe and served with him during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 alongside John Willett Payne, captain of HMS Russell. The campaign culminated in the Glorious First of June, when a French fleet was defeated by Howe's innovative tactics, but was ultimately successful in protecting a large grain convoy from the United States. Seymour's command of Leviathan was <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> in the victory, the ship fighting at the initial engagement of the 28 May and seeing extensive action during the battle itself. Seymour {{was one of only}} a few of Howe's commanders to successfully close with the French line, although he was unable to break through it. Leviathan then engaged closely with America, which she reduced to a battered wreck in a duel that lasted two hours. Leviathan was also badly damaged, having taken fire from Éole and Trajan during the fighting. At Howe's order, Seymour then left America (which was later captured) and joined the reformed fleet that held off a French counter-attack in the latter stages of the battle. In the aftermath of the action, Seymour was one of the captains marked out for praise, being presented with a medal commemorating his service during the engagement. Leviathan had suffered 11 killed and 32 wounded in the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Following Jardine's appointment, {{a meeting}} was {{arranged}} with Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr {{and his two}} fast bowlers Larwood and Voce at London's Piccadilly Hotel. Jardine explained his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring {{to one side of}} the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl accurately on leg stump and make the ball rise up into the body of the batsman. The bowlers agreed that they could, and that it might prove effective, but Jardine stressed that bowling accurately was <b>vitally</b> <b>important,</b> or Bradman would dominate the bowling. Larwood believed that Jardine saw Bradman as his main target and wished to attack him psychologically as well as in a cricketing sense. At the same time, other Australian batsmen were also discussed. Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the remainder of the 1932 season with mixed success. Jardine also visited Frank Foster who had toured Australia in 1911–12 to discuss field placings appropriate to Australian conditions. Foster had bowled leg theory on that tour with his fielders placed close in on the leg-side, as had George Hirst in 1903–04. During the second half of the season, the team to tour Australia was announced. The selection of four fast bowlers and a few medium pacers was very unusual at the time, and it was commented on by the hosts' media, including Bradman. The selection of Eddie Paynter, who did not have a strong record, to replace the ill Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji was very likely a choice of Jardine. He had a history of good performances against Yorkshire, and Jardine considered that a player's record against northern counties was a good indication of his potential at international level.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> {{that all}} braking {{is done in}} a {{controlled}} manner, as any sudden shocks impose very high loads on the rack rail and pinion wheels, and can cause damage.|$|E
25|$|Bile is {{the major}} pathway for the {{excretion}} of copper and is <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> in the control of liver copper levels. Most fecal copper results from biliary excretion; the remainder is derived from unabsorbed copper and copper from desquamated mucosal cells.|$|E
25|$|Although the Maya {{calendar}} was {{not tied}} to the Sun, John Teeple has proposed that the Maya calculated the solar year to somewhat greater accuracy than the Gregorian calendar. Both astronomy and an intricate numerological scheme for the measurement of time were <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> components of Maya religion.|$|E
25|$|Understanding how {{a corpse}} {{decomposes}} and {{the factors that}} may alter the rate of decay is extremely important for evidence in death investigations. Campobasso, Vella, and Introna consider the factors that may inhibit or favor the colonization of insects to be <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> when determining the time of insect colonization.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{work began}} at the park in 1976 to uncover {{the remains of the}} village. Greenwood Furnace was {{designated}} a Historical Landmark in 1995 by ASM International in recognition of the superior quality iron that was produced by Greenwood Iron and was <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> to the westward expansion of the railroads.|$|E
25|$|YWAM ship {{equipped}} ministries, {{the maritime}} arm of YWAM's Mercy Ministries, uses ships to bring {{physical and spiritual}} healing {{to the poor and}} needy. YWAM ships have provided <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> surgeries, dental care, medical supplies, food, seeds, construction materials, development projects, training, and their message to the isolated islands and rivers of the world.|$|E
25|$|Bells were <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> {{to daily}} life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, {{to call the}} Mission {{residents}} to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with ringing the mission bells.|$|E
25|$|One {{central and}} <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> {{agreement}} was the Statute of Westminster 1931, which conferred full self-government upon the Dominions Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, while preparing {{the first steps}} towards the eventual Commonwealth of Nations, {{and away from the}} designation 'British Empire'. In 1930, the first British Empire Games sports competition was held successfully among Empire nations in Hamilton, Canada.|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} RAM of the 512K was <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> for the Macintosh as {{it finally}} allowed for more powerful software applications, {{such as the}} then-popular program Microsoft Multiplan. However, Apple continued to market the 128K {{for over a year}} as an entry-level computer, the mid-level 512K and high-end Lisa (and claiming that it could be easily expanded should the user ever need more RAM).|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{the brigade}} did achieve a <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> task {{in nearly a}} week of night-and-day fighting. While they fought on from Muar Harbour to Parit Sulong Bridge, {{stalling}} the Imperial Guards Division, strongly backed by air and tank support, the three brigades of Westforce in the Segamat area were able to withdraw safely down the central trunk road to Labis, and thence towards the key crossroads at Yong Peng.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Chicago {{was one of}} {{the most}} unionized cities in the world. Nearly 243,000 Chicagoans belonged to unions, about a quarter of the workforce. One-third of these worked in a single {{industry}} (meatpacking). The Teamsters were <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> to the Chicago labor movement, for a sympathy strike by the Teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout the city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{confusion}} {{about the idea of}} dissonance is created by the fact that musicians and writers sometimes use the word dissonance and related terms in a precise and carefully defined way, more often in an informal way, and very often in a metaphorical sense ("rhythmic dissonance"). For many musicians and composers, the essential ideas of dissonance and resolution are <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> ones that deeply inform their musical thinking on a number of levels.|$|E
25|$|An issue arose as {{to whether}} the Admiralty should retain control of {{warehouses}} at Gibraltar, which were then underused. Tryon reported that in the event of war, stores immediately available at Gibraltar might be <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> to the fleet, and that at such a time it would be virtually impossible to get back storage space relinquished in peace time. He {{was one of the few}} at that time to recognise the port's strategic significance for the fleet.|$|E
25|$|Madame Montour's {{village of}} Otstonwakin or Ostuagy was a <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> {{location}} during {{the settlement of}} what is now Lycoming County. Her village at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River was an important stopping point for the Moravian missionaries who were spreading the gospel throughout the wilderness of Pennsylvania during the 1740s. Count Zinzendorf, a missionary being guided by Conrad Weiser with the permission of Shikellamy, came to Ostuagy in 1742.|$|E
25|$|Elk Knob State Park's {{location}} atop an amphibolite peak {{has made}} it a <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> and ecologically unique area. Amphibolite is a dark metamorphic rock which is rich in nutrients and supports the growth of rare plants. Elk Knob and Rittle Knob, which {{are now part of}} Elk Knob State Park, are ecologically rich sites that host diverse and rare plant species such as Gray's lily, rattlesnake root, flame azalea, purple fringed orchid and trailing wolfsbane.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the Salt Lake Valley, the Mormons literally {{had to make a}} place to live. They created irrigation systems, laid out farms, built houses, churches and schools. Access to water was crucially important. Almost immediately, Brigham Young set out to identify and claim additional community sites. While it was difficult to find large areas in the Great Basin where water sources were dependable and growing seasons long enough to raise <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> subsistence crops, satellite communities began to be formed.|$|E
25|$|Human {{missions}} to Mars will include several transitions between different gravitational environments. These changes will eventually affect the reflex eye movements. A {{key question is}} whether astronauts can have different sets of reflexes among which they can rapidly switch based on the gravitational environment. Determination of the dual-adaptive capabilities of reflex eye movements in such circumstances is <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> {{so that it can}} be determined to what extent the Sensory-motor coupling skills acquired in one-g environment will transfer to others.|$|E
25|$|Ownership of Greenwood Furnace Iron Works was {{transferred}} to John A. Wright in 1847. Wright {{was one of the}} founders of the Pennsylvania Railroad in nearby Altoona. The ironworks at Greenwood and nearby Freedom Iron Works were supervised in part by Andrew Carnegie. Under the leadership of Wright and Carnegie Greenwood and Freedom became <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> centers of iron production for the booming railroad industry. The company expanded its iron output by building a Bessemer furnace at Freedom Iron Works and building a second stack at Greenwood Furnace.|$|E
25|$|We are {{now living}} in a G-Zero world, one in which no single country or bloc of {{countries}} has {{the political and economic}} leverage—or the will—to drive a truly international agenda. The result will be intensified conflict on the international stage over <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> issues, such as international macroeconomic coordination, financial regulatory reform, trade policy, and climate change. This new order has far-reaching implications for the global economy, as companies around the world sit on enormous stockpiles of cash, waiting for the current era of political and economic uncertainty to pass. Many of them can expect an extended wait.|$|E
25|$|The Teamsters were <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> to {{the labor}} {{movement}}, for a strike or sympathy strike by the Teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood. It also meant that Teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes {{in order to avoid}} strikes, and control of a Teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues. During Shea's presidency, the entire Teamsters union was notoriously corrupt. Noted labor historian John R. Commons famously concluded that during this time, the Teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} contribution {{was made by}} the Belgian Congo. Congolese soldiers of the Force Publique were involved in fighting with Italian forces during the East African Campaign. Congolese soldiers also served in the Middle East and Burma. The Congo was also a <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> economic asset to the allied powers, particularly through its exports of rubber and uranium; in fact the uranium used during the Manhattan Project – including that used for the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was supplied by the Belgian firm Union Minière du Haut Katanga from Katanga Province in the Belgian Congo.|$|E
25|$|Iran and Syria {{are close}} {{strategic}} allies, and Iran has provided significant support for Syria in the Syrian Civil War. This {{is said to}} include technical support, some combat troops, and $9bn in financial support. Iran views the civil war as a critical front in an existential battle that directly relates to its geopolitical security. Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, was reported in September 2011 to be vocally {{in favor of the}} Syrian government. The Syrian city of Zabadani is <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> to Assad and to Iran because, at least as late as June 2011, the city served as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps's logistical hub for supplying Hezbollah.|$|E
25|$|Lode {{gold was}} first {{discovered}} on Bougainville in 1930. The discovery of vast copper ore deposits in the Crown Prince Range on Bougainville Island during the 1960s {{led to the}} establishment of the huge Bougainville Copper Mine by the Australian company Conzinc Rio Tinto. The Panguna mine began production in 1972 under the management of Bougainville Copper Ltd, with the government of Papua New Guinea as a 20% shareholder. At the time, the Panguna mine was the largest open cut mine in the world. It produced more than 45% of Papua New Guinea's national export revenue, and was, as such, <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> to the economy.|$|E
25|$|While {{the heavy}} warmbloods of the north-west and south have {{distinct}} identities, these horses were bred all over Germany and well-beyond. One stronghold for heavy warmbloods has been Moritzburg, the State Stud that serves Saxony and Thuringia. During {{the last quarter}} of the 19th century and the first quarter of the 20th century, two-thirds of the state stallion roster was made up of Oldenburg sires. The descendants of these stallions were saved from mandatory castration by State Equerry Dr. Herta Steiner, and through her efforts and those of dedicated breeders, the heavy warmbloods were saved. The blood proved to be <b>vitally</b> <b>important,</b> as these horses were used to improve the stock elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Cost {{reduction}} was {{the reason}} for many revisions. Reducing manufacturing costs was <b>vitally</b> <b>important</b> to Commodore's survival during the price war and leaner years of the 16-bit era. The C64's original (NMOS based) motherboard would go through two major redesigns, (and numerous sub-revisions) exchanging positions of the VIC-II, SID and PLA chips. Initially, {{a large portion of the}} cost was eliminated by reducing the number of discrete components, such as diodes and resistors, which enabled the use of a smaller printed circuit board. There were 16 total C64 motherboard revisions, most of them aimed at simplifying and reducing manufacturing costs. Some board revisions were exclusive to PAL regions. All C64 motherboards were manufactured in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Military and {{civilian}} observers from every major power closely followed {{the course of}} the war. Most were able to report on events from the perspective of embedded positions within the land and naval forces of both Russia and Japan. These military attachés and other observers prepared first-hand accounts of the war and analytical papers. In-depth observer narratives of the war and more narrowly focused professional journal articles were written soon after the war; and these post-war reports conclusively illustrated the battlefield destructiveness of this conflict. This {{was the first time the}} tactics of entrenched positions for infantry defended with machine guns and artillery became <b>vitally</b> <b>important.</b> Both would become dominant factors in World War I.|$|E
