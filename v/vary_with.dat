5000|$|The thermal {{conductivity}}, , {{is often}} {{treated as a}} constant, though {{this is not always}} true. While the thermal conductivity of a material generally <b>varies</b> <b>with</b> temperature, the variation can be small over a significant range of temperatures for some common materials. In anisotropic materials, the thermal conductivity typically <b>varies</b> <b>with</b> orientation; in this case [...] is represented by a second-order tensor.

5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of chronometers, especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry or Masonry {{consists}} of fraternal organisations that trace their origins {{to the local}} fraternities of stonemasons, which {{from the end of}} the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.|$|E

The Lottery has held Millionaire Raffles irregularly: some during spring; but most {{have been drawn}} on New Years Day. Rules <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> each raffle; the top prize is usually $1million; generally, raffle prizes are paid in lump sum.|$|E

No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of ongoing research.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{readers have}} a choice of {{approximately}} 120 daily newspapers with a total of 50 million copies of set paper with an average subscription rate of 1.13 newspapers per household. The main newspaper's publishers are Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Nikkei Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun. According to a survey conducted by the Japanese Newspaper Association in June 1999, 85.4 per cent of men and 75 per cent of women read a newspaper every day. Average daily reading times <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> 27.7 minutes on weekdays and 31.7 minutes on holidays and Sunday.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals have}} a {{specific}} temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> the seasons. Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer hibernation {{that allows them to}} avoid the hottest and driest periods.|$|E

5|$|Sources <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> {{regards to}} when the {{singular}} Dąbrowski Legion was expanded into multiple Legions. Pivka and Roffe note that in May 1797 the Legion was reorganized into two formations, the first being commanded by Karol Kniaziewicz and the second by Józef Wielhorski, each numbering about 3,750 infantry, not counting artillery support. Davies, however, states that the Second Legion was formed in 1798 under Józef Zajączek. In July 1797 the Legions suppressed another insurrection, this time in Reggio Emilia.|$|E
5|$|The Maine Coon {{is a long}} {{or medium}} haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, {{although}} texture may <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> coat color. The length is shorter {{on the head and}} shoulders, and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.|$|E

While robins occasionally overwinter {{in the northern part}} of the United States and southern Canada, most migrate to winter south of Canada from Florida and the Gulf Coast to central Mexico, as well as along the Pacific Coast. Most depart south by the end of August and begin to return north in February and March (exact dates <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> latitude and climate).|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E
