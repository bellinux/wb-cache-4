5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} {{the text of}} the four Gospels based on the <b>Vulgate.</b> It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the <b>Vulgate.</b> There are numerous differences from the <b>Vulgate,</b> where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, there {{does not seem to be}} a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.|$|E

5|$|In November 1533, {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the fifth edition, Sepúlveda sent Erasmus a description of the ancient Vatican manuscript, informing him that it differed from the text which he had edited in favour of the <b>Vulgate</b> in 365 places. We do not know anything about these 365 readings except for one. Erasmus in Adnotationes to Acts 27:16 wrote that according to the Codex from the Library Pontifici (i.e. Codex Vaticanus) name of the island is καυδα (Cauda), not κλαυδα (Clauda) as in his Novum Testamentum (Tamet si quidam admonent in codice Graeco pontificiae bibliothecae scriptum haberi, καυδα, id est, cauda). In another letter sent to Erasmus in 1534 Sepúlveda informed him, that Greek manuscripts were altered from the <b>Vulgate.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century Western {{scholars}} {{became aware}} of the manuscript {{as a consequence of the}} correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library, successively Paulus Bombasius, and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether the Codex Vaticanus contained the Comma Johanneum, and Bombasius supplied a transcript of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 to show that it did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 cross-checked all places where Erasmus's New Testament (the Textus Receptus) differed from the <b>Vulgate,</b> and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where the Codex Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost. Consequently, the Codex Vaticanus acquired the reputation of being an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the <b>Vulgate</b> rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not until much later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the <b>Vulgate</b> and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as the Codex Regius (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now Bibliothèque nationale de France).|$|E
5|$|It was {{a bilingual}} edition, the Greek text {{was in a}} left column, Latin in a right column, and it is clear, the Greek text {{was not the first}} target of this edition, it was the Latin text of <b>Vulgate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The non-deuterocanonicals {{gave the}} Common Bible {{a total of}} 81 books: it {{included}} 1 Esdras (also known as 3 Ezra), 2 Esdras (4 Ezra), and the Prayer of Manasseh, books that {{have appeared in the}} <b>Vulgate's</b> appendix since Jerome's time [...] "lest they perish entirely", but are not considered canonical by Catholics and are thus not included in most modern Catholic Bibles.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a way it}} is {{legitimate}} to say that Erasmus [...] "synchronized" [...] or [...] "unified" [...] the Greek and the Latin traditions of the New Testament by producing {{an updated version of}} either simultaneously. Both being part of canonical tradition, he clearly found it necessary to ensure that both were actually presenting the same content. In modern terminology, he made the two traditions [...] "compatible". This is clearly evidenced by the fact that his Greek text is not just the basis for his Latin translation, but also the other way round: there are numerous instances where he edits the Greek text to reflect his Latin version. For instance, since the last six verses of Revelation were missing from his Greek manuscript, Erasmus translated the <b>Vulgate's</b> text back into Greek. Erasmus also translated the Latin text into Greek wherever he found that the Greek text and the accompanying commentaries were mixed up, or where he simply preferred the <b>Vulgate’s</b> reading to the Greek text.|$|R
50|$|The Post-Vulgate, written {{probably}} between 1230 and 1240, is {{an attempt}} to create greater unity in the material, and to de-emphasise the secular love affair between Lancelot and Guinevere in favor of the Quest for the Holy Grail. It omits almost all of the <b>Vulgate's</b> Lancelot Proper section, making it much shorter than its source, and directly condemns everything but the spiritual life. It does not survive complete, but has been reconstructed from French, Castilian Spanish, and Portuguese fragments.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the manuscript's early history. According to Hort, {{it was written in}} the West, {{probably}} in Rome, as suggested {{by the fact that the}} chapter division in the Acts common to Sinaiticus and Vaticanus occurs in no other Greek manuscript, but is found in several manuscripts of the Latin <b>Vulgate.</b> Robinson countered this argument, suggesting that this system of chapter divisions was introduced into the <b>Vulgate</b> by Jerome himself, as a result of his studies at Caesarea. According to Kenyon the forms of the letters are Egyptian and they were found in Egyptian papyri of earlier date. Gardthausen Ropes and Jellicoe thought it was written in Egypt. Harris believed that the manuscript came from the library of Pamphilus at Caesarea, Palestine. Streeter, Skeat, and Milne also believed that it was produced in Caesarea.|$|E
5|$|Manuscripts 1eap and 1rK Erasmus {{borrowed}} from Johannes Reuchlin. The {{rest of the}} manuscripts he {{borrowed from}} Dominicans. It is significant {{that he did not}} use the Codex Basilensis, which was held at the Basel University Library, and was available for him. Erasmus had three manuscripts of the Gospels and Acts, four manuscripts of the Pauline epistles, but only one manuscript with the Book of Revelation. In every book of the New Testament he compared three or four manuscripts, except the last book, Book of Revelation. Unfortunately, this manuscript was not complete, it lacked the final leaf, which contained the last six verses of the book. Instead of delaying the publication, on account of the search for another manuscript, he decided to translate the missing verses from the Latin <b>Vulgate</b> into Greek. He used an inferior manuscript of <b>Vulgate</b> with textual variant libro vitae (book of life) instead ligno vitae (tree of life) in Rev 22:19. Even {{in other parts of the}} Book of Revelation and other books of the New Testament Erasmus occasionally introduced self-created Greek text material taken from the <b>Vulgate.</b> F. H. A. Scrivener remarked, that in Rev 17:4 he created a new Greek word: ἀκαθαρτητος (instead τὰ ἀκάθαρτα). There is no such word in Greek language as ακαθαρτητος. In Rev 17:8 he used καιπερ εστιν (and yet is) instead of και παρεσται (and shall come). In Acts 9:6 the question that Paul asks at the time of his conversion on the Damascus road, Τρέμων τε καὶ θαμβὣν εἲπεν κύριε τί μέ θέλεις ποιῆσαι ("And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do?") was incorporated from the <b>Vulgate.</b>|$|E
5|$|The legend that Joseph of Arimathea {{retrieved}} certain holy relics {{was introduced}} by the French poet Robert de Boron in his 13th-century version of the grail story, {{thought to have been}} a trilogy though only fragments of the later books survive today.

5000|$|The Generations of Noah or Table of Nations ( [...] of the Hebrew Bible) is a {{genealogy}} of {{the sons}} of Noah and their dispersion into many lands after the Flood, focusing on the major known societies. The term [...] "nations" [...] to describe the descendants is a standard English translation of the Hebrew word [...] "goy", following the 400 CE Latin <b>Vulgate's</b> [...] "nationes" [...] / [...] "nationibus", and {{does not have the}} same political connotations that the word entails today.|$|R
5000|$|Much {{scholarship}} {{over the}} last fifty years has been dedicated to the translation and interpretation of [...] "conversatio morum". The older translation [...] "conversion of life" [...] has generally been replaced with phrases such as [...] "to a monastic manner of life", drawing from the <b>Vulgate's</b> use of conversatio as a translation of [...] "citizenship" [...] or [...] "homeland" [...] in Philippians 3:20. Some scholars have claimed that the vow formula of the Rule is best translated as [...] "to live in this place as a monk, in obedience to its rule and abbot." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is sometimes}} erroneously {{cited as the}} only known Greek copy to read in Luke 2:22 αὐτῆς with the Complutensian Polyglot. However according to Caspar Rene Gregory who personally viewed the manuscript it actually reads αὐτῶν and not αὐτῆς. No Greek manuscripts of the NT read αὐτῆς in Luke 2:22, they either read αὐτῶν, αὑτον or αὐτου. The form αὐτῆς in the Complutensian Polyglot and the critical editions of Beza and Elzevir is wholly derived from the Latin eius (which could be either masculine or feminine). Its inclusion in the King James Bible is simply another example where a reading not found in any Greek manuscript was adopted via the Latin <b>Vulgate's</b> influence on Beza's critical editions.|$|R
5|$|The {{provenance}} {{and early}} history of the codex is uncertain; Rome (Hort), southern Italy, Alexandria (Kenyon,, 1912, p. 88. Burkitt), and Caesarea (T. C. Skeat) have been suggested as the origin. Hort's argument for Rome rests mainly on certain spellings of proper names, such as Ισακ and Ιστραηλ, which show a Western or Latin influence. A second argument is that the chapter division of Acts, {{similar to that of}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, is not found in any other Greek manuscript, but is present in several manuscripts of the Latin <b>Vulgate.</b> Robinson counters the argument by suggesting that this system of chapter divisions was introduced into the <b>Vulgate</b> by Jerome himself, {{as a result of his}} studies at Caesarea. According to Hort, it was copied from a manuscript whose line length was 12–14 letters per line, because where the Codex Vaticanus's scribe made large omissions, they were typically 12–14 letters long.|$|E
5|$|The same distigmai were {{observed}} in Codex Fuldensis, especially in the section containing 1 Cor 14:34–35. The distigme of two codices indicate {{a variant of the}} Western manuscripts, which placed 1 Cor 14:34–35 after 1 Cor 14:40 (manuscripts: Claromontanus, Augiensis, Boernerianus, 88, itd, g, and some manuscripts of <b>Vulgate).</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{attack was}} made in 1521 by Paulus Bombasius, the prefect of the Vatican Library, because in Greek text Erasmus {{departed}} from the common readings of the <b>Vulgate.</b> He informed Erasmus that in the Vatican Library is held an extremely ancient copy of the Scriptures (i.e. Codex Vaticanus). He sent two extracts from this manuscript containing 1 John 4:1-3 and 1 John 5:7-11 (it did not include Comma).|$|E
5000|$|Jerome, however, in the <b>Vulgate's</b> prologues {{describes}} some {{portions of}} books in the Septuagint {{not found in the}} Hebrew Bible as being non-canonical (he called them apocrypha); for Baruch, he mentions by name in his Prologue to Jeremiah and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or [...] "not in the canon". The Synod of Hippo (in 393), followed by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419), may be the first council that explicitly accepted the first canon which includes the books that did not appear in the Hebrew Bible; the councils were under significant influence of Augustine of Hippo, who regarded the canon as already closed.|$|R
5000|$|The name Jehovah {{appeared}} in all early Protestant Bibles in English, except Coverdale's translation in 1535. The Roman Catholic Douay-Rheims Bible used [...] "the Lord", {{corresponding to the}} Latin <b>Vulgate's</b> use of [...] "Dominus" [...] (Latin for [...] "Adonai", [...] "Lord") to represent the Tetragrammaton. The Authorized King James Version, which used [...] "" [...] in a few places, most frequently gave [...] "the [...] " [...] as {{the equivalent of the}} Tetragrammaton. The name Jehovah {{appeared in}} John Rogers' Matthew Bible in 1537, the Great Bible of 1539, the Geneva Bible of 1560, Bishop's Bible of 1568 and the King James Version of 1611. More recently, it has been used in the Revised Version of 1885, the American Standard Version in 1901, and the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures of Jehovah's Witnesses in 1961.|$|R
2500|$|The precise {{meaning of}} the Hebrew , usually {{translated}} as [...] "witch" [...] or [...] "sorceress", is uncertain. In the Septuagint, it was translated as pharmakeía or pharmakous. In the 16th century, Reginald Scot, a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated , φαρμακεία, and the <b>Vulgate's</b> Latin equivalent veneficos as all meaning [...] "poisoner", and on this basis, claimed that [...] "witch" [...] was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended. His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in [...] is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of [...] include [...] "mutterer" [...] (from a single root) or herb user (as a compound word formed from the roots kash, meaning [...] "herb", and hapaleh, meaning [...] "using"). The Greek φαρμακεία literally means [...] "herbalist" [...] or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with mageia and goeteia as a term for a sorcerer.|$|R
5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the <b>Vulgate,</b> were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the <b>Vulgate</b> text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables {{in such a way as}} to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{became known}} to Western scholars {{as a result}} of correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library. Portions of the codex were collated by several scholars, but numerous errors were made during this process. The Codex's relationship to the Latin <b>Vulgate</b> was unclear and scholars were initially unaware of the Codex's value. This changed in the 19th century when transcriptions of the full codex were completed. It was at that point that scholars realised the text differed significantly from the Textus Receptus.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} edition, {{published}} in 1539, Calvin dropped this format {{in favour of}} systematically presenting the main doctrines from the Bible. In the process, the book was enlarged from six chapters to seventeen. He concurrently worked on another book, the Commentary on Romans, {{which was published in}} March 1540. The book was a model for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin <b>Vulgate,</b> an exegesis, and an exposition. In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised the work of his predecessors Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger, and Martin Bucer, but he also took care to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings.|$|E
5000|$|A {{carbuncle}} [...] is any red gemstone, {{most often}} a red garnet. The word occurs in four places in many English translations of the Bible. The English translation is a {{rendering of the}} <b>Vulgate's</b> Latin carbunculus, a word used for a small coal (or charcoal), and also for any {{of a number of}} precious or semi-precious stones, especially those of a red color. Jerome apparently chose the term because of its similarity in meaning to the Septuagint's ἄνθραξ (anthrax meaning coal), which was in turn used by the Greek to translate the Hebrew נֹפֶךְ (nōphek) in two of its four occurrences in the Old Testament. The etymology of the Hebrew term is uncertain, though Koehler-Baumgartner suggests a connection to פּוּךְ (phook), used in the Old Testament as a term for eye makup, and probably implying a colored powder most likely made from a crushed mineral. For נֹפֶךְ (nōphek) itself they suggest the gloss [...] "semi-precious stone" [...] (of uncertain color).|$|R
5000|$|Jerome in the <b>Vulgate's</b> prologues {{describes}} a canon which excludes the deuterocanonical books, possibly excepting Baruch. In his Prologues, Jerome mentions {{all of the}} deuterocanonical and apocryphal works by name as being apocryphal or [...] "not in the canon" [...] except for Prayer of Manasses and Baruch. He mentions Baruch by name in his Prologue to Jeremiah and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or [...] "not in the canon". The inferior status to which the deuterocanonical books were relegated by authorities like Jerome is seen by some as being due to a rigid conception of canonicity, one demanding that a book, {{to be entitled to}} this supreme dignity, must be received by all, must have the sanction of Jewish antiquity, and must moreover be adapted not only to edification, but also to the [...] "confirmation of the doctrine of the Church".|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his third edition, Erasmus had seen the Complutensian Polyglot, and used its text for improvement of his own text. In the Book of Revelation he altered his fourth edition (1527) in about 90 passages {{on the basis of the}} Complutensian text. Unfortunately Erasmus had forgotten what places of the Apocalypse he translated from Latin and he did not correct all of them. Except in the Revelation, the fourth edition differed only in about 20 places from his third (according to Mill about 10 places). The fourth edition was printed in three parallel columns, they contain the Greek, Erasmus' own Latin version, and the <b>Vulgate.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Church of the Nativity {{is one of}} Bethlehem's major {{tourist attractions}} and a magnet for Christian pilgrims.

Nearby is the Milk Grotto where the Holy Family took refuge on their Flight to Egypt and next door is the cave where St. Jerome spent thirty years creating the <b>Vulgate,</b> the dominant Latin version of the Bible until the Reformation.|$|E
5|$|The Ormulum {{consists}} of 18,956 lines of metrical verse, explaining Christian teaching {{on each of}} the texts used in the mass throughout the church calendar (Treharne 2000, p.273). As such, it is the first new homily cycle in English since the works of Ælfric of Eynsham (c. 990). The motivation was to provide an accessible English text {{for the benefit of the}} less educated, which might include some clergy who found it difficult to understand the Latin of the <b>Vulgate,</b> and the parishioners who in most cases would not understand spoken Latin at all (Treharne 2000, p.273).|$|E
5000|$|The {{thought was}} then {{utilized}} in Christianity, whose {{strong emphasis on}} divine judgment, Heaven, Hell, and the Salvation of the soul brought death {{to the forefront of}} consciousness. Many memento mori works are products of Christian art, although there are equivalents in Buddhist art. In the Christian context, the memento mori acquires a moralizing purpose quite opposed to the Nunc est bibendum (now is the time to drink) theme of Classical antiquity. To the Christian, the prospect of death serves to emphasize the emptiness and fleetingness of earthly pleasures, luxuries, and achievements, and thus also as an invitation to focus one's thoughts on the prospect of the afterlife. A Biblical injunction often associated with the memento mori in this context is In omnibus operibus tuis memorare novissima tua, et in aeternum non peccabis (the <b>Vulgate's</b> Latin rendering of Ecclesiasticus , [...] "in all thy works be mindful of thy last end and thou wilt never sin.") This finds ritual expression in the rites of Ash Wednesday, when ashes are placed upon the worshipers' heads with the words, [...] "Remember Man that you are dust and unto dust you shall return." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing the categorisations {{which have}} helped to build the field of {{disability}} in France, this article analyses the meanings of disability and how they shifted over the 20 th century. Our aim is to identify, from a holistic perspective, both {{the conditions under which}} they were produced and the major paradigms in which they were rooted. The initial category thus originates in the moral division of poverty which was part of mediaeval Christianity and which, in the 14 th century, put forward inaptitude for work as a legitimate reason for assistance. At the end of the 19 th century and the start of the 20 th century, solidarism and the principle of social debt opened the way for redress for the damage caused by society: financial redress to begin with, then redress in the sense of “rehabilitation” {{within the context of a}} war economy. Breaking down the boundaries of inaptitude, these new procedures made a distinction between people disabled through war or accidents at work – which came under the heading of collective responsibility – and disabled civilians. Within their groups, the latter therefore produced and distributed a new meaning: disability “as an épreuve of the self”, a category of experience which was to find support from various <b>vulgates</b> of human and social sciences. However, the result was different acceptances of the meaning of épreuve; although these had in common the fact that they focused attention on the person, they were accompanied by distinct modalities for the social treatment of disability. The vicissitudes of meanings of disability “as an épreuve” illustrate the movement of reflexivity and subjectivity which drive our late modernity and its effects on current social policies and practices...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the next}} 15 years, until he died, Jerome {{produced}} {{a number of}} commentaries on Scripture, often explaining his translation choices in using the original Hebrew rather than suspect translations. His patristic commentaries align closely with Jewish tradition, and he indulges in allegorical and mystical subtleties after the manner of Philo and the Alexandrian school. Unlike his contemporaries, he emphasizes {{the difference between the}} Hebrew Bible [...] "apocrypha" [...] and the Hebraica veritas of the protocanonical books. In his <b>Vulgate's</b> prologues, he describes some portions of books in the Septuagint that were not found in the Hebrew as being non-canonical (he called them apocrypha); for Baruch, he mentions by name in his Prologue to Jeremiah and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or [...] "not in the canon". His Preface to The Books of Samuel and Kings includes the following statement, commonly called the Helmeted Preface:This preface to the Scriptures may serve as a “helmeted” introduction to all the books which we turn from Hebrew into Latin, so that we may be assured that what is not found in our list must be placed amongst the Apocryphal writings. Wisdom, therefore, which generally bears the name of Solomon, and the book of Jesus, the Son of Sirach, and Judith, and Tobias, and the Shepherd are not in the canon. The first book of Maccabees I have found to be Hebrew, the second is Greek, as can be proved from the very style.Although Jerome was once suspicious of the apocrypha, it is said that he later viewed them as Scripture. For example, in Jerome's letter to Eustochium he quotes Sirach 13:2., elsewhere Jerome also refers to Baruch, the Story of Susannah and Wisdom as scripture.|$|R
