[...] It is produced by the chlorination of <b>vinyltoluene.</b> Often <b>vinyltoluene</b> consists of a mixture of 3- and 4-vinyl isomers, in which case the vinylbenzyl chloride will also be produced as a mixture of isomers.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this was}} {{research}} effort was to test the ability of two poly <b>vinyltoluene</b> research samples to produce recordable, distinguishable signals in response to gamma rays and neutrons. Pulse shape discrimination was performed to identify if the signal was generated by a gamma ray or a neutron. A standard figure of merit for pulse shape discrimination was used to quantify the gamma-neutron pulse separation. Measurements were made with gamma and neutron sources with and without shielding. The best figure of merit obtained was 1. 77; this figure of merit was achieved with the first sample {{in response to an}} un-moderated 252 Cf source shielded with 5. 08 cm of lead...|$|E
40|$|This work {{studies the}} liquid phase {{separation}} of styrene and ethylbenzene on the metal-organic framework [Cu- 3 (BTC) (2) ] (BTC = 1, 3, 5 -benzenetricarboxylate) {{as well as}} the analogous separation of <b>vinyltoluenes</b> from ethyltoluenes. Batch and column experiments have been performed to demonstrate the capacity of the material to separate styrene and ethylbenzene. Adsorption capacities of around 20 wt % are measured, while separation factors reach values as high as 5. 5. As is demonstrated by UV-vis absorption measurements, the adsorption mechanism is based on specific interactions between the free Cu 2 + ligation sites of the framework and the pi-electrons of the aromatic compounds. For the separation of the <b>vinyltoluenes</b> and ethyltoluenes, similar capacities and separation factors have been obtained as for the separation of styrene and ethylbenzene, which suggests an analogous adsorption mechanism. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Metal-organic {{frameworks}} are a {{class of}} microporous materials with exceptionally high pore volumes. Their composition of metal ions and organic linkers creates a chemically diverse environment allowing various potential interactions with adsorbing molecules. Much research has been performed on this class of materials concerning catalysis and gas phase adsorption. The storage of hydrogen gas in metal-organic frameworks {{is one of the}} key research topics concerning MOFs. Recently, liquid phase adsorption and separation on MOFs gained interest, although not many data are available yet. This thesis will focus on various separation and purification problems. The separation of a steam crackerÂ’s C 5 -cut will be discussed first using a combination of MOFs and zeolites. MIL- 96, an Al-trimesate, is able to separate di-olefins from the other fractions due to sterical and possibly entropical reasons, while [Cu 3 (BTC) 2] can separate olefins from paraffins based on interactions of the olefinic bond with metal sites present in the host material. Using a high silica chabasite zeolite, the separation of linear and branched C 5 -isomers can be attained due to shape selectivity. A second major separation studied is the separation of ethylbenzene vs styrene and of <b>vinyltoluenes</b> from the corresponding ethyltoluenes. MIL- 47, MIL- 53 and [Cu 3 (BTC) 2] have been studied and all three materials have similar uptake capacitites and separation factors, but the adsorption in all three materials is based on a different mechanism. The adsorption is entropy driven on MIL- 47, while it is enthalpy driven on the analogous structure of MIL- 53. On [Cu 3 (BTC) 2], the interaction with the free metal sites as well as the number of p-electrons in the adsorbate seem to be playing an important role. Apart from separations, purification is another important application of liquid phase adsorption. The removal of phenolic compounds from wastewater is an example of this and it is shown that a water stable MOF like MIL- 53 (Cr) can perform this purification. Due to its organic composition, MIL- 53 (Cr) is capable of interacting with phenolic compounds and as water is coadsorbed, the regeneration of this material is more straightforward than with classical activated carbon. Finally, the removal of heterocyclic aromatic contaminants from fuel feeds is discussed for a variety of MOFs. It turns out that the Lewis acidity of the free metal sites of a MOF is of crucial importance to adsorb either both sulfur and nitrogen containing contaminants or only nitrogen containing contaminants, underlining the enormous potential that MOFs have for adsorptive applications. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Theses. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Through {{the use of a}} sec-butyllithium. N,N,N',N'- tetramethylethylene-diamine chelate complex it was possible to anionically graft a conventional unvulcanised rubber, SBR (solprene 1204), with vinyl aromatic monomers such as styrene, o(-methylstyrene and <b>vinyltoluene.</b> By choosing suitable solvents and reaction conditions high yields were obtained. Grafting efficiencies, determined from the amounts of homopolymer present in the gel permeation. chromatograms of the products, were found in the 60 to 100 & range. Grafting efficiencies for the o(-methylstyrene only systems were generally found {{at the lower end of}} this range whereas the grafting efficiencies for the other JBR graft copolymers were usually greater than 80...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} thesis is focused on bulk radical polymerization of styrene, methylmethacrylate, <b>vinyltoluene</b> and paramethylstyrene. It summarizes actual informations about kinetics and performance possibilities of bulk polymerization. Experimental part deals with polystyrene prepolymers preparation by bulk polymerization. The aim is to find optimal conditions for prepolymers preparation. Prepolymers should be usable for subsequent polymerization nearly up to 100 % conversion. Conversion values were gravimetrically determined and molecular weights were obtained by viskosity measurements, which were realized by Ubbelohde viscometer. In the experimental part, there were performed simulations targeted on conversion dependence on time. The purpose was a prediction of monomer conversion {{at a given time}} during polymerization. Differences between reality and simulation were low in most of cases and the found form of kinetic behavior calculations provides satisfying results. In the conclusion of this thesis was suggested a new procedure for polystyrene prepolymers preparation...|$|E
40|$|The {{resolution}} of continuous flow electrophoresis systems is generally {{measured by the}} spread of the sample bands {{in the direction of the}} electrophoretic migration. This paper evaluates the cross section of the sample bands in the plane perpendicular to the flow and shows that the spread in the direction perpendicular to the migration increased significantly with the applied electric field. Concentrated samples of monodisperse latex particles and <b>vinyltoluene</b> T-butylstyrene particles in sample buffers of different electrical conductivities were used to map the shape of the sample bands relative to the zero electric field case. As the electric field was applied, the sample band spread from an initial diameter of only one-third the chamber thickness until it approached the chamber walls where electroosmosis significantly reduced the {{resolution of}} separation. It can be shown, however, that it is possible to minimize these distortions by careful sample preparation and experiment design...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{routes to}} {{polymers}} possessing functional groups were studied. Direct functionalisation of poly(vinyltoluene) by lithiation and carboxylation {{resulted in the}} expected carboxylic acid but reaction was complicated by {{the production of a}} mixture of products. Reaction occurred both at the polymer backbone and at the pendant methyl group. Reaction with ethyl formate was also difficult to control and a secondary alcohol was formed even when an excess of the carbonyl compounds was employed. Grignard formation of poly(bromostyrene) was successful but once formed, the derivative rearranged resulting in chain scission and degradation of the polymer. Therefore subsequent reactions of the Grignard reagent with carbonyl groups were unsuccessful in producing functionalised polymers. Reactions of <b>vinyltoluene</b> monomer were more successful. Although complications arose when lithiation and carboxylation of the monomer were carried out using lithium diisopropylamide because the carboxylic acid product reacted with the excess lithium diisopropylamide present, metallation by potassium t-butoxide followed by reaction with 2 -(3 -chloropropyl) - 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxalane resulted in the formation of 2 -methyl- 2 (4 -(vinylphenyl) -butyl- 1, 3,-dioxalane. The butyllithium initiated anionic polymerisation of this protected monomer resulted in a polymer which had a very narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn= 1. 05) and subsequent hydrolysis of the polymer resulted in poly(6 (vinylphenyl) -hexan- 2 -one) which was derivatised with 2, 4 dinitrophenyl-hydrazine. Functionalisation by modification of the siloxane derivative 3 -(methylpropenoxycarbonyl) ltrimethoxysilane was unsuccessful. The acid catalysed exchange reactions of this monomer with alcohols such as eugenol, octan- 1 -ol, pentan- 1 -ol, and hexan- 1 -ol were inefficient, resulting in a mixture of products and unreacted starting materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of particles}} and concurrent steady-state flow of a dilute suspension from an infinite reservoir over the mucous surface of intestinal strips were quantitatively studied. The micronsize particle systems included negatively charged poly (<b>vinyltoluene)</b> and hydroxylated Dynosphere(R) particles {{with and without}} a positively charged polybrene polymer coated layer. The suspensoids were characterized by zeta potential measurements. An in vitro setup and technique likened to a thin falling liquid film system was developed wherein an excised intestinal segment cut lengthwise is spread on a plastic flute and positioned at an incline, and a suspension is allowed to flow down the intestinal strip. The falling liquid film {{was estimated to be}} 54 [mu]m in thickness from nonsteady-state flow kinetic experiments. Particle concentrations entering the segment from the dilute suspension reservoir and leaving the intestinal segment were determined with the Coulter counter to quantify the steady-state fraction of particles adsorbed as they relate to intestinal length, flow rate, ionic strength, zeta potential and particle concentration. The flowing liquid film technique was found to be quantitatively sensitive and, consequently, allowed one to focus on the mechanism of the approach of micron-size particles to the mucous surface without the major concern of particle flocculation in the bulk liquid. The logarithm of the fraction of nonadsorbed particles remaining in the liquid film decreased linearly with intestinal length at all flow rates employed. The fraction adsorbed decreased with increasing flow rates on account of the shorter transit times. The steady-state region of the fraction of nonadsorbed particles remaining versus time plots persisted for a relatively long time indicating the existence of a particle concentration gradient {{along the length of the}} intestinal strip. The fact that the fraction of particles adsorbed was not affected by particle concentrations ranging from 4. 5 - 14 x 106 particles per ml suggests that there is sufficiently available unoccupied surface area for incoming particles to be adsorbed onto mucus. It has been estimated that no more than 5 % of the area of the intestinal strip is occupied by adsorbed particles. Failure to desorb particles from the mucous surface by perfusing the intestinal segment indicates tight binding between the particles and mucus. A physical model was deduced from the experimental results wherein the steady-state fraction of adsorbed particles is related to length of the intestinal strip, flow rate and mass transfer-adsorption coefficient. The mass transfer resistances of negatively charged particles decreased with the addition of sodium chloride and approached the minimum resistance obtained by the positively charged, polybrenecoated latex particles, whose mass transfer resistance was independent of electrolyte concentration. This supports a mechanism involving the diffusion of the negatively charged particles within an electrostatic field of force as the particles approach the negatively charged mucous surface. Passage of particles over the potential energy barrier is required for the successful collision and tight binding with mucus...|$|E
