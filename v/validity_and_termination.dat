40|$|Fault-tolerant {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} issues in Web service reliability. Current researches focus on achieving fault-tolerant Web service through extending Web service related standards. Because these standards are evolving and have some compatibility problems, approaches used in existing works cannot provide a practical way to implement a fault-tolerant mechanism for Web service. This paper presents a mobile agent-based fault-tolerant model, called MAFTM, for composite Web service at the system level. Since mobile agent-based workflow is suitable for distributed Web service composition, the authors use mobile agents to provide fault-tolerant capability for composite Web service. The MAFTM model concentrates on crash failures and communication link failures. Based on their previous work of the totally ordered multicast for mobile agents, the authors design a replication mechanism that introduces a group of replicated mobile agents to maintain a group of replicated instances for one composite Web service. To assure exactly once semantics in the execution of replicated instances, the authors propose a consensus algorithm. This algorithm can be used to guarantee that, in each step of the composite Web service, all replicated mobile agents agree on only one committed atomic Web service. Also, they prove properties of the MAFTM model including agreement, <b>validity,</b> integration <b>and</b> <b>termination.</b> Department of Computin...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} lecture, {{we talked about}} {{consensus}} and gave three conditions that all the executions (possibly partial) of an algorithm, which tries to solve the consensus problem, need to satisfy: <b>validity,</b> agreement, <b>and</b> <b>termination.</b> We {{also said that the}} first two conditions are called safety conditions and the last one is liveness condition. While implementing quorum systems,as expected, we will focus only on the safety (consistency) conditions, as quorum systems are designed in a way to achieve consistency in a system. But before that we need to address a problem. 1. 1 Eventual leader failure detector To achieve termination successfully, we need failure detectors. But we don’t know of any failure detectors because of the FLP impossibility results [Fischer et al., 1985], which states that no consensus is possible in an asynchronous system even under a single crash failure. So we need to relax the timing conditions to overcome the impossibility results in order to achieve termination (liveness) in consensus. This forces us to work on the weak faulty system instead. There are many theoretical results that talk about theorems like, “If we have a failure detector, then [...] . ”, where the detectors are used as black-box or oracle (fo...|$|R

The results of the analysis indicate that block rotations can have a profound influence on the interpretation of geodetic measurments and the inversion of geodetic data.
