Methods: ICa,L was recorded in single myocytes isolated from undiseased human hearts using the whole cell voltage clamp technique.

We elucidate its mechanism in an electrophysiological approach by comparing voltage-clamp and current-clamp recordings of individual neurons on an insulated planar electrode. Noninvasive stimulation of neurons from pedal ganglia of Lymnaea stagnalis is achieved by defined <b>voltage</b> <b>ramps</b> applied to an electrolyte/HfO 2 /silicon capacitor. Effects on the smaller attached cell membrane and the larger free membrane are distinguished in a two-domain-stimulation model. Under current-clamp, we study the polarization that is induced for closed ion channels. Under voltage-clamp, we determine the capacitive gating of ion channels in the attached membrane by falling <b>voltage</b> <b>ramps</b> and for comparison also the gating of all channels by conventional variation of the intracellular voltage. Neuronal excitation is elicited under current-clamp by two mechanisms: Rising <b>voltage</b> <b>ramps</b> depolarize the free membrane such that an action potential is triggered. Falling <b>voltage</b> <b>ramps</b> depolarize the attached membrane such that local ion currents are activated that depolarize the free membrane and trigger an action potential.

Device parameters, such as the channel length, effective electron mobility, substrate doping level and the gate <b>voltage</b> <b>ramping</b> rate were changed to see their effects on the substrate response.

40|$|The {{polarization}} entanglement photon pairs {{generated from}} the biexciton cascade decay in a single semiconductor quantum dot is corrupted by the position-dependent (time-dependent) phase difference of the two polarization mode due to the fine structure splitting. We show that, by taking <b>voltage</b> <b>ramping</b> to an electro-optic modulator, such phase-difference can be removed. In our first proposed set-up, two photons are sent to two separate Pockels cell under reverse <b>voltage</b> <b>ramping,</b> as a result, the position-dependent phase {{difference between the two}} polarization mode is removed in the outcome state. In our second proposed set-up, the polarization of the first photon is flipped and then both photons fly into the same Pokels cell. Since we only need to separate the two photons rather than separate the two polarization modes, our schemes are robust with respect to fluctuations of the optical paths.
