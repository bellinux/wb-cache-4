5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} microbiological laboratory testing. This {{can be done by}} virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, <b>viral</b> <b>antigen</b> detection (such as for NS1) or specific antibodies (serology). Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be negative {{in the early stages of}} the disease. PCR and <b>viral</b> <b>antigen</b> detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|To be able {{to perform}} a proper {{diagnosis}} of this pathogen is it important to take samples from the suspected infected individuals such as a stool, throat, or nasopharyngeal sample. There are various tests that can be done on these samples to see if a person is infected. <b>Viral</b> <b>antigen</b> can be detected by performing an assay. A serological assay can also be performed on the sample to look for virus-specific antibodies present in the sample, thus showing that the person is trying to combat the virus. The virus can be isolated in culture through the use of mouse-L fibroblasts, green monkey kidney cells, as well as HeLa cells.|$|E
25|$|HSV evades {{the immune}} system through {{interference}} with MHC class I antigen presentation on the cell surface, by blocking TAP or the transporter associated with antigen processing induced by the secretion of ICP-47 by HSV. In the host cell, TAP transports digested <b>viral</b> <b>antigen</b> epitope peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing these epitopes to be combined with MHC class I molecules and presented {{on the surface of}} the cell. Viral epitope presentation with MHC class I is a requirement for activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), the major effectors of the cell-mediated immune response against virally-infected cells. ICP-47 prevents initiation of a CTL-response against HSV, allowing the virus to survive for a protracted period in the host.|$|E
40|$|Organ {{distribution}} and intracellular localization of <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> in C 58 mouse leukemias were investigated in detail by the immunofluorescent complement fixation method. During successive transmission of C 58 mouse lymphocytic leukemia by cell-free filtrates myelocytic leukemia developed. Whether this myelocytic leukemia {{was caused by}} the same or different virus was investigated by the above immunofluorescent procedure. 1. More distinct and increased particle fluorescence which indicated the presence of leukemia <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> were detected by the immunofluorescent complement fixation method than by the direct method. 2. The <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> in the leukemic cells were localized in 4 different types; perinuclear arrangement, intracytoplasmic scattering, arrangement near the cytoplasmic membrane and extracellular localization. There was no observable difference in localization of <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> between the lymphocytic and myelocytic leukemias. 3. Of organ distribution, more <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> were observed in the bone marrow and lymph nodes and a few in the spleen and liver in the lymphocytic leukemia. Less <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> were observed in the bone marrow and lymph nodes in the myelocytic leukemia. There were no <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> in the organs of the non-leukemic C 58 mouse. Cross-immune reactions using antiviral antisera of the lymphocytic and myelocytic leukemias showed that the two viruses closely resembled but were not identical. These findings were indicative of the presence of the two types of viruses in the C 58 mouse leukemias...|$|R

Variations in the cellular site (cytoplasm, cell membrane, and nucleus), the distribution (particulate or homogeneous), and the quantity (little or much) of Rous <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> were seen. The per cent of sarcoma cells containing <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> was related to the tumor initiating dose of virus and to the infectivity titer of virus extracted from the wing tumor. With certain assumptions it was estimated that a quantity of virus approaching one tumor-producing dose (1 TD 50) per tissue section was detectable with fluorescent antibody. Sarcoma cells containing <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> were identified as early as 4 days after inoculation of Rous virus. At this time <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> were also localized in the skeletal muscle of the inoculated wing in a characteristic focal pattern of deposition near or on the sarcolemma. This association between <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> and skeletal muscle fibers was observed also at 3 days after virus inoculation, when sarcoma cells were not yet demonstrable in the tissue sections. <b>Viral</b> <b>antigens</b> were detected in sarcoma cells in lung tumors of young chickens and in tumors of the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> was determined in lungs, spleen and bronchial lymph nodes of a non-lethal primary Sendai virus infection of mice. Immunofluorescent staining showed that virus was initially {{confined to the}} bronchial mucosal columnar cells. Most antigen was present in this location between the 3 rd and 5 th days a finding which correlated well with infectivity assays. From the 3 rd day desquamated mucosal cells in the bronchial lumen showed relatively weak staining for <b>viral</b> <b>antigens.</b> Alveolar macrophages were shown to contain <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> only after mucosal shedding had occurred. <b>Viral</b> <b>antigens</b> were found in bronchial lymph nodes between the 3 rd to 9 th days, and in the spleen from the 3 rd day to 49 th day after infection.

40|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>antigens</b> {{were fixed}} {{to the surface of}} microtiter wells, and serial dilutions of {{antiviral}} antibody were added. The amount of antiviral antibody bound to <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> was determined by measuring {{the extent to which the}} antiviral antibody either inhibited the specific binding of 125 I-labeled antiviral immunoglobulin G (IgG) (direct technique) or enhanced the specific binding of 125 I-labeled anti-IgG (indirect technique). Immune complexes composed of <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> and antiviral antibody (human) could be detected by the binding of 125 I-labeled rheumatoid factor. Specific binding was influenced by the concentration of protein in the diluents used during the different steps of the procedure. A high concentration of protein in the diluent used with the <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> decreased specific binding, whereas a high concentration of protein in the diluent used with 125 I-labeled anti-IgG increased specific binding by decreasing nonspecific attachment of the labeled anti-IgG.

50|$|Several {{investigators}} have used IF microscopy {{to follow the}} development of PPV in cell culture. In general, {{the sequence of events}} is as follows. <b>Viral</b> <b>antigen</b> is detected in the cytoplasm of cells soon after infection if the inoculum contains a high titer of virus and <b>viral</b> <b>antigen.</b> Most, if not all, of this early cytoplasmic fluorescence is the result of antigen phagocytized from the inoculum. By sequential examinations, such antigen can be demonstrated first on the external surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and later within the cytoplasm, often relatively concentrated in a juxtanuclear location. The first unequivocal evidence of viral replication is the appearance of nascent <b>viral</b> <b>antigen</b> in the nucleus (Fig. 2A). In at least some infected cells, nascent antigen next appears in the cytoplasm in sufficient quantity that both cytoplasm and nucleus are brightly fluorescent. Infected cells commonly seen in the lung of fetuses that develop a high titer of antibody for PPV probably represent this stage of replication (see Fig. 8C). Affected cells subsequently round up, become pyknotic, and disintegrate with release of virus and <b>viral</b> <b>antigen</b> (Fig. 2B). Other cells in the culture that are not at the appropriate stage to support viral replication continue to phagocytize and accumulate <b>viral</b> <b>antigen</b> in their cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). A second wave of viral replication can be induced if these cells are stimulated to enter the S phase of the cell cycle as, for example, by the addition of fresh culture medium.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of transplacental infection {{has been investigated}} by using IF microscopy to identify infected cells in maternal and fetal tissues at progressively longer intervals after maternal oronasal exposure.

40|$|Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) {{produces}} a persistent {{infection of the}} nervous system in susceptible mice. To map the localization of <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> in the central nervous system (CNS), the authors studied, by means of ultrastructural immune peroxidase techniques, 4 - 6 -month-old mice persistently infected with LCMV following an intracerebral inoculation at birth. The greatest number of infected neurons was observed in the cortex, particularly of the limbic system, and certain nuclei of the hypothalamus. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells selectively expressed <b>viral</b> <b>antigens.</b> Moderate numbers of infected neurons were found in the anterior horns of the spinal cord, basal ganglia, and thalamus.

We have previously shown that PV can persistently infect some human cell lines in vitro, particularly neuroblastoma cell lines. We report here an ex vivo model in which PV can persistently infect primary cultures of human fetal brain cells. Two mutations involving capsid residues 142 of VP 2 and 95 of VP 1 were repeatedly selected during the persistent infections. These residues are located in capsid regions known to be involved in interactions between PV and its receptor. During the first week after infection, <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> were found in cells of both the neuronal and glial lineages. In contrast, 2 weeks after infection, <b>viral</b> <b>antigens</b> were detected almost exclusively in cells of the neuronal lineage.
