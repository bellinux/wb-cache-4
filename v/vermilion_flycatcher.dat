50|$|In 1839, John Gould {{created the}} current genus Pyrocephalus for the <b>vermilion</b> <b>flycatcher.</b> While it is {{considered}} a monotypic genus by some authorities, other taxonomists (including the International Ornithologists' Union), believe that up to three of the <b>vermilion</b> <b>flycatcher</b> subspecies (Darwin's, San Cristóbal, and Scarlet flycatcher) merit species status.|$|E
50|$|The San Cristóbal flycatcher was {{described}} as full species Pyrocephalus dubius in 1839 by John Gould. In 1890, Robert Ridgway suggested the new combination Pyrocephalus minimus.

A 2016 study suggests to reinstate the specific status for both Pyrocephalus dubius and the other Galápagos taxon Pyrocephalus nanus because of genetic divergence.

5000|$|During {{a survey}} in 1929 ornithologist Albert Kenrick Fisher found this bird rather {{abundant}} {{all along the}} arid western coast to the settlement of Progreso in the highlands. During the next sixty years invasive plants replaced {{a large part of}} the endemic vegetation which led to the decline of the insects which were dependent on the endemic plants. When David and Lee Steadman visited San Cristobal Island in the 1980s they described the San Cristóbal <b>vermilion</b> <b>flycatcher</b> as extremely rare. The last reliable sighting was in 1987. Finally, a six-month expedition in 1998, failed to find any birds. Reasons for the decline of the San Cristóbal <b>vermilion</b> <b>flycatcher</b> might have been the vanishing of the food insects, avian pox, and the avian malaria. After a long-term-study since 2012, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust described it as [...] "first bird extinction in Galapagos" [...] in June 2016.|$|E

5000|$|Most, but not all, {{species are}} rather plain, with various hues of brown, gray and white commonplace. Obvious {{exceptions}} include {{the bright red}} <b>vermilion</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> blue, black, white and yellow many-colored rush-tyrant and some species of tody-flycatchers or tyrants, which are often yellow, black, white and/or rufous, from the Todirostrum, Hemitriccus and Poecilotriccus genera. Several species have bright yellow underparts, from the ornate flycatcher to the great kiskadee. Some species have erectile crests. The crest is taken to the extreme in the royal flycatcher, which is plain but for a large black-spotted, red-and-blue crest which it fans out like a peafowl tail when excited. Several of the large genera (i.e. Elaenia, Myiarchus or Empidonax) are quite difficult to tell apart in the field due to similar plumage and some are best distinguished by their voices. Behaviorally they can vary from species such as spadebills which are tiny, shy and live in dense forest interiors to kingbirds, which are relatively large, bold, inquisitive and often inhabit open areas near human habitations. As the name implies, a great majority of tyrant flycatchers are entirely insectivorous (though not necessarily specialized in flies). Tyrant flycatchers are largely opportunistic feeders and often catch any flying or arboreal insect they encounter. However, food can vary greatly and some (like the large great kiskadee) will eat fruit or small vertebrates (e.g. small frogs). In North America, most species {{are associated with a}} [...] "sallying" [...] feeding style, where they fly up to catch an insect directly from their perch and then immediately return to the same perch. Most tropical species however do not feed in this fashion and several types prefer to glean insects from leaves and bark. Tropical species are sometimes found in mixed-species foraging flocks, where various types of passerines and other smallish birds are found feeding in proximity.|$|E

40|$|Industrial melanism is {{a celebrated}} {{evolutionary}} phenomenon because it demonstrates {{the efficacy of}} natural selection in response to anthropogenic environmental change. We investigated a potential instance of industrial melanism in a vertebrate, the <b>vermilion</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Pyrocephalus rubinus). The species is strikingly bright red throughout its broad range, but a sooty brown morph is abundant in the heavily polluted city of Lima, Peru. We found that plumage morph is perfectly predicted by a single nucleotide polymorphism in the MC 1 R gene. We quantified genotype and allele frequencies in seven neighborhoods of Lima. Within neighborhoods, there were fewer heterozygotes than expected, and surveys of mated pairs were consistent with assortative mating. The melanic allele frequency dropped from ~ 60 % to ~ 5 % across the urban-suburban interface, implicating strong divergent selection on plumage color. Spatial autoregressive models showed that coastal cloudiness predicted melanic allele frequency, while air pollution did not. We conclude that divergent selection and assortative mating act togethe¬r to maintain the melanic allele at one extreme of a cloudiness gradient, even with no physical barriers to gene flow. The co-occurrence of industrial pollution and the melanic morph of the <b>vermilion</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is not industrial melanism, but a coincidence of human history and natural history.

We found no distinction among the western South American subspecies piurae, ardens, obscurus and cocachacrae, or between the North American flammeus and mexicanus. We recovered two reciprocally monophyletic clades within subspecies nanus from the Galapagos. Nuclear haplotype networks revealed a high diversity of unique alleles in southern subspecies, and lower diversity in northern subspecies.
