40|$|Abstract—The ship Kelvin-wake {{models on}} {{two-dimensional}} (2 -D) linear and nonlinear sea surfaces are {{combined with the}} second-order small-slope approximation method (SSA-II) to comparatively study the corresponding electromagnetic (EM) scattering characteristics. The nonlinear sea-surface models include the Choppy Wave Model (CWM) and the second-order Creamer model (Creamer (2)). Considering the limitations of using the ideal plane EM wave incident upon a rough sea surface of the limited size, the modified tapered wave is utilized as the incident wave to derive the scattering waves. Due {{to the fact that}} the nonlinear effects of Creamer (2) surfaces is obviously stronger than those of CWM surfaces, the bistatic normalized radar cross section (NRCS) calculated from Creamer (2) surfaces is significantly greater than that of its linear and CWM surfaces for scattering angles departing from the specular direction, and the backscattering coefficients from Creamer (2) surfaces are also the greatest except within quasi-specular (near vertical incidence) region. Moreover, for the linear and nonlinear sea surfaces, the influences of different wind speeds and directions on scattering characteristics are also calculated and analyzed in detail. However, taking the ship Kelvin wakes into account, the corresponding scattering features are obviously distinct from those of the single linear and nonlinear sea surfaces. This helps to provide a basis to extract the <b>related</b> <b>ship</b> <b>information</b> through the scattering characteristics of ship Kelvin wakes. Also it shows that the small-slope approximation method is a very effective analysis method to deal with the EM scattering from the rough sea surface...|$|R

They provided {{detailed information on}} targets to British headquarters in India and China, who transmitted them to the Americans. The French operatives were reluctant to provide information on French or Vietnamese targets, and their most important contribution was <b>relating</b> <b>ship</b> movements along the coast. American carrier aircraft sank twenty-four vessels and damaged another thirteen in January 1945. An OSS report of 19 March 1945 contains eight pages of <b>shipping</b> <b>information</b> from one anonymous French official who had contacts from Saigon {{in the south to}} Qui Nhon in the north.

Data and information from the global positioning system (GPS), digital compass (DC), automatic identification system (AIS) and electronic navigational charts (ENC) were utilized to display map, map data, directional, location and <b>ship</b> <b>related</b> <b>information.</b> The data and other information display orientation remains in legible horizontal manner even if the base map is moving or transforming while several utilities such as serial device connection configuration and data retrieval was written for technical and testing purposes. This work was done to come-up with a template for developing a marine vehicle system that {{will serve as a}} reference or basis for future system developmental works. The modular and compartmentalized design of the system makes it very easy to customize for further specific development such as a Marine Vehicle Monitoring System or Marine Navigation System...|$|R

The first one is pointed to importance of effective legislation in the Czech Republic and the European Union, which is dedicated to shipping the dangerous articles by road transport. Also it regards to risks of accidents and possible ecologic impacts to an environment. This part compares the amount of traffic accidents in the Czech Republic and states of the EU in a frame of ADR. It shows the risks <b>related</b> to <b>shipping</b> the dangerous articles by road transport. The closing part belongs to important elements of safe transportation of dangerous matters. The second part of the thesis analyses current state of <b>shipping</b> <b>information</b> systems in the Czech Republic and in the European Union. There is the analysis, the suggestions for improvement of the systems´ efficiency and its application in the Czech Republic.

40|$|Part 5 : Witness WorkshopInternational audienceThis paper {{reports on}} the use of key design {{properties}} for development of a new approach towards a solution for sharing <b>shipping</b> <b>information</b> in the supply chain for international trade. Information exchange in international supply chain is extremely inefficient, rather uncoordinated, based largely on paper, e-mail, phone and text message, and far too costly. This paper explores the design properties for a shared information infrastructure to exchange information between all parties in the supply chain, commercial parties as well as authorities, which is called a <b>Shipping</b> <b>Information</b> Pipeline. The contribution of the paper is to expand previous research with complementary key design properties. The paper starts with a review of existing literature on previous proposed solutions for increased collaboration in the supply chain for international trade, Inter-Organization Systems and Information Infrastructures. The paper argues why the previous attempts are inadequate to address the issues in the domain of international supply chains. Instead, a different set of key design properties are proposed for the <b>Shipping</b> <b>Information</b> Pipeline. The solution has been developed in collaboration with a network of representatives for major stakeholders in international trade, whom evaluate it positively and are willing to invest, develop and test the prototype of the <b>Shipping</b> <b>Information</b> Pipeline...|$|R
