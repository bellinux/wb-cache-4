5|$|Ants {{are active}} {{all year long}} in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter {{in a state of}} {{dormancy}} known as hibernation. The forms of inactivity are <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.|$|E

The {{quality of the}} ore also <b>varied,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was not always}} profitable to smelt, as several furnaces built near iron ore mines in the Marcellus were abandoned before the ore and timber resources used to fuel them became scarce.|$|E
5|$|The {{side effects}} of {{amphetamine}} are <b>varied,</b> <b>and</b> the amount of amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have {{a greater risk of}} serious side effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.|$|E
5|$|US Navy {{decompression}} tables {{have gone}} {{through a lot of}} development over the years. They have mostly been based on parallel multi-compartment exponential models.

Upon release, the album received generally mixed reviews from music critics and suffered dismal sales {{partly due to the}} poor distribution and support by Bong Load.

However, its diet can {{be far more}} <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th {{century the}} kings {{continued}} to build vesara or Deccan-style monuments but later incorporated Dravida-style gopuras {{to meet their}} ritualistic needs. The Prasanna Virupaksha temple (underground temple) of Bukka and the Hazare Rama temple of Deva Raya are examples of Deccan architecture. The <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> intricate ornamentation of the pillars is a mark of their work. At Hampi, though the Vitthala temple is {{the best example of}} their pillared Kalyanamantapa style, the Hazara Ramaswamy temple is a modest but perfectly finished example. A visible aspect of their style is their return to the simplistic and serene art developed by the Chalukya dynasty. A grand specimen of Vijayanagara art, the Vitthala temple, took several decades to complete during the reign of the Tuluva kings.|$|E
5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E

5|$|Rodin {{began the}} project in 1884, {{inspired}} by the chronicles of the siege by Jean Froissart. Though the town envisioned an allegorical, heroic piece centered on Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the eldest of the six men, Rodin conceived the sculpture as {{a study in the}} <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> complex emotions under which all six men were laboring. One year into the commission, the Calais committee was not impressed with Rodin's progress. Rodin indicated his willingness to end the project rather than change his design to meet the committee's conservative expectations, but Calais said to continue.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at {{between three and}} four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester.

This parrot's diet is <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} received mixed reviews. Prell {{thought that}} the mission-design was <b>varied,</b> <b>and</b> the voting system kept the mode from being repetitive. He also praised the interconnected structure between the single-player and multiplayer, noting that the items that could be carried over from multiplayer to campaign made the mode feel rewarding for players. Reiner {{thought that the}} action featured in this mode is satisfying, but thought that the system lacked enough depth and complexity to engage players. Patterson echoed similar thoughts, and felt that the ability of players to switch between the campaign and the Chaos Squad mode made the multiplayer mode a rewarding experience. Brown criticized the mode, saying that its difficulty was not properly scaled.|$|E
