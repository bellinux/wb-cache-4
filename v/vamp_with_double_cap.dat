30|$|Twenty (20) {{groundwater}} samples {{each have}} been collected from bore wells for two different periods, post-monsoon in November 2014 and pre-monsoon in May 2015 (Fig.  1). Each sample was collected in acid-washed polyethylene 500  mL bottle. Before collection of water in a particular bottle, the bottle is rinsed thoroughly with the respective samples of the groundwater. Sample location is written on the bottle and suitable preservatives were added for storage till completion of quantitative chemical analysis. The bottle was filled {{to the brim with}} water taking care that no air bubble was trapped within the water sample. To prevent evaporation, the bottles were sealed <b>with</b> <b>double</b> plastic <b>caps</b> and precaution was also taken to avoid sample agitation during transfer to the laboratory. Immediately after collection, samples were transferred to the laboratory.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{strategy to}} facilitate correction of single-base mutations of episomal targets in mammalian cells has been developed. The method utilizes a chimeric oligonucleotide {{composed of a}} contiguous stretch of RNA and DNA residues in a duplex conformation <b>with</b> <b>double</b> hairpin <b>caps</b> on the ends. The RNA/DNA sequence is designed to align with the sequence of the mutant locus and to contain the desired nucleotide change. Activity of the chimeric molecule in targeted correction was tested in a model {{system in which the}} aim was to correct a point mutation in the gene encoding the human liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase. When the chimeric molecule was introduced into cells containing the mutant gene on an extrachromosomal plasmid, correction of the point mutation was accomplished with a frequency approaching 30 %. These results extend the usefulness of the oligonucleotide-based gene targeting approaches by increasing specific targeting frequency. This strategy should enable the design of antiviral agents...|$|R

40|$|Editor: IOP, ISSN 0268 - 1242 International audienceInAs/InGaAsP/InP(113) B quantum-dots are {{studied as}} active mediums for laser {{structures}} emitting near 1. 55 µm under optical and electrical injection. In order to precisely tune the emission wavelength of QDs, the <b>double</b> <b>cap</b> growth procedure is used. Laser emission {{on the ground}} states is obtained under optical pumping at room temperature. On equivalent structures doped for electrical injection, laser emission is also observed at low temperatures up to 200 K. The difference between the optical and electrical pumping is ascribed to low carrier injection efficiency due {{to the presence of}} a 3 nm InP hole blocking barrier at each quantum dot layer which is inherent to the <b>double</b> <b>cap</b> growth procedure. Room temperature laser emission has been reached when the InP first cap layer is substituted by a quaternary GaInAsP (1. 18 µm gap) layer in the <b>double</b> <b>cap</b> growth procedure. The threshold current density of the new structure with QD capped only by quaternary is as low as 840 A cm− 2 at room temperature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} we analyze the {{minimization}} of a nonlocal isoperimetric prob-lem (NLIP) posed on the 2 -sphere. After establishing the regularity of the free boundary of minimizers, we characterize two critical points of the functional describing (NLIP) : the single <b>cap</b> and the <b>double</b> <b>cap.</b> We show that when the parameter controlling {{the influence of the}} nonlocality is small, the single cap is not only stable but also is the global minimizer of (NLIP) for all values of the mass constraint. In other words, in this param-eter regime, the global minimizer of the (NLIP) coincides with the global minimizer of the local isoperimetric problem on the 2 -sphere. Furthermore, we show that in certain parameter regimes the <b>double</b> <b>cap</b> is an unstable critical point. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFour {{different}} regioselective <b>double</b> <b>capping</b> {{reactions were}} applied either to alpha- or beta-cyclodextrin (CD) scaffolds. The first, which {{relied on the}} use of a rigid, bulky dialkylating reagent containing two trityl-like subunits, gave access to an A,B,D,E-tetra-functionalised beta-CD regioisomer in large scale reactions. Two further capping reactions, involving the dianions PhP 2 - and S 2 -, led to the synthesis of new C- 1 -symmetrical beta-cyclodextrins in which pairs of neighbouring glucose units are linked by very short spacers. The last <b>double</b> <b>capping</b> reaction described allowed the high-yield preparation of unprecedented alpha- and beta-cyclodextrins containing two sulfate handles. Proximal capping turned out to be favoured for each of the above difunctional reagents. The structural characterisation of the capped species was achieved by thorough NMR investigations as well as by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies...|$|R
40|$|Cross-sectional {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy {{was used}} to study at the atomic scale the <b>double</b> <b>capping</b> process of self-assembled InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a (311) B substrate. The thickness of the first capping layer is found to play a mayor {{role in determining the}} final results of the process. For first capping layers up to 3. 5 nm, the height of the QDs correspond to the thickness of the first capping layer. Nevertheless, for thicknesses higher than 3. 5 nm, a reduction in the dot height compared to the thickness of the first capping layer is observed. These results are interpreted in terms of a transition from a <b>double</b> <b>capping</b> to a classical capping process when the first capping layer is thick enough to completely cover the dots...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{study was to investigate}} cephalometrically the skeletal, dental, and soft tissue modifications induced by activator treatment in patients with Class II malocclusions caused by mandibular retrognathism. The subjects, all in the mixed dentition, were selected from a single centre and were divided into two groups: 40 patients treated <b>with</b> an incisor <b>double</b> <b>capping</b> activator (20 girls, 20 boys {{with a mean age of}} 10 years) and a control group of 30 subjects (15 girls, 15 boys with a mean-age of 10 years). The dentoskeletal and aesthetic changes that occurred were compared on lateral cephalograms taken before treatment (T 0) and after 18 - 24 months, when the activator was removed (T 1). In the control group the radiographs were obtained before (T 0) and after (T 1) 21 months (standard deviation +/- 3 months). Activator treatment in these growing patients resulted in a correction of the Class II relationship (ANB - 2. 14 degrees), a restriction of maxillary growth (SNA - 0. 5 degrees) an advancement of the mandibular structures (SNB + 1. 64 degrees, FH NPg + 3. 39 degrees; OLp-B + 5. 17 mm, OLp-Pg + 5. 14 mm, OLp-Go + 2. 44 mm), a correction of the overjet (- 5. 03 mm), an improvement in overbite (- 1. 17 mm) and uprighting of the maxillary incisors ((1) under bar FH - 5. 64 degrees).
