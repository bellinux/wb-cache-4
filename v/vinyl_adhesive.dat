50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s, Matsutani {{goes back}} to three {{dimensional}} works combining <b>vinyl</b> <b>adhesive</b> and graphite pencil. Patiently covering the canvas or paper with pencil strokes, the artist questions the concepts of space and time, immobility and movement. Remaining most of the time faithful to the two dimensions of canvas or paper work, he brings life to the surface, letting <b>vinyl</b> <b>adhesive</b> inflate or flow, leaving the door open to unexpected results, full of sensuality and of an unusual tactility.|$|E
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, Matsutani shifts from Nihonga to a more abstract style, experimenting with materials. <b>Vinyl</b> <b>adhesive</b> becomes his favourite tool, covering the canvas in circles or bubbles (of which some burst), created by spreading air into the material with a straw, before drying the glue with a fan or an hair-dryer. Matsutani takes part of his inspiration in the organic shapes observed through a microscope in the laboratory of a friend. Very sensuous, the works are infused with a latent eroticism.|$|E
5000|$|Vinyl {{composition}} tile (VCT) is {{a finished}} flooring material used primarily in commercial and institutional applications. Modern vinyl floor tiles and sheet flooring and versions of those products sold {{since the early}} 1980s are composed of colored polyvinyl chloride (PVC) chips formed into solid sheets of varying thicknesses (1/8" [...] is most common) by heat and pressure. Floor tiles are cut into modular shapes such 12" [...] x 12" [...] squares or 12" [...] x 24" [...] rectangles. In installation the floor tiles or sheet flooring are applied to a smooth, leveled sub-floor using a specially formulated <b>vinyl</b> <b>adhesive</b> or tile mastic that remains pliable. In commercial applications some tiles are typically waxed and buffed using special materials and equipment.|$|E

The experiments were performed as described by Sano et al. [17] and Umebayashi et al. [5, 18]. A plastic funnel was attached, with <b>vinyl</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape, to the stem of each sample tree 0.3 – 0.8  m above the ground.

After introduction of dye for 30  min, the tree was felled and disks were cut from the stem at 2 -m intervals from the base of the stem to the apex. Then, the bark was peeled from the stem and the distribution of dye in vessel elements at the surface of the stem was examined with the naked eye. The maximum ascent of dye, defined as the distance from the site of introduction of the dye to the top of the colored zone, was recorded.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{commercial}} advertisement vehicle wrap {{is thought to}} have been created for Pepsi Co in 1993, which used vinyl to wrap a bus promoting its Crystal Pepsi product. It wasn’t long before bus wrap advertising was everywhere and the new form of vehicle graphics trickled down to smaller businesses and consumers. Wrapping whole vehicles was still challenging. Majority of the difficulties came from premature adhesion and air bubbles under the vinyl. As technology improved, companies like Avery Dennison, 3M and Oracal developed the use of air-channels that made the vinyl repositionable and allowed for bubble-free installation. Air-channel, created using microscopic glass beads incorporated into the <b>vinyl’s</b> <b>adhesive,</b> prevented the <b>vinyl</b> from fully sticking to the substrates surface thereby permitting air flow between adjacent sections. In addition, these beads allow for the vinyl to be repeatedly be removed and reapplied until the beads are broken by firmly pressing the vinyl using a small hard squeegee. Once the beads are broken the vinyl will be firmly adhered to the substrates surface. Proprietary company blends of polymer in the vinyl allowed the material to conform to compound curves, recesses, and corrugations through the use of heat guns and torches.|$|R

40|$|Microfluidic is used {{to perform}} mixing, flowing and {{dispersing}} of fluid in micro volume and they are widely applied in biomedical sciences, bioengineering and food sciences. Microfabrication technique based on microelectronic technology has the capability to produce microfluidic devices in micro or nano-metric scale but this technique involves costly process and toxic chemicals. In this project, we proposed the use of patterned <b>vinyl</b> <b>adhesive</b> template to produce a microfluidic device on a work bench that was applied to generate microbeads of Calcium Alginate for microencapsulation of cells. The design of the microfluidic device was simulated in the COMSOL Multiphysics software to provide emulsification of two fluids. In this work, an infusion pump of high flow rate (1000 to 5000 μl/min) was developed to be used together with a commercial syringe pump that could pump the fluid flow to emulsify the continuous and disperse phases leading {{to the production of}} microbeads. The human keratinocyte cell lines (HaCaTs) encapsulated in the microbeads were characterised using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and 4 ', 6 - diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) staining. The fabrication process of the microfluidic device was simple, safe and yet highly reproducible. Nonetheless, the device developed was able to produce narrow distribution of microbeads with diameter from 500 to 800 μm. At a volume of 20 μl Sodium Alginate solution, 50 ± 10 pieces of microbeads can be produced in 5 seconds. HaCaTs were successfully embedded in the microbeads using this simple and efficient technique...|$|E
40|$|Everyday life {{is full of}} uncertainty, drudgery, {{tension and}} instability. It is a {{seemingly}} endless series of repetitive routines, minutiae and boredom, yet despite the intensity of these sensations much of this takes place {{within the realm of}} unnoticed ordinary existence, as the background noise within daily life. This research aims to establish an aesthetic of uncertainty and instability through which, manifestations of the unseen, unnoticed, and unexpected experiences of ordinary life can be visualised within abstract sculpture and installation strategies. The visual aesthetic and concepts for artworks have been developed through studio based exploration primarily concentrated on activating emotive sensations embedded in commonplace materials and straightforward fabrication processes. Using the exploratory process of tinkering, approximately 35 distinct studio experiments have been used to test the tolerances and expressive properties of a range of ordinary materials. Critical reflection on the outcomes of the studio experimentation has focussed the use of a narrow range of materials such as sign writer’s <b>vinyl,</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape, palette wrap, recycled plastic, salvaged cardboard, metal, and found objects. Experimentation has also helped to identify the potential of processes such as skinning, binding, crushing and crumpling, and presentation strategies of suspension, repetition of similar forms, the use of movement, propping and stacking to suggest tension and ambiguity. The use of clashing vibrant colours and reflective surfaces can enhance the destabilising effect of the forms and serve to activate affective prompts. These qualities comprise the aesthetic language of uncertainty and instability, and have guided the development of the final forms for presentation as outcomes of the research. The project has been contextualised in relation to artists whose practices exploit the properties of everyday materials, and emphasise certain performative actions within their making process as expressive strategies. Artists examined include Clay Ketter, who through his Sheetrock works, explores abstraction with mundane construction materials such as plaster board, and Jim Lambie whose use of colourful adhesive vinyl in installation works such as Zobop!, 1999 creates a destabilizing, immersive environment. The work of Phyllida Barlow, who deploys ordinary materials including concrete, plaster and wood to produce imposing and uncomfortable large scale installations, and John Bock whose performance and video works reference autobiographical experience and express a sense of hysteria and absurdity, have also been investigated to inform the context for the research. Theoretical investigations framing the research include writings by Ben Highmore who discusses the significance of the everyday, the mundane and the ordinary, Jane Bennett and Eric Shouse whose works discuss sensation embedded in ordinary materials and the dynamic of affect, Tim Ingold and John Seely Brown in relation to making and tinkering, and Kirk Varnedoe who offers perspectives on abstraction. It is usually not until unexpected encounters and interruptions puncture the repetitious humdrum that we are prompted to feel the presence of an expansive range of emotions – those fleeting moments of joy and pleasure, disappointment, happiness, and anxiety for example. Pursuing this core premise, the research examines how it is possible to create tension through the evocation of conflicting sensations, or the experience of uncertainty. Through physical action and performed gestures in the making process in combination with ordinary materials that offer properties such as softness, malleability, tensile strength, and low levels of resistance it is possible to use abstract form to activate a range of sensations experienced in ordinary life. Furthermore through the use of vibrant and fluorescent colour, patterned and highly detailed reflective surfaces, it is possible to create the effect of allure that shifts and gives way to feelings of uncertainty and instability as artworks reveal their potential to collapse, fall or move within the space of an installation. Finally the research has affirmed the capacity for abstract sculpture and installation artworks to articulate direct experiences of contemporary everyday life as emotive resonances...|$|E

40|$|Micro-patterning tools {{adopted from}} the {{semiconductor}} industry have mostly been optimized to pattern features onto rigid silicon and glass substrates, however, recently the need to pattern on soft substrates has been identified in simulating cellular environments or developing flexible biosensors. We present a simple method of introducing a variety of patterned materials and structures into ultra-flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers (elastic moduli down to 3 kPa) utilizing water-soluble dextran sacrificial thin films. Dextran films provided a stable template for photolithography, metal deposition, particle adsorption, and protein stamping. These materials and structures (including dextran itself) were then readily transferrable to an elastomer surface following PDMS (10 to 70 : 1 base to crosslinker ratios) curing over the patterned dextran layer and after sacrificial etch of the dextran in water. We demonstrate that this simple and straightforward approach can controllably manipulate surface wetting and protein adsorption characteristics of PDMS, covalently link protein patterns for stable cell patterning, generate composite structures of epoxy or particles for study of cell mechanical response, and stably integrate certain metals with use of <b>vinyl</b> molecular <b>adhesives.</b> This method is compatible over the complete moduli range of PDMS, and potentially generalizable over a host of additional micro- and nano-structures and materials...|$|R

30|$|To {{identify}} whether canopy properties influence HP inaccuracy {{through their}} effects on the grey-pixel fraction, a model canopy system was used to minimise the sources of grey pixels and manipulate two canopy properties, SCB length and gap fraction, independently. Model canopies {{have been used in}} several HP studies because they are more controllable and manipulable than real canopies (Chianucci 2016; Hwang et al. 2016; Macfarlane et al. 2014; Song et al. 2014). In the present study, model canopies were made with opaque black <b>adhesive</b> <b>vinyl</b> sheet, which diminished the amount of grey pixels caused by bright canopy elements; the greyness variation of sky pixels was controlled by using an artificial light source. The image size of smallest canopy elements and openings of model canopies were larger than the pixel size of the camera we used, which eliminated mixed pixels resulting from sub-pixel objects. Consequently, in our model CHPs, the only source of grey pixels is mixed pixels recording SCBs. This system also allowed us to vary SCB length and gap fraction independently, so that we could distinguish one’s effects from the other’s.|$|R

This people {{are in need of}} lower leg prostheses but are unable to afford the high costs of current prosthetic components. In this study, bamboo was used to replace the conventional pylon material to reduce the cost in below knee prosthesis. Bamboo is a natural fiber-reinforced composite material possesses good mechanical properties to warrant its use as a structural material. Methodology: The bamboo pylon was produced from proper harvesting of Bambusa Heterostachya. It was then dried in an oven at 200 o Celsius for 72 hours. Before lamination, the bamboo culm underwent pre-treatment with V-Sawit oil at about 120 °C for about 30 to 90 minutes. Bamboo pylon was laminated with at least 3 layers, using <b>vinyl</b> urethane <b>adhesive</b> and polyvinyl acetate. The processes involved in producing bamboo pylon ensure its durability and protection against pest. In second part of the study, bamboo pylon was tested for flexural, compressive and tensile properties under Universal Testing Machine based on ASTM standards. In addition, computer simulation of subject walking with bamboo pylon was performed. The third part of the study involved gait comparisons on six transtibial amputees while walking with bamboo and stainless steel pylon with the prosthetic legs. Results and Discussions: The results showed with yield compressive stress and Young’s modulus of 132. 6 MPa (SD ± 3. 3 MPa) and 30. 7 GPa (SD ± 4. 7 GPa) respectively, bamboo pylon was three times stronger than fibre reinforced plastic and two times stronger than Aluminum. There was no significant difference found in vertical and antero-posterior ground reaction forces (p > 0. 05) in Bamboo prosthetic leg compared to Stainless steel prosthetic leg. Joint kinematics for Bamboo prosthetic leg was also comparable to joint kinematics for Stainless steel prosthetic leg (p > 0. 05) except for the hip extension (p 0. 05).
