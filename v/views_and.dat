40|$|In this paper, the {{challenges}} in local-feature-based image matching are variations of <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination. Different methods have been recently proposed to address these problems by using invariant feature detectors and distinctive descriptors. However, the matching performance is still unstable and inaccurate, particularly when large variation in view or illumination occurs. In this paper, we propose a <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination invariant image matching method. We iteratively estimate {{the relationship of the}} relative <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination of the images, transform the view of one image to the other, and normalize their illumination for accurate matching. The performance of matching is significantly improved and is not affected by the changes of <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination in a valid range. The proposed method would fail when the initial <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination method fails, which gives us a new sight to evaluate the traditional detectors. We propose two novel indicators for detector evaluation, namely, valid angle and valid illumination, which reflect the maximum allowable change in <b>view</b> <b>and</b> illumination, respectively. Keywords-Feature detector evaluation, image matching, Iterative algorithm. 1...|$|R
