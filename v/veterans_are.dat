5|$|On January 25, 2017, Baker {{proposed}} a $40.5 billion state budget {{for fiscal year}} 2018, and on March 9, 2017, legislative hearings began to review it. Tax changes proposed in Baker's 2018 budget proposal include extending the state sales tax to online retailers without physical storefronts or offices in-state, a requirement that credit card companies send a 1099 tax form to individuals earning more than $600 from credit and debit card transactions, extending the state's hotel tax to room-sharing services and individuals who rent out rooms for more than 150 days a year, and a $2,000-per-employee assessment on employers that do not offer health insurance to counter spending growth in the state Medicaid program, MassHealth. Spending increases to MassHealth, local government and local education aid, higher education (including $78 million towards repairs of the University of Massachusetts Boston underground parking garage), an anti-opioid trafficking program and substance abuse services, homelessness prevention, improvement in clinical services at Bridgewater State Hospital, the Department of Children and Families to hire more case workers, a job retraining fund, an MBTA subsidy, and increasing state tax credits to businesses that hire unemployed military <b>veterans</b> <b>are</b> included in the proposal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Veteran</b> {{homelessness}} <b>is</b> not {{a phenomenon}} {{only of the}} 21st century; {{as early as the}} Reconstruction Era, homeless <b>veterans</b> <b>were</b> among the general homeless population. In 1932, homeless <b>veterans</b> <b>were</b> part of the Bonus Army. In 1934, there were as many as a quarter million veterans living on the streets. During the Truman Administration, there were one hundred thousand homeless veterans in Chicago, and a quarter of that number in Washington, D.C. In 1987, the number of homeless <b>veterans</b> <b>was</b> as high as three hundred thousand.|$|R

The cemetery also boasts two sculptures by Albin Polasek, who headed the sculpture department at the Art Institute of Chicago. They are called Mother and Pilgrim.|$|E
25|$|In {{peacekeeping}} operations, {{officers are}} seconded to the Australian Federal Police and take an oath or {{affirmation of the}} AFP.

Following their service, UN peacekeeping <b>veterans</b> <b>are</b> awarded the United Nations Medal for their particular mission. In addition, under the Australian system of honours and awards, police officers serving with peacekeeping organisations are awarded the Police Overseas Service Medal with the relevant clasp for the prescribed area of service. As of 2008, two clasps to that medal were awarded to members for operations in Cyprus and East Timor.|$|E
25|$|Since the gay {{and lesbian}} <b>veterans</b> <b>are</b> not asked to {{disclose}} information about their sexual orientation on medical forms, the healthcare providers are often unaware of this information when they consider medical treatment options. In response to these concerns, the Institute of Medicine suggested that patients disclose such information on medical records. The information will be confidential and only used to assess health. The VHA is striving to prevent this information from being shared with other organizations. Sharpe and Uchendu suggest the option of incorporating open-ended questions to encourage the veterans to supply additional written information.|$|E

25|$|One out of 50 {{children}} or 1.5 million children in United States of America will be homeless each year. In 2013 that number jumped to {{one out of}} 30 children, or 2.5 million. There were an estimated 57,849 homeless veterans estimated in the United States during January 2013, or 12 percent of all homeless adults. Just under 8 percent of homeless U.S. <b>veterans</b> <b>are</b> female. Texas, California and Florida have the highest numbers of unaccompanied homeless youth {{under the age of}} 18, comprising 58% of the total homeless under 18 youth population. Homelessness affects men more than women. At least 70% to 85% of all homeless are men.|$|E
25|$|In their article, Sherman and her coauthors {{explain that}} in the past, most of {{the gay and lesbian}} {{veterans}} were uncomfortable in disclosing their sexual orientations or identities because they were afraid that this information could lead to their discharge from the military. With the repeal of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, gays and lesbians are assured that their sexual orientations will not be used against them. Nonetheless, because of their previous experiences in the military, many gay and lesbian <b>veterans</b> <b>are</b> still worried that this information may jeopardize their future careers and prospects. Because of societal stereotypes and stigmas, they are also worried that they may be denied medical service, lose their benefits, or receive inferior services.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to developing scientific challenges to its position refusing C-123 veterans' exposure claims, on March 10, 2014 VA began revising their web {{pages to include}} reference to the submission of a special C-123 study project for the Institute of Medicine. First promised the C-123 veterans in 2012, this study directs IOM to consider medical implications of their exposures. The results were published by the IOM on 9 January 2015, solidly confirming the post-Vietnam veterans' herbicide exposures, and faulting the 2012 USAF C-123 Consultative Letter which had relied on incorrect application of a formula in determining toxicity. Under Secretary Hickey assured veterans that VA would abide by the IOM findings, and VA immediately formed a committee to address its next step as C-123 <b>veterans</b> <b>are</b> brought into the VA health care system.|$|E

A number of <b>veterans</b> <b>are</b> listed in the Notable Interments. Although the majority of war graves are in the dedicated railed section to the west – also containing 19th century services graves – a number of servicemen's graves are scattered in other areas.

25|$|Pakistan {{does not}} have its own {{equivalent}} to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. There is also no federal ministry that looks after veteran affairs. Most of Pakistan's infantry come from lower income, poor families, mainly from the rural areas of the country. They remain unknown {{from the time of}} their recruitment, and for the most part, to the time of their leave or death. Because there is no network of support that goes out to veterans, some believe that Pakistan's <b>veterans</b> <b>are</b> facing similar issues like those faced by Vietnam veterans. Politicians hardly ever mention the veterans in speeches or statements. This is because civil society hardly ever inquires or hears about the physical and mental challenges facing Pakistan's veterans. How to re-integrate veterans in to society is an issue {{that has yet to be}} addressed.|$|E
25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation. Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian <b>veterans</b> <b>are</b> disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, {{and some of them are}} having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E

50|$|Research has {{linked the}} {{neurological}} abnormalities found in Persian Gulf War veterans {{who suffer from}} Gulf War syndrome to exposure to wartime combinations of organophosphate chemical nerve agents. Before, it <b>was</b> believed that <b>veterans</b> <b>were</b> suffering from a psychologically based disorder or depression, most likely post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many <b>veterans</b> <b>were</b> given pyridostigmine bromide (PB) pills to protect against nerve gas agents such as sarin and soman. During the war <b>veterans</b> <b>were</b> exposed to combinations of organophosphate nerve agents, which produced symptoms associated with chronic organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) syndrome. Similar symptoms found in the <b>veterans</b> <b>were</b> the same symptoms reported for individuals in occupational settings who were acutely poisoned by organophosphates, such as chlorpyrifos. Studies found veterans experienced deficits in intellectual and academic abilities, simple motor skills, memory impairment, and impaired emotional function. These symptoms indicate brain damage, not a psychologically based disorder.|$|R
