5000|$|Modern (2007) watch balance {{wheels are}} usually made of Glucydur, a low thermal {{expansion}} alloy of beryllium, copper and iron, with springs of a low thermal coefficient of elasticity alloy such as Nivarox. [...] The two alloys are matched so their residual temperature responses cancel out, resulting in even lower temperature error. The wheels are smooth, to reduce air friction, and the pivots are supported on precision jewel bearings. Older balance wheels used weight screws around the rim to adjust the poise (balance), but modern wheels are computer-poised at the factory, using a laser to burn a precise pit in the rim to make them balanced. [...] Balance wheels rotate about 1½ turns with each swing, that is, about 270° to each side of their center equilibrium position. The rate of the balance wheel is adjusted with the regulator, a lever with a narrow slit on the end through which the balance spring passes. This holds {{the part of the}} spring behind the slit stationary. Moving the lever slides the slit up and down the balance spring, changing its effective length, and thus the resonant <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> of the balance. Since the regulator interferes with the spring's action, chronometers and some precision watches have ‘free sprung’ balances with no regulator, such as the Gyromax. Their rate is adjusted by weight screws on the balance rim. A balance's <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> is traditionally measured in beats (ticks) per hour, or BPH, although beats per second and Hz are also used. The length of a beat is one swing of the balance wheel, between reversals of direction, so there are two beats in a complete cycle. Balances in precision watches are designed with faster beats, because they are less affected by motions of the wrist. [...] Alarm clocks and kitchen timers often have a rate of 4 beats per second (14,400 BPH). Watches made prior to the 1970s usually had a rate of 5 beats per second (18,000 BPH). Current watches have rates of 6 (21,600 BPH), 8 (28,800 BPH) and a few have 10 beats per second (36,000 BPH). During WWII, Elgin produced a very precise stopwatch that ran at 40 beats per second (144,000 BPH), earning it the nickname 'Jitterbug'. [...] Audemars Piguet currently produces a movement that allows for a very high balance vibration of 12 beats/s (43,200 BPH). [...] The precision of the best balance wheel watches on the wrist is around a few seconds per day. The most accurate balance wheel timepieces made were marine chronometers, which by WWII had achieved accuracies of 0.1 second per day.|$|E
5000|$|Vibratory pile hammers {{contain a}} system of {{counter-rotating}} eccentric weights, powered by hydraulic motors, and designed {{in such a way}} that horizontal vibrations cancel out, while vertical vibrations are transmitted into the pile. The pile driving machine is lifted and positioned over the pile by means of an excavator or crane, and is fastened to the pile by a clamp and/or bolts. Vibratory hammers can either drive in or extract a pile; extraction is commonly used to recover steel [...] "H" [...] piles used in temporary foundation shoring. Hydraulic fluid is typically supplied to the driver by a diesel engine powered pump mounted in a trailer or van and connected to the driver head through a set of long hoses. When the pile driver is connected to a dragline excavator, it is powered by the excavator's own diesel engine. Vibratory pile drivers are often chosen to mitigate noise, as when the construction is very close to residence or office buildings, or when there is not enough vertical clearance above the foundation to permit use of a conventional pile hammer (for example when retrofitting additional piles to a bridge column or abutment footing). Hammers are available with several different vibration rates, ranging from about 1200 vibrations per minute to about 2400 VPM; the <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> chosen is influenced by soil conditions at the site and other factors such as power requirements and purchase price of the equipment.|$|E
5000|$|These early balance wheels were crude timekeepers {{because they}} lacked the other {{essential}} element: the balance spring. Early balance wheels were pushed {{in one direction}} by the escapement until the verge flag that was in contact with a tooth on the escape wheel slipped past {{the tip of the}} tooth ("escaped") and the action of the escapement reversed, pushing the wheel back the other way. In such an [...] "inertial' wheel, the acceleration is proportional to the drive force. In a balance wheel clock or watch the drive force provides both the force that accelerates the wheel and also the force that slows it down; once escape has occurred, the same force that was accelerating the wheel starts decelerating it to a halt, and then accelerating it in the other direction. If the drive force is increased, both acceleration and deceleration are greater to the same degree, this results in the wheel getting pushed back and forth faster. This made the timekeeping strongly dependent on the force applied by the escapement. If the escapement was driven directly by the mainspring, the watch would have slowed down as the spring unwound and lost force during its running period, which would have made the watch useless as a timekeeper. This is why all pre-balance spring watches had fusees (or in a few cases stackfreeds) to equalise the force from the mainspring reaching the escapement. The idea of the balance spring was inspired by observations that springy hog bristle curbs, added to limit the rotation of the wheel, increased its accuracy. [...] Robert Hooke first applied a metal spring to the balance in 1658 and Jean de Hautefeuille and Christiaan Huygens improved it to its present spiral form in 1674 [...] The addition of the spring made the balance wheel a harmonic oscillator, the basis of every modern clock. This means the wheel vibrated at a natural resonant frequency or ‘beat’ and resisted changes in its <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> caused by friction or other disturbances. This crucial innovation greatly increased the accuracy of watches, from several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, changing them from expensive novelties into useful timekeepers.|$|E

40|$|Simplification of astrophysical {{calculations}} can {{be achieved}} by invoking the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium; however, recent investigations suggest that this assumption may not be valid for certain astrophysical regions. To examine the effects of multiquantum translation to vibration transitions in expanding circumstellar envelopes, vibrational populations of the lowest 20 levels of CO have been calculated as a function of pressure and radiation density for H atom-CO collisions. Significant departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium is indicated, which implies lower dissociation rates for molecular components and a subsequent enhancement in the rate of grain formation by many orders of magnitude. Stabilization of intermediate species before they can dissociate may facilitate the formation of refractory grain cores in very hot, dilute outflows.

40|$|AbstractThe {{modes of}} pulse-periodic laser action with thermocycling were defined, at which {{an area with}} a corrugated-shaped relief and a clear border was formed {{in the center of}} the heat-affected zone in the study material, brass L 62 of 0. 05 mm thickness. It was found that during pulse-periodic laser action, {{wedge-shaped}} submicrocavities were formed on the surface layer of the material. These submicrocavities converge at their edges with formation of extended nanosized channels with widths not more than 100 nm. The pulse-periodic laser action with a pulse frequency of 3 Hz on single-phase brass leads to the formation of nanosized cavities due to the accumulation of internal stresses during cyclic heating and cooling at high rates. The estimation of vibration rates of the samples in the frequency range from 0. 5 to 16000 Hz was performed. It was revealed during the study of the forced oscillations that the maximum values of <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> occur at frequencies corresponding to the natural vibration frequencies. The application of a damping device causes significant reduction in <b>vibration</b> <b>rate,</b> but under such conditions the pore formation is not stopped.

Average accuracy of voice gender identification by adult listeners was 81. 7 % and 41. 1 % for prepubertal children’s voice gender produced under neutral and imitation conditions respectively. No significant difference in f 0 was found between genders under neutral condition, suggesting similar vocal mechanism for prepubertal boys and girls. Average F 1 and F 2 associated with boys were lower than that with girls. It was suggested that both difference in vocal tract length, and the sex-specific articulatory behaviors contributed to the differences in formant frequencies, thus enhancing sexual dimorphism for gender voice identification. Under imitation condition, boys exhibited significantly higher f 0 than girls. F 1 associated with boys was also higher than that with girls.

40|$|The {{jumping spider}} Phidippus clarus uses signals that combine visual and substrate-borne vibrations, which predict {{the outcome of}} male [...] male {{competition}} and are important to copulation success. We investigated the function of males' substrate-borne vibrations by examining phenotypic correlates of vibratory signal traits and assessing whether these affect female mating and remating decisions. Virgin females were first paired with males, and females that copulated in first trials were then paired with a second male to determine whether females remate. We measured vibratory signals produced by males during these interactions to determine 1) correlations between substrate-borne signal traits and male phenotypes, 2) whether properties of substrate-borne signals predicted mating success in first and second copulations, and 3) whether females of different mating status have different acceptance thresholds for male characters. Courtship <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> {{was positively correlated with}} male leg size, and signaling rate significantly predicted mating success in all copulations. Some females were polyandrous; however, copulation with mated females occurred after longer courtship durations, and courtship duration was positively correlated with male size, demonstrating that mated females are less receptive to mates and suggesting that females may be trading up in subsequent matings. Our study shows that males invest significant effort in courtship and that sexual selection via female choice may play a nontrivial role in the mating system. These results are the first to show that honest information about male size is encoded by substrate vibrations, and these signals are important for male mating success in both virgin and mated females.

40|$|Ultrafast laser pulses - optical pulses {{shorter than}} a {{picosecond}} - result in rapid processes occurring {{at both the}} surface and the interior of solid materials. Understanding these processes requires ultrafast probes; optical probes (reflectivity, spectral) are suitable for some surface studies, but the tracking of structural changes are well suited to x-ray and electron diffraction. An ultrafast photo-electron diffractometer is a tool for tracking structural changes such as thermal expansion, melting and super-heating, crystal phase changes, ionization, and more. The design and operation of an ultrafast photo-electron diffractometer is detailed, and its successful operation is demonstrated by sub-picosecond recording of strain in a free-standing polycrystalline platinum film of 9 nm thickness subjected to a fluence of 2 mJ/cm 2 from 150 fs laser pulses. The temporal profile of the relative change of strain is used to determine corresponding temperatures changes; for the (311) peak an increase of 70 K is noted within 10 ps. The increase in temperature takes place at a very nearly linear 7 K/ps. The (111) peak heats more rapidly, reaching 84 K in 6 ps, and is also nearly linear at 14 K/ps.

Contemporary FES research is focused on increasing the maximum operating speed of the rotor and reducing the power consumed by the active magnetic bearings. Therefore, the objective of this research was to implement a novel nonlinear controller called ?wavelet-based time-frequency control? (WFXLMS) in a computer simulation of a FES system with five degrees-of-freedom and compare its dynamic stability and active power consumption with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and fuzzy-logic controller scheme. Specifically, all three controllers were applied to a FES system operating at a high rate of speed and the amplitude of <b>vibration,</b> <b>rate</b> of convergence, and current draw were compared. The results show that the ideal choice for a FES system is the WFXLMS controller. While it did draw the largest maximum current of any system, it used significantly less (half of PID and a quarter of fuzzy-logic?s) steady state current. This would drastically improve the energy storage duration; one of the main functions of a FES system. The WFXLMS controller is also the ideal system for higher operating speeds because of the system?s stability in the frequency domain. Comparing the average displacements shows that the WFXLMS controller had the largest average displacement (particularly in the z- axis), but the WFXLMS controller only used a fraction of the available clearance gap. If the FES system was used in an environment like space or a wind-farm where external excitations are limited, the WFXLMS controller is the clear choice. However, if external excitations are a real concern, the PID and fuzzy-logic controllers demonstrated a much quicker reaction time and would be the better choice...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) It {{is common}} {{practice}} in industry to beneficiate coal (and other minerals) to meet contractual obligations. This beneficiation increases the concentration of the valuable component in the product by removing the unwanted gangue or mineral matter in predominantly density based separations. Current beneficiation technology relies heavily on water-based separation devices that are highly efficient. However these require extensive water recovery operations and result in a wet product that has a reduced value and higher transport cost than an equivalent dry product. As water supplies in the mining areas of Australia become less reliable, there is renewed interest in beneficiation technologies {{that do not require}} water or water recovery operations and can produce a product of equivalent value to water-based beneficiation. This thesis considers dry beneficiation in a novel gas-solid fluidised bed, known as the Reflux Classifier, {{with the addition of a}} dense-medium and vibration. Prior to this work, the application of the water-based Reflux Classifier to the separation of particles on the basis of size and/or density had been extensively studied and the use of the pneumatic Reflux Classifier as a size separation device had also been investigated. The application of the pneumatic Reflux Classifier to the density based beneficiation of particles had not been previously considered. In the present study, the density based separation of particles in a laboratory scale pneumatic Reflux Classifier was considered. The apparatus was constructed of stainless steel and had a cross-sectional area of 20 mm × 100 mm with a plenum chamber and distributor below a 1 m vertical fluidised bed and a 2 m channel inclined at 70 º to the horizontal above. A sand dense-medium was used to encourage density based separations and sand was continually fed to the bed in all experiments. The bed could be configured for batch separations with continuous overflow removal, or continuous separations with both continuous overflow and underflow removal. The whole apparatus could be vibrated to study the effect of the addition of vibration to the separations. The separations obtained in the Reflux Classifier were compared to separations in a 3 m vertical fluidised bed to determine the effect of the incline on the separation performance of the vessel. The majority of the separation experiments were conducted on batch quantities of plastic tracer particles in the size range - 6. 35 + 1. 0 mm with densities of 1300, 1600, 1800, 2100 and 2400 kg/m³. In batch experiments, tracer particles of a single density were placed on the distributor and the bed filled with silica sand (density 2600 kg/m³, - 355 + 90 μm). The gas and vibration were introduced simultaneously with a continuous feed of sand medium and the rate of elutriation of particles (both sand and tracer) from the bed was measured. The batch experiments investigated the effect of changing the vibration frequency and direction, including separations with no vibration, across the range of tracer particle densities. In continuous experiments, steady state between the feed and the continuous overflow and underflow of sand was established. The tracer particles in single density samples were fed into the bed in 10 minute intervals over a period of 40 minutes and their rate of exit through the overflow and underflow was measured. The continuous experiments investigated the effect of changing the overflow rate of particles at a constant feed rate and the effect of changing the gas rate. The sand fluidised bed acted as a dense-medium, or pseudo-fluid, enhancing the density separation of particles. Increasing the gas rate, or decreasing the vibration frequency both acted to increase the size of bubbles in the bed, which resulted in less homogeneity in the medium and thus less effective separations. As with all dense media operations, the effectiveness of the medium increased for larger tracer particles. An almost perfect density separation of particles greater than 4 mm in diameter was observed while for particles less than 2 mm in diameter the separation was more dependent on the convective velocity of the medium than the particle size. The rate of particle elutriation from the bed was first order dependent on particle concentration. The elutriation rate data for the batch experiments was modelled using a two-parameter model for dispersed plug flow to find the particle velocity and dispersion. The particle velocity was found to consist of a convective velocity due to the flowrate of the sand through the vessel that affected all particles equally, and a buoyant velocity dependent on particle size and density. This buoyant velocity could be predicted from an equation for particle terminal velocity in the Intermediate regime, with the density and viscosity of the medium dependent on the vibration conditions The density cut-point of the separations could be varied by changing the overflow rate, the <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> and the gas rate. Increasing the overflow rate or the gas rate led to a higher density cut-point while increasing the vibration frequency reduced the density cut-point. The separation efficiency decreased with decreasing particle size or increasing gas rate, but was largely unaffected by the overflow rate. The inclusion of the incline increased the separation efficiency by encouraging the refluxing of near density particles, as observed in the water-based Reflux Classifier. This refluxing is a unique characteristic of the inclined channel that was not observed in the vertical fluidised bed. The separation performance of the experimental apparatus was very good for the largest particles in comparison to water-based beneficiation devices but poor for particles below 2. 0 mm. For particles in the size range - 6. 35 + 4. 0 mm the separation efficiency, measured by the Ep, was 0. 04 for the batch separations and 0. 06 for the continuous separations. This compares well with the 0. 02 - 0. 03 Ep of water-based dense-medium cyclones on the same size coal particles. The Ep for particles in the size range - 2. 0 + 1. 0 mm was 0. 16 in the batch separations and 0. 35 in the continuous separations which is significantly higher than the 0. 07 Ep of the water-based Reflux Classifier and the 0. 14 to 0. 18 Ep of water-based spirals. From the tracer particle experiments the best conditions for a continuous coal separation were determined to be high frequency vibration, and minimal gas and overflow rates, with the Reflux Classifier performing better than a vertical fluidised bed. A separation of coal confirmed that the dense-medium pneumatic Reflux Classifier with vibration can perform good density based separations. The geometry used in this work restricted the processing capacity (tonnage) of the unit to approximately 1. 5 t/m². h, with higher feed rates resulting in particles accumulating in the bed and causing blockages. A waterbased Reflux Classifier has a throughput capacity as high as 47 t/m². h. This thesis describes the first attempt to characterise the behaviour of a Reflux Classifier with sand dense-medium. The intention was to determine if such an apparatus could be used to separate particles on the basis of density and the potential for its application as an industrial process. The focus was on the changes in behaviour and the separation cut-point and efficiency with changing conditions. From this work it was concluded that the laboratory scale Reflux Classifier can separate particles on the basis of density with similar efficiency and cut-point to current industrial standards but the processing capacity is significantly below that of similar footprint water-based technologies...|$|E
