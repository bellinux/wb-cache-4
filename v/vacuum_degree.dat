40|$|We {{argue that}} a unitary {{description}} of the formation and evaporation {{of a black hole}} implies that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is the "entropy of a vacuum": the logarithm of the number of possible independent ways in which quantum field theory on a fixed classical spacetime background can emerge in a full quantum theory of gravity. In many cases, the covariant entropy counts this entropy [...] the degeneracy of emergent quantum field theories in full quantum gravity [...] with the entropy of particle excitations in each quantum field theory giving only a tiny perturbation. In the Rindler description of a (black hole) horizon, the relevant <b>vacuum</b> <b>degrees</b> of freedom manifest themselves as an extra hidden quantum number carried by the states representing the second exterior region; this quantum number is invisible in the emergent quantum field theory. In a distant picture, these states arise as exponentially degenerate ground and excited states of the intrinsically quantum gravitational degrees of freedom on the stretched horizon. The formation and evaporation of a black hole involve processes in which the entropy of collapsing matter is transformed into that of a vacuum and then to that of final-state Hawking radiation. In the intermediate stage of this evolution, entanglement between the vacuum and (early) Hawking radiation develops, which is transferred to the entanglement among final-state Hawking quanta through the evaporation process. The horizon is kept smooth throughout the evolution; in particular, no firewall develops. Similar considerations also apply for cosmological horizons, for example for the horizon of a meta-stable de-Sitter space.

The single factor tests indicated that, the optimal moisture content, microwave power output, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>degree</b> were 19. 8 ± 2 % (50 °C hot air drying for 3 h), 686 ± 3. 5 W and 0. 09 MPa, respectively. The results showed that proper moisture content of the pre-dehydrated fish slices and microwave power could increase the expansion ratio and crispness of the fish slices, and then improve the sensory quality of the finished products. The higher <b>vacuum</b> <b>degree</b> could enhance the puffing effect, improve the crispness of the fish slices, increase the energy efficiency of microwave heating, and obviously decrease the burnt spots formation on the surface of the finished products. The processing parameters of the savory crisp bighead carp slices were optimized by a L 15 (51 · 32) orthogonal design based on the single factor tests.

50|$|Price {{elasticity}} also differentiates {{types of}} goods. An elastic good is one {{for which there}} is a relatively large change in quantity due to a relatively small change in price, and therefore is likely {{to be part of a}} family of substitute goods; for example, as pen prices rise, consumers might buy more pencils instead. An inelastic good is one for which there are few or no substitutes, such as tickets to major sporting events, original works by famous artists, and prescription medicine such as insulin. Complementary goods are generally more inelastic than goods in a family of substitutes. For example, if a rise in the price of beef results in a decrease in the quantity of beef demanded, it is likely that the quantity of hamburger buns demanded will also drop, despite no change in buns' prices. This is because hamburger buns and beef (in Western culture) are complementary goods. It is important to note that goods considered complements or substitutes are relative associations and should not be understood in a <b>vacuum.</b> The <b>degree</b> to which a good is a substitute or a complement depends on its relationship to other goods, rather than an intrinsic characteristic, and can be measured as cross elasticity of demand by employing statistical techniques such as covariance and correlation.|$|R
