40|$|Aim. To study a {{possibility}} of usage of the alkaline gel electrophoresis method (Comet assay) for determination of genotoxic properties of <b>veterinary</b> <b>vaccines</b> preparations. Methods. The alkaline gel electrophoresis of isolated eukaryotic cells has been used with further visualization of the samples by fluorescent microscopy. Results. <b>Veterinary</b> <b>vaccines</b> testing by the Comet assay method under alkaline conditions revealed that the samples No. 1 and No 12 from twelve investigated vaccine preparations had genotoxic influence on eukaryotic cells of CHO-K 1 and Vero test cultures, No. 12 sample being genotoxic only at metabolic activation. Conclusions. The method of alkaline gel ålectrophoresis of single cells (Comet assay) is suitable for determination of <b>veterinary</b> <b>vaccines</b> genotoxic influence on the test eukaryotic cells CHO-K 1.

50|$|GALVmed {{is one of}} {{only two}} British-based {{charities}} supported by the Gates Foundation. In August 2014, Bill Gates visited GALVmed’s Edinburgh office to see and hear first-hand the progress being made by GALVmed. Apart from the completed phase 1 and ongoing phase 2 PLSHL projects, GALVmed conceived and was a partner in the Vaccines for the Control of Neglected Animal Diseases in Africa (VACNADA) project, which ran from 2010 to 2011. The €20million VACNADA project, funded by the European Union Food Facility and with overall coordination of the implementing partners by the African Union-Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR), was an intervention aimed to enhance food security through reducing the impact of animal disease by increasing access to and use of quality vaccines. Other partners included the African Union Panafrican <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Vaccine</b> Centre (AU-PANVAC) and the centre de coopération internationale enrechercheagronomique pour le développement (CIRAD). GALVmed led the implementation of a VACNADA component to improve the capacity of eight African laboratories to make quality assured vaccines in more efficient ways that met internationally recognised quality standards and best practices. Staff from selected national vaccine producing laboratories, identified through a needs assessment, received training in laboratory and vaccine operation management, had their laboratory facilities upgraded and technical support provided for the implementation of quality assurance and standardisation of the production process of selected vaccines. In 2011, DFID awarded GALVmed an additional grant worth £8,010,708 to support the development of an integrated package of tools and policies and implement it as a cost effective control of animal African trypanosomosis (AAT). The objective was to develop a new robust field diagnostic tool for AAT, new trypanocidal drugs and to establish the basis {{for the development of a}} vaccine for AAT. The Controlling AAT project was scheduled to run until February 2014,. The DFID funding for AAT was subsequently complemented by a grant worth US$ 1,421,722 awarded by BMGF in January 2014 to undergo Phase 2 of the project. The stated purpose of the BMGF grant was to develop safe and effective drugs against drug-resistant AAT as well as a diagnostic test for field diagnosis of infection in cattle and to improve the quality control of existing trypanocidal drugs used by smallholder livestock keepers in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
40|$|The major {{goals of}} <b>veterinary</b> <b>vaccines</b> are {{to improve the}} health and welfare of {{companion}} animals, increase production of livestock in a cost-effective manner, and prevent animal-to-human transmission from both domestic animals and wildlife.

The final successful outcome of vaccine research and development is the generation of a product that will be available in the marketplace or that will be used in the field to achieve desired outcomes. As detailed in this review, successful <b>veterinary</b> <b>vaccines</b> have been produced against viral, bacterial, protozoal, and multicellular pathogens, which in many ways have led the field in the application and adaptation of novel technologies. These <b>veterinary</b> <b>vaccines</b> have had, and continue to have, a major impact not only on animal health and production but also on human health through increasing safe food supplies and preventing animal-to-human transmission of infectious diseases.
