40|$|Air/Oil {{filtration}} through filters {{is commonly}} utilised in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>industry</b> where oil lubricated pumps are used across {{a number of}} different applications such as food and packaging, industrial, pharmaceutical, R&D, forming and drying. The air/oil filters are crucial in the reduction of exhaust emissions, which, when suspended as fine particulate matter can cause great harm to the environment, climate, equipment life and public health. However, the behaviour of flow through the filters is not fully understood and much of the design and development work is based on historical know-how and experimental studies. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a powerful tool to understand the flow characteristics and droplet trajectory through the filters which is challenging through experimental techniques. In this study, a CFD model is developed by using the commercial ANSYS FLUENT code. Oil droplets from the pump entering the filter are treated as a discrete phase. Euler-Lagrangian frame is used to characterise the multiphase flow, K-Ɛ as a turbulence model, Rosin-Rammler distribution of oil droplets, User Defined Functions (UDF) are written for droplet injection, distribution and deposition. Various methodologies and tests were developed to obtain the required data to feed into the model and validate the data predicted by the computational model.

40|$|There is a pervading {{sense of}} unease that artificially {{intelligent}} machines will soon radically alter {{our lives in}} ways that are still unknown. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology are developing at an extremely rapid rate as computational power continues to grow exponentially. Even if existential concerns about AI do not materialize, there are enough concrete examples of problems associated with current applications of AI to warrant concern about the level of control that exists over developments in this field. Some form of regulation is likely necessary to protect society from harm. However, advances in regulatory capacity have not kept pace with developments in new technologies, including AI. This is partly because regulation has become decentered; that is, the traditional role of public regulators such as governments commanding regulation has dissipated, and other participants including those from within the industry have taken the lead. Other contributing factors are dwindling government resources on one hand and the increased power of technology companies on the other. These factors have left the field of AI development relatively unregulated. Whatever the reason, it is now more difficult for traditional public regulatory bodies to control the development of AI. In the <b>vacuum,</b> <b>industry</b> participants have begun to self-regulate by promoting soft law options such as codes of practice and standards. This Article argues that despite the reduced authority of public regulatory agencies, the risks associated with runaway AI require regulators to begin to participate in what is largely an unregulated field. In an environment where resources are scarce, governments or public regulators must develop new ways of regulating. This Article proposes solutions to regulating the development of AI ex ante through a two-step process: first, governments can set expectations and send signals to influence participants in AI development. The Authors adopt the term “nudging” to refer to this type of influencing. Second, public regulators must participate in and interact with the relevant industries. By doing this, they can gather information and knowledge about the industries, begin to assess risks, and then {{be in a position to}} regulate those areas that pose the most risk first. To conduct a proper risk analysis, regulators must have sufficient knowledge and understanding about the target of regulation to be able to classify various risk categories. The Authors have proposed an initial classification based on the literature that can help to direct pressing issues for further research and a deeper understanding of the various applications of AI and the relative risks they pose...|$|E

40|$|The American Society for Testing and Materials has {{published}} a new standard test method for characterizing time and temperature-dependence of material outgassing kinetics and the deposition kinetics of outgassed species on surfaces at various temperatures. This new ASTM standard, E 1559 (1), uses the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) collection measurement approach. The test method was originally developed under a program sponsored by the United States Air Force Materials Laboratory (AFML) to create a standard test method for obtaining outgassing and deposition kinetics data for spacecraft materials. Standardization by ASTM recognizes that the method has applications beyond aerospace. In particular, the method will provide data of use to the electronics, semiconductor, and high <b>vacuum</b> <b>industries.</b> In ASTM E 1559 the material sample is held in vacuum in a temperature-controlled effusion cell, while its outgassing flux impinges on several QCM's which view the orifice of the effusion cell. Sample isothermal total mass loss (TML) is measured {{as a function of}} time from the mass collected on one of the QCM's which is cooled by liquid nitrogen, and the view factor from this QCM to the cell. The amount of outgassed volatile condensable material (VCM) on surfaces at higher temperatures is measured as a function of time during the isothermal outgassing test by controlling the temperatures of the remaining QCM's to selected values. The VCM on surfaces at temperatures in between those of the collector QCM's is determined {{at the end of the}} isothermal test by heating the QCM's at a controlled rate and measuring the mass loss from the end of the QCM's as a function of time and temperature. This reevaporation of the deposit collected on the QCM's is referred to as QCM thermogravimetric analysis. Isothermal outgassing and deposition rates can be determined by differentiating the isothermal TML and VCM data, respectively, while the evaporation rates of the species can be obtained as a function of temperature by differentiating the QCM thermogravimetric analysis data...|$|R

40|$|Many {{metropolitan}} {{cities are}} situated along coastal belts, which {{are composed of}} very soft alluvial and marine clays. Because of low shear strength and high compressibility, the soft soils in these areas are not suitable for construction without appropriate ground improvement. To ensure stability during construction and reduce long-term settlements, {{it is necessary to}} implement a preconstruction technique in the soft soil site on which infrastructures are to be built. A common technique is to use prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs), which, combined with surcharge loading and vacuum, occurs before the construction of many essential coastal line infrastructures such as airports, railway tracks, and commercial buildings worldwide. This technique has been proved to be an effective way to expedite soft soil consolidation. Firstly, the radial drainage paths allowed by PVDs accelerate the dissipation of excess pore pressure under the surcharge loading. Secondly, negative pore pressure created by the vacuum accelerates the consolidation process as well as controlling lateral displacement. This chapter introduces the basic principles of PVDs combined with surcharge loading and vacuum, along with the illustration of two types of PVD systems: the membrane system and the membraneless system. The numerical conversion method from 3 D to 2 D and a constitutive model for soft soils under cyclic loading is presented, along with case histories of the Port of Brisbane, the Pacific Highway in Ballina, the Sandgate Rail Grade Separation Project in Australia, and the Tianjin Port in China. PVDs with vacuum-assisted preloading was utilized in each of these projects and has made significant contributions to preconstruction consolidation.

40|$|The Holweck pump {{is widely}} used in the <b>vacuum</b> pumping <b>industry.</b> It can be a self {{standing}} apparatus {{or it can be}} part of a more advanced pumping system. It is composed by an inner rotating cylinder (rotor) and an outer stationary cylinder (stator). One of them, has spiral guided grooves resulting to a gas motion from the high towards the low vacuum port. Vacuum pumps may be simulated by the DSMC method but due to the involved high computational cost in many cases manufactures commonly resort to empirical formulas and experimental data. Recently a computationally efficient simulation of the Holweck pump via linear kinetic theory has been proposed by Sharipov et al [1]. Neglecting curvature and end effects the gas flow configuration through the helicoidal channels is decomposed into four basic flows. They correspond to pressure and boundary driven flows through a grooved channel and through a long channel with a T shape cross section. Although the formulation and the methodology are explained in detail, results are very limited and more important they are presented in a normalized way which does not provide the needed information about the pump performance in terms of the involved geometrical and flow parameters. In the present work the four basic flows are solved numerically based on the linearized BGK model equation subjected to diffuse boundary conditions. The results obtained are combined {{in order to create a}} database of the flow characteristics for a large spectrum of the rarefaction parameter and various geometrical configurations. Based on this database the performance characteristics which are critical in the design of the Holweck pump are computed and the design parameters such as the angle of the pump and the rotational speed, are optimized.

40|$|Roll-to-roll vacuum {{deposition}} is {{the technology that}} applies an even coating to a flexible material that can be held on a roll and provides a much faster and cheaper method of bulk coating than deposition onto single pieces or non-flexible surfaces, such as glass. This technology {{has been used in}} industrial-scale applications for some time, including a wide range of metalized packaging (e. g. snack packets). Its potential as a high-speed, scalable process has seen an increasing range of new products emerging that employ this cost-effective technology: solar energy products are moving from rigid panels onto flexible substrates, which are cheaper and more versatile; in a similar way, electronic circuit 'boards' can be produced on a flexible polymer, creating a new range of 'flexible electronics' products; and, flexible displays are another area of new technology in vacuum coating, with flexible display panels and light sources emerging. Charles Bishop has written this book to meet the need he identified, as a trainer and consultant to the <b>vacuum</b> coatings <b>industry,</b> for a non-mathematical guide to the technologies, equipment, processes and applications of {{vacuum deposition}}. His book is aimed at a wide audience of engineers, technicians and production management. It also provides a guide to the subject for sectors in which vacuum deposition is a novel technology, such as solar energy and flexible electronics. By taking a holistic end-to-end approach to vacuum deposition, from materials through processes to end-use, Bishop provides his readers with an invaluable set of analytical tools and rules-of-thumb that will enable them to: develop processes and products that reduce failure rates, increase system efficiency and improve end products; improve the specification of system requirements; and, have more worthwhile discussions with engineering specialists and machinery suppliers. Bishop's non-mathematical explanation of vacuum deposition technologies will empower a wide range of technicians, production managers and engineers in related disciplines to improve performance and maximize productivity from vacuum coating systems. It provides the knowledge and understanding needed to specify systems more effectively and enhance the dialogue between non-specialists and suppliers / engineers.

40|$|This paper reports recent {{developments}} of vacuum coatings technologies for hot-forming tooling applications. Whilst well {{implanted in the}} machining and cutting <b>industry,</b> <b>vacuum</b> coatings face important challenges for the fabrication of forming tools, and more specifically in hot forming, due to the extreme operation conditions to be met, such as high loading forces, impact/thermal cycling, working material adhesion, etc. Present and future coatings adapted to hot work tooling are discussed in this paper: transition metal nitrides, carbon nitrides, borides and mixed oxides are among the currently postulated coating formulations for high temperature forming. The study is complemented with current strategies of characterizing {{the properties of the}} coatings in the adequate environment of high temperatures and contact loadings. To this aspect, a number of examples, from using standard laboratory equipment to the use of in-house developed tribological set-ups, are given, together with recent findings obtained from the authors’ research groups. The data available is, however, quite limited from the scientific literatures on the field trials with reliable, statistical relevance, which is, probably, attributed to the high costs normally incurred for carrying out experiments in real industrial environment. Nevertheless, we could still draw a conclusion of that vacuum coating for tooling applications is at a front edge of knowledge generation and technology transfer to industry, and while being already mature, there is still a needed effort for significant industrial up-take from the novel coatings developed or being under the development...|$|R
40|$|Large-area {{electronics}} (LAE) manufacturing {{has been}} a key focus of both academic and industrial research, especially within the last decade. The growing interest is born out {{of the possibility of}} adding attractive properties (flexibility, light weight or minimal thickness) at low cost to well-established technologies, such as photovoltaics, displays, sensors or enabling the realisation of emerging technologies such as wearable devices and the Internet of Things. As such there has been great progress in the development of materials specifically designed to be employed in solution processed (plastic) electronics, including organic, transparent metal oxide and nanoscale semiconductors, as well as progress in the deposition methods of these materials using low-cost high-throughput printing techniques, such as gravure printing, inkjet printing, and roll-to-roll <b>vacuum</b> deposition. Meanwhile, <b>industry</b> innovation driven by Moore’s law has pushed conventional silicon-based electronic components to the nanoscale. The processes developed for LAE must strive to reach these dimensions. Given that the complex and expensive patterning techniques employed by the semiconductor industry so far are not compatible with LAE, there is clearly a need to develop large-area high throughput nanofabrication techniques. This thesis presents progress in adhesion lithography (a-Lith), a nanogap electrode fabrication process that can be applied over large areas on arbitrary substrates. A-Lith is a self-alignment process based on the alteration of surface energies of a starting metal electrode which allows the removal of any overlap of a secondary metal electrode. Importantly, it is an inexpensive, scalable and high throughput technique, and, especially if combined with low temperature deposition of the active material, it is fundamentally compatible with large-area fabrication of nanoscale electronic devices on flexible (plastic) substrates.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} with a flextensional piezoelectric actuator {{have led to}} the development of a sampler with a bit that is designed to produce and capture a full set of sample forms including volatiles, powdered cuttings, and core fragments. The flextensional piezoelectric actuator is a part of a series of devices used to amplify the generated strain from piezoelectric actuators. Other examples include stacks, bimorphs, benders, and cantilevers. These devices combine geometric and resonance amplifications to produce large stroke at high power density. The operation of this sampler/drill was demonstrated using a 3 x 2 x 1 -cm actuator weighing 12 g using power of about 10 -W and a preload of about 10 N. A limestone block was drilled to a depth of about 1 cm in five minutes to produce powdered cuttings. It is generally hard to collect volatiles from random surface profiles found in rocks and sediment, powdered cuttings, and core fragments. Toward the end of collecting volatiles, the actuator and the bit are covered with bellows-shaped shrouds to prevent fines and other debris from reaching the analyzer. A tube with a miniature bellows (to provide flexibility) is connected to the bit and directs the flow of the volatiles to the analyzer. Another modality was conceived where the hose is connected to the bellows wall directly to allow the capture of volatiles generated both inside and outside the bit. A wide variety of commercial bellows used in the <b>vacuum</b> and microwave <b>industries</b> can be used to design the volatiles capture mechanism. The piezoelectric drilling mechanism can potentially be operated in a broad temperature range from about- 200 to less than 450 C. The actuators used here are similar to the actuators that are currently baselined to fly as part of the inlet funnel shaking mechanism design of MSL (Mars Science Laboratory). The space qualification of these parts gives this drill a higher potential for inclusion in a future mission, especially when considering its characteristics of low mass, small size, low power, and low axial loads for sampling...|$|R
40|$|Grasping in minimal {{invasive}} surgery (MIS) is conducted with so called laparoscopic graspers. These graspers are generally derivatives of instruments used in open surgery. The performance of these graspers {{depends on the}} technical and medical functionality, the skills and experience of the user, the surgeon, and the comfort of use related to the instrument. The foremost characteristic required for any grasp instrument in grasping soft organs and tissue is the so called ‘safe grip’. The technical and medical functionality of any grasp instrument depends on this property. The patient safety {{was defined as the}} completion of a procedure throughout which no adverse events take place which compromise the physical (and also mental) wellbeing of a patient. Vacuum technique as grasping technique for MIS was chosen as research subject for this thesis. There were three main reasons for this choice. First, vacuum technique is a widely applied grasp technique in industry. Besides the potential induced by its variety of applications in <b>industry,</b> <b>vacuum</b> technique, as grasp technique for MIS, has been studied concerning its potential. These studies underline the potential of vacuum technique however, the findings were not translated to actual applications in MIS nor was any knowledge provided concerning the conditions or requirements in relation to vacuum grasping which ensure a safe grip. The third aspect of vacuum technique is its physical principles. Vacuum grasping is a very controlled and homogenous way of grasping. The ‘object’ type which was grasped by means of vacuum was the bowel. The bowel is an organ which is frequently grasped during MIS procedures. It is a very delicate and easily damaged. Bowel damage can have serious consequences for the patient. With regard to grasping the bowel no research has yet been conducted concerning vacuum grasping. Design Inclusive Research (DIR) was applied as the methodological tool concerning this project. DIR is characterized by the incorporation of design activities which support and provide as input for the research activities. This particular method was chosen due to the intention and necessity of developing vacuum grasp instruments on behalf of the research activities. As stated above, this thesis focusses on the feasibility of vacuum technique as grasp technique for MIS. This is {{based on the premise that}} we strive to a constant performance regardless of the skills and experience of the user. The research question was defined as, is vacuum technique feasible as grasping technique for minimal {{invasive surgery}}? This feasibility can be interpreted as the feasibility of a vacuum grasp instrument. The performance is determined by the technical aspects, the skills and experience of the surgeon and the comfort of use. This leads to three focus areas. The first two focus points are related to the technical and medical functionality (grip and damage). The third focus point is derived the comfort of use. From this study it can be conclude that, vacuum technique as grasp technique has potential to be used in minimal invasive surgery, no damage to the bowel was encountered either at the macroscopic or at the microscopic level. A try-out towards grasping other types of tissue showed that vacuum also has potential to safely grasp the liver, gallbladder and spleen. From a technical view point vacuum technique offers a number of benefits concerning the physical principle of vacuum grasping. It is a very constant and controllable way of grasping which provides sufficient grip on the bowel. Vacuum technique does not compress the tissue and seems none sensitive to variations in the tissue such as differences in wall thickness and tissue folds which adds to the safe way of grasping. The nozzles of the instruments have no moving parts and the vacuum is limited. Therefore it makes no difference whether the instruments are used by an expert or a novice. The performance on this aspect is constant regardless of the skills and experience of the user. The overall conclusion is that basically vacuum technique is a safe and useful technique to grasp the bowel. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
