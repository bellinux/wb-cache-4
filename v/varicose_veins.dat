In <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> the valves are damaged, disfunction or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|As {{the summit}} closed on 28 September 1970, hours after escorting the last Arab leader to leave, Nasser {{suffered}} a heart attack.

5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis.

An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{tourniquet}} during <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery, {{has been}} shown, through previous randomised trials, {{to result in a}} significant reduction in blood loss, superior post-operative cosmesis with no increase in operating time. Nonetheless, it would seem that few surgeons use this technique. Using postal questionnaires (n = 107), we have assessed the views and current practice among general surgeons (consultants and higher surgical trainees) in Wessex where the method was first proposed, to see how widely it has been adopted. We find that the majority (69. 5 %) of general surgeons in Wessex never use a tourniquet during <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery. Possible reasons for this include the belief that it is time consuming, inconvenient, compromises the sterility of the operative field and confers no advantage. We conclude, however, that by not using a tourniquet during <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery, surgeons are overlooking an important, evidence-based technique.

5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> and similar disorders.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo characterise the {{inflammatory}} cell infiltrate in <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> wall, {{and its relationship}} to the valve complex. DesignA comparative study of the distribution of {{inflammatory cell}}s in normal and <b>varicose</b> <b>vein.</b> MaterialsSpecimens of proximal human long saphenous vein were obtained from patients with duplex Doppler confirmed long saphenous vein reflux (n= 14). Control vein was obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass without clinical evidence of venous insufficiency (n= 6). Longitudinal 7 μm frozen sections of vein, displaying valve, were prepared. MethodsUsing immunohistochemistry, T-lymphocytes (CD 3), macrophage/monocytes (CD 68), neutrophils (CD 15 s) and mast cells (anti-mast cell tryptase) were identified. The number of cells per unit length vein were counted using light microscopy. ResultsThere were significantly more mast cells and macrophage/monocytes in <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> as compared to control. There was a non-significant trend towards more T-lymphocytes in <b>varicose</b> <b>vein.</b> Few neutrophils were present in <b>varicose</b> or normal <b>vein.</b> The distribution of inflammatory cells with respect to the valve was not found to be significant. ConclusionsVaricose veins display a greater inflammatory cell infiltrate than normal vein. The key role of macrophage/monocytes and mast cells in tissue damage and remodelling should stimulate further research into whether they {{play a significant role in}} the development of chronic venous insufficiency...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> disease {{primarily}} causes cosmetic concern it {{can also}} develop into disabling venous ulcers. For advanced disease, surgical intervention is a mainstay {{for a majority of}} patients. Several new techniques have evolved during the last decade and a handful of these are offered through the Norwegian Statutory Health Care System. Few economic evaluations have been performed considering surgery for <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> disease, none including the range of new endovascular techniques. Objectives: The aim of the current thesis was to estimate costs and outcome of five common techniques of <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery in a Norwegian Health Care Setting (high ligation and stripping, radiofrequency ablation, endovenous laser ablation, steam vein sclerosis and cyanoacrylate glue) using both a societal perspective and a health care perspective. Methods: A structured literature search was made to determine the clinical effectiveness and the rate of compilations in the five methods. Data on costs and health-related quality of life related to <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> disease were also collected. With the aid of an expert panel, a structured decision tree was developed using TreeAge software. A one-year perspective was modelled, and a variety of common complications were included. Monte Carlo simulation was used for probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: In the societal perspective the laser ablation strategy was the most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness-ratio (ICER) of NOK 70, 539 compared to a no treatment alternative, and had a 42 % probability of being cost-effective using a willingness-to-pay threshold of NOK 500, 000. In a health care perspective, however, the steam vein sclerosis strategy was the most cost-effective with an ICER of NOK 34, 005 compared to a no treatment alternative, and this strategy had a 50 % probability of being cost-effective. Conclusion: Recent endovenous surgical treatment alternatives (including laser ablation and steam vein sclerosis) provide clinically effective treatment for advanced, symptomatic <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> disease and are cost-effective in a Norwegian Health Care Setting. The societal perspective envelop costs related to <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery that are not accounted for in a health care perspective, and is therefore recommended when undertaking comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses...|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{observational study}} of 63 legs in 49 patients was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} adequacy of primary <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery performed by surgical trainees. Appropriate surgery {{was carried out by}} a surgical senior house officer (SHO) under direct consultant supervision. All patients underwent pre- and postoperative duplex scanning. The preoperative duplex scan demonstrated incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) or long saphenous vein (LSV) in 59 limbs, a mid-thigh perforator (MTP) in 11 limbs, and saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) in 5 limbs. Surgery successfully abolished all sites of pre-existing reflux. The postoperative duplex scan revealed that 17 new sites of reflux, not identified preoperatively, had developed in 12 limbs. With a consultant-led service and accurate preoperative identification of sites of reflux, the surgical trainee can adequately perform <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery. This would seem a reasonable approach to training and eliminating recurrence owing to inadequate surgery. The development of new sites of reflux within 6 months of <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery may be owing to altered venous haemodynamics consequent upon this surgery...|$|R
25|$|Sclerotherapy {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of spider veins and occasionally <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> for over 150 years.

25|$|Sclerotherapy is {{one method}} (along with surgery, {{radiofrequency}} and laser ablation) {{for the treatment}} of spider veins, occasionally <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> and venous malformations.

40|$|Objective:Assessment {{of outcome}} after <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery. Design:Prospective study using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (SF 36) which {{considers}} {{different aspects of}} overall health. Setting:University Hospital and Community. Materials: 150 patients undergoing <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery. Chief outcome measures:SF 36 questionnaires were sent pre-operatively and at 1 and 6 months post surgery. Main results:Eighty-nine (59 %) patients answered all three questionnaires. Pre-operatively their overall health {{was similar to that}} of the general population. The “cost” to the patient of the operation was demonstrated by an increased pain and reduced role function at 1 month post-operation (p < 0. 01). By 6 months post-operation, when compared with preoperative values, all dimensions except social function and health perception were improved (p < 0. 01). Overall symptoms improved (p < 0. 01) by 1 month and were further improved at 6 months. Conclusions:The general good health of <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> patients may justify the low priority given to their treatment, but the improvement in symptoms and general health that relatively simple surgery provides should ensure its continued provision as a health care service...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{exists that}} {{cutaneous}} microvascular endothelial dysfunction persists in patients following <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery. This study compared cutaneous microvascular function between post-surgical <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> patients and healthy controls and investigated whether any impairment of function can be attenuated by acute lower-limb exercise. Cutaneous flux {{responses of the}} gaiter area were measured in supine and standing positions before and after a 25 -min walk using laser Doppler fluximetry and incremental-dose administration of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The pre-exercise peak responses to ACh (standing) were lower in patients than controls (48 ± 11 vs. 96 ± 28 PU; P = 0. 032), whereas treadmill exercise abolished this difference (P = 0. 819). In contrast, the pre-exercise responses to SNP (standing) appeared higher in patients than controls (3 mC responses: 24 ± 4 vs. 10 ± 2 PU, respectively; P = 0. 023), with no effect of acute exercise (P > 0. 05). These findings suggest that acute treadmill exercise augments microvascular endothelial function in post-surgical <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> patients to levels observed in age-matched controls...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of exercise training on cutaneous microvascular function in post-surgical <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> patients. Sixteen post-surgical (4 – 5 weeks) <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> patients were randomised to a treadmill-walking exercise group or a non-exercise control group. The exercise group trained twice weekly for 8 weeks. Changes in cutaneous microvascular function of the gaiter area were assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry combined with incremental-dose iontophoretic administration of acetylcholine chloride (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in both supine and standing positions. At 8 weeks, peak flux responses to ACh in the supine position were increased in the exercise group (44 ± 30 to 62 ± 33 PU; P = 0. 03) with a similar trend in the standing position (37 ± 27 to 74 ± 31 PU; P = 0. 08). There were no such changes {{in the control group}} (P > 0. 05). Additionally, peak flux responses to SNP were unchanged in both groups and body positions (P > 0. 05). The results suggest that moderate-intensity lower-limb exercise training improves microvascular endothelial vasodilator function in post-surgical <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> patients...|$|R
