5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: <b>viability</b> (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus <b>viability</b> and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} analyze a unicellular-multicellular {{evolutionary}} transition, a multi-cellular organism is {{identified with the}} vector of <b>viabilities</b> and fecundities of its constituent cells. The Michod–Viossat–Solari–Hurand–Nedelcu index of group fitness for a multicel-lular organism {{is a function of}} these cell <b>viabilities</b> and fecundities. The MVSHN index has been used to analyze the germ-soma specialization and the fitness decoupling between the cell and organism levels that takes place during the transition to multicellularity. In this article, social choice theory is used to provide an axiomatic characterization of the group fitness ordering of vectors of cell <b>viabilities</b> and fecundities underlying the MVSHN index...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the contribution of plaque and saliva towards the prolonged activity, also called substantivity, of three antimicrobial mouthrinses (Listerine (R), Meridol (R), Crest Pro Health (R)), used in combination with a toothpaste (Prodent Coolmint (R)). Volunteers brushed for 4 weeks with a toothpaste without antimicrobial claims, while during the last 2 weeks half of the volunteers used an antimicrobial mouthrinse in addition to brushing. At the end of the experimental period, plaque and saliva samples were collected 6 h after oral hygiene, and bacterial concentrations and <b>viabilities</b> were determined. The contribution of plaque and saliva towards substantivity was assessed by combining plaque obtained after mechanical cleaning only with plaque and saliva obtained after additional use of an antimicrobial rinse.

40|$|Adult flies were {{collected}} from Suwon population and the third chromosomes were extracted from each of 112 males using the Ser/Sb balancer stocks. Then the homozygote <b>viabilities</b> of the third chromosome were estimated under the normal (2512) and the heat-shock (371 (3) conditions. A degree of response(name as Responsability) {{was measured by the}} ratio of <b>viabilities</b> under the heat shock and the normal condition. Furthermore, the puffing patterns of the strains which have shown high and low responsability were analyzed with heat-induced puffs on the polytene chromosome in order to observe relationship between responsability and the expression of Hsp genes. The following results were obtained. 1) The lethal frequency on the third chromosome of homozygous strains was 0. 277 + 0. 042. 2) The average <b>viabilities</b> of non-lethal homozygous strains were estimated 0. 800 + 0. 026 and 0. 726 + 0. 026 at normal and heat shock condition, respectively. 3) The average responsability was estimated 0. 938 + 0. 032. The wide distribution of responsabilities represented that there were many of variants for heat-shock responses in the third chromosome of the natural population. 4) Comparing with the puffing patterns on the polytene chromosome, it was observed that the duration of the puffs of 87 A and 87 C, which were known to code Hsp 70, was longer in the strains of high responsability than in those of low one. ope...|$|R
40|$|Selective culling in {{populations of}} most organisms is rank-order: {{individuals}} of low rank {{on a scale}} of potential fitnesses tend to be eliminated during early development, whereas surviving adults (whose number reflects the carrying capacity of the environment) are generally drawn from the distribution's upper end. Haldane pointed out [Haldane, J. B. S. (1932) The Causes of Evolution (Harper & Row, New York) ] that selection which favors individuals in the upper tail of a composite distribution curve tends to favor members of the more variable of two populations, rather than members of a less variable one, even though the latter may possess the higher mean. In addition to reviewing earlier observations bearing on Haldane's argument, the present report describes an analysis of the comparative egg-to-adult <b>viabilities</b> of flies (Drosophila melanogaster) carrying combinations of second chromosomes obtained from one or another of eight experimental populations. Overall, the <b>viabilities</b> of flies carrying combinations of chromosomes one of which is shared (i/j vs. j/k) are as different as those of flies carrying combinations of independently sampled chromosomes (i/j vs. k/l). Episodes seemingly occurred within the populations during which flies carrying combinations that shared a chromosome differed more in their <b>viabilities</b> than flies carrying unrelated combinations. Such episodes could reflect the occurrence of selection of the sort described by Haldane...|$|R

40|$|Plaque {{is never}} fully removed by {{brushing}} and may {{act as a}} reservoir for antibacterial ingredients, contributing to their substantive action. This study investigates the contribution of plaque-left-behind and saliva towards substantivity of three antibacterial toothpastes versus a control paste without antibacterial claims. First, volunteers brushed 2 weeks with a control or antibacterial toothpaste. Next, plaque and saliva samples were collected 6 and 12 h after brushing and bacterial concentrations and <b>viabilities</b> were measured. The contributions of plaque and saliva towards substantivity were determined by combining control plaques with experimental plaque or saliva samples and subsequently assessing their <b>viabilities.</b> Bacterial compositions in the various plaque and saliva samples were compared using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The <b>viabilities</b> of plaques after brushing with Colgate-TotalA (R) and Crest-Pro-HealthA (R) were smaller than of control plaques and up to 12 h after brushing with Crest-Pro-HealthA (R) plaques still contained effective, residual antibacterial activity against control plaques. No effective, residual antibacterial activity could be measured in saliva samples after brushing. There {{was no significant difference}} in bacterial composition of plaque or saliva after brushing with the different toothpastes. Plaque-left-behind after mechanical cleaning contributes to the substantive action of an antibacterial toothpaste containing stannous fluoride (Crest-Pro-HealthA (R)). The absorptive capacity of plaque-left-behind after brushing is of utmost clinical importance, since plaque is predominantly left behind in places where its removal and effective killing matter most. Therewith this study demonstrates a clear and new beneficial effect of the use of antibacterial toothpastes...|$|R

40|$|Hypoxic {{preconditioning}} {{can play}} a significant neuroprotective role. However, {{it has not been}} employed clinically because of safety concerns. To find a safer preconditioning stimulus that is both practical and effective, we investigated whether ginkgolides are capable of preconditioning as hypoxia to protect C 6 cells against ischemic injury. We demonstrated that both ginkgolides (37. 5 mu g/mL) and hypoxia (1 % O- 2 for 16 h) can significantly increase cell <b>viabilities</b> and expression of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (p-GSK), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha (HIF- 1 alpha) and erythropoietin (EPO) in ischemic cells. The inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase (PI 3 K) significantly but not completely reduced the enhanced expression of these proteins and cell <b>viabilities</b> induced by ginkgolides and hypoxic preconditioning. These indicated that ginkgolides could mimic hypoxic preconditioning by increasing expression of HIF- 1 alpha as well as its target protein EPO and that the ginkgolides and hypoxic preconditioning role might be partly mediated by the activation of the p 42 /p 44 -rnitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. pathways. The similar tendency in the changes of protein expression, cell <b>viabilities</b> and responses to MAPK or PI 3 K inhibitors of the cells treated with ginkgolides and hypoxia suggests that ginkgolides and hypoxic preconditioning might operate by similar mechanisms. The findings also imply that ginkgolides might have the potential for clinical use to prevent injury in high-risk conditions. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|R
