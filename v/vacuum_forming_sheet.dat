40|$|Introduction: The maxillomandibular {{relationship}} (MMR) {{record is}} a critical step to establish the new occlusion in implant supported complete mouth rehabilitation. Using patients existing denture for recording the MMR requires implant definitive cast to be modified extensively to completely seat the denture (with unaltered flanges) on it. This may influence the correct seating of the denture on the implant definitive cast causing faulty recording of the MMR. Materials and Method: Elastomeric record bases, reinforced with the resin framework, are fabricated and relined with the light body elastomeric material when all the healing abutments are in place. The MMR is recorded with these elastomeric record bases using <b>vacuum</b> <b>formed</b> facial surface index of the occluded existing dentures as a guideline. Results: The elastomeric record bases with facial surface index of the existing dentures can allow clinicians to record MMR records without removing the healing abutments from the mouth with acceptable accuracy. This can save chair-side time of the procedure. The record of facial surfaces of existing complete denture in the <b>form</b> of <b>vacuum</b> <b>formed</b> <b>sheet</b> helps to set the occlusal vertical dimension. Conclusion: Use of facial surface index together with the elastomeric record bases can be the useful alternative technique to record the MMR in patients with implant supported full mouth rehabilitation. Further study is required to prove its routine clinical utility...|$|R
50|$|Most modern acrylic {{canopies}} are <b>vacuum</b> <b>formed.</b> A <b>sheet</b> of acrylic is {{secured to}} a female mould, then the entire assembly is heated in an oven until the acrylic is pliable. The air is then removed from the mould and the acrylic sheet is drawn into it, forming {{the shape of the}} canopy. The acrylic is then trimmed to the appropriate shape and attached to an aluminum or composite frame. Some one-off canopies are made in a similar fashion, but since a mould would be too time-consuming to make, the acrylic is heated and <b>vacuum</b> <b>formed</b> until it approximates the shape the builder is seeking. This type of construction is less precise, however, and each canopy is unique. If multiple canopies will be needed, a mould is almost always used.|$|R
50|$|Forming dies are {{typically}} made by tool and die makers {{and put into}} production after mounting into a press. The die is a metal block that is used for <b>forming</b> materials like <b>sheet</b> metal and plastic. For the <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> of plastic <b>sheet</b> only a single form is used, typically to form transparent plastic containers (called blister packs) for merchandise. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> is considered a simple molding thermoforming process but uses the same principles as die forming. For the <b>forming</b> of <b>sheet</b> metal, such as automobile body parts, two parts may be used: one, called the punch, performs the stretching, bending, and/or blanking operation, while another part that is called the die block securely clamps the workpiece and provides similar stretching, bending, and/or blanking operation. The workpiece may pass through several stages using different tools or operations to obtain the final form. In {{the case of an}} automotive component there will usually be a shearing operation after the main forming is done and then additional crimping or rolling operations to ensure that all sharp edges are hidden and to add rigidity to the panel.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of a study on the effect of {{selected}} conditions of a pressure-bubble <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> for polystyrene <b>sheet</b> on the non-uniformity of wall thickness of finished parts. The investigation was performed using DOE methods. Variables for the tests included temperatures in the external and internal zones of the heaters as well as heating time. The results demonstrate that the heating time and temperature in the internal zone formed by the heater have a statistically significant effect on the finished part’s wall thickness at the measuring points. It has been found that the side walls and bottom of the finished part are uniformly deformed, and thus exhibit the lowest wall thickness non-uniformity at a heating time of 22 s (corresponding {{to the middle of the}} measuring range). Also, it is observed that the application of low temperatures in both zones of the heater has a positive effect. Due to the use of bubble, the finished parts exhibit a much lower wall thickness non-uniformity compared to those produced without bubble...|$|R

An {{efficient}} way of cutting <b>vacuum</b> <b>formed</b> items from the original <b>sheet</b> of <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> material. The cutter can also cut any necessary holes, such as cable or access holes, at the same time. Roller cutting is suitable for fairly large items, where precision alignment is not required. As the vacuum formings and the cutter are rolled sideways through the roller cutter machine, some misalignment can occur. Roller cutting can't be used for making holes or features in the sides of vacuum formings, as the cutter tool always cuts vertically from the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Wood {{patterns}} {{are a common}} material to <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> but probably the most obvious. Wood is relatively inexpensive and allows the customer to make changes to the design easily. Using recycled objects or forms are the most sustainable {{way to make a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> because they are 'found objects' at no additional cost. The number of samples that one is able to get from any pattern depends {{on the size of the}} part and the thickness of the material. Once the specifications of the part have been met, the pattern is then used to create a ceramic composite mold, or cast aluminum mold for regular production. Potentially, there are ways to create holes in plaster with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> if the replicated forms you make the <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> from are deep enough and you leave gaps between them for the plastic to form into. Then, once the plastic is used to cast a plaster mold, the deep plastic areas will leave holes if the mold is not completely filled.|$|R
