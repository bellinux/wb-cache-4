40|$|Multimedia desktop {{conferencing}} {{systems that}} includes audio, video and application sharing are gaining momentum and increasingly becoming a reality. This paper describes one such system, called Java Collaborative Environment (JCE). The application sharing component of JCE allows the conference participants to share any application written in Java using its Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT). The {{audio and video}} components of JCE {{are based on the}} new Java Media Framework (JMF). In this paper, we describe the problems encountered during the use of JMF in a conference with a large number of participants. The problems are caused by using the real-time transport protocol (RTP) within JMF for sending and receiving many audio and video streams. Our solutions to these problems are based on using a <b>video</b> <b>multiplexer</b> and an audio mixer. The <b>video</b> <b>multiplexer</b> is to display the videos of many participants into few video windows and the audio mixer is to combine all audio streams into one. KEY WORDS: [...] ...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing concern about the {{potential}} impact of the long-term correlations in variable bit rate (VBR) video traffic on real-time traffic engineering in the emerging broadband networks such as ATM networks and Integrated Services Internet. Previous studies have shown that video traffic exhibits long-range dependence (LRD), raising doubts about the validity of short-range dependence (SRD) Markovbased models for video applications. Using theory and simulations, we study VBR <b>video</b> <b>multiplexers</b> over ranges of desirable cell loss probabilities and buffer sizes (maximum delays). We show that the long-term correlations do not have significant impact on the cell loss probabilities, and that well-designed Markovian models, which capture the relevant range of correlations, provide good prediction of system performance. We further show that, contrary to wide-spread belief, capturing the long-range dependence alone (while ignoring the SRD) can lead to underestimation of the resources [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} meet {{stringent}} specifications of bandwidth flatness, differential gain and phase, and 75 Ω drive capability, high speed complementary bipolar processes are more suitable than CMOS processes for video switches and multiplexers. Traditional CMOS switches and multiplexers suffer from several disadvantages at video frequencies. Their switching time (typically 50 ns or so) is not fast enough for today's video applications, and they require external buffering in order to drive typical video loads. In addition, the small variation of the CMOS switch on-resistance with signal level (RON modulation) introduces unwanted distortion in differential gain and phase. Multiplexers based on complementary bipolar technology offer a better solution at video frequencies. The tradeoffs, of course, are higher power and cost. Functional block diagrams of the AD 8170 /AD 8174 /AD 8180 /AD 8182 bipolar <b>video</b> <b>multiplexer</b> are shown in Figure 1. The AD 8183 /AD 8185 <b>video</b> <b>multiplexer</b> is shown in Figure 2. These devices offer {{a high degree of}} flexibility and are ideally suited to video applications, with excellent differential gain and phase specifications. Switching time for all devices in the family is 10 ns to 0. 1 %. The AD 8186 /AD 8187 are single-supply versions of the AD 8183 /AD 8185.

The new system has minimal hardware and installation cost overheads, since it exploits the already installed CCTV cameras.

This paper presents a solution to this fairness problem which is based on the enforcement of controlled per±connection delays. The amount of delay imposed on each source is calculated by an optimization process at connection admission and termination instants. Two different optimization objectives, one minimax and one minisum, are considered. Their performance and their relation to buffer space constraints is examined. The loss and delay performance of the scheme is also evaluated through simulations. In particular, very low per±connection delay variance is ob-served, indicating reduced jitter. Finally, two implementation alternatives of the scheme on an ATM network are presented: (a) as a protocol between multiplexer and sources and (b) as a non±work conserving service discipline for multiplex-ers. The engineering aspects and, in particular, the buffer demands of the two alternative implementations are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{commercial}} egg industry commonly uses induced molt {{procedures to}} rejuvenate flocks {{for a second}} or third laying cycle. Molting may be induced by feed withdrawal for up to 10 days (7), water withdrawal for 2 days (19), or both, along with a reduction of day length (14). Such programs cause concern about animal welfare because it is thought that they may be harmful to hens (28). Given the concerns for potential bird stress, various methods of nutrient restriction that would avoid long term feed withdrawal have been investigated (20, 24). One of the alternative methods for molt induction is high-dietary Zn (4). Materials and Methods In this study, a total of 30 Hy-line W- 36 leghorn hens (at 50 wk old) (1400 ± 150 g), were randomly assigned to 5 replicate. Ten cages (3 hens in each cage) on both the upper and lower tiers were considered to observe behavior patterns. Data recording of predetermined behavioral patterns were carried out using five Camera Digital <b>Video</b> Recorder <b>Multiplexer</b> System. Behavior recording began at 9 : 00 h each day and ended at 11 : 00 h and a second observation starting at 16 : 00 p. m and ended at 18 : 00 p. m. Total of ten cages (containing 3 hens/ cage (30 hens total)) were used to collect 5 behaviors (feeding, drinking, nonnutritive pecking, preening and aggression pecking) and one posture (sitting). The following ethogram was adopted from Webster (27) feeding defined as pecking behavior directed toward the feed trough or toward a neighboring feed trough. Drinking was defined as the appearance of ingesting water from the nipple at the near of the cage. Nonnutritive pecking was defined as non aggressive pecking at anything other than feed, which included cage pecking, feather pecking, bill pecking and air pecking. Preening behavior involved the manipulation of the plumage with the beak. Aggressive was the sum of pecks that occurred within a cage or between neighboring cages. Sitting was defined as a crouched posture with shanks or breast in contact with the cage floor. Results and Discussion Percentage of observation of all behaviors except for non-nutritive pecking was significantly affected by high dietary zinc (...|$|R
40|$|Biotube was {{developed}} for plant gravitropic research investigating the potential for magnetic fields to orient plant roots as they grow in microgravity. Prior to flight, experimental seeds are placed into seed cassettes, {{that are capable of}} containing up to 10 seeds, and inserted between two magnets located within one of three Magnetic Field Chamber (MFC). Biotube is stored within an International Space Station (ISS) stowage locker and provides three levels of containment for chemical fixatives. Features include monitoring of temperature, fixative/ preservative delivery to specimens, and real-time video imaging downlink. Biotube's primary subsystems are: (1) The Water Delivery System that automatically activates and controls the delivery of water (to initiate seed germination). (2) The Fixative Storage and Delivery System that stores and delivers chemical fixative or RNA later to each seed cassette.
