50|$|<b>Voltage</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{describes}} {{the fraction of}} energy lost through overpotential. For an electrolytic cell this is the ratio of a cell's thermodynamic potential divided by the cell's experimental potential converted to a percentile. For a galvanic cell it is the ratio of a cell's experimental potential divided by the cell's thermodynamic potential converted to a percentile. <b>Voltage</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{should not be confused}} with Faraday efficiency. Both terms refer to a mode through which electrochemical systems can lose energy. Energy can be expressed as the product of potential, current and time (joules = volts × amps × seconds). Losses in the potential term through overpotentials are described by <b>voltage</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Losses in the current term through misdirected electrons are described by Faraday efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Faradaic loss is {{only one}} form of energy loss in an {{electrochemical}} system. Another is overpotential, {{the difference between the}} theoretical and actual electrode voltages needed to drive the reaction at the desired rate. Even a rechargeable battery with 100% faradaic efficiency requires charging at a higher voltage than it produces during discharge, so its overall energy efficiency is the product of <b>voltage</b> <b>efficiency</b> and faradaic efficiency. Voltage efficiencies below 100% reflect the thermodynamic irreversibility of every real-world chemical reaction.|$|E
50|$|In electrochemistry, {{overpotential}} is {{the potential}} difference (voltage) between a half-reaction's thermodynamically determined reduction potential and the potential at which the redox event is experimentally observed. The term {{is directly related to}} a cell's <b>voltage</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In an electrolytic cell the existence of overpotential implies the cell requires more energy than thermodynamically expected to drive a reaction. In a galvanic cell the existence of overpotential means less energy is recovered than thermodynamics predicts. In each case the extra/missing energy is lost as heat. The quantity of overpotential is specific to each cell design and varies across cells and operational conditions, even for the same reaction. Overpotential is experimentally determined by measuring the potential at which a given current density (typically small) is achieved.|$|E

50|$|In electronics, {{a linear}} {{regulator}} {{is a system}} used to maintain a steady voltage. The resistance of the regulator varies {{in accordance with the}} load resulting in a constant output voltage. The regulating device is made to act like a variable resistor, continuously adjusting a voltage divider network to maintain a constant output voltage and continually dissipating the difference between the input and regulated voltages as waste heat. By contrast, a switching regulator uses an active device that switches on and off to maintain an average value of output. Because the regulated voltage of a linear regulator must always be lower than input <b>voltage,</b> <b>efficiency</b> is limited and the input voltage must be high enough to always allow the active device to drop some voltage.|$|E
5000|$|Nor is current {{efficiency}} {{the same as}} thermodynamic efficiency, since it never address the how much energy (potential in volts) is in the electrons added or removed. The <b>voltage</b> <b>efficiency</b> determined by the reactions overpotential is more {{directly related to the}} thermodynamics of the electrochemical reaction. In fact {{the extent to which a}} reaction goes to completion is related to how much greater the applied potential is than the reduction potential of interest. In the case where multiple reduction potentials are of interest, it is often difficult to set an electrolysis potential a [...] "safe" [...] distance (such as 200 mV) past a redox event. The result is incomplete conversion of the substrate, or else conversion of some of the substrate to the more reduced form. This factor must be considered when analyzing the current passed and when attempting to do further analysis/isolation/experiments with the substrate solution.|$|E

The ambient temperature alkaline electrolyser is capable for wider operational range and faster response time when powered by wind energy sources.

40|$|Development and {{optimization}} of {{the electrodes}} {{in a water}} electrolysis system using a polymer membrane as electrolyte {{have been carried out}} in this work. A cell voltage of 1. 59 V (energy consumption of about 3. 8 kWh/Nm 3 H 2) has been obtained at practical operation conditions of the electrolysis cell (10 kA ·m − 2, 90 ◦C) using a total noble metal loading of less than 2. 4 mg·cm − 2 and a Nafion ® - 115 membrane. It is further shown that a cell voltage of less than 1. 5 V is possible at the same conditions by combination of the best electrodes obtained in this work. The most important limitation of the electrolysis system using polymer membrane as electrolyte has proven to be the electrical conductivity of the catalysts due to the porous backing/current collector system, which increases the length of the current path and decreases the cross section compared to the apparent one. A careful compromise must therefore be obtained between electrical conductivity and active surface area, which can be taylored by preparation and annealing conditions of the metal oxide catalysts. Anode catalysts of different properties have been developed. The mixed oxide of Ir-Ta (85 mole% Ir) was found to exhibit highest <b>voltage</b> <b>efficiency</b> at a current density of 10 kA · m − 2 or below, whereas the mixed oxide of Ir and Ru (60 - 80 mole% Ir) was found to give the highest <b>voltage</b> <b>efficiency</b> for current densities of above 10 kA · m − 2.
