25|$|An ammeter shunt is {{a special}} type of current-sensing resistor, having four {{terminals}} and a value in milliohms or even micro-ohms. Current-measuring instruments, by themselves, can usually accept only limited currents. To measure high currents, the current passes through the shunt across which the voltage drop is measured and interpreted as current. A typical shunt consists of two solid metal blocks, sometimes brass, mounted on an insulating base. Between the blocks, and soldered or brazed to them, are one or more strips of low {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) manganin alloy. Large bolts threaded into the blocks make the current connections, while much smaller screws provide <b>volt</b> <b>meter</b> connections. Shunts are rated by full-scale current, and often have a voltage drop of 50 mV at rated current. Such meters are adapted to the shunt full current rating by using an appropriately marked dial face; no change need to be made to the other parts of the meter.|$|E

50|$|A {{potentiometer}} is {{an instrument}} for variable potential (voltage) in a circuit. Before {{the introduction of the}} moving coil and digital <b>volt</b> <b>meters,</b> potentiometers were used in measuring voltage. The method was described by Johann Christian Poggendorff around 1841 and became a standard laboratory measuring technique.|$|R
50|$|Many DVMs (digital <b>volt</b> <b>meters)</b> have a capacitance-measuring function. These usually operate by {{charging}} and discharging the capacitor under test with a known current and measuring {{the rate of}} rise of the resulting voltage; the slower the rate of rise, the larger the capacitance. DVMs can usually measure capacitance from nanofarads to a few hundred microfarads, but wider ranges are not unusual.|$|R
50|$|In October 1976, a {{year after}} introduction, a new de luxe version of the Kitten, branded as the Kitten DL, was announced. Improvements {{included}} revised springs and dampers and a changed anti-roll bar but mainly the DL model was an uprated interior improvement packaged which included more comfortable seats which reclined & tilted, modified door trims incorporating a map pocket made of coloured vinyl, a parcel shelf, <b>volt</b> <b>meter</b> & oil pressure gauge, radio with twin speakers, chrome hubcaps with chrome surrounds, extra additional carpet, front and rear fog lights {{and in some cases}} rear reversing lights.|$|E
5000|$|In electrochemistry, the anode is the {{electrode}} where oxidation {{is taking place}} in the battery, i.e. electrons get free and flow out of the battery (technical current flowing into it). However, this happens on opposite electrodes during charge vs. discharge. The less ambiguous terms are positive (cathode on discharge) and negative (anode on discharge). This is the positive-negative polarity which is displayed on a <b>volt</b> <b>meter.</b> [...] For rechargeable cells, the term [...] "cathode" [...] designates the positive electrode in the discharge cycle, even when the associated electrochemical reactions change their places when charging and discharging, respectively. For lithium-ion cells the positive electrode ("cathode") is the lithium based one.|$|E

Features the Futura offered over the GLi included body coloured door handles and mirrors, availability of Black Pearl paintwork, demand wash-wipe feature on windscreen wipers (demand wipe only on GLi), ABS brakes, cruise control, full instrumentation pack (four ancillary gauges plus tachometer) with <b>volt</b> <b>meter</b> and oil pressure gauge, digital clock, lamps for ignition lock and map reading, eight-speaker Alpine sound system, carpeted door map pockets on front doors only, full cloth trim.

25|$|The SI derived {{units for}} the {{electric}} field are <b>volts</b> per <b>meter,</b> newtons per coulomb, or tesla meters per second.|$|R
25|$|To {{avoid the}} loading of the {{measured}} circuit {{by the current}} drawn by the meter movement, some analog multimeters use an amplifier inserted between the measured circuit and the meter movement. While this increases the expense {{and complexity of the}} meter, by use of vacuum tubes or field effect transistors the input resistance can be made very high and independent of the current required to operate the meter movement coil. Such amplified multimeters are called VTVMs (vacuum tube voltmeters), TVMs (transistor <b>volt</b> <b>meters),</b> FET-VOMs, and similar names.|$|R
50|$|A {{voltage divider}} {{can be used}} to scale down a very high voltage {{so that it can be}} {{measured}} by a <b>volt</b> <b>meter.</b> The high voltage is applied across the divider, and the divider output - which outputs a lower voltage that is within the meter's input range - is measured by the meter. High voltage resistor divider probes designed specifically for this purpose {{can be used to}} measure voltages up to 100 kV. Special high-voltage resistors are used in such probes as they must be able to tolerate high input voltages and, to produce accurate results, must have matched temperature coefficients and very low voltage coefficients. Capacitive divider probes are typically used for voltages above 100 kV, as the heat caused by power losses in resistor divider probes at such high voltages could be excessive.|$|E
50|$|One {{other problem}} can {{happen with the}} wattage rating of the power supply. There are 2 Dell power {{supplies}} that were used for different Inspiron models which have the same plug assembly and voltage, a 65 watt supply model PA-6 and a 90 watt supply model PA-9. Some models (for example the Inspiron 1100) shipped with a PA-9. If a PA-6 (or equivalent aftermarket supply) is used in these models then the system might not boot at times. In such cases, it will light the battery light {{for a few seconds}} when the supply is plugged in. This can also happen if the power supply becomes marginal. Marginal supplies can show as supplying full voltage even if tested with a <b>volt</b> <b>meter</b> while the supply is plugged into the computer and an attempt is made to turn on the computer.|$|E

In a standard vigilance setting, gaze at three illuminable <b>volt</b> <b>meters</b> was monitored by a Mackworth television eye camera with automatic recording capability. Gaze at a given meter produced illumination of the meter, and signals (deflections of the needle on the meter) were scheduled as intermittent consequences of this response.

Typically these systems are remotely controlled. Using commercial instruments has many benefits. Manufactures have the skill, knowledge, and experience to produce high quality products.

In second place was Chris Petty at an average race speed of 62.219 mph and third place with the TORK entry was John Crellin at an average race speed of 60.475 mph. There was confusion {{at the end of the}} Open class as the winner Chris Heath was briefly excluded and then reinstated after the rider was unaware of a TTXGP regulation that competitors must sound the machines' electric horn if a yellow flag is displayed by a race marshal. After discussion with ACU stewards and the TTXGP organisers, Chris Heath was reinstated as winner of the Open class.|$|E

40|$|Our Great Lakes {{are under}} attack by the {{invasive}} Asian carp. If they were to establish themselves in the lakes, it would prove detrimental to the ecosystem, the multi-billion dollar fishing industry, and recreational lake use.

Currently, these fish are being stopped by a massive horizontal electrode fish barrier system located in Romeoville, Illinois. My research was spurred by the amount of problems with the maintenance of the system. Using horizontal electrodes makes them susceptible to damage and debris, mostly from barge chains and silt. The current maintenance protocol is to poison the water, shut down the barrier, and send a diver into potentially electrified water. I decided to try to model mounting removable electrodes on the side wall to stop the damage. I hypothesized that this would produce the same gradient and stop the fish. I created a 2 percent scale model of both configurations and tested the gradient using a <b>volt</b> <b>meter.</b> My findings show that vertically mounted electrodes will produce the same fish-stopping gradient, and are easier to maintain, safer, and more economical...|$|E
