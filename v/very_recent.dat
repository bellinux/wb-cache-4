5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. These split into at least three enclaves which subsequently evolved in isolation in the following drier glacial periods until the current more favourable climate saw them expand once again and interbreed where they overlap. This suggests the original split was only <b>very</b> <b>recent</b> as the forms had insufficient time to speciate. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals have been {{introduced}} to Newfoundland, either by chance or deliberately. Moose, snowshoe hare, American red squirrel, eastern chipmunk, and masked shrew, and others, {{were brought to the}} island through specific wildlife mandates. Moose were introduced in 1904 and are now the dominant ungulate on the island. An unusual experiment conducted in 1964 involved relocating a small herd of bison onto Brunette Island in Fortune Bay. The last of these animals is thought to have died by 1994. Rats and mice were unintentionally introduced while mink escaped from fur farms. Coyotes are a <b>very</b> <b>recent</b> addition to the fauna of Newfoundland. How coyotes got onto the island is still debated by wildlife officials, but it is probable that they crossed the ice from Cape Breton Island in the 1980s. Newfoundland has no native amphibians, but frogs were introduced onto the island in the 1860s and toads almost a century later.|$|E

25|$|The MRT was a <b>very</b> <b>recent</b> {{addition}} for Singapore and as such, {{the authorities}} {{wanted to keep}} the MRT map as easy to use for Singaporeans as possible. Hence, each direction of travel was colour-coded in a different colour {{as though it were a}} line on its own. In that way, confusion in decision-making when taking a certain line in a certain direction would be reduced for passengers. However, this reduced the amount of colours available for new lines and was not in line with international practice.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to Gutenberg {{printing}}, {{which allowed}} printing {{on both sides}} of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until <b>very</b> <b>recent</b> times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to rub the back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed. Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.|$|E
25|$|Of the basal breeds, the American Eskimo Dog and Eurasier {{were the}} <b>very</b> <b>recent</b> product of {{cross-breeding}} other basal breeds. Most basal breeds have hybridized with other lineages in the past. If those other lineages were other basal breeds then a basal genetic signature remains. The combination of introgression and past population bottlenecks suggested that basal breeds {{have little or}} no genetic connections to their ancestral populations and that their genetic distinctiveness does not signify ancient heritage. They are distinctive from the modern breeds because the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and the basal breeds have mostly avoided admixture with them due to geographic or cultural barriers.|$|E

25|$|Several {{reports have}} been {{published}} since the 1990s on the genetic makeup of the Siberian tiger {{and its relationship to}} other subspecies. One of the most important outcomes has been the discovery of low genetic variability in the wild population, {{especially when it comes to}} maternal or mitochondrial DNA lineages. It seems that a single mtDNA haplotype almost completely dominates the maternal lineages of wild Siberian tigers. On the other hand, captive tigers appear to show higher mtDNA diversity. This may suggest that the subspecies has experienced a <b>very</b> <b>recent</b> genetic bottleneck caused by human pressure, with the founders of the captive population being captured when genetic variability was higher in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The lack {{of chairs}} {{may also have}} been to provide more space for prostration, another ancient Jewish {{observance}} that the Jews of Yemen continued to practise until <b>very</b> <b>recent</b> times. There are still a few Yemenite Jews who prostrate themselves during the part of everyday Jewish prayer called Tachanun (Supplication), though such individuals usually do so in privacy. In the small Jewish community that exists today in Bet Harash, prostration is still done during the tachanun prayer. Jews of European origin generally prostrate only during certain portions of special prayers during Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) and Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). Prostration was a common practise amongst all Jews until some point during the late Middle Ages or Renaissance period.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{continues}} to be volcanically active, but the dispersed population has witnessed few eruptions due to the remoteness of the volcanoes and their low level of activity. The span of recorded and witnessed volcanic activity in Canada differs from region to region {{and at least two}} eruptions have been witnessed by people. Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, more than 200potentially active volcanoes exist throughout Canada, 49of which have erupted in the past 10,000years (Holocene). This is <b>very</b> <b>recent</b> in geological terms, suggesting volcanoes in Canada have ongoing activity. Ongoing scientific studies have indicated there have been earthquakes associated with at least ten Canadian volcanoes, including: Mount Garibaldi, Hoodoo Mountain, Castle Rock, Mount Cayley, The Volcano, Crow Lagoon, Silverthrone Caldera, Mount Meager, the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
