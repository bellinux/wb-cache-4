2500|$|Of the {{anterior}} thigh muscles the largest are the four {{muscles of the}} quadriceps femoris: the central rectus femoris, which is surrounded by the three vasti, the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius,</b> medialis, and lateralis. Rectus femoris {{is attached to the}} pelvis with two tendons, while the vasti are inserted to the femur. All four muscles unite in a common tendon inserted into the patella from where the patellar ligament extends it down to the tibial tuberosity. Fibers from the medial and lateral vasti form two retinacula that stretch past the patella on either sides down to the condyles of the tibia. The quadriceps is the knee extensor, but the rectus femoris additionally flexes the hip joint, and articular muscle of the knee protects the articular capsule of the knee joint from being nipped during extension. The sartorius [...] runs superficially and obliquely down on {{the anterior}} side of the thigh, from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pes anserinus on the medial side of the knee, from where it is further extended into the crural fascia. The sartorius acts as a flexor on both the hip and knee, but, due to its oblique course, also contributes to medial rotation of the leg as one of the pes anserinus muscles (with the knee flexed), and to lateral rotation of the hip joint.|$|E
50|$|Tensor <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> is {{a muscle}} in the {{anterior}} compartment of thigh. It lies between the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> and the vastus lateralis.

30|$|Biopsy {{specimens}} {{were taken}} of the muscular <b>vastus</b> lateralis, medialis, <b>intermedius,</b> rectus femoris, fascia lata, and lateral and medial retinaculum of the patella to find any potential tissue abnormalities, such as fibrosis or degeneration of the muscles or fibrous band.|$|R
40|$|A {{rare case}} of a {{posttraumatic}} extensive ganglion cyst of the anterolateral thigh with connection to the knee joint is presented. A 54 - year-old man presented a palpable mass in the anterolateral region of his right thigh with a 15 months existing sense of fullness and tightness. He had an accident with his bicycle 21 months ago. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed showing a cyst inside the quadriceps femoris muscle between <b>vastus</b> lateralis and <b>intermedius</b> with connection to recessus suprapatellaris and knee joint. In addition MRI detected a traumatic lesion in the quadriceps femoris tendon in the near of the knee joint. The ganglion cyst was 18 cm long and was excised completely. Intraope - ratively, the knee joint connection was confirmed and excised as well. The ganglion cyst {{was filled with a}} gelatinous and viscous fluid...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} inhomogeneous changes in quadriceps femoris (QF) cross-sectional area (CSA) in response to strength training. It is assumed that these differential changes in muscle shape influence the muscle 2 ̆ 7 s functional capacity during high-force and high-power movements. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to compare intermuscular and intramuscular QF adaptations to high-load strength training and fast-speed power training. Methods Thirty-six non-strength-trained men were randomly assigned to four groups and completed 8 wk of parallel-depth heavy squat-lift training (HS-P), parallel-depth jump squat training (JS-V), volitional-depth jump squat training (JS-V), or no training (C). Quadriceps femoris, <b>vastus</b> lateralis (VL), <b>intermedius</b> (VI), medialis (VM), and rectus femoris (RF) CSA were measured in distal-, mid-, and proximal-thigh regions using extended field-of-view ultrasonography and compared using a 3 × 2 mixed-model MANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Results Parallel-depth heavy squat-lift training and JS-P elicited similar changes in mid-CSAQF as well as summed CSA of the QF, VL, VI, and VM. Cross-sectional area of the VL (CSAVL) and CSAVI increased in both HS-P and JS-P at mid-thigh, but only JS-P significantly increased CSA proximally, and only HS-P significantly increased CSA distally. Cross-sectional area of the VM (CSAVM) increased in HS-P and JS-P distally, but only HS-P increased at mid-thigh. No hypertrophy was observed in RF at any location and no significant differences were observed between JS-P and JS-V. Parallel-depth heavy squat-lift training elicited greater proximal hypertrophy in each of the vasti muscles, whereas only JS-P elicited distal VL and VI hypertrophy. Conclusions These observed inhomogeneous changes in CSA may alter the thigh 2 ̆ 7 s moment of inertia and moment arms of muscle 2 ̆ 2 compartments, 2 ̆ 2 and the influence of elastic component force transmission on the muscular force expression. Such selective hypertrophy is speculated to be biomechanically beneficial to high-force or high-power movements used in training...|$|R
50|$|The tensor <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> muscle tenses on the {{aponeurosis}} of the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> {{and also}} medialises {{the action of}} the muscle. It also acts as a second tensor in addition to the tensor fasciae latae.|$|E
50|$|The tensor <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> muscle {{originates}} {{from the}} proximal part of femur specifically from the anterior {{part of the}} greater trochanter. The muscle lies anterior to the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> but deep to the rectus femoris.The tendinous part of the muscle is closely related to, and sometimes fuses with, the aponeurosis of the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius.</b> Distally, it joins the quadriceps tendon and inserts to the medial aspect of the patella. It is supplied by the femoral nerve and the lateral circumflex femoral artery.|$|E
50|$|In addition, recent cadaver {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a sixth muscle, the tensor <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius.</b> While the muscle has variable presentations, it consistently originates at the proximal femur, runs between the vastus lateralis and <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> muscles, and inserts distally at the medial aspect of the patellar base. Historically considered a part of the vastus lateralis, the tensor <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> muscle is innervated by an independent branch of the femoral nerve and its tendinous belly can be separated from the vasti lateralis and intermedius muscles in most cases.|$|E

Muscle {{hypertrophy}} and serum hormone concentrations during combined {{strength and}} endurance training vs. strength or endurance training only in middle aged and older women. University of Jyväskylä, Department of Biology of Physical Activity. Master’s thesis in Science of Sport Coaching and Fitness Testing. 70 pp. Purpose: The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to compare the effects of strength training only (2 x week), endurance training only (2 x week), and combined training (2 + 2 x week) on muscle hypertrophy and serum hormone concentrations in middle-aged and older women during 21 weeks of training. Methods: 96 healthy, moderately active middle-aged and older women were assigned to three training groups and a control group; 1) Strength training only (S, n = 27) 2 x week, program included dynamic exercises that activate a large amount of muscle bulk and increase energy metabolism. 2) Endurance training only (E, n = 26) 2 x week was performed by bicycle ergometer, heart rate levels of endurance training were determined by aerobic performance tests and monitored during training. 3) Combined {{strength and endurance}} training (SE, n = 25), performed both E and S sessions. 4) Control group (C, n = 18) was instructed to maintain their habitual physical activities which were monitored by training diaries. Lean mass (LM) of the legs and arms was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and muscle thickness of several muscles by ultrasound at weeks 0, 10, and 21. Serum basal hormone concentrations of several anabolic hormones were measured at weeks - 1, 0, 10, and 21. Results: The S and SE groups showed significant increases in LM in both arms and legs (S 1. 6 %, 1. 4 %, SE 2. 1 %, 4. 0 % respectively). All training groups showed significant increases (p< 0. 05, p< 0. 001) in LM legs, but only the S and SE groups showed increases in arms LM. S and SE groups showed the largest increases in muscle thickness in all muscles measured, with the SE group having the largest gains in the legs (<b>vastus</b> lateralis +vastus <b>intermedius)</b> 11. 5 %, biceps femoris long 8. 3 %) while the S group had the largest increases in arms (triceps brachii 10. 0 %, biceps brachii 7. 1 %). All training groups exhibited significant increases in serum testosterone (p< 0. 05, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Combined strength and endurance training by cycling may be more effective than strength training alone for increasing muscle hypertrophy whether being measured by DEXA or ultrasound in middle aged and older women...|$|R
40|$|The author {{investigated}} 125 lower {{limbs of}} 69 Japanese cadavers from his dissecting room, and obtained the following results. 1. Definition of the perforating arteries and the medial perforating branches. As generally accepted, only those arteries, that perforate the adductors {{close to the}} linea aspera, are called perforating arteries. Such arteries, as those piercing the adductor maguns far from the femur, are provisionally called "medial perforating branches". The first perforating artery (Ⅰ) appears backwards from between the adductor minimus and {{the main part of}} the adductor magnus. The second perforating artery (Ⅱ) perforates {{the main part of the}} adductor magnus above or at the proximal third of the origin of the short head of the biceps. The third perforating arteries (Ⅲ) perforate the adductor magnus at the height of the middle and the distal thirds of the biceps origin. In some cases, a twig whose course and distribution are the same as those of the third perforating arteries arises from the distal part of the femoral artery or from the popliteal artery. Such are also included in the third perforating arteries. "Superior medial perforating branch" arises from the first perforating artery, the profunda femoris artery or the medial circumflex artery, pierces the adductor magnus and appears at the upper medial part of its posterior surface. Generally it occurs as one twig. "Inferior medial perforating branches" arise from the muscular branches to the adductor magnus and appears backwards at the lower part of the muscle, as one to three twigs. (Table 9). 2. The total number of perforating arteries (Tables 1, 2 and 3). They arise from the profunda femoris as 2 - 6 branches, in most of the cases as 3 - 5 (average 4. 02). As they sometimes divide into 2 or 3 branches before they pass through the adductors, the number of branches, piercing the adductor magnus, is more than the former: 2 - 7, in most of the cases 4 or 5 (average 4. 66). Furthermore, if the perforating arteries of the femoral and popliteal origins are included, the average number of the arteries, passing through the adductor magnus, is 4. 85. 3. The number of each perforating artery (Tables 5 and 6). I is generally single, rather rarely two (30 limbs, 24. 0 %) or three (3 limbs, 2. 4 %) in number. The supernumerary first perforating arteries are its ascending branches, that pierce the muscle separately. Ⅱ also is generally single, rather rarely two or three (17. 6 %). Whereas, Ⅲ is generally two or three in number. In one case Ⅲ was missing. 4. The origin and branching of the perforating arteries are presented in Fig. 2. In the majority of the cases, the first and the second branches become Ⅰ and Ⅱ respectively, and Ⅲ are derived from the third branch and on (Type Ⅰ, 72. 0 %). Besides, the type Ⅱ (15. 2 %), in which the first branch divides into Ⅰ and Ⅱ, and type Ⅲ (12. 0 %), in which Ⅱ are derived from the first and second branches, are not rarely found. 5. Generally, Ⅰ and Ⅱ pierce the adductor brevis and the adductor magnus, while Ⅲ the latter muscle only. (Table 4). 6. Distribution of the perforating arteries and the "medial perforating branches". (Table 7 and Fig. 4). Generally the ascending branch of Ⅰ is distributed to the lower part of the gluteus maximus and its neighbourhood, the descending branch (the main branch), as the principal source of the arterial supply of the hamstring muscles, supply the long head of the biceps, the semitendinosus, the semimembranosus and the sciatic nerve, and Ⅱ and Ⅲ supply the short head of the biceps and the <b>vastus</b> lateralis and <b>intermedius.</b> The "superior medial perforating branch" enters the proximal part of the semimembranosus, and the "inferior medial perforating branches" supply chiefly the belly of the semimembranosus. 7. Besides the perforating arteries and the medial perforating branches, the hamstring muscles are supplied by some twigs : the transverse branch of the medial circumflex artery supplies the proximal part of the semitendinosus and the long head, and some twigs from the distal part of the femoral and from the popliteal arteries supply the distal part of the hamstring muscles. 8. Arterial pattern of the back of the thigh (Table 12, Figs 4, 5, 6) The lower part of the gluteus maximus receives branches from Ⅰ (100 %), the <b>vastus</b> lateralis and <b>intermedius</b> from Ⅱ (95. 2 %) and Ⅲ (85. 6 %), the short head of the biceps from Ⅱ (57. 6 %) and Ⅲ (99. 2 %), and the sciatic nerve from Ⅰ (82. 4 %), each with little variations. On the other hand, the arteries to the belly of the long head the semitendinosus and the semimembranosus are fairly variable. Normally, their main source is the descending branch of Ⅰ, and the inferior medial perforating branches (M) and sometimes Ⅱ, rarely Ⅲ as well, supply only a small part. But not rarely the descending branch is small or missing and substituted by M or Ⅱ. In this respect various arterial patterns of the back of the thigh are classified into five types: two types with developed Ⅰ, normal type (74 limbs, 59. 2 %) and paranormal type (19 limbs, 15. 2 %), type with developed M (14 limbs, 11. 2 %), type with developed Ⅱ (8 limbs, 6. 4 %) and mixed type (10 limbs, 8. 0 %) ...|$|R
50|$|This {{muscle is}} {{categorised}} into five types according to morphology: the independent type, VI-type, VL-type, common type and two-belly type. The independent type of the tensor <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius,</b> {{also the most}} frequent type, has its tendon lying between the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> and the vastus lateralis. For the VI-type and the VL-type, the tendinous part of the muscle is integrated into the fascia of the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> and the vastus lateralis respectively. For the common type, it has a non-separable origin between the intertrochanteric line and greater trochanter. Two separate muscle bellies can be found for the two-belly types.|$|E
5000|$|A third {{branch is}} derived from the nerve to the <b>Vastus</b> <b>intermedius.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{distinct}} from the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius,</b> but occasionally blended with it.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Muscles {{of lower}} thigh. (Rectus femoris removed {{to reveal the}} <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Anterior {{compartment}} {{muscles of}} the thigh include pectineus, sartorius, and the four muscles that comprise the quadriceps muscles- rectus femoris, vastus medialis, <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> and vastus lateralis.|$|E
5000|$|Quadriceps femoris: {{has four}} heads {{which include the}} rectus femoris (originates from ilium, inserts into base and cranial of patella), vastus {{medialis}} (originates on medial side of femur, inserts into medial side of patella), <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> (originates from cranial side of femur, inserts into medial side of patella), and vastus lateralis (originates on lateral side of femur, inserts on lateral and cranial side of patella). These four muscles extend the femoropatellar joint (stifle joint). Additionally, the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> raises the femoropatellar capsule, and the rectus femoris flexes the hip.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} compartment of thigh contains the sartorius muscle {{and the four}} quadriceps: the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> and vastus medialis, along with the articularis genus. They are supplied by the femoral nerve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> {{lies between}} vastus lateralis and vastus {{medialis}} {{on the front}} of the femur (i.e. on the top or front of the thigh), but deep to the rectus femoris. Typically, it cannot be seen without dissection of the rectus femoris.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the upper}} three-fourths of this surface the <b>Vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> arises; the lower fourth is {{separated}} from the muscle by {{the intervention of the}} synovial membrane of the knee-joint and a bursa; from the upper part of it the Articularis genus takes origin.|$|E
5000|$|The lateral surface {{includes}} the portion between the lateral border and the linea aspera; it is continuous above with the corresponding {{surface of the}} greater trochanter, below {{with that of the}} lateral condyle: from its upper three-fourths the <b>Vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> takes origin.|$|E
5000|$|The rectus femoris muscle (...) {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{quadriceps}} muscles of the human body. The others are the vastus medialis, the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> (deep to the rectus femoris), and the vastus lateralis. All four parts of the quadriceps muscle attach to the patella (knee cap) via the quadriceps tendon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> {{arises from}} the front and lateral {{surfaces}} {{of the body of}} the femur in its upper two-thirds, sitting under the rectus femoris muscle and from {{the lower part of the}} lateral intermuscular septum. Its fibers end in a superficial aponeurosis, which forms the deep part of the quadriceps femoris tendon.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, the rectus femoris is not {{dominant}} in knee extension when the hip is flexed {{since it is}} already shortened and thus suffers from active insufficiency. In essence: the action of extending the knee from a seated position is primarily driven by the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius,</b> and less by the rectus femoris.|$|E
5000|$|The {{branches}} to the <b>Vastus</b> <b>intermedius,</b> {{two or three}} in number, enter the anterior surface of the muscle about {{the middle of the}} thigh; a filament from one of these descends through the muscle to the Articularis genus and the knee-joint. The articular branch to the hip-joint is derived from the nerve to the Rectus femoris.|$|E
50|$|The {{front and}} back {{surfaces}} are joined by a thin margin and towards centre by a thicker margin. The tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle attaches {{to the base of}} the patella., with the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> muscle attaching to the base itself, and the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis are attached to outer lateral and medial borders of patella respectively.|$|E
50|$|The vastus {{medialis}} and <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> {{appear to}} be inseparably united, but when the rectus femoris has been reflected a narrow interval will be observed extending upward from the medial border of the patella between the two muscles, and the separation may be continued {{as far as the}} lower part of the intertrochanteric line, where, however, the two muscles are frequently continuous.|$|E
50|$|Vasti (plural of vastus) are {{the three}} {{separate}} skeletal muscles located in the thigh. The three muscles; <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius,</b> lateralis and medialis {{are located in the}} middle, on the outside and inside of the thigh, respectively. Together with the rectus femoris muscle the vastus muscles form the quadriceps femoris muscle, a large fleshy mass which covers the front and sides of the femur.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} compartment {{is one of}} the fascial compartments of the thigh that contains groups of muscles together with their nerves and blood supply. The {{anterior compartment}} contains the sartorius muscle (the longest muscle in the body) and the quadriceps femoris group, which consists of the rectus femoris muscle and the three vasti muscles - the vastus lateralis, <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius,</b> and the vastus medialis.|$|E
50|$|In human anatomy, the {{quadriceps}} tendon {{allows the}} quadriceps femoris muscles (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius)</b> to converge on the superior {{aspects of the}} patella on the anterior of the thigh, which continues as the patellar ligament. A tendon connects muscle to bone, while a ligament connects bone to bone. The quadriceps tendon works with the quadriceps to extend the leg.|$|E
5000|$|The vastus {{medialis}} is {{a muscle}} {{present in the}} anterior compartment of thigh, {{and is one of}} the four muscles that make up the quadriceps muscle. The others are the vastus lateralis, <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> and rectus femoris. It is the most medial of the [...] "vastus" [...] group of muscles. The vastus medialis arises medially along the entire length of the femur, and attaches with the other muscles of the quadriceps in the quadriceps tendon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transverse}} {{branch of}} lateral circumflex femoral artery {{is a small}} artery in the thigh. It is the smallest branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery and passes lateralward over the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius,</b> pierces the vastus lateralis, and winds around the femur, just below the greater trochanter, anastomosing {{on the back of}} the thigh with the medial femoral circumflex artery, the inferior gluteal artery, and the perforating arteries of the profunda femoris artery.|$|E
50|$|It gives {{attachment}} to the patellar ligament, which attaches to the patella from where the suprapatellar ligament forms the distal tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscles. The quadriceps muscles consist of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius.</b> These quadriceps muscles are innervated by the femoral nerve. The tibial tuberosity thus forms the terminal part of the large structure {{that acts as a}} lever to extend the knee-joint and prevents the knee from collapsing when the foot strikes the ground. The two ligaments, the patella, and the tibial tuberosity are all superficial, easily palpable structures.|$|E
50|$|In {{strength}} training and fitness, the squat is a compound, full body exercise that trains primarily {{the muscles of}} the thighs, hips and buttocks, quadriceps femoris muscle (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius</b> and rectus femoris), hamstrings, as well as strengthening the bones, ligaments and insertion of the tendons throughout the lower body. Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the legs and buttocks, as well as developing core strength. Isometrically, the lower back, the upper back, the abdominals, the trunk muscles, the costal muscles, and the shoulders and arms are all essential to the exercise and thus are trained when squatting with the proper form.|$|E
50|$|The patella is a {{floating}} sesamoid bone {{held in place}} by the quadriceps muscle tendon and patellar tendon ligament. Exercises should strengthen quadriceps muscles such as rectus femoris, <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius,</b> and vastus lateralis. However, tight and strong lateral quadriceps can be an underlying cause of patellar dislocation. If this is the case, it is advisable to strengthen the medial quadriceps, vastus medialis (VMO), and stretch the lateral muscles. Exercises to strengthen quadriceps muscles include, but are not limited to, squats and lunges. Adding extra external support around the knee by using devices such as knee orthotics or athletic tape can help to prevent patellar dislocation and other knee-related injuries. External supports, such as knee braces and athletic tape, work by providing movement in only the desired planes and help hinder movements that can cause abnormal movement and injuries. Women who wear high heels tend to develop short calf muscles and tendons. Exercises to stretch and strengthen calf muscles are recommended on a daily basis.|$|E
50|$|Of the {{anterior}} thigh muscles the largest are the four {{muscles of the}} quadriceps femoris: the central rectus femoris, which is surrounded by the three vasti, the <b>vastus</b> <b>intermedius,</b> medialis, and lateralis. Rectus femoris {{is attached to the}} pelvis with two tendons, while the vasti are inserted to the femur. All four muscles unite in a common tendon inserted into the patella from where the patellar ligament extends it down to the tibial tuberosity. Fibers from the medial and lateral vasti form two retinacula that stretch past the patella on either sides down to the condyles of the tibia. The quadriceps is the knee extensor, but the rectus femoris additionally flexes the hip joint, and articular muscle of the knee protects the articular capsule of the knee joint from being nipped during extension. The sartorius runs superficially and obliquely down on {{the anterior}} side of the thigh, from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pes anserinus on the medial side of the knee, from where it is further extended into the crural fascia. The sartorius acts as a flexor on both the hip and knee, but, due to its oblique course, also contributes to medial rotation of the leg as one of the pes anserinus muscles (with the knee flexed), and to lateral rotation of the hip joint.|$|E
