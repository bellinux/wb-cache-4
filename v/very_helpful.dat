5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. The Clash asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and drug problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially bassist Paul Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to be <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded in one or two takes.|$|E

Shooting {{primarily}} took place in Toronto, because mayor David Miller is a Hulk fan and promised to be <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> to the crew when closing Yonge Street for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day. The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the University of Toronto and Morningside Park. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out. There was also shooting in the Financial District. A factory in Hamilton, Ontario, which was due for demolition, was {{the interior of the}} Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military command center. The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a backlot in Hamilton. Other Canadian locations included CFB Trenton and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia. Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in New York City and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro. While there, the crew shot at Rocinha, Lapa, Tijuca Forest and Santa Teresa. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.|$|E

Understanding mode conversion is <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> when trying to optimize the design of interconnects for gigabit data throughput.|$|E

25|$|In {{the best}} book on asthma of the 19th century, first {{published}} in 1860, the British physician and physiologist Henry Hyde Salter (1823–1871) included a chapter on treatment ″by stimulants″. Strong coffee was <b>very</b> <b>helpful,</b> presumably because it dispelled sleep, which favoured asthma. Even more impressive, however, was the response to ″strong mental emotion″: ″The cure of asthma by violent emotion is more sudden and complete than by any other remedy whatever; indeed, I know few things more striking and curious in {{the whole history of}} therapeutics. … The cure … takes no time; it is instantaneous, the intensest paroxysm ceases on the instant.″ ″Cure″ due to release of adrenaline from the adrenals is the retrospective interpretation.|$|E

In 1957 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, he took 15 for 89; against Leicestershire at Old Trafford in 1958 13 for 64; and at Cardiff that year he and Tattersall bowled Glamorgan out for 26.

25|$|Lucilia cuprina {{is often}} used as a <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> tool to aid medical and {{forensic}} professionals. It {{is known to be}} one of the first flies to occupy a corpse upon its death. Once it lands on a corpse, it continues in the formation of its next generation by laying its eggs. The eggs are followed by its larva, pupa and finally the adult. Forensic professionals may form a postmortem interval by the life stage found on the corpse. L. cuprina, although it is a worldwide pest, is very climate specific. It occupies dryer climates. A forensic investigator may conclude that a corpse has been relocated from its original location if it is found in a moist climate with L. cuprina on it.|$|E
