50|$|The {{group was}} {{originally}} composed of double bassist Werner Dafeldecker, cellist Michael Moser, trombonist Radu Malfatti and guitarist Burkhard Stangl. Their name {{came from a}} <b>voltage</b> <b>adapter</b> Dafeldecker and Moser found in a second-hand shop.|$|E
5000|$|A {{peripheral}} from Sinclair Research for its ZX Spectrum home computer, the ZX Interface 1 {{was launched}} in 1983. Originally intended as a local area network interface for use in school classrooms, it was revised before launch to also act as the controller for up to eight ZX Microdrive high-speed tape-loop cartridge drives. It also included a DE-9 RS-232 interface capable of operating at up to 19.2 kbit/s [...] - [...] a rare instance of Sinclair using an industry-standard connector. At hardware level it was mainly a <b>voltage</b> <b>adapter,</b> the serial protocol being implemented in software by bit-banging. This led to problems when receiving data, but not when transmitting.|$|E
2500|$|... {{very high}} <b>voltages</b> — <b>adapters</b> are {{available}} which form a voltage divider with the meter's internal resistance, allowing measurement into {{the thousands of}} volts. [...] However, very high voltages often have surprising behavior, aside from effects on the operator (perhaps fatal); high voltages which actually reach a meter's internal circuitry may internal damage parts, perhaps destroying the meter or permanently ruining its performance.|$|R
50|$|The Astro Wars game runs on six volts DC {{and can be}} {{powered by}} four 'C' type {{batteries}} or alternatively via a low <b>voltage</b> mains <b>adapter</b> (not supplied with the game). As the display is based on VFD technology, it allows bright, multicoloured in-game elements to be rendered but {{at the cost of}} a relatively small screen size. The VFD display is manufactured with the pre-formed, immutable in-game objects effectively fixed in place onto a dark background. Each element can be individually lit or unlit during play, giving the illusion of animation and movement. In-game objects cannot touch or superimpose on one another. The screen was slightly magnified to improve gameplay.|$|R
50|$|The meter {{is of the}} 12% (1/9) partial type {{with the}} {{metering}} area indicated by a slightly darkened box {{in the center of}} the finder area. It is fully coupled to shutter speed dial and aperture ring on FD lenses in the match needle style. The meter was designed to be powered by a single 1.35 volt 625-type mercury cell, specifically the Mallory PX-625 and the Eveready EPX-625. While these batteries are obsolete, modern replacements include the Wein zinc-air cell PX625, available at large online retailers. Alternative options for replacement are to use a 1.5 volt silver battery either through a <b>voltage</b> dropping <b>adapter</b> or recalibrating the meter. Using modern zinc air batteries provide the original voltage, but have a relatively short life.|$|R
50|$|Originally, most AC/DC {{adapters}} were linear power supplies, {{containing a}} transformer {{to convert the}} mains electricity voltage to a lower voltage, a rectifier to convert it to pulsating DC, and a filter to smooth the pulsating waveform to DC, with residual ripple variations small enough to leave the powered device unaffected. Size and weight of the device was largely determined by the transformer, which in turn {{was determined by the}} power output and mains frequency. Ratings over a few watts made the devices too large and heavy to be physically supported by a wall outlet. The output <b>voltage</b> of these <b>adapters</b> varied with load; for equipment requiring a more stable voltage, linear voltage regulator circuitry was added. Losses in the transformer and the linear regulator were considerable; efficiency was relatively low, and significant power dissipated as heat even when not driving a load.|$|R
40|$|The FAN 7528 is {{an active}} power factor {{correction}} (PFC) controller for boost PFC applications that operates in critical conduction mode (CRM). It uses voltage mode PWM that compares an internal ramp signal with the error amplifier output to generate MOSFET turn-off signal. Because the voltage mode CRM PFC controller does not need the rectified AC line voltage information, it can save the power loss of the input voltage sensing network necessary for the current mode CRM PFC controller. The FAN 7528 provides the dual-output voltage control function without the AC line <b>voltage</b> sensing for <b>adapter</b> applications. It changes the PFC output voltage according to the AC line voltage. It provides protection functions such as over-voltage protection, open-feedback protection, over-current protection, and under-voltage lockout protection. The FAN 7528 can be disabled if the INV pin voltage is lower than 0. 45 V and the operating current decreases to 65 µA. Using a new variable on-time control method, THD {{is lower than the}} conventional CRM boost PFC ICs...|$|R
