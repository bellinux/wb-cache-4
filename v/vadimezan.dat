50|$|Despite {{positive}} results at the preclinical stage, <b>vadimezan</b> failed in human clinical trials. Studies {{have demonstrated the}} reason for the inefficacy. <b>Vadimezan</b> was shown to target the STING pathway, however, this effect is mouse specific; it has no effect on human STING. A single amino acid difference at position 162 (S162A) of the cyclic-dinucleotide-binding site of STING makes mouse STING sensitive to the drug, whereas human STING remains insensitive.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Angiosarcomas are rare, {{aggressive}} vascular tumours {{known to}} express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key pro-angiogenic growth factor. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the potential effects of vascular-targeted agents for the treatment of angiosarcoma, using two human cutaneous angiosarcoma cell lines (ASM and ISO-HAS), and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HuDMECs) for comparison. Methods: Protein arrays were used to assess the expression of angiogenesis-related proteins, and potential drug targets were assessed by ELISA and Western blotting. Response to vascular-targeted agents, including bevacizumab an anti-VEGF antibody, axitinib a VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, everolimus an mTOR inhibitor, selumetinib a MEK inhibitor and <b>vadimezan</b> a vascular-disrupting agent were compared in functional in vitro cellular assays, including viability, differentiation and migration assays. Results: ASM and ISO-HAS cells expressed a broad range of pro-angiogenic growth factors. ASM and ISO-HAS VEGF expression was significantly increased (p = 0. 029) compared with HuDMECs. Striking responses were seen to <b>vadimezan</b> with an IC 50 of 90 and 150 μg/ml for ASM and ISO-HAS cells, respectively. Selumetinib inhibited ASM with an IC 50 of 1, 750 ng/ml, but was not effective in ISO-HAS. Everolimus reduced both ASM and ISO-HAS viable cell counts by 20 % (p < 0. 001). Minimal responses were observed to bevacizumab and axitinib in assays with ASM and ISO-HAS cells. Conclusions: Further studies are warranted to investigate mTOR inhibitors, MEK inhibitors and vascular-disrupting agents for the treatment of angiosarcoma. © 2013 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Background: Species {{selectivity}} of DMXAA (5, 6 -dimethylxanthenone- 4 -acetic acid, <b>Vadimezan)</b> for murine cells over {{human cells}} could explain {{in part the}} recent disappointing phase III trials clinical results when preclinical studies were so promising. To identify analogues with greater human clinical potential, we compared the activity of xanthenone- 4 -acetic acid (XAA) analogues in murine or human cellular models. Methods: Analogues with a methyl group systematically substituted at different positions of the XAA backbone were evaluated for cytokine induction in cultured murine or human leukocytes; and for anti-vascular effects on endothelial cells on matrigel. In vivo antitumour activity and cytokine production by stromal or cancer cells was measured in human A 375 and HCT 116 xenografts. Results: Mono-methyl XAA analogues with substitutions at the seventh and eighth positions were the most active in stimulating human leukocytes to produce IL- 6 and IL- 8; and for inhibition of tube formation by ECV 304 human endothelial-like cells, while 5 - and 6 -substituted analogues were the most active in murine cell systems. Conclusion: Xanthenone- 4 -acetic acid analogues exhibit extreme species selectivity. Analogues that are the most active in human systems are inactive in murine models, highlighting {{the need for the}} use of appropriate in vivo animal models in selecting clinical candidates for this class of compounds.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} 18 F-fluromisonidazole (18 F-FMISO) PET for monitoring the tumor response to the antivascular compound 5, 6 -dimethylxanthenone- 4 -acetic acid (DMXAA; <b>vadimezan).</b> Methods— 18 F-FMISO PET was performed 3 h before and 24 h after treatment with DMXAA (20 mg/kg) in mice bearing HT 29 xenograft tumors. Pimonidazole was coadministered with the first 18 F-FMISO injection, and 2 -(2 -nitro- 1 H-imidazol- 1 -yl) -N-(2, 2, 3, 3, 3 -pentafluoropropyl) acetamide (EF 5) was coadministered with the second one. Hoechst 33342 was administered 5 min before sacrifice. Digital autoradiograms of tumor sections were acquired; this acquisition was followed by immunofluorescence microscopic visualization of pimonidazole, EF 5, the Hoechst 33342, CD 31, and α-smooth muscle actin. Results—DMXAA treatment resulted in a marked reduction in the 18 F-FMISO mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) in approximately half of the treated tumors. The reduction in SUVmean correlated with a decrease in the fraction of tumor area staining positive for both EF 5 and pimonidazole.

40|$|Background: Successful {{immunotherapy}} {{will require}} alteration of the tumour microenvironment and/or decreased immune suppression. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are one major factor affecting tumour microenvironment. We hypothesised that altering TAM phenotype would augment {{the efficacy of}} immunotherapy. Methods: We and others have reported that 5, 6 -Dimethylxanthenone- 4 -acetic-acid (DMXAA, <b>Vadimezan)</b> {{has the ability to}} change TAM phenotypes, inducing a tumour microenvironment conducive to antitumour immune responses. We therefore combined DMXAA with active immunotherapies, and evaluated anti-tumour efficacy, immune cell phenotypes (flow cytometry), and tumour microenvironment (RT–PCR). Results: In several different murine models of immunotherapy for lung cancer, DMXAA-induced macrophage activation significantly augmented the therapeutic effects of immunotherapy. By increasing influx of neutrophils and anti-tumour (M 1) macrophages to the tumour, DMXAA altered myeloid cell phenotypes, thus changing the intratumoural M 2 /non-M 2 TAM immunoinhibitory ratio. It also altered the tumour microenvironment to be more pro-inflammatory. Modulating macrophages during immunotherapy resulted in increased numbers, activity, and antigen-specificity of intratumoural CD 8 þ T cells. Macrophage depletion reduced the effect of combining immunotherapy with macrophage activation, supporting the importance of TAMs in the combined effect. Conclusion: Modulating intratumoural macrophages dramatically augmented the effect of immunotherapy. Our observation...|$|E
40|$|High {{intravenous}} {{doses of}} vitamin C (ascorbic acid) {{have been reported}} to benefit cancer patients but the data are controversial and there is incomplete knowledge of what physiological mechanisms might be involved in any response. Vitamin C is taken up efficiently by cells expressing SVCT 2 transporters and since vascular endothelial cells express SVCT 2, we explored the hypothesis that administration of high dose vitamin C (up to 5 g/kg) to mice might affect vascular endothelial function. A single administration of vitamin C to mice induced time- and dose-dependent increases in plasma concentrations of the serotonin metabolite 5 -hydroxyindole acetic acid (5 -HIAA), a marker for vascular disrupting effects. Responses were comparable to those for the tumor vascular disrupting agents <b>vadimezan</b> and fosbretabulin. High-dose vitamin C administration decreased tumor serotonin concentrations, consistent with the release of serotonin from platelets and its metabolism to 5 -HIAA. High-dose vitamin C also significantly increased the degree of hemorrhagic necrosis in tumors removed after 24 hours, and significantly decreased tumor volume after 2 days. However, the effect on tumor growth was temporary. The results support the concept that vitamin C at high dose increases endothelial permeability, allowing platelets to escape and release serotonin. Plasma 5 -HIAA concentrations could provide a pharmacodynamic biomarker for vitamin C effects in clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the most}} {{important}} biological characteristics of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is high vascular density. <b>Vadimezan</b> (ASA 404, DMXAA) belongs to the class of small molecule vascular disrupting agents (VDA) that cause disruption of established tumor vessels and subsequent tumor hemorrhagic necrosis. Its selective antivascular effect is mediated by intratumoral induction of several cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α (MIP- 1 α). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that ASA 404 acts synergistically with taxanes. In this study, we investigated if treatment of mice bearing U 251 human glioblastoma xenografts with ASA 404 and taxol may be synergistic. Therapy response was evaluated by measuring changes in tumor size and metabolic activity using 18 F-FDG PET (Fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emision tomography) imaging. Methods U 251 cells were inoculated s. c. in the right hind limb of NMRI-Foxn 1 nu athymic female nude mice. Animals were randomly assigned into 4 groups (7 – 9 animals/group) for treatment: control, taxol, ASA 404, and ASA 404 plus taxol. The animals received either a single dose of taxol (10 [*]mg/kg), ASA 404 (27. 5 [*]mg/kg), or taxol (10 [*]mg/kg) plus ASA 404 (27. 5 [*]mg/kg) administered i. p.; ASA 404 was administred 24 [*]h after the treatment with taxol. 4 and 24 [*]h after treatment with ASA 404 (28 and 48 [*]h hours after treatment with taxol) 18 [*]F-FDG PET scans were performed. Results The treatment with taxol did not affect the tumor growth in comparison to untreated controls. The treatment of animals with single dose ASA 404 alone or in combination with taxol caused a significant delay in tumor growth. The combined treatment did not decrease the growth of the xenografts significantly more than ASA 404 alone, but early changes in tumor 18 [*]F-FDG uptake preceded subsequent growth inhibition. The tumor weights, which were determined at the end of treatment, were lower in case of combined treatment. Conclusions The treatment with ASA 404 alone or in combination with taxol showed antitumoral effects in our glioblastoma model probably through destruction of blood vessels. The implications for the anticancer effect of this compound warrant further preclinical studies. 18 F-FDG PET appears to be a promising tool to monitor treatment with ASA 404 early in the course of therapy. </p...|$|E

However, the latest Phase III clinical trial has shown frustrating outcomes in the treatment of NSCLC, since the therapeutic targets and underlying mechanism for the anticancer effect of DMXAA are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to examine the proteomic response to DMXAA and unveil the global molecular targets and possible mechanisms for the anticancer effect of DMXAA in NSCLC A 549 cells using a stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) approach. The proteomic data showed that treatment with DMXAA modulated the expression of 588 protein molecules in A 549 cells, with 281 protein molecules being up regulated and 306 protein molecules being downregulated. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) identified 256 signaling pathways and 184 cellular functional proteins that were regulated by DMXAA in A 549 cells. These targeted molecules and signaling pathways were mostly involved in cell proliferation and survival, redox homeostasis, sugar, amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism, cell migration, and invasion and programed cell death. Subsequently, the effects of DMXAA on cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, autophagy, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were experimentally verified. Flow cytometric analysis showed that DMXAA significantly induced G 1 phase arrest in A 549 cells. Western blotting assays demonstrated that DMXAA induced apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway and promoted autophagy, as indicated by the increased level of cytosolic cytochrome c, activation of caspase 3, and enhanced expression of beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 A/ 1 B-light chain 3 (LC 3 -II) in A 549 cells. Moreover, DMXAA significantly promoted intracellular ROS generation in A 549 cells. Collectively, this SILAC study quantitatively evaluates the proteomic response to treatment with DMXAA that helps to globally identify the potential molecular targets and elucidate the underlying mechanism of DMXAA in the treatment of NSCLC.
