In ATM networks, image quality remains almost the same by encoding a video signal at <b>variable</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> (<b>VBRs).</b> Moving picture experts group (MPEG) video consists of three different frames: intra (I), predictive (P), and bidirectional (B). The important feature of VBR MPEG video traffic is the long-range dependence (LRD) characteristic. To examine the LRD characteristic of real MPEG video sequences, the Hurst parameter is employed. This paper presents a wavelet method, a line length method, and a Fourier filtering method for Hurst parameter estimation and compares their performance of LRD analysis with various video data. The relationship between the Hurst parameter and parameters in fractal modeling is also investigated...|$|R

A good characterization of VBR sources allows the implementation of efficient Connection Admission Control (CAC) and Police functions. In this study we show that the Gamma Distribution is a good tool for modeling the aggregate traffic of homogeneous as well as heterogeneous VBR MPEG sources. Therefore, we propose to characterize the VBR video traffic {{by the use of}} simple descriptors based on the Gamma modeling of the sources: the mean rate and variance. We show that the proposed descriptors allow the implementation of an efficient video CAC function (offering probabilistic performance guarantees) that agrees well with simulation results.

40|$|The B-ISDN {{will carry}} {{a variety of}} traffic types: the <b>Variable</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate</b> traffic (<b>VBR),</b> of which {{compressed}} video is an example, Continuous <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate</b> traffic (CBR), of which telemetry is an example, Data traffic, and Available <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate</b> traffic (ABR) that represents aggregate data traffic with very limited guarantees on quality. Of these, VBR and CBR have timing constraints and need synchronous bandwidth; data traffic is relatively delay insensitive. In this paper, we consider the VBR, Data and ABR traffic types and obtain the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the queueing delay experienced by a burst of ABR traffic in the output buffer of an ATM switch. The cdf is used to trade off buffer loss probabilities against deadline violation probabilities through adjusting the buffer size and (delay) deadline values.

40|$|Abstract — Currently, {{there are}} many local area {{industrial}} networks that can give guaranteed bandwidth to synchronous traffic, particularly providing CBR channels (Constant <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate),</b> which allow improved bandwidth management. Some of such networks operate over Ethernet, delivering channels with enough capacity, specially with compressors, to integrate multimedia traffic in industrial monitoring and image processing applications with many sources. In these industrial environments where a low latency is an essential requirement, JPEG is an adequate compressing technique but it generates <b>VBR</b> traffic (<b>Variable</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate).</b> Transmitting <b>VBR</b> traffic in CBR channels is inefficient and current solutions to this problem significantly increase the latency or further degrade the quality. In this paper an R(q) model is used which allows on-line calculation of the JPEG quantification factor. We obtained increased quality, a lower requirement for the CBR channel with reduced number of discarded frames along with better use of the channel bandwidth.

30|$|The HCCA {{mechanism}} {{was proposed}} in the IEEE 802.11 e amendment [1] to improve the PCF scheme. It {{is based on a}} round-robin scheme and it is intended to guarantee bounded delay requirements. Like the PCF scheme, the PC also polls all the stations in the polling list, even though some stations may not have messages to transmit. When the PC polls a station that has no packets to transfer, the station will transmit a null frame. As a consequence, the polling overhead is roughly equal to the time interval from sending the polling frame till the end of the ACK frame [26]. A number of improvements have been recently proposed to reduce the HCCA polling overhead. For instance, Gao et al. [27] proposed a new admission control framework to replace the traditional CSMA mechanism. It uses the mean data rate and the mean packet-size values to calculate the resource needed by each message flow. Thus, this new mechanism is particularly adequate when dealing with <b>variable</b> resource <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>VBR)</b> traffic over HCCA.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{bandwidth}} allocation {{plays an}} important role in integrated services networks. Effective bandwidth management can improve the overall performance of the network significantly. In integrated services networks, different types of traffic coexist. To serve these different types of traffic satisfactorily, hybrid switching is commonly used. Hybrid switching is an integration of circuit switching and packet switching in the same network. In this thesis, dynamic bandwidth allocation is studied to provide satisfactory hybrid switching performance. Specifically, we will study how to allocate bandwidths for continuous <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> (CBR) traffic served by circuit switching and <b>variable</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> traffic (<b>VBR)</b> served by packet switching. The performance measure is based on the blocking probability of CBR traffic and the time delay of VBR traffic. Therefore, the objective of the dynamic bandwidth allocation is to maintain balance between blocking probability and delay under various traffic conditions. To accomplish this, the dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithms consists of traffic intensity estimation, traffic performance prediction, and performance optimization. A simulation is written to demonstrate the algorithm for various traffic scenarios...|$|R

5000|$|After {{the control}} word comes the TDMoIP payload. For structure-agnostic {{transport}} (SAToP) {{this is simply}} a predetermined number of TDM octets, while for the structure-locked format the payload is an integer number of TDM frames. For structure-indication and structure-reassembly TDMoIP draws on proven adaptation mechanisms originally developed for ATM. A side benefit of this choice of payload types is simplified interworking with circuit emulation services carried over ATM networks. For statically allocated, constant bit-rate (CBR) TDM links, TDMoIP employs ATM adaptation layer 1 (AAL1). This mechanism, defined in ITU-T standard I.363.1 and ATM Forum specification atm-vtoa-0078, was developed for carrying CBR services over ATM. AAL1 operates by segmenting the continuous stream of TDM data into small 48-byte cells and inserting sequencing, timing, error recovery, and synchronization information into them. TDMoIP allows concatenation of any number of AAL1 cells into a packet (note that these are AAL1 cells and not ATM cells, i.e. they {{do not include the}} five-byte [...] "cell tax"). By allowing multiple cells per packet, TDMoIP facilitates flexible tradeoffs of buffering delay (which decreases with fewer cells per packet) for bandwidth efficiency (which increases with more cells per packet, due to the per packet overhead). For dynamically allocated TDM links, whether the information rate varies due to activation of time slots or due to voice activity detection, TDMoIP employs ATM adaptation layer 2 (AAL2). This mechanism, defined in ITU-T standard I.363.2, was developed for carrying <b>variable</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>VBR)</b> services over ATM. AAL2 operates by buffering each TDM time slot into short minicells, inserting the time slot identifier and length indication, sequencing, and then sending this minicell only if it carries valid information. TDMoIP concatenates the minicells from all active time slots into a single packet. For time slots carrying high-level data link control (HDLC) data, such as data for common channel signaling (CCS), TDMoIP has a special adaptation that encapsulates stretches of non-idle data.|$|E
