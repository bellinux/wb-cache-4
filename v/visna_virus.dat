40|$|Lentiviruses {{provide a}} {{suitable}} {{starting point for}} the generation of viral vectors for vaccination due to their ability to transduce non-dividing cells, including dendritic cells. This allows the delivery of antigens directly to antigen presenting cells to stimulate an immune response. The most well developed and characterised lentiviral vector is based on HIV- 1 which now incorporates safety features to minimise the effects of hazards such as insertional oncogenesis. These HIV- 1 vectors have been shown to mediate immunity against several pathogens including: Plasmodium falciparum, the Influenza Virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mouse models. Our group has applied the advances in the HIV- 1 system to the <b>visna</b> maedi <b>virus</b> in order to engineer vaccines suitable for sheep. The vaccines will initially be targeted against the sheep pathogens: Teladorsagia circumcinta and Louping Ill Virus; these pathogens have been chosen as current control strategies are insufficient. In this project, antigens previously identified to provide protective immunity, were inserted into the vector cassette of the <b>visna</b> maedi <b>virus</b> system. Expression of these antigens was then shown in a mammalian system by using plasmids to transfect cells in vitro. Vectors encoding these antigens were used to assay expression in cell culture after infection; however, significant expression of antigens was not induced by these vectors.

The compound was highly active against strains of adeno-, vaccinia, influenza B, paramyxo-, picorna-, and reoviruses, with 50 % inhibition of virus-induced cytopathology at 1 to 10 microM. Lesser or no antiviral effects were observed against herpes simplex, cytomegalo-, corona-, influenza A, vesicular stomatitis, and <b>visna</b> <b>viruses.</b> Drug potency against certain viruses was highly cell line dependent (N 10169 was highly active in HeLa cells but {{was much less}} potent in Vero cells). This was correlated, in part, to differences in levels of adenosine kinase activity in these cell lines, since adenosine kinase appears to phosphorylate N 10169 to its active form. N 10169 was inhibitory to proliferating cells at antiviral concentrations, whereas stationary-phase monolayers tolerated higher concentrations (less {{than or equal to}} 100 microM). Exogenous uridine was able to reverse the virus-inhibitory effects of the compound, leading to the discovery that N 10169 5 '-monophosphate is a potent inhibitor of cellular orotidylate decarboxylase. N 10169 was evaluated in mice that were infected intraperitoneally with banzi virus or inoculated intranasally with influenza B virus, and in hamsters that were infected intranasally with vaccinia virus.

50|$|<b>Visna</b> Maedi <b>virus</b> is a {{retrovirus}} meaning its genome {{consists of}} a (+)RNA that undergoes reverse transcription and then is integrated into the host's genome after infection. This integration is what leads to VMV's lifelong persistent infection. VMV has a long incubation period. During the initial outbreak among sheep in Iceland, {{there was no sign}} of clinical disease until six years after the importation of the Karakul sheep, which brought the virus from Germany to Iceland. Susceptibility to infection also increases with a higher level. VMV infects cells of the monocyte lineage, but only replicates at high levels when the monocytes are more mature/differentiated. of maturity/differentiation of the monocytes. Infected differentiated monocytes, also known as macrophages, will continuously present VMV antigens inducing T-lymphocytes to produce cytokines that in turn induce the differentiation of monocytes.|$|R

Lentiviruses are a complex type of retroviruses, and include the human immunodeficiency viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2.

She performed similar work with caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), a closely related virus of goats.|$|E
5000|$|The viral LTRs are {{essential}} for viral transcription. [...] The LTRs include a TATA box at the -20 position and a recognition site for the AP-4 transcription factor at the -60 position. [...] There are several AP-1 transcription factor binding sites in the viral LTRs. The closest AP-1 binding site is bound by the Jun and Fos proteins to activate transcription. [...] A duplicated motif in the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> LTR is associated with cell tropism and neurovirulence.|$|E
5000|$|The visna {{viral genome}} encodes three {{structural}} genes characteristic of retroviruses, gag (group specific antigen), pol (polymerase), and env (envelope protein).

A rev response element (RRE) exists inside the env gene. An auxiliary gene, vif (viral infectivity factor), is also encoded.

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that French small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) from sheep are {{more similar to}} Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) than to <b>visna</b> maedi <b>virus</b> (VMV) in a conserved region of the pol gene. To extend these results, we have examined sequences from a variable region of the env gene in French SRLV. We found that they were nearly equally distant from both CAEV and VMV strains, suggesting a considerable divergence since the initial introduction of the virus. Analysis of separate clones from individual animals showed that some carry a population of variant viruses. The study of further pol gene sequences from both goats and sheep suggests that viral variants show little or no host species specificity.

50|$|<b>Visna</b> Maedi <b>virus</b> (VMV) {{belongs to}} the small {{ruminant}} lentivirus group (SRLV). In general, SRLVs enter the cell through the interaction of their glycosylated envelope protein with a cellular receptor on the cell's plasma membrane facilitating fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. However, the specific cellular receptor that VMV binds is not entirely certain. A few studies have proposed MHC class II, CD4 and CXCR4 proteins as possible receptors however, none of these proteins have been established as the main receptor. Another study suggests that C-type lectins part of the mannose receptor (MR) family play a role as an alternative SRLV receptor. The mannose receptor is a 180-kDa transmembrane protein with eight tandem C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of which CRD4 and CRD5 are essential in recognizing mannose, fucose and N-acetyl glucosamine residues. Studies suggest that VMV gains entrance to the cell via mannosylated residues on its envelope proteins. MR is involved in recognizing the surface of pathogens and is involved in phago- and endocytosis and mediating antigen processing and presentation {{in a variety of}} cells including monocyte/macrophages and endothelial cells.|$|R
40|$|The p 2 {{region of}} the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Gag polyprotein {{contains}} an assembly domain, which is required late in replication for efficient budding of virus-like particles from cells (J. W. Wills, C. E. Cameron, C. B. Wilson, Y. Xiang, R. P. Bennett, and J. Leis, J. Virol. 68 : 6605 - 6618, 1994). This domain, {{referred to as the}} L domain, was previously mapped to the 11 amino acids of p 2 b. Through the analysis of a series of deletion and substitution mutations, the L domain has now been fine mapped to a highly conserved amino acid sequence, PPPPYV of p 2 b. Sequences flanking PPPPYV motif can be deleted without any effect on budding. Defects caused by L-domain deletions can be rescued by placing a wild-type copy of the sequence at several other positions in RSV Gag. A proline-rich P(S/T) APP motif is found in many retroviral Gag polyproteins; the motif found in the p 6 region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has been implicated in late functions of the virus. Substitution of the RSV L domain with this motif in a 10 -amino-acid sequence derived from <b>visna</b> leukemia <b>virus</b> results in wild-type release of virus particles from cells. In contrast, the slightly different sequences from Gibbon ape leukemia virus, Moloney leukemia virus, PSAPP alone, or a proline-rich SH 3 binding sequence do not efficiently rescue RSV L-domain mutations...|$|R
50|$|Antigenic {{shift is}} {{the process by which}} two or more {{different}} strains of a virus, or strains of two or more different viruses, combine to form a new subtype having a mixture of the surface antigens of the two or more original strains. The term is often applied specifically to influenza, as that is the best-known example, but the process is also known to occur with other viruses, such as <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> in sheep.

50|$|This {{reasoning}} ignores {{numerous examples}} of viruses other than HIV {{that can be}} pathogenic after evidence of immunity appears.

In other animals, viral relatives of HIV with long and variable latency periods, such as <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> in sheep, cause central nervous system damage even after the production of antibodies.|$|E
50|$|With the {{discovery}} of AIDS and its cause, HIV, Clements' work took on a new dimension of relevance. In 1985, she published an article with HIV co-discoverer Robert Gallo and others describing the relationship of HIV to <b>visna</b> <b>virus.</b> This article helped to establish HIV as a lentivirus, not a leukemia virus as was originally thought. At the time, the origin of HIV was unknown, and Clements' work presented the possibility that HIV could have been transferred to humans from animals.

5000|$|Jakob Segal (1911-1995), a {{professor}} at Humboldt University in then-East Germany, proposed that HIV was engineered at a U.S. military laboratory at Fort Detrick, by splicing together two other <b>viruses,</b> <b>Visna</b> and HTLV-1. According to his theory, the new virus, created between 1977 and 1978, was tested on prison inmates who had volunteered for the experiment in exchange for early release. He further suggested that it was through these prisoners that the virus was spread to the population at large. At {{the end of the}} Cold War, former KGB agents Vasili Mitrokhin and Oleg Gordievsky independently revealed that the Fort Detrick hypothesis was a propaganda operation devised by the KGB's First Chief Directorate codenamed [...] "Operation INFEKTION". This revelation was later supported by officer Günther Bohnensack of section X of East Germany's Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung. It is known that Segal was in close contact with Russian KGB officers and Mitrokhin mentioned him as a central asset of the operation. It is not entirely clear whether Segal pursued the hypothesis independently on his own accord or whether he was simply following orders. Segal himself always denied the latter and kept pursuing the hypothesis even after the operation had been canceled and the Cold War had ended.|$|R
40|$|Lentiviruses {{are unique}} retroviruses which cause {{diseases}} with long incubation periods and prolonged clinical courses. The prototype lentiviruses, visna/maedi of sheep and arthritis-encephalitis virus of goats (CAEV), infect {{cells of the}} monocyte-macrophage system and replicate at a restricted level in these cells. The virus life cycle is closely associated with maturational factors in the cells; monocytes support {{the early stages of}} the replication cycle which goes to completion only when the cells mature to macrophages. Virus replication in the monocyte-macrophage results in lesions characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS), lungs, synovium and mammary gland and their draining lymph nodes. Co-cultivation of sheep or goat lymphocytes with macrophages infected with <b>visna</b> or CAE <b>viruses</b> results in production of a unique interferon (LV-IFN). LV-IFN is a non-glycosylated protein of 54, 000 to 64, 000 daltons and has biological properties which have several implications for pathogenesis. Firstly, it retards the rate of maturation of monocytes and thus indirectly slows the rate of virus replication. Second, it restricts the rate of virus replication in mature macrophages by preventing virus maturation. Third, it induces expression of class II (Ia) antigens of the major histocompatibility complex on cells of macrophage lineage. Thus, by curtailing virus replication and enhancing expression of MHC class II antigens, LV-IFN may contribute to the induction and augmentation of the host's lymphoproliferative response to the virus...|$|R
40|$|CD 8 + {{cytotoxic}} T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses {{have been}} shown to be important in the control of human and simian immunodeficiency virus infections. Infection of sheep with visna/maedi <b>virus</b> (<b>VISNA),</b> a related lentivirus, induces specific CD 8 + CTL in vivo, but the specific viral proteins recognized are not known. To determine which VISNA antigens were recognized by sheep CTL, we used recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the different genes of VISNA: in six sheep (Finnish LandraceDorset crosses, Friesland and Lleyn breeds) all VISNA proteins were recognized except TAT. Two sheep, shown to share major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles, recognized POL and were used to map the epitope. The pol gene is 3267 bp long encoding 1088 aa. By using recombinant vaccinia viruses a central portion (nt 1609 – 2176, aa 537 – 725) was found to contain the CTL epitope and this was mapped with synthetic peptides to a 25 aa region (aa 612 – 636). When smaller peptides were used, a cluster of epitopes was detected: at least three epitopes were present, at positions 612 – 623 : DSRYAFEFMIRN; 620 – 631 : MIRNWDEEVIKN; and 625 – 635 : EEVIKNPIQAR. A DNA-prime-modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) -boost strategy was employed to immunize four sheep shown to share MHC class I allele(s) with the sheep above. Specific CTL activity developed in all the immunized sheep within 3 weeks of the final MVA boost although half the sheep showed evidence of specific reactivity after the DNA-prime immunizations. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of induction of CTL by a DNA-prime-boost method in VISNA infection...|$|R
5000|$|Though it {{does not}} produce severe immunodeficiency, visna shares many {{characteristics}} with human immunodeficiency virus, including the establishment of persistent infection with chronic active lymphoproliferation; however, <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> does not infect T-lymphocytes.

5000|$|Visna - Maedi is {{a chronic}} viral disease {{prevalent}} in adult sheep. The disease is rarely found in certain species of goat.

This disease corresponds to two clinical entities caused by the same Maedi is a form that results in a chronic progressive pneumonia. Visna refers to the neurological form of the disease and predominantly causes meningoencephalitis in adult sheep. This disease has inflicted many economic losses worldwide due to the long incubation period and the high mortality rate of sheep and goats. MV virus can infect sheep of any age but clinical symptoms rarely occur in sheep less than two years old. The onset of the diseases is gradual resulting in relentless loss of weight in addition to breathing problems. Cough, abortion, rapid breathing, depression, chronic mastitis and arthritis are also additional symptoms observed. These symptoms appear mostly in animals over the age of three and therefore might spread to other flocks before clinical diagnosis can be achieved. Animals showing the above symptoms might die within six months of infection. This causal lentivirus can be found in monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages of infected sheep in the presence of humoral and cell mediated immune response and can also be detected by conducting several serological tests. Transmission of the disease occurs most commonly via the oral route caused by ingestion of colostrum or milk that contains the virus or inhalation of infected aerosol droplets. Due to variation of the strains of MVV, some of the association clinical symptoms may be more pre-dominant in a flock relative to others along with differences in genetic susceptibility patterns.|$|E

40|$|The <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> Tat {{protein is}} {{required}} for efficient viral transcription from the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> long terminal repeat (LTR). AP- 1 sites within the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> LTR, which can be bound by the cellular transcription factors Fos and Jun, are also necessary for Tat-mediated transcriptional activation. A potential mechanism by which the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> Tat protein could target the viral promoter is by protein-protein interactions with Fos and/or Jun bound to AP- 1 sites in the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> LTR. Once targeted to the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> promoter, the Tat protein could then interact with basal transcription factors to activate transcription. To examine protein-protein interactions with cellular proteins at the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> promoter, we used an in vitro protein affinity chromatography assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, {{in addition to an}} in vivo two-hybrid assay, to show that the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> Tat protein specifically interacts with the cellular transcription factors Fos and Jun and the basal transcription factor TBP (TATA binding protein). The Tat domain responsible for interactions with Fos and Jun was localized to an alpha-helical domain within amino acids 34 to 69 of the protein. The TBP binding domain was localized to amino acids 1 to 38 of Tat, a region previously described by our laboratory as the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> Tat activation domain. The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun were found to be important for the interactions with Tat. Mutations within the basic domains of Fos and Jun abrogated binding to Tat in the in vitro assays. The <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> Tat protein was also able to interact with covalently cross-linked Fos and Jun dimers. Thus, the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> Tat protein appears to target AP- 1 sites in the viral promoter in a mechanism similar to the interaction of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax with the cellular transcription factor CREB, by binding the basic domains of an intact bZIP dimer.

Further, we demonstrate that the 30 -kDa protein is a membrane-associated proteoglycan substituted with a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain(s) and that treatment of susceptible cells with an inhibitor of GAG synthesis significantly reduces <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> production.

Portions of the CAEV LTR are closely homologous to analogous regions of <b>visna</b> <b>virus.</b> The CAEV LTR is not significantly homologous with the HTLV-III LTR; however, like HTLV-III, <b>visna</b> <b>virus,</b> and equine infectious anemia virus, CAEV uses tRNA lysine as a primer for reverse transcription. The transcriptional activity of the CAEV and <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> LTRs was measured by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, and the activity of the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> LTR was generally higher in a variety of uninfected cell types. Infection of cells with <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> markedly increased gene expression directed by either the CAEV or <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> LTR, but in contrast, infection of cells with CAEV had little effect on the activity of either LTR. The lack of trans-activation by CAEV, a virus which causes debilitating arthritis and encephalitis in goats, suggests that trans-activation may not be a general property of pathogenic lentiviruses...|$|E

Pretreatment of <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> with neuraminidase abolished hemagglutination inhibition activity {{but did not}} significantly affect attachment, infectivity, or virus-induced cell fusion in sheep choroid plexus cell monolayers...|$|E
40|$|The distantly related lentiviruses human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> each encode a posttranscriptional regulatory protein, termed Rev, that is critical for expression of the viral structural proteins. We genetically mapped the cis-acting target sequence for <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> Rev, the <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> Rev-response element or RRE-V, to a complex 176 -nucleotide RNA stem-loop structure that coincides with sequences encoding the N terminus of the transmembrane component of envelope. The computer-predicted structure of the RRE-V was validated by in vitro analysis of structure-specific RNase cleavage patterns. The <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> Rev protein was shown to interact specifically with the genetically defined RRE-V in vitro {{but was unable to}} bind the HIV- 1 RRE. Similarly, HIV- 1 Rev was also unable to bind the RRE-V specifically. We therefore conclude that the HIV- 1 and <b>visna</b> <b>virus</b> Rev proteins, while functionally analogous, nevertheless display distinct RNA sequence specificities. These findings provide a biochemical explanation for the observation that these two viral regulatory proteins are functional only in the homologous viral system...|$|E
