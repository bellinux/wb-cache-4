30|$|The size of {{the overall}} effect in Treviso and <b>Vicenza</b> <b>provinces</b> was lessened by the programme's limited diffusion, and this had at least two causes. First, in a very rigid labour market, where terms and {{conditions}} of employment were negotiated in detail at the national level, firms {{took advantage of the}} new contract form – to separate the wheat from the chaff. Better educated workers or, generally speaking, workers with higher productivity, were offered open-ended contracts and higher entrance wages, while low productivity workers were hired through CFL, on fixed-term contracts and lower wages. Thus, CFL aided the process of screening workers for their job suitability. The occurrence of the programme intervention in a very rigid situation fostered competition among workers, and among firms, and improved the economy's employment performance. This argument {{is one of the main}} policy directions identified by the Manpower and Social Affairs Committee of the OECD (Kluve and Schmidt 2002, p.   421). Second, the programme was burdened by a series of restrictions aimed at selecting “good” employers. Employers were selected on the basis of an employment history free of recent substantial firings in order to avoid subsidizing firms which might have reduced employment prior to engaging in the programme with the intention of re-hiring previously employed youths on a temporary employment basis. Also, many applications were rejected on the grounds that the proposed training programmes they offered were poor.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cancer is a {{major cause}} of death in {{domestic}} animals. Furthermore, many forms of pet neoplasm resemble that of their human counterparts in biologic behaviour, pathologic expression, and recognised risk factors. In April 2005, a pilot project was activated so as to establish a dog and cat tumour registry living in the Venice and <b>Vicenza</b> <b>provinces</b> (Veneto Region, north-eastern Italy), with the aim of estimating the incidence of spontaneous tumours. Results Through a telephone survey, the estimates of canine and feline populations of the catchment area turned out to be of 296, 318 (CI +/- 30, 201) and 214, 683 (CI +/- 21, 755) subjects, respectively. During the first three years, overall 2, 509 canine and 494 feline cases of neoplasia were diagnosed. In dogs, the estimated annual incidence rate (IR) per 100, 000 dogs for all tumours was 282 in all the catchment area, whereas in cats the IR was much lower (IR = 77). Malignant and benign tumours were equally distributed in male and female dogs, whereas cats had a 4. 6 -fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than benign. In both dogs and cats, purebreds had an almost 2 -fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than mixed breeds. Tumour incidence increased with age in both dog and cat populations. Conclusion This study has provided estimates of incidence of spontaneous neoplasm in companion animals. Further attempts will be made to increase the accuracy in the population size assessment and to ascertain the real gap with the official regional canine demographic registry. Veterinary practitioners may also benefit from the tumour registry insofar they may obtain data for specific breeds, age groups or geographical areas. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) {{is the most common}} genetic renal disorder, with a prevalence of 1 : 500 to 1 : 1, 000. ADPKD is genetically heterogeneous: the genes involved are PKD 1 and PKD 2. ADPKD occurs worldwide and in all ethnic groups and is an important cause of CKD Stage 5. Prevalence of ADPKD on renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Italy has been reported to be 8. 2 %. In the dialysis population of <b>Vicenza,</b> a <b>province</b> in Northeastern Italy, it accounts for 13. 4 %. The study aims to investigate reasons for the high prevalence of ADPKD in our region and to describe the clinical profile and genetics of these patients. METHODS: Since April 2007, ADPKD patients have been enrolled. Patients from families not native to Vicenza have been excluded. The diagnosis of ADPKD is defined by ultrasound criteria. Complete clinical details have been recorded, including family history. We have used linkage analysis to identify the gene involved in each family. RESULTS: We describe the first 100 patients recruited from a total of 42 families. 29 patients were in ESRD at the time of enrollment. Renal stones and hepatic cysts were present in 24 % and 40 %, respectively. The majority of the ADPKD patients (61 %) were diagnosed either incidentally or by screening. Positive family history was recorded in 86 patients. The involved gene was PKD 1 in 83. 7 % and PKD 2 in 16. 3 % of the studied patients. PKD 2 patients presented the common haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: It is the first epidemiological study from Northeastern Italy reporting clinical profile and genetic analysis of ADPKD patients. The clinical profile of the patients is similar to previous reports, but there is a high prevalence of ADPKD in our region. The presence of a common haplotype is in accordance with our hypothesis of a founder effect in our province, suggesting that a strong lineage-specific gene is present. If the sequence analysis confirms the same mutation, this might suggest a common ancestral origin and a segregation of a specific mutation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens are {{transmitted}} by bloodsucking culicid mosquitoes belonging to Culex, Aedes, Ochlerotatus, Anopheles and Mansonia genera. The detection of filarioids in mosquitoes for assessing distribution of vectors and/or of pathogens {{in a given}} area (also known as “xenomonitoring”), when based on individual dissection of wild-caught female mosquitoes is time consuming and hardly applicable in large epidemiological surveys. Our study aimed to evaluate the recently developed duplex real-time PCR for screening large number of culicids and to assess their positivity for D. immitis and D. repens {{in an area where}} both species are endemic. Methods A duplex real-time PCR was used to detect and differentiate D. immitis and D. repens in mosquitoes collected in six provinces of the Veneto region using 43 carbon dioxide-baited traps under the frame of an entomological surveillance program to monitor the vectors of West Nile disease. From early May till October 2010, unfed female mosquitoes (n[*]=[*] 40, 892) were captured in 20 selected sites. Results Mosquitoes identified as Culex pipiens, Ochlerotatus caspius, Aedes vexans and Culex modestus were grouped into 995 pools according to species, day and site of collection (from minimum of 1 to maximum of 57). Out of 955 pools, 23 (2. 41 [*]%) scored positive for Dirofilaria spp. of which, 21 (2. 2 [*]%) for D. immitis and two (0. 21 [*]%) for D. repens. An overall Estimated Rate of Infection (ERI) of 0. 06 [*]% was recorded, being higher in Och. caspius and Ae. vexans (i. e., 0. 18 [*]% and 0. 14 [*]%, respectively). At least one mosquito pool was positive for Dirofilaria spp. in each province with the highest ERI recorded in <b>Vicenza</b> and Padova <b>provinces</b> (i. e., 0. 42 % and 0. 16 [*]%, respectively). Mosquitoes collected in all provinces were positive for D. immitis whereas, only two (i. e., Padova and Rovigo) provinces scored positive for D. repens. All mosquito species, except for Cx. modestus, were positive for D. immitis, whereas D. repens was only found in Cx. pipiens. Conclusions The results suggest that both Dirofilaria species are endemic and may occur in sympatry in the examined area. The molecular approach herein used represents a powerful tool for surveillance programs of D. immitis and D. repens in the culicid vectors towards {{a better understanding of the}} epidemiology of the infections they cause and their seasonal transmission patterns. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{definition}} of hydrological alert systems for rainfall-induced landslides is {{strongly related to}} a deep knowledge of the geological and geomorphological features of the territory. Climatic conditions, spatial and temporal evolution of the phenomena and characterization of landslide triggering, together with propagation mechanisms, are the key elements to be considered. Critical steps {{for the development of}} the systems consist of the identification of the hydrological variable related to landslide triggering and of the minimum rainfall threshold for landslide occurrence. In this paper we report the results from a process-based model to define a hydrological alert system for the Val di Maso Landslide, located in the northeastern Italian Alps and included in the <b>Vicenza</b> <b>Province</b> (Veneto region, NE Italy). The instability occurred in November 2010, due to an exceptional rainfall event that hit the <b>Vicenza</b> <b>Province</b> and the entire NE Italy. Up to 500 mm in 3 -day cumulated rainfall generated large flood conditions and triggered hundreds of landslides. During the flood, the Soil Protection Division of the <b>Vicenza</b> <b>Province</b> received more than 500 warnings of instability phenomena. The complexity of the event and the high level of risk to infrastructure and private buildings are the main reasons for deepening the specific phenomenon occurred at Val di Maso. Empirical and physically-based models have been used to identify the minimum rainfall threshold for the occurrence of instability phenomena in the crown area of Val di Maso landslide, where a retrogressive evolution by multiple rotational slides is expected. Empirical models helped in the identification and in the evaluation of recurrence of critical rainfall events, while physically-based modelling was essential to verify the effects on the slope stability of determined rainfall depths. Empirical relationships between rainfall and landslide consist of the calculation of rainfall Depth-Duration-Frequency (DDF) curves, which allow one to determine rainfall depth (or intensity) as a function of duration for given return periods or probabilities of exceedance (frequencies). Physically-based modelling was performed through coupled seepage and slope stability analyses. Combining results from empirical and physically-based modelling, the minimum alert threshold for a reactivation of the phenomenon was found in rainfall cumulated up to 60 days with a return period of 2 yr. These results were used to set up a hydrological alert system based on the calibration of DDF curves which can be used as a sort of abacus to plot in real time rainfall depths and to set increasing levels of alert on the basis of the degree of exceptionality of rainfall. The alert system for Val di Maso was successfully tested by the rainfall events that produced displacements which have been recorded by extensometers placed in the crown area after the November 2010 landslide. However, further tests are recommendable to improve the process-based model that led to the implementation of the alert system. To this end, a monitoring system is currently being realized. In the near future, monitoring data will help in testing and improving landslide evolution and alert models. The proposed hydrological alert system proves to be effective mainly because it can be applied to different scales of investigation and geological and geomorphological contexts. In fact, it might also be applicable to territorial scale analyses, as showed by the brief example provided in this paper on how the alert system could be used for landslide early warning in the area surrounding Val di Maso. Furthermore, it is easy to set up. The needed components are a rain gauge station, a software that compares rainfall data to rainfall events with different return periods and degree of alert, and a transmission system of the warning levels to authorities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{feasibility}} study on potentialities and limits of using DInSAR (Differential Synthetic Aperture RADAR Interferometry) techniques in landslide phenomena analysis at different scales (basin and slope scale). The study area is the Agno Valley, located in the NE sector of Italian Alps (<b>Vicenza</b> <b>Province,</b> Veneto Region, Italy). At the basin scale, factors that limit the applicability of inteferometric techniques, have been investigated. Portions of RADAR images affected by geometric distortion (layover and shadowing) are compared with morphometric factors (aspect and slope) and with land use data. The results show that areas affected by distortions are very limited and the presence of steep slope is the main factor limiting theapplicability of SAR interferometric techniques. At slope scale, time-series displacement data derived from Persistent Scatters processing are analysed to evaluate the state of activity of landslide phenomena that occur in Rovegliana-Cappellazzi area (North sector of Agno Valley). Furthermore, displacement data have been compared with rainfall data to investigated landslide triggering factors.

This amber has been carefully analysed by means of infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTG), and elemental chemical analysis. Then, the amber from Bolca has been compared with other ambers of similar age.

According to the shallow benthic biozonation, the age is in both cases SBZ 11, or Middle Cuisian (Early Eocene). Moreover, the fossil assemblages allowed to reconstruct the palaeoenvironments, stressing they were in both case on a shallow carbonate platform, relatively close to the shoreline.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} climatic {{features}} of the <b>Vicenza</b> <b>Province</b> (NE Italy) and {{the characteristics of the}} exceptional rainfall event that hit the area in November 2010, triggering a huge number of landslides. Our analysis aims at identifying the hydrological variable related to the triggering of the recorded instabilities and the recent variation in the occurrence of rainfall events inducing landslides. During the period 1920 – 2009, a negative trend in the annual rainfall and a marked positive trend of the mean annual temperature have been observed in the study area. Rainfall has become more concentrated during autumnal season (October–December) and the greatest increase in temperature has been registered in winter (January–March) and summer (June–August). As a consequence, the quantity of meteoric water available for infiltration and run off processes has increased in autumn, which has typically been the season with the maximum number of landslides. Moreover, the statistical analysis of annual rainfall maxima for durations of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h, and 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days, allowed us to highlight that the occurrence of intense rainfall events has increased in the last 20 years. Our results show that the degree of rainfall-induced landslide hazard has increased in the study area, possibly due to recent climate changes. In the near future, such results should be taken into account for landslide forecasting, monitoring and mitigation...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, {{groundwater}} {{resources of}} the high Vicenza plain were subjected to an increasing extraction rate and, at the same time, to a lower quantity of groundwater recharge. The result is a decreasing flow from the plain springs and a high reduction in piezometric levels of the middle and lower Venetian aquifers. In order to restore the balance of groundwater resources in the Vicenza area, the <b>Vicenza</b> <b>Province</b> has promoted experimental activities aimed to increase the recharge of the aquifer in the high Vicenza plain and in the River Agno valley, using infiltration wells, forested infiltration areas, infiltration trenches, subsurface fields and infiltration canals. All recharge plants are fed by irrigation water, managed by agricultural consortia only during periods of water surplus. Construction works were preceded by specific geological and hydrogeological investigations to verify the suitability for recharge, {{with the purpose of}} optimizing the available economic resources. For the protection of the aquifer system, a chemical background of infiltration water was assessed with periodical chemical-physical and microbiological surveys. After the activation date, a monthly monitoring program started to verify the quality of both surface and groundwater, collecting samples in monitoring wells downstream the infiltration structures. The input flow rate entering the various systems, monitored by automatic instruments either in the superficial structure and in groundwater, have provided interesting information about the volumes and the quality of water.

30|$|Steel {{industry}} presents one of {{the highest}} energy demand of all the industrial sector. Foundries have a really relevant role both in economical terms and as regards the energy demand. The cost of energy represents several percentage points of the overall costs of a foundry. The electricity demand is very high, particularly for the induction melting furnaces. A large amount of thermal energy is obtained both from natural gas combustion and from the coal needed for the process of formation of cast iron in cupolas. Moreover, the plant services must be considered: one very energy consumer is compressed air production. Every factory is different from another so that the proposal of actions of energy savings or thermal recovers requires a detailed study of each plant considering the lay out and analysing the single processes with related energy needs and thermal levels. The co-operation of the University of Padua with the Centro Produttività Veneto allowed to plan a series of energy audits in some foundries located in <b>Vicenza</b> <b>province.</b> The experiences of the first facilities surveys and audits recommendations demonstrated both potential advantage of energy savings and the related difficulties, often due to the high investment costs. Anyhow the joint work of auditing between the university experts and the foundry technicians produced a better awareness on the critical points of the plant and a higher rationality level in the evaluation of investments for the renewable of the machinery. Here, the method of performing the energy audits is described together with the very first results in terms of proposals for energy savings evaluated technically and economically.|$|E
40|$|Hypodermosis is a myiasis {{of cattle}} mainly {{found in the}} Northern Hemisphere. In Italy it has been {{reported}} primarily in southern regions with a farm prevalence reaching a peak of 85 %, while few data are available in the north of the country. This paper reports the results of a serological survey carried out on hypodermosis in <b>Vicenza</b> <b>province</b> (northeastern Italy). During January and February 1999, bulk milk samples were collected from 224 dairy farms and tested, using an hypodermosis ELISA kit. Epidemiological data, such as farm location, herd size, number of cows, grazing management, treatments against Hypoderma larvae, presence of imported animals, were gathered and statistically analysed in relation to the serological results. In 15 farms the presence of warbles was monitored by manual palpation and larvae collected for identification. Ninety-seven (43. 3 %) samples were detected as positive, whereas 12 (5. 4 %) and 115 (51. 3 %) were inconclusive and negative, respectively. Thirteen farms were positive upon parasitological examination and the larvae collected were identified as Hypoderma bovis. Seroprevalence was highly correlated with the practice of free grazing and slightly, but significantly, correlated with the number of cows on the farm. The mean antibody level of positive herds was significantly higher on farms without imported animals. On farms with warbled animals there was a high inverse correlation between antibody level and quantity of milk in the tanks and the number of lactating cows.

40|$|Steel {{industry}} presents one of {{the highest}} energy demand of all the industrial sector. Foundries have a really relevant role both in economical terms and as regards the energy demand. The cost of energy represents several percentage points of the overall costs of a foundry. The electricity demand is very high, particularly for the induction melting furnaces. A large amount of thermal energy is obtained both from natural gas combustion and from the coal needed for the process of formation of cast iron in cupolas. Moreover the plant services must be considered: one very energy consumer is compressed air production. A not negligible weight is due to water pumping or the drying requested for eventual spray booths or the formations of moulds/cores. Every factory is different from another so that the proposal of actions of energy savings or thermal recovers requires a detailed study of each plant considering the lay out and analysing the single processes with related energy needs and thermal levels. The cooperation of the University of Padua with the Centro Produttività Veneto allowed to perform a series of energy audits in some foundries located in <b>Vicenza</b> <b>province.</b> The experience demonstrated both potential advantage of energy savings and the related difficulties, often due to the high investment costs. Anyhow the joint work of auditing between the university experts and the foundry technicians produced a better awareness on the critical points of the plant and a higher rationality level in the evaluation of investments for the renewable of the machinery. Here the method of performing the energy audits is described together with the proposals for energy savings evaluated technically and economically...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of the {{groundwater}} contamination by hexavalent chromium {{in an industrial}} site in the <b>Vicenza</b> <b>province</b> The present thesis work, consists {{in the study of}} mechanisms able to mobilize a pollutant in a site on the higher plain of Veneto. Specifically, considering the contaminated site by hexavalent chromium in the "Galvanica pm" a dismantled factory in the municipality of Tezze sul Brenta (province of Vicenza), we wanted to distinguish the contribution of groundwater table raising from the infiltrated rainfall on mobilization of hexavalent chromium from contaminated soil to groundwater. The processing of historical monitoring data, allowed to build the trends of piezometric level, rainfall intensity and infiltration rate, the concentrations of hexavalent chromium in groundwater and pumping rates for contaminant plume capture. The analysis of these data sets are fundamental to reconstruct the quantity (mass) of hexavalent chromium extracted from 2008 to 2014, highlighting the crucial role of rainfall in the transport of the pollutant in groundwater. The analysis of historical data has allowed to distinguish different mechanisms leading to the release of contaminants in groundwater and their weight. In detail, the study showed that in periods, in which there is the effect of the infiltration of rainwater, in groundwater we registered long-lasting contamination events, with concentrations of chrome in the order of hundreds of ug/l. Meanwhile, with the raising of the piezometric level above a threshold limit, the hexavalent chromium values reach values of a few thousand mg/l for short time periods. Finally, {{it was found that the}} combined action of abundant rainfall and {{the groundwater}} table raising, originates a mobilization mechanism that leads to have intermediate concentration values compared to those previously described, but for long time periods. ...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{numerical}} models {{developed in the}} last twenty years to predict the propagation of flow-like landslide in the framework of the continuum and discrete element mechanics, the SPH model proposed by Pastor et al. (2009) is particularly suitable for this kind of analysis. The model is based on the theory of the shallow-water waves, assuming that for the flow-like landslides the average depths are small in comparison with their length or width, and also simplifying the 3 D propagation model by integrating the equations along the vertical axis. In this way, the Biot – Zienkiewicz equations for non-linear materials and large deformation problems are coupled to various constitutive models (Bingham, Voëllmy, Morh-Coulomb, etc.) obtaining a 2 D depth-integrated model, which presents an excellent combination of accuracy and simplicity and provides information about propagation, such as average velocity or depth of the flow along the path. This study presents the calibration of Pastor’s model carried out on the base of observations obtained in the Rotolon torrent valley. In this site, located in the Northeastern part of <b>Vicenza</b> <b>province</b> (Italy) a debris-flow triggering area is active since a century and periodically it creates risk conditions for the down-stream valley. The last dangerous events occurred in November 2009 and 2010 and seriously engaged the valley worrying the inhabitants and the local administrators. Fortunately no dead and injured people have been registered. In this case, the rheological tests carried out in a coaxial rheometer on the finest part of the material collected along the stream did not furnished reliable data for the calibration of the model: this because the material is composed by heterogeneous material including large parts of coarse particles, which cannot be introduced in the rheometer. Thus, the model calibration was performed using the in-situ observation carried out immediately after the 2009 event. The calibrated model proved to be a very useful tool to assess the critical flow conditions in some cross-sections along the stream and also to suggest some interventions for the risk reduction in the valley...|$|E
