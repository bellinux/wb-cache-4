30|$|SLA Enforcement - <b>Violation</b> <b>Response.</b> An {{important}} issue for SLA Enforcement is whether an application’s resource demands {{are expected to}} be static throughout its execution, or whether they can vary in a predictable or unpredictable manner. If an application’s demands {{are expected to be}} relatively constant, then static throttling methods can be used. However, if an application’s demands can vary, perhaps unpredictably, then it’s behavior must be monitored to determine if it has gone “out of spec”. For a performance-critical application, the primary goal of a machine-enforceable, dynamic SLA is to pro-actively bring the application back into compliance. This requires some type of “control knobs” on the infrastructure or on the application itself.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this phase II study was to document activity and toxicity of docetaxel and cisplatin as induction chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIA N 2 {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) before definitive local treatment. Forty-six chemotherapy-naı¨ve patients (median age 60 years) were included. Treatment consisted of 3 cycles of docetaxel (85 mg/m 2 on day 1), followed by cisplatin (40 mg/m 2 /day on days 1 and 2) every 21 days. Grade 3 – 4 leukopenia and neutropenia occurred in 45. 7 % and 65. 2 % of the patients, respectively. Among 8 cases of febrile neutropenia (17. 4 %), one (2. 2 %) resulted in early death. Common grade 3 – 4 non-haematological toxicities were nausea (17. 4 %) and vomiting (13 %). Eighty-five percent of the patients received three courses; six stopped prematurely due to toxicity, one due to protocol <b>violation.</b> <b>Response</b> rate was the primary endpoint of this study. Considering eligible patients (n = 40), 18 responses (1 complete and 17 partial responses) were observed (response rate 45 %; 95 % Confidence interval (CI) : 29. 3 %– 61. 5 %).

This study investigated how violation-, response-, and feedback-related electrophysiological (EEG) activity changes over time during language learning. Twenty-two Dutch learners of German classified short prepositional phrases presented serially as text. The phrases were initially presented without feedback during a pre-test phase, and then with feedback in a training phase on two separate days spaced 1 [*]week apart.

40|$|Parole {{officials}} {{have traditionally been}} afforded considerable discretion when making sanctioning decisions {{to be able to}} tailor sanctions according to sub-stantively rational concerns such as individuals ’ unique needs and situations. However, the application of substantive rationality in sanctioning can also generate unwanted disparities because sanctioning decisions may be based on extralegal factors that parole officials consider relevant. Concerns regarding disparate treatment of offender groups have prompted a number of states to consider adopting administrative <b>violation</b> <b>response</b> policies that emphasize formal rationality and uniformity by restricting parole officers ’ discretion and structuring sanctioning decisions according to legally relevant criteria. By emphasizing formal rationality in sanctioning, structured sanction policies present a dilemma for parole officersFuniformity versus individualized treatment. In 2005, the state of Ohio implemented an administrative viola-tion response policy designed to reduce parole officers ’ reliance on revoca-tion hearings and promote uniformity in sanctioning decisions. This study involved an examination of whether Ohio’s shift to structured sanctioning coincided with differences in legal and extralegal effects on parole officers’ decisions to pursue revocation hearings. Analyses of data collected before and after the implementation of the policy revealed a reduction in the num-ber of revocation hearings officers pursued. Only modest increases in uni-formity were observed, however, because there was little disparity resulting from officers ’ hearing decisions before the policy was put in place. These findings are discussed within perspectives on justice system actors’ decision making.

40|$|The 16 O(e,e'p) {{reaction}} in the quasi-elastic region has been studied in several experiments to determine spectroscopic factors, hence, {{the degree to which}} $^{ 16 }$O looks like a closed shell. By varying the kinematics, experimentalists are able to extract response functions which comprise the cross section. However, analysis of the response functions separately produces very different spectroscopic factors. Two calculations led to different conclusions as to whether exchange currents can eliminate the discrepancies. Neither calculation considered relativistic corrections. The purpose of the article is to investigate the disagreement as to whether exchange currents are the solution to obtaining consistent spectroscopic factors, and to show that relativistic corrections have a much greater influence on providing this consistency. This calculation employs the recoil corrected continuum shell model, a model that uses a realistic interaction, and produces non-spurious scatterings states that are solutions to the coupled channels problems. Pionic and pair contributions to the exchange currents were calculated as developed by Dubach, Koch, and Donnelly. Relativistic effects are included by use of the direct Pauli reduction. Contributions of the exchange currents are shown to be insufficient to provide consistent spectroscopic factors. However, the inclusion of relativistic corrections, that can be large, lead to more consistent spectroscopic factors and cross sections. The influence of channel coupling is also shown to be significant. Tests of current conservation show that inclusion of the direct Pauli reduction produces small increases in its <b>violation.</b> <b>Response</b> functions which depend on the transverse current are sensitive to the lower component of relativistic wave functions, and hence, would provide a measure of the appropriateness of any relativistic model...|$|E
3000|$|The {{offer of}} the {{provider}} represents the catalog of components {{available on the}} PaaS. The providers offer SCC components that are differentiated by their QoS levels, their prices {{and how they are}} built, deployed and managed. In a specific SLA (Fig. 12, bullet 4) we find the result of the choice of SCC components corresponding to the SLO of the user and constitute its VPSN (SCC composition). In our Springoo example, the selected SCCs are an Apache-SCC and a Jonas-SCC component whose composition meets the requested SLO (number of requests per second, response time and integrity 8.2). The classes (Fig. 12, bullet 5) represent the terms of contracts. We have the supplier guarantees namely SLO 1 and SLO 2 of the user of Springoo (Fig. 12, bullet 5.1). To do this, we find the [...] "SLA Management Actions" [...] (Fig. 12, bullet 5.2), which define the list of actions to do, more those provided at the SCC components level (6), ie at the VPSN level, for the end-to-end service delivery. We find the actions that are induced by SLO and those for SLA violation. For example, to ensure SLO 2 of the user, which represents resources elasticity case, according to requirements, we need to add a Jonas and therefore a Load Balancer component to share the load. These shares will be automatically activated when an OutContract of QoS component at the composition level will be sent. Another case would be that of SLA violations (Fig. 12, bullet 5.3), for example, if the response time of the VPSN no longer meets the SLO. The specific actions will depend on the business rules and diagnosis. If a <b>violation</b> <b>response</b> time comes from the location of the added Jonas, it must be replaced with an ubiquitous Jonas with a more appropriate location. These management actions are conducted by the dynamic reconfiguration of the VPSN.|$|E

These include repetition suppression, mismatch negativity, <b>violation</b> <b>responses,</b> place-cell activity, phase precession, theta sequences, theta-gamma coupling, evidence accumulation, race-to-bound dynamics, and transfer of dopamine responses. Furthermore, the (approximately Bayes' optimal) behavior prescribed by these dynamics has a degree of face validity, providing a formal explanation for reward seeking, context learning, and epistemic foraging. Technically, the fact that a gradient descent appears to be a valid description of neuronal activity means that variational free energy is a Lyapunov function for neuronal dynamics, which therefore conform to Hamilton's principle of least action...|$|R

40|$|Published: 24 January 2017 The {{present study}} used {{magnetoencephalography}} (MEG) to investigate how Spanish adult learners of Basque respond to morphosyntactic violations {{after a short}} period of training on a small fragment of Basque grammar. Participants (n = 17) were exposed to violation and control phrases in three phases (pretest, training, generalization-test). In each phase participants listened to short Basque phrases and they judged whether they were correct or incorrect. During the pre-test and generalization-test, participants did not receive any feedback. During the training blocks feedback was provided after each response. We also ran two Spanish control blocks before and after training. We analyzed the event-related magnetic- field (ERF) recorded in response to a critical word during all three phases. In the pretest, classification was below chance and we found no electrophysiological differences between violation and control stimuli. Then participants were explicitly taught a Basque grammar rule. From the first training block participants were able to correctly classify control and violation stimuli and an evoked <b>violation</b> <b>response</b> was present. Although the timing of the electrophysiological responses matched participants' L 1 effect, the effect size was smaller for L 2 and the topographical distribution differed from the L 1. While the L 1 effect was bilaterally distributed on the auditory sensors, the L 2 effect was present at right frontal sensors. During training blocks two and three, the violation-control effect size increased and the topography evolved to a more L 1 -like pattern. Moreover, this pattern was maintained in the generalization test. We conclude that rapid changes in neuronal responses can be observed in adult learners of a simple morphosyntactic rule, and that native-like responses can be achieved at least in small fragments of second language.

40|$|Most {{cultural}} and legal codes {{agree that the}} intentional killing of civilians, whether in peacetime or war, is prohibited. This is the norm of civilian immunity, widely {{considered to be a}} fundamental moral and legal principle. Yet despite this fact, the deliberate killing of large numbers of civilians remains a persistent feature of global political life. What is more, the perpetrators have often avoided criticism and punishment. Examining dozens of episodes of mass killing perpetrated by states since the French Revolution late eighteenth century, this book attempts to explain this paradox. It studies the role that civilian immunity has played in shaping the behaviour of perpetrators and how international society has responded to mass killing. The book argues that although the world has made impressive progress in legislating against the intentional killing of civilians and in constructing institutions to give meaning to that prohibition, the norm's history in practice suggests that the ascendancy of civilian immunity is both more recent and more fragile than might otherwise be thought. In practice, decisions to violate a norm are shaped by factors relating to the norm and the situation at hand, so too is the manner in which international society and individual states respond to norm <b>violations.</b> <b>Responses</b> to norm <b>violations</b> are not simply matters of normative obligation or calculations of self-interest but are instead guided by a combination of these logics as well as perceptions about the situation at hand, existing relations with the actors involved, and power relations between actors holding different accounts of the situation. Thus, whilst civilian immunity has for the time being prevailed over 'anti-civilian ideologies' which seek to justify mass killing, it remains challenged by these ideologies and its implementation shaped by individual circumstances. As a result, whilst it has become much more difficult for states to get away with mass murder, it is still not entirely impossible for them to do so.

In contrast to CFDs, eCFDs specify patterns of semanti-cally related values in terms of disjunction and inequality, and are capable of catching inconsistencies that arise in practice but cannot be detected by CFDs. The increase in expressive power does not incur extra complexity: we show that the satisfiability and implication analyses of eCFDs remain NP-complete and coNP-complete, respectively, {{the same as their}} CFDs counterparts. In light of the intractability, we present an algorithm that approximates the maximum number of eCFDs that are satisfiable. In addition, we revise SQL techniques for detecting CFD violations, and show that violations of multiple eCFDs can be captured via a single pair of SQL queries. We also introduce an incremental SQL technique for detecting eCFD <b>violations</b> in <b>response</b> to database updates. We experimentally verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our SQL-based detection methods. I...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effect of modeled rule violation behavior on observer response within a small group setting. Students decided {{whether or not they}} would engage in a modeled behavior that was in conflict with instructions that were given prior to the beginning of a task. Bandura (1965) described the acquisition of new responses from observing others as vicarious learning, a central concept within social learning theory. Model and observer characteristics as well as moral reasoning levels were identified as being important variables in influencing observer response to modeled behavior. ^ One hundred and thirty-one students attending an urban, midwestern university participated in this study. Students were randomly placed in one of six experimental conditions (low, medium, high DIT/model/control). They were asked to view a series of eighty slides of human faces and write the first descriptive word that came to mind. Candy was available after completion of the task. Students in the model condition were exposed to a model who took candy prior to the completion of the task. The model observed the response of the students and noted any rule violations. Students in the control condition were requested to complete the task without a model present. Students were asked to complete an eighteen item questionnaire which provided an opportunity for them to express their feelings about the experimental and control group experiences. ^ Eight one-way, eight two-factor ANOVAS and ten chi-square tests were performed, utilizing self reported rule violation, confrontive behavior, comfort level, performance satisfaction, judgment of model behavior, and model attribution responses as dependent variables. The chi-square revealed significant relationships between model sex, subject sex, DIT level and self reported rule <b>violation</b> <b>responses.</b> There was a significant relationship between experimental grouping (model/control) and self reported rule violation. ANOVA revealed no main effects for moral reasoning level, experimental condition, model or subject sex on any of the dependent measures, nor any significant interactions on any of the dependent measures. ^ This study suggests the need to examine more fully the types of modeled behaviors in which students are willing to engage and whether moral reasoning level and model and observer characteristics will play a role in determining observer resistance or yielding to the modeled behavior. The implications of this study may assist educators in understanding some of the factors that influence behavior of contemporary college students. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Companies are {{currently}} {{turning to the}} use of web applications offered as Cloud services, expecting a certain QoS expressed by means of a maximum response time. Virtual Machines hosting these applications may vary their resource allotment as a consequence of a variation in the incoming workload intensity to guarantee the agreed response time. This allotment should be enough to avoid an under-provision that would lead to the <b>violation</b> of <b>response</b> time constraints, and low enough to avoid an over-provision that would lead to resource wasting. To anticipate the resource demands of web applications, we propose a Prediction System that combines statistical and Machine Learning techniques. This system is composed by the Immediate Predictor to anticipate the immediate CPU demand, useful to adapt pro-actively the resource allotments, and by the Capacity Predictor to forecast the CPU demand at a more distant future.

However, to date {{there is no}} experimental evidence of interpersonal hate. This phenomenon was explored, as was {{its place in the}} triad of hostile emotions. It was theorized that interpersonal hate would be differentiated from the hostile emotions (contempt, anger, and disgust) by appraisal of violation type and by behavioral response, and that the hostile emotions could be recognized by these characteristics, as well. Specifically, it was hypothesized that interpersonal hate would be incited by autonomy violations and avoidance responses; anger would be incited by autonomy violations and approach responses; disgust would be incited by divinity violations and avoidance responses; and contempt would be incited by community <b>violations</b> and avoidance <b>responses.</b> In Study 1, participants were shown scenarios that depicted violation types of autonomy, community, and divinity, combined with either approach or avoidance responses. Results indicated that participants recognized interpersonal hate when shown depictions of autonomy <b>violations</b> and avoidance <b>responses.</b> However, the expected patterns of appraisal and behavior were not so clearly supported for the hostile emotions. In Study 2, the same scenarios were used, but participants were either shown all avoidance behavior scenarios, or all approach behavior scenarios. Again, interpersonal hate was rated higher in scenarios depicting violations of autonomy and avoidance responses, but the hostile emotions did not reveal expected patterns of results. Support for the hostile emotions was mixed, and suggests that further research and theoretical development in this area is warranted. Across two studies, conducted in two different populations, interpersonal hate was identified by participants by the predicted appraisal of autonomy violation and avoidance behavior. It is concluded that interpersonal hate is an emotion, that it occurs when someone feels a violation to the self that they wish to avoid, and that it behaves in a predictable pattern, similar to other emotions...|$|R

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that even if ballast water exchange is mandatory, without strong enforcement, compliance with regulations may be significantly lower than that reported by vessels. Meaningful evaluation of ballast water regulations should therefore take into account predicted <b>violation</b> rates in <b>response</b> to enforcement. To address this issue, I present a framework for simulating the violation-enforcement relationship, in which the output is the proportion of vessels that violate ballast water regulations. I apply the simulated violation results to a simple dose-response model to evaluate {{the relative importance of}} the relationship between violation rate and invasion rate. Results demonstrate that the benefit of improving (or even accurately quantifying) the violation rate is highly dependent on the biological uncertainty in the relationship between ballast water and establishment of invasive species. As for minimizing the violation rate, the best allocation of an enforcement budget is robust to the model assumptions explored here...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid - 1980 s, Indonesia has rapidly deregulated. Employment opportunities, income {{generation}} capacity, {{and the opportunity}} to negotiate better working conditions have expanded. Many Indonesians are concerned that workers have not shared in economic development benefits and think that a minimum wage increase would bring bottom wages up and reduce wage differentials. Additionally, international agencies have criticized Indonesia for labor standard <b>violations.</b> In <b>response,</b> the Indonesian government has increased workers'statuary rights and removed collective bargaining obstacles. Real minimum wages doubled between 1988 and 1995. Regulation enforcement toughened. Manufacturing employment expansion has broaden statutory rights coverage, requiring enforcement. The government should close the gap between statutory rights and voluntary agreed-on working conditions. It must correct legal standards and reduce labor dispute intervention. Current labor regulations inhibit constructive discourse between workers and employers on: dismissal, dispute resolution mechanisms, and social security contributions. Appropriate legislative action in job safety and child labor is needed. Inviting public intervention rather than allowing strikes and lockouts to operate isolates negotiation from market conditions. While labor regulation should facilitate voluntary employer and worker agreements, it often discourages job creation. Keeping Indonesia's economy competitive requires an industrial relations system relying on voluntary wage and working condition negotiations. The tasks workers perform and the employers for whom they perform them must be subject to change. This process is a normal feature of healthy labor markets.
