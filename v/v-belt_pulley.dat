50|$|The Renault 16's engine's {{design was}} well-suited to Lotus's requirements. It used an {{aluminium}} block with cast-iron cylinder liners, which saved appreciable weight {{compared to the}} cast-iron blocks more common at the time. It's overhead-valve design had the camshaft located high-up in the block, resulting in a compact valve-train well suited for high-rpm operation. Most importantly, all the engine ancillaries (water pump, belt-drives, alternator) were driven off a <b>v-belt</b> <b>pulley</b> fixed to the transaxle end of the camshaft instead of being driven by the engine's crankshaft. When fitted to the Europa, this pulley location put all the engine's ancillaries at its rear face giving easy access for maintenance, rather than them being located hard against the vehicle's bulkhead as-for most conventional engines.|$|E

40|$|In the {{performance}} of force-coupled <b>V-belt</b> <b>pulley</b> mechanisms, friction forces play quite important role. Surface friction coefficient affecting friction force changes {{as a function of}} the environmental conditions prevailing around the system. Because of this feature, efficiency of the mechanism depends on the environmental conditions in the working space. In this study, experiments have been conducted in various moisture and temperature conditions and at the condition presence of various material particles and dust such as chalk, cement, sand, synthetic fiber and flour. Thus, slipping of pulleys relative to each other as a function of environmental conditions have been determined. Slipping values have been shown graphically. It was seen that relative moisture of the air slightly affects total slippage and as relative moisture of the air was kept constant, slipping values increased exponentially with temperature. On the other hand, at the condition including various material particles and dust the slippage was affected by particles and dust depending on their feature and structure...|$|E
40|$|The design {{objective}} is {{to come up with}} a mower that is portable, durable, easy to operate and maintain. It also aims to design a self-powered mower of electrical source; a cordless electric lawn mower. The heart of the machine is a battery-powered dc electric motor. It comprises of a system of speed multiplication pulleys which drive the cutting blades and the charging unit comprising of a 12 V alternator and a lift mechanism meant to alter the height of cut. This is achieved by means of a system of <b>v-belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> with minimal slip effect; collapsible blades to reduce the common problem of wear. The use of collapsible blades and incorporation of an alternator for recharging the battery make the design unique such that no engine is involved. Performance test gave a cutting efficiency of 89. 55 % with 0. 24 kN human effort. Thus, the machine is considered highly efficient and is readily adaptable to different cutting conditions...|$|R

50|$|In {{this most}} common CVT system, {{there are two}} <b>V-belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> that are split {{perpendicular}} to their axes of rotation, with a V-belt running between them. The gear ratio is changed by moving the two sheaves of one pulley closer together and the two sheaves of the other pulley farther apart. The V-shaped {{cross section of the}} belt causes it to ride higher on one pulley and lower on the other. This changes the effective diameters of both pulleys, which changes the overall gear ratio. As the distance between the pulleys and the length of the belt does not change both pulleys must be adjusted (one bigger, the other smaller) simultaneously {{in order to maintain the}} proper amount of tension on the belt. Simple CVTs combining a centrifugal drive pulley with a spring loaded driven pulley often use belt tension to effect the conforming adjustments in the driven <b>pulley.</b> The <b>V-belt</b> needs to be very stiff in the pulley's axial direction in order to make only short radial movements while sliding in and out of the pulleys.|$|R

The issues is taking the raw bag material used for harvest and cutting it to a specified length. The material comes on a 2000 ft. spool {{and needs to be}} cut to a length of 54 in. Using an existing but out dated machine, a bench mark was made that the new design must be 10 % more efficient for the customer to invest money into building the machine. Using mechanical machine design and computer designing software the machine was designed to the customer specifications. The design was a free standing steel frame, powered by an electric motor with a <b>v-belt</b> <b>pulley</b> system to transfer the power. The design featured safety improvement as well a reduction in size. The overall design was an improvement from the current machine being used because it was able to be moved and disassembled easily.

40|$|The torque {{measurement}} {{has been a}} challenge especially for low torques. The amplification of the torque with either pulleys or gears is one way out, but it introduces its own losses and affects {{the accuracy of the}} measurand. The magnetic force applied to the flywheel is one of the nascent option which is explored in this present work. The prime mover is low power impulse steam turbine, but a 50 W generic universal electrical motor is opted for prime mover. The speed being very high, it is reduced at 4 times with corresponding amplification in torque. A properly bearing supported shaft with flywheel is coupled to this motor through <b>V-belt</b> <b>pulleys.</b> The electromagnets are applied at the circumference with predefined gap. The arrangement to vary this gap is provided on the setup. The three DC voltages are applied to electromagnets for so as to produce three different magnitudes.

Hence, thus calibrated force i. e. torque shall enable to estimate the power developed, which is essentially useful for efficiency calculations.

They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly trapezoidal (hence the name [...] "V"). The [...] "V" [...] shape of the belt tracks in a mating groove in the pulley (or sheave), {{with the result that}} the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases—the greater the load, the greater the wedging action—improving torque transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than flat belts. V-belts trump flat belts with their small center distances and high reduction ratios. The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys. Optimal speed range is [...] <b>V-belts</b> need larger <b>pulleys</b> for their thicker cross-section than flat belts.|$|R
