5|$|In 1982, Ian Gillan {{announced}} the band would fold, as {{he needed to}} rest his damaged vocal cords. The tone and style of his singing changed considerably when he eventually returned. His <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> more nasal tone and this can be heard on albums he has made from 1983 to the present day. His use of multi-tracked backing vocals also became highly prominent. The rest of the band Gillan, particularly McCoy and Towns, were not happy at the sudden disbanding of the group so soon after the success of Magic, and sued Gillan for royalties.|$|E
5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
25|$|With Britten, Pears was {{a co-founder}} of the Aldeburgh Festival in 1947 and the Britten-Pears School in 1972. After Britten died in 1976, Pears {{remained}} {{an active participant in}} the festival and the school, where he was director of singing. His own <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> distinctive timbre, not to all tastes, but such was his musical skill that he could use the voice to good effect in many styles of music.|$|E

25|$|Her <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{distinctive}} character which the Italians call a lirico spinto, marked by its quick vibrato, incisive diction, intensity of attack and unwavering emotional impact. During her career she performed {{with many of}} the contemporary greats of opera—Beniamino Gigli, Claudia Muzio, Jussi Björling, and Franco Corelli. She worked with some of the best conductors of her time, but it is her work with Toscanini that has endured. Despite her talent and numerous performances, she was not the best known of her contemporaries, overshadowed in her day by Zinka Milanov, Maria Callas, Victoria de los Ángeles and Renata Tebaldi.|$|E
25|$|In April 1970, Lake left King Crimson and {{reunited with}} Emerson, along with drummer Carl Palmer of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown and Atomic Rooster {{to form the}} {{progressive}} rock supergroup, Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Lake began with a Fender bass before he switched to a Gibson Ripper. As well as bass, Lake contributed acoustic and electric guitar work to Emerson Lake & Palmer, and his <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wider and more diverse range than anything The Nice had recorded. Emerson, Lake & Palmer {{became one of the}} most successful groups in the 1970s. Lake became known for performing on a Persian carpet on stage, which originally sold for £1,500 and, by 1976, had increased its value to £7,000. In addition, Lake would change his guitar strings after each show on tour.|$|E

500|$|Jodi Benson, who was {{predominantly}} a stage actress, {{was chosen}} to voice Ariel because the directors felt [...] "it was really important {{to have the same}} person doing the singing and speaking voice". Clements stated that Benson's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> unique [...] "sweetness" [...] and [...] "youthfulness". When recording the vocals for [...] "Part of Your World", Benson asked that the lights in the studio be dimmed, to create the feeling of being deep under the sea. [...] "Part of Your World", which was referred to by songwriter Howard Ashman as the [...] "I Want" [...] song, was originally going to be cut from the final film, owing to Jeffrey Katzenberg's belief that it slowed the story down, but Ashman and Keane fought to keep it in.|$|E
500|$|The song is an uptempo pop, dance-pop and R {{song with}} a synthy production, {{written in the}} key of G major with a time {{signature}} in common time and a tempo of 123 beats per minute. The vocal range spans from E3 to D5. The basic chord progression of the song is Am, G, D, G, Bm, and Em. In the middle eight it features a breakdown where the song's usual instruments are replaced with hand claps whilst some of the media reported that Cole's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Whitney Houston-like tone to it. NME magazine reported that some people noticed similarities between the song and a 2007 song [...] "Lil Star" [...] by American singer Kelis, though Cole's representatives denied any similarities. Meanwhile, other media outlets reported that [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] has a similar chord progression to [...] "All My Life" [...] by K-Ci & JoJo. The song was later covered by British boyband The Wanted, who released it as the B-side to their number-one single, [...] "All Time Low".|$|E
2500|$|On January 14, 1957 Allen excited much {{attention}} for her {{portrayal of the}} title heroine in Arthur Honegger's Judith in a concert performance of the work with the American Concert Choir and Orchestra under conductor Margaret Hillis at Town Hall. Critic Edward Downes said of her performance, [...] "Allen sang {{the music of the}} first two acts without apparent effort. Her <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> rich, true mezzo-soprano quality with a brilliant top, and dark reedy chest tones. It was so beautifully placed and focused that it gave the impression of being larger than it was. Her piano and even pianissimo singing had the velvet quality that carries so beautifully through an auditorium. She was a figure of regal dignity, yet she showed dramatic temperament, too." [...] In December 1957 she was a soloist in the Oratorio Society of New York's performances of Handel's Messiah.|$|E

2500|$|Proto-Germanic verbs {{have three}} moods: indicative, subjunctive and imperative. [...] The subjunctive mood {{derives from the}} PIE optative mood. [...] Indicative and subjunctive moods are fully {{conjugated}} throughout the present and past, while the imperative mood existed only {{in the present tense}} and lacked first-person forms. [...] Proto-Germanic verbs have two voices, active and passive, the latter deriving from the PIE mediopassive voice. [...] The Proto-Germanic passive existed only in the present tense (an inherited feature, as the PIE perfect had no mediopassive). [...] On the evidence of Gothic—the only Germanic language with a reflex of the Proto-Germanic passive—the passive <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> significantly reduced inflectional system, with a single form used for all persons of the dual and plural. [...] Note that, although Old Norse has an inflected mediopassive, it is not inherited from Proto-Germanic, but is an innovation formed by attaching the reflexive pronoun to the active voice.|$|E
