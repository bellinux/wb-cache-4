50|$|AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric protein {{composed}} of a catalytic alpha subunit, a noncatalytic beta subunit, and a noncatalytic regulatory gamma subunit. Various forms {{of each of these}} subunits exist, encoded by different genes. AMPK is an important energy-sensing enzyme that monitors cellular energy status and functions by inactivating key enzymes involved in regulating de novo biosynthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol. This gene {{is a member of the}} AMPK gamma subunit family and encodes a protein with four CBS domains. Mutations in this gene have been associated with <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation</b> (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), progressive conduction system disease and cardiac hypertrophy.

40|$|Over {{a period}} of five years 12 {{patients}} underwent electrophysiological studies for the investigation of recurrent tachycardias which showed <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation.</b> Nine patients had a type B pattern and two a type A. One patient had episodes of both types. Dual atrioventricular nodal pathways were found in six of seven patients with atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia mechanisms. Single direct atrioventricular accessory pathways were present in four patients, single nodoventricular pathways in five, and multiple pathways in three. Twenty one tachycardias were induced, of which 13 showed <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation.</b> Five patients had nodoventricular pathway conduction during atrioventricular nodal tachycardia and one during atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia. Only three patients had simple antidromic tachycardia and one additional atrioventricular nodal tachycardia with bystander atrioventricular accessory conduction. Three patients had three different tachycardias, three had two types, and six had one type. Thus junctional tachycardias showing <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation</b> are often associated with multiple mechanisms and complex anatomical and functional substrates.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the relationship between hemodynamic and ventricular dyssynchrony parameters in patients undergoing simultaneous and sequential biventricular pacing (BVP). BackgroundVarious echocardiographic parameters of ventricular dyssynchrony have been proposed to screen and optimize BVP therapy. MethodsForty-one patients with heart failure undergoing BVP implantation were studied. Echocardiography coupled with tissue tracking and pulsed Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) was performed before and after BVP implantation and {{after three months of}} optimized BVP. Indexes of inter- or intraventricular dyssynchrony were correlated with hemodynamic changes during simultaneous and sequential BVP (10 intervals of right ventricular [RV] or left <b>ventricular</b> [LV] <b>pre-excitation).</b> ResultsVariations in intra-LV delaypeak, intra-LV delayonset, and index of LV dyssynchrony measured by pulsed DTI were highly correlated with those of cardiac output (r = − 0. 67, r = − 0. 64, and r = − 0. 67, respectively; p < 0. 001) and mitral regurgitation (r = 0. 68, r = 0. 63, and r = 0. 68, respectively; p < 0. 001), whereas variations in the extent of myocardium displaying delayed longitudinal contraction (r = − 0. 48 and r = 0. 51, respectively; p < 0. 05) and the variations in septal-to-posterior wall motion delay (r = − 0. 41, p < 0. 05 and r = 0. 24, p = NS, respectively) were less correlated. The changes in interventricular dyssynchrony were not significantly correlated (p = NS). Compared with simultaneous BVP, individually optimized sequential BVP significantly increased cardiac output (p < 0. 01), decreased mitral regurgitation (p < 0. 05), and improved all parameters of intra-LV dyssynchrony (p < 0. 01). At three months, a significant reverse mechanical LV remodeling was observed with significantly decreased LV volumes (p < 0. 01) associated with an increased LV ejection fraction (p = 0. 035). ConclusionsSpecific echocardiographic measurements of ventricular dyssynchrony are highly correlated with hemodynamic changes and may be a useful adjunct in the selection and optimization of BVP.

BackgroundSudden death can be the first clinical manifestation in asymptomatic children with <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation,</b> but reduction of its incidence by prophylactic ablation requires the identification of subjects at high risk. MethodsBetween 1995 and 2005 we prospectively collected clinical and electrophysiologic data from 184 children (66 % male; median age 10 years; range 8 to 12 years) with asymptomatic <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation</b> on the electrocardiogram. After electrophysiologic testing, subjects were followed as outpatients taking no medications. The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of arrhythmic events. Predictors of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias were analyzed. ResultsOver a median follow-up of 57 months (min/max 32 / 90 months) after electrophysiologic testing, 133 children (mean age 10 years; range 8 to 12 years) did not experience arrhythmic events, remaining totally asymptomatic, while 51 children had within 20 months (min/max 8 / 60 months) a first arrhythmic event, which was potentially life-threatening in 19 of them (mean age 10 years; range 10 to 14 years). Life-threatening tachyarrhythmias resulted in cardiac arrest (3 patients), syncope (3 patients), atypical symptoms (8 patients), or minimal symptoms (5 patients). Univariate analysis identified tachyarrhythmia inducibility (p < 0. 001), anterograde refractory period of accessory pathways (APERP) ≤ 240 ms (p < 0. 001), and multiple accessory pathways (p < 0. 001) as risk factors for potentially life-threatening arrhythmic events. Independent predictors by multivariate analysis were APERP (p = 0. 001) and multiple accessory pathway (p = 0. 001). ConclusionsThese findings are potentially relevant in terms of early identification of high-risk asymptomatic children with <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation.</b> Subjects with short APERPs and multiple pathways are at higher risk of developing life-threatening arrhythmic events and are the best candidates for prophylactic ablation...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{retrospective}} study was planned {{for a good}} risk assessment of asymptomatic patients affected by <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation.</b> METHODS: From 1985 to 2007, 124 patients with an atrioventricular pathway (electrocardiographic signs of <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation)</b> were admitted to our cardiology division. The average age was 7 years (range 1 month to 18 years). The mean follow-up period in the whole population of patients was 4. 2 years (range 1 - 13 years). Four patients were lost during the follow-up. During this period, all patients remained in good health. In all of them, we performed a Holter evaluation every year. An intermittent pathway was detected in 18 patients (15 %), and four of them (3. 4 %) showed a supraventricular tachycardia {{even though they were}} asymptomatic patients. An ergometric test was performed in 76 asymptomatic patients; 16 children (21 %) showed a total abrupt vanishing of delta wave. A transoesophageal electrophysiological evaluation was performed in 14 patients.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} with <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation</b> A previously fit {{and well}} 25 -year-old man presented with palpitations and dizziness. His pulse was irregular and tachy-cardic (162 bpm). His admission ECG is shown (figure 1). The ECG demonstrates a broad-complex tachycardia which, {{in contrast to}} ventricular tachycardia, is irregularly-irregular in rhythm with a delayed R-wave upstroke (delta wave). This is typical of atrial fibrillation (AF) with <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation.</b> He was successfully cardioverted with intravenous flecainide. The postcardioversion ECG (figure 2) demonstrates sinus rhythm, short P-R interval and delta waves, consistent with an atrioventricular accessory pathway (AP). The diagnosis is therefore WolffeParkinsoneWhite (WPW) syndrome. The AP was subsequently ablated, with normalisation of the ECG. WPW syndrome is characterised by premature ventricular activation due to AP conduction bypassing the atrioventricular node. AF is commonly associated with WPW and, if AP conduction is rapid, can potentially degrade into ventricular fibrillation. Haemodynamically unstable patients require immediate electrical cardioversion. More stable patients may be treated chemically with intravenous flecainide, procainamide or ibutilide. It {{is important to note}} that atrioventricular nodal blocking agents such as digoxin, b-blockers, adenosine, verap-amil and diltiazem are contraindicated in pre-excited AF since they augment AP conduction, predisposing to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death.

40|$|It was {{recently}} shown that supernormal conduction in the diseased His-Purkinje system {{is more common}} than previously thought, and is always associated with prolongation of refractoriness. To assess whether supernormal conduction could also occur in the accessory pathway of patients with <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation,</b> 21 patients with manifestly prolonged refractoriness in the accessory pathway were studied. Under these conditions, programmed atrial stimulation revealed a phase of supernormal conduction in 16 (76 %) of the 21. Therefore, what {{was believed to be}} a nonexistent or exceptional physiologic event was shown to be a rather common finding, at least under certain circumstances. Supernormal conduction occurred in all 7 patients with an anterograde refractory period of 480 to 980 ms, and in 5 of 10 patients with a refractory period > 1. 0 second or with no anterograde conduction. Supernormal conduction could not be demonstrated in four patients with a refractory period ≤ 440 ms, but appearedin all four patients after the refractory period was prolonged by a rapid rate of stimulation or administration of ajmaline. The electrophysiologic changes underlying the occurrence of supernormal conduction in the accessory pathway are similar to those previously reported for the bundle branch system. The demonstration of supernormal conduction in the accessory pathway may uncover the presence of concealed <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation.</b> Supernormal conduction over the accessory pathway may facilitate a rapid ventricular response during atrial fibrillation, even if the refractory period is prolonged...|$|E

In the eight patients with an active left bypass tract, the onset, upstroke and peak of the left ventricular phase histogram preceded those of the right ventricular histogram.

Congenital abnormalities in CCS, as well as ectopic orinappropriate induction of CCS tissue in the mature heart, may be processes that contribute to, orcause, cardiac conduction disturbance and arrhythmia in adults. Understanding the signallingmechanisms that give rise to normal development of the CCS may thus provide insight into cardiacdisease...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{usefulness of}} the vectorcardiogram is well documented by the numerous reports published in the last 3 decades. It has been found more reliable than the electrocardiogram for the diagnosis of atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy. It is more sensitive than the electrocardiogram in the recognition of myocardial infarction, especially if the infarction is inferior or if it occurs {{in the presence of}} left bundle branch block or left anterior hemiblock. It is helpful in the diagnosis of <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation</b> and in the localization of the bypass tract. Some repolarization abnormalities are more clearly demonstrated by the vector display. However, some information, such as that on cardiac chamber size and myocardial damage, can also be obtained by other noninvasive tests that are often performed on the same patients. With the increasing awareness of cost-effectiveness of various laboratory procedures in medicine, the vectorcardiogram should no longer be considered a routine cardiac test and should be requested only for a specific clinical purpose. When properly utilized, vectorcardiography should remain a valuable diagnostic as well as teaching tool...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Pre-excitation {{is based}} on an {{accessory}} conduction pathway between the atrium and ventricle. The term Wolff- Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is used for patients with the pre-excitation/WPW pattern associated with AP-related tachycardia. Case Outline. We present a 52 -year-old man with severe palpitation, fatigue, lightheadedness and difficulty breathing. The initial ECG showed tachyarrhythmia with heart rate between 240 and 300 /min. He was treated with antiarrhythmics (Digitalis, Verapamil, Lidocaine) with no response. Then, the patient was treated with electrical cardioversion and was referred to our Clinic for further evaluation with the diagnosis: “Ventricular tachycardia”. During in-hospital stay, the previously undiagnosed WPW pattern had been seen. Additional diagnostic tests confirmed permanent pre-excitacion pattern (ECG Holter recording, exercises test). The patient was referred to an electrophysiologist for further evaluation. Mapping techniques provided an accurate assessment of the position of the accessory pathway which was left lateral. The elimination of the accessory pathway by radiofrequent catheter ablation is highly effective in termination and elimination of tacchyarrhythmias. Conclusion. Symptomatic, life-threatening arrhythmia, first considered as ventricular tachycardia, reflected atrial fibrillation with <b>ventricular</b> <b>pre-excitation</b> over an accessory pathway in a patient with previously undiagnosed WPW syndrome...|$|E
