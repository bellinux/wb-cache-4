2500|$|There {{are also}} many {{companies}} that sell carbon credits to commercial and individual customers {{who are interested}} in lowering their carbon footprint on a voluntary basis. These carbon offsetters purchase the credits from an investment fund or a carbon development company that has aggregated the credits from individual projects. [...] Buyers and sellers can also use an exchange platform to trade, which is like a stock exchange for carbon credits. [...] The quality of the credits is based in part on the <b>validation</b> <b>process</b> and sophistication of the fund or development company that acted as the sponsor to the carbon project. This is reflected in their price; voluntary units typically have less value than the units sold through the rigorously validated Clean Development Mechanism.|$|E

A model-based approach is needed for both design and <b>validation</b> <b>processes</b> in order to manage the complexity and validate the conformance to safety requirements. In this paper, a SysML-based approach merging MBSE and MBSA is presented. This approach is applied to a Flight Control System (FCS) both for the design and the <b>validation</b> <b>processes.</b> A parallel is made to compare the models used {{in each of these}} processes.
