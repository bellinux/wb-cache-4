5|$|After Bab el Wad, {{the road}} wound to Jerusalem through deep, narrow valleys, over steep spurs, {{and around the}} {{shoulders}} of rocky hills. There were other ways through the hills, but they were a tangle of unmapped, rough and rocky hill tracks and pathways—often little more than donkey tracks—which made movement by infantry, dismounted cavalry, and artillery very difficult. The rough tracks meandered through narrow valleys and over distorted piles of razor-backed ridges, which were broken by groups of cone-shaped hills and successive shelves of rock jutting out from every hillside at intervals of a few yards. It was <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> advances to the north or south of the main road to be supported by artillery. In heavy rain and cold, wet and muddy conditions, it {{was found to be}} impossible to deploy the 75th Division's guns off the road. These guns had been brought forward by teams of up to eight horses to a gun the day before.|$|E

5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food {{was available in}} the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back {{to live with the}} older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E

He also played badminton, and he excelled in paddleball, being <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to beat <b>for</b> several years. On account of his four national titles, his championship paddle is a permanent trophy in a display kiosk near the racquetball courts at the University of Michigan where the sport of paddleball was born. He dominated the sport {{for most of the}} 1960s and his last national paddleball championship came in 1968 after which he was eclipsed by his pupil Charlie Brumfield.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{packaging}} {{development is}} a multidimensional task between image economical and ecological aspects and legislative facts. It is shown that development strategies are much dependent on the specific application; generalizations are <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible.</b> Conditions <b>for</b> the success of flexible packaging systems are: Systems with high material input will be substituted, stable returnable transit packaging systems will be introduced waste management strategies will be opened into the direction of energy recovery. Conditions for a possible success of biodegradable packagings: Biological methods for use of biowaste will be widely introduced with broad acceptance by the population and by the government. However, a conversion to usable substances (biogas, high quality compost) has to be attained. For both classes of packaging systems, the key target is to attain a good functionality. As a method to improve functional properties, barrier coating with thin inorganic layer is shown as an example...|$|R

25|$|After Daisies the {{government}} {{made it very}} difficult for Chytilová to find work within Czechoslovakia, even though she was never officially classified as a 'blacklisted' director. Her follow-up film Ovoce stromů rajských jíme (Fruit of Paradise, 1969) was her last film before the Soviet Union invasion of 1968. After the Soviet Union invasion it was <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Chytilová to find work and she resorted to directing commercials under her husband’s name, Jaroslav Kučera.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{absorption}} of Independent Fianna Fáil and its sole TD, Niall Blaney into Fianna Fáil, there were then three outgoing Fianna Fáil TDs in this very competitive three-seater constituency. Under the Single transferable vote proportional representation electoral system used in Ireland, it was considered <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> all three to be elected. Fianna Fáil's Cecilia Keaveney lost her seat to the Fine Gael candidate Joe McHugh, with McDaid and Blaney being the two successful Fianna Fáil candidates.|$|E
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on {{judicial}} politics in three international regimes. The courts of these regimes are trustee courts, operating {{in an environment of}} judicial supremacy with respect to states. An international trustee court meets three criteria: (1) the court is the authoritative interpreter of the regime’s law; (2) the court’s jurisdiction is compulsory; and (3) it is <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible,</b> in practice, <b>for</b> contracting states to reverse the court’s important rulings. After developing a theory of trusteeship, we turn to how judges have used their powers. Although there is variation, each court has engaged in “majoritarian activism,” producing law that reflects standard practices or a high degree of state consensus but {{that would not have been}} adopted by states under unanimity decision rules. Majoritarian activism helps judges to develop the law progressively, to mitigate potential legitimacy problems, and to render efforts at curbing the growth of their authority improbable or ineffective...|$|R
50|$|Here the patentees {{have joined}} {{hands with the}} two largest {{competitors}} in the industry and by terms of their agreement have <b>virtually</b> made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> others to obtain rights under those patents. The contract even gives Stearns and Besser the power to restrict competition present and future by requiring their joint consent before licensing others. It is this combination requiring collective action that primarily invalidates the agreement. We believe {{it clear that the}} parties intended this contract to be a means whereby control of the industry could be acquired and competition eliminated. For what other reason would Besser or Stearns want the consent of the other before approving a licensee suggested by the patentees? And where it is apparent, as it is here, that the contract is to eliminate competition, it must be held illegal.|$|R
30|$|Our {{study has}} several limitations. Since it is observational, {{unblinded}} outcome assessment is unavoidable. Patients were not randomised and the cohorts are heterogeneous, with significant imbalances at baseline (e.g. severity scores, prevalence of sepsis) and many potential confounders on outcome. Even {{though we are}} confident {{that we were able to}} identify most of them and perform an appropriate adjustment, several approaches to adjusting the data are possible. It appears <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to account <b>for</b> the different severity of illness in the colloid cohort versus the crystalloid cohort without using adjustment parameters that are also influenced by disease progress. Thus, both risks of residual confounding and overadjustment exist. As a consequence, the adjusted results should be interpreted with caution. However, the small adjusted confidence intervals around or below 1 strongly suggest neutrality of the investigated colloids in terms of mortality and AKI. Unfortunately, although the analysis plan for the major endpoints (AKI, 90 -day and ICU mortality) was designed a priori, no statistical analysis plan has been pre-published, which would have further strengthened the present results.|$|R
25|$|It {{was held}} that (1) the equal {{protection}} clause was violated by the Ohio election laws, which made it <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> any party except the Republican and Democratic Parties to qualify on the ballot, and (2) the American Independent Party was, and the Socialist Labor Party was not, entitled to have its name placed on the ballots, because the former promptly sought injunctive relief in the United States Supreme Court, thus avoiding interruption of the state's electoral process, and the latter delayed in seeking such relief.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{unification}} of Italy in 1861, a wide and increasing economic divide has been noticeably growing between the northern provinces and the southern half of the Italian state. In {{the early decades of}} the new kingdom, the lack of an effective land reform, heavy taxes and other economic measures imposed on the South, together with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods, made the situation <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> many tenant farmers and land owners. Multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meager living, especially from 1892 to 1921.|$|E
25|$|The laws {{included}} {{safety standards}} and specifications that were <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> barnstormers to meet, and restrictions on how low in altitude certain tricks could be performed (making {{it harder for}} spectators {{to see what was}} happening). The military also stopped selling Jennys in the late 1920s. This made it too difficult for barnstormers to make a living. Clyde Pangborn, who was pilot of the two-man aviation team who were the first to cross the Pacific Ocean nonstop in 1931, ended his barnstorming career in 1931. Some pilots, however, continued to wander the country giving rides as late as fall 1941.|$|E

25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{elaborate}} computerized {{early warning}} {{systems such as}} Defense Support Program were developed to detect incoming Soviet attacks and to coordinate response strategies. During this same period, intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) systems were developed that could deliver a nuclear payload across vast distances, allowing the U.S. to house nuclear forces capable of hitting the Soviet Union in the American Midwest. Shorter-range weapons, including small tactical weapons, were fielded in Europe as well, including nuclear artillery and man-portable Special Atomic Demolition Munition. The development of submarine-launched ballistic missile systems allowed for hidden nuclear submarines to covertly launch missiles at distant targets as well, making it <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the Soviet Union to successfully launch a first strike attack against the United States without receiving a deadly response.|$|E
25|$|In versus-fighting games, a draw {{occurs when}} both players end the match through a double KO; or via time over, {{with the same}} {{percentage}} of life bar. For example, some of these games, such as Street Fighter and Tekken, require two winning rounds to win the match, and if after a third round the score ends in a 1–1 draw, the players have to fight again in an extra round. If this extra round ends in a draw, the game will end for both players. In Mortal Kombat, if a round ends when the time runs out and both players have complete life bars, the game ends for both players, because due to Mortal Kombats gameplay (in which every common hit takes block damage) it is <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a round to end tied, {{and that means the}} players were not playing for real. In the Super Smash Bros. series, if two players have equal lives {{at the end of a}} tied match a sudden death period begins with each player having 300% damage, essentially making it so a single hit can win the game.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Marines of Task Force X-Ray {{had little}} or no urban combat experience, and the US troops were not trained for urban close-quarters combat, so this battle was {{especially}} tough for them. Due to Huế's religious and cultural status, Allied forces were ordered not to bomb or shell the city, for fear of destroying the historic structures. Also, since it was still monsoon season in that area of the country with heavy rain and low clouds on many days during the battle, it was <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the U.S. forces to use air support. But as the intensity of the battle increased, the policy was eliminated. PAVN tactics were to hold the Marines close, negating the use of artillery and air support. A forward fighting line was maintained directly opposite the Marines with a secondary line 2 blocks back. Each building on the fighting lines was defended by snipers and machine guns, while spider holes were dug in gardens and streets, creating cross-fire between all buildings and streets. If the Marines penetrated the forward line the PAVN moved to the secondary line and then reoccupied the abandoned positions at night.|$|E
