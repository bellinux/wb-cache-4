5|$|Some anti-bathhouse activists {{argue that}} these {{measures}} are not enough, especially given that it is <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, {{they point out that}} they may be less likely to engage in anal or multipartner sexboth of which put participants at risk for contracting STDsin such situations.|$|E
5|$|Domestic competition, however, eclipsed Phonofilm. By September 1925, De Forest and Case's working {{arrangement}} {{had fallen}} through. The following July, Case joined Fox Film, Hollywood's third largest studio, to found the Fox-Case Corporation. The system developed by Case and his assistant, Earl Sponable, given the name Movietone, thus {{became the first}} viable sound-on-film technology controlled by a Hollywood movie studio. The following year, Fox purchased the North American rights to the Tri-Ergon system, though the company found it inferior to Movietone and <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> integrate the two different systems to advantage. In 1927, as well, Fox retained the services of Freeman Owens, who had particular expertise in constructing cameras for synch-sound film.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, {{it is still}} easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, it is <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that it is <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E

5|$|Months went {{by without}} any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to common {{wood and metal}} needles, antique knitting needles were sometimes made from tortoiseshell, ivory and walrus tusks; these materials are now banned due to their impact on endangered species, and needles made from them are <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> find.|$|E
25|$|Elaborate {{constraints}} {{placed on}} women's figures {{over the years}} were not universal. Corsetry made it <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> work, so simpler functional garments were worn by women who worked inside or outside the home. Support for the breasts was often provided by a simple tie under the breast line, in the bodice.|$|E
50|$|Israel did not {{withdraw}} to {{the positions of}} 28 September 2000, a key requirement of Phase I of the Roadmap. Instead, movement of Palestinians was heavily impeded by numerous roadblocks, earth mounds and checkpoints, and movement between West Bank and Gaza was <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible.</b> According <b>to</b> Israel, the Palestinians did not fulfil their obligation to end violence and terrorism, and therefore they refused to withdraw.|$|R

25|$|Critics raved, and {{the album}} sold well, but the band were {{confronted by the}} {{practical}} problem that they had created a studio masterpiece which was <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> recreate on the road. Ogdens was performed as a whole just once, and memorably, live in the studio on the BBC television programme Colour Me Pop.|$|E
25|$|The {{butterfly}} effect {{can also be}} demonstrated by very simple systems. For example, the randomness of the outcomes of throwing dice depends on this characteristic to amplify small differences in initial conditions—the precise direction, thrust, and orientation of the throw—into significantly different dice paths and outcomes, which makes it <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> throw a dice {{exactly the same way}} twice.|$|E
25|$|PXE {{acceptance}} since v2.1 {{has been}} ubiquitous; {{today it is}} <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> find a network card without PXE firmware on it. The availability of inexpensive Gigabit Ethernet hardware (NICs, switches, routers, etc.) has made PXE the fastest method available for installing an operating system on a client when competing against the classic CD, DVD, and USB flash drive alternatives.|$|E

25|$|As one descends, in {{addition}} to the normal atmospheric pressure at the surface, the water exerts increasing hydrostatic pressure of approximately 1 bar (14.7 pounds per square inch) for every 10m (33 feet) of depth. The pressure of the inhaled breath must balance the surrounding or ambient pressure to allow inflation of the lungs. It becomes <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> breathe air at normal atmospheric pressure through a tube below three feet under the water.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> train a {{child for}} a WISC test or other gifted test.

25|$|An issue arose as {{to whether}} the Admiralty should retain control of {{warehouses}} at Gibraltar, which were then underused.

25|$|Since a clear {{archetype}} {{for determining}} guilt does not exist, {{the criminal justice}} system must rely on rulings handed down by juries. Even after a decision has been made, it is <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> know whether a jury has been correct or incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime. Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task, contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} ED is {{not defined}} archaeologically, but {{political}}ly. The conquests of Sargon and his successors upset the political equilibrium throughout Iraq, Syria, and Iran. The conquests lasted many years into the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad and built on ongoing conquests during the ED. The transition is much harder to pinpoint within an archaeological context. It is <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> date a site to either ED III or Akkadian period based on ceramic or architectural evidence alone.|$|E
25|$|It prefers heavy, gravelly {{soil with}} {{excellent}} drainage, {{in a sunny}} position. It is drought tolerant, and frost tolerant down to -7°C. Plants become straggly and untidy with age, so should be pruned when young. Propagation is by seed, as the hairy stems of this plant make it <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> strike stem cuttings, and heel cuttings have been met with limited success. Germination takes three to four weeks, and has an excellent success rate. Flowering usually begins at {{three to four years}} from seed.|$|E
