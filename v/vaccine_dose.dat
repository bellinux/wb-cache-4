50|$|One very typical {{version of}} phase one studies in {{vaccines}} involves an escalation study, {{which is used}} in mainly medicinal research trials. The drug is introduced into a small cohort of healthy volunteers.

The first level of an escalation study usually has two or three groups of around 10 healthy volunteers. Each subgroup receives the same <b>vaccine</b> <b>dose,</b> which is the expected lowest dose necessary to invoke an immune response (the main goal in a vaccine - to create immunity).

Antibodies against tetanus were measured in 1433 workers and students of Padua University (Italy). The enrolment criterion was the ability to provide a booklet of vaccinations released by a public health office. The influence of age, gender, the number of <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses,</b> and the interval since the last dose was determined. Ten years after the last dose, the majority of subjects (95. 0 %) displayed an antibody titre above the protective level (≥ 0. 10 IU/ml), and half of these (49. 1 %) had a long-term protective level (≥ 1. 0 IU/ml). According to our data, titre depends on both the number of <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> and the interval since the last dose (P< 0. 0001). Five <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> and an interval of at least 10 years since the last dose are predictive of a long-term protective titre in absence of a booster (1. 97 IU/ml).

50|$|The HPV {{vaccines}} {{are based}} on hollow virus-like particles (VLPs) assembled from recombinant HPV coat proteins. The virus possesses circular double stranded DNA and a viral shell that is composed of 72 capsomeres. Every subunit of the virus is composed of two proteins molecules, L1 and L2. The reason why this virus has the capability to affect the skin and the mucous layers is due to its structure. The primary structures expressed in these areas are E1 and E2, these proteins {{are responsible for the}} replication of the virus. E1 is a highly conserved protein in the virus, E1 {{is in charge of the}} production of viral copies is also involved in every step of replication process. The second component of this process is E2 ensures that non-specific interaction occurs while interacting with E1. As a result of these proteins working together is assures that numerous amounts of copies are made within the host cell. The structure of the virus is critical because this influence the infection affinity of the virus. Knowing the structure of the virus allowed for the development of an efficient vaccine, such as Gardasil and Cervarix. The vaccines target the two high-risk HPVs, types 16 and 18 that cause the most cervical cancers. Gardasil's proteins are synthesized by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its protein makeup allows it to target four types of HPV. Gardasil contains inactive L1 proteins from four different HPV strains: 6, 11, 16, and 18.

The effect of breastfeeding on the immunogenicity of Rotarix®, a two-dose oral monovalent rotavirus vaccine, was examined in a community-based trial in New Delhi, India. Four hundred mother–infant pairs were randomized into two equal groups. Infants were aged 6 – 7 weeks at enrollment. Mothers were encouraged to either breastfeed or to withhold breastfeeding during the 30 min prior to and after each <b>vaccine</b> <b>dose</b> was administered. We collected blood specimens from infants at enrollment and 4 weeks after the second <b>vaccine</b> <b>dose.</b> Blood and breast milk specimens were obtained from mothers at baseline and breast milk specimens were collected {{at the time of}} the second <b>vaccine</b> <b>dose.</b> Seroconversion was defined as infant serum anti-VP 6 IgA antibody level of ≥ 20 IU/mL 4 weeks after the second <b>vaccine</b> <b>dose</b> and a ≥ 4 -fold rise from baseline.

In this population, the immune response to Rotarix® was not enhanced by withholding breastfeeding around the time of vaccination.

Information about additional HPV <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> received or reasons for non-completion were sought. Responses were analysed and records cross-checked against the National HPV Vaccination Program Register. Results: Of 660 parents or carers contacted, 207 (31. 4 %) responded. We found: 1) completion rates increased, an additional 122 / 207 (45. 2 %) students had completed all three doses of HPV through their general practitioner (GP); 2) under-notification of GP doses to the National HPV Vaccination Program Register was an issue with only 5 / 165 (3. 0 %) reported; 3) {{the main reason for}} non-completion was being unaware of the opportunity to catch-up at a GP. Conclusions: Underreporting by GPs of HPV <b>vaccine</b> <b>doses</b> administered and failure to complete courses identifies two opportunities to increase HPV vaccine coverage. These could be addressed by extending provision of catch-up HPV doses in school and by developing practice software solutions for automatic notification of doses from GPs. Reasons given by parents for non-completion, mostly logistical barriers, indicate a high degree of acceptance of HPV vaccination...|$|R
