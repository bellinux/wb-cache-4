In this paper, we introduce an experimental measurement approach {{for studying the}} fragmentation effects of hypervelocity impact in the laboratory. We demonstrate this method by investigating a hypervelocity impact on a thin aluminum bumper plates and tracking individual fragments in the debris clouds. The setup involves a thin laser plane illuminating the debris cloud fragments, which are recorded with a high-speed video camera. The image sequence is analyzed, yielding spatio-temporal information about each fragment in the debris cloud. This allows individual fragment size and velocity information, previously not available, to be calculated...|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} {{is currently}} {{the greatest threat to}} the avifauna of Costa Rica. To study its effects on bird species composition in the Monteverde region, I surveyed three sites of <b>varying</b> degrees of <b>fragmentation.</b> I did not detect {{a significant difference in the}} species richness and heterogeneity among the three sites. My study showed, however, that the species composition changed drastically among sites. Furthermore, the predominant feeding guilds of the species unique to each site changed between sites, suggesting that food availability is an important determinant of where a bird lives. The proportion of insectivores was inversely related to fragmentation, and omnivores are perhaps less affected by fragmentation than other feeding guilds because they are able to use a higher variety of food resources. Certain species were only found at the more continuous sites, including the Black-breasted Wood-quail (Odontophorus leucolaemus), which implies they may be more sensitive to habitat fragmentation...|$|R
40|$|Particle {{transport}} {{in random}} media obeying a given mixing statistics is key in several applications in nuclear reactor physics and more generally in diffusion phenomena emerging in optics and life sciences. Exact {{solutions for the}} ensemble-averaged physical observables are hardly available, and several approximate models have been thus developed, providing a compromise between the accurate treatment of the disorder-induced spatial correlations and the computational time. In order to validate these models, it is mandatory to resort to reference solutions in benchmark configurations, typically obtained by explicitly generating by Monte Carlo methods several realizations of random media, simulating particle transport in each realization, and finally taking the ensemble averages for the quantities of interest. In this context, intense research efforts have been devoted to Poisson (Markov) mixing statistics, where benchmark solutions have been derived for transport in one-dimensional geometries. In a recent work, we have generalized these solutions to two and three-dimensional configurations, and shown how dimension affects the simulation results. In this paper we will {{examine the impact of}} mixing statistics: to this aim, we will compare the reflection and transmission probabilities, as well as the particle flux, for three-dimensional random media obtained by resorting to Poisson, Voronoi and Box stochastic tessellations. For each tessellation, we will furthermore discuss the effects of <b>varying</b> the <b>fragmentation</b> of the stochastic geometry, the material compositions, and the cross sections of the transported particles.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of infected Ixodid ticks {{is an important}} component of human risk of Lyme disease, and various empirical studies have shown that this is associated, at least in part, to landscape fragmentation. In this study, we aimed at exploring how <b>varying</b> woodland <b>fragmentation</b> patterns affect the risk of Lyme disease, through infected tick abundance. A cellular automata model was developed, incorporating a heterogeneous landscape with three interactive components: an age-structured tick population, a classical disease transmission function, and hosts. A set of simplifying assumptions were adopted with respect to the study objective and field data limitations. In the model, the landscape influences both tick survival and host movement. The validation of the model was performed with an empirical study. Scenarios of various landscape configurations (focusing on woodland fragmentation) were simulated and compared. Lyme disease risk indices (density and infection prevalence of nymphs) differed considerably between scenarios: (i) the risk could be higher in highly fragmented woodlands, which is supported by a number of recently published empirical studies, and (ii) grassland could reduce the risk in adjacent woodland, which suggests landscape fragmentation studies of zoonotic diseases should not focus on the patch-level woodland patterns only, but also on landscape-level adjacent land cover patterns. Further analysis of the simulation results indicated strong correlations between Lyme disease risk indices and the density, shape and aggregation level of woodland patches. These findings highlight the strong effect of the spatial patterns of local hos...|$|R
40|$|Compressive, tortional and {{abrasive}} deforming {{forces are}} translated to the limbs during high energy trauma. The long bones may be fractured in many patterns with a <b>varying</b> extent of <b>fragmentation</b> and comminution but the soft-tissues appear {{to absorb the}} forces in a predictable way. We retrospectively reviewed a series of 79 complex limb injuries treated in a dedicated centre where the clinical notes and photo-documentation were meticulously kept and where the outcomes were known. The soft-tissue injuries were then described and revealed four patterns of injury: abrasion/avulsion, non-circumferential degloving, circumferential single plane and circumferential multi-plane degloving. These patterns occurred either in isolation or occasionally in combination. Resuturing of degloved skin was only successful in non-circumferential (pattern 2) cases. Radical excision of devitalised tissue followed by soft-tissue reconstruction in a single procedure was successful in all patterns apart from pattern 4 (circumferential multi-plane degloving). In pattern 4 we recommend serial wound excision prior to reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Inter-Research 2002 Habitat loss {{leads to}} a {{reduction}} in number of remnant habitats in continuous landscapes and inevitably leads to increased distances between habitats. We tested the independent and interactive effects of habitat number (number of suitable habitats per unit area) and habitat proximity (distance between these habitats) on assemblages of invertebrates associated with kelp holdfasts (Ecklonia radiata). We tested whether these kinds of habitat modifications have disproportionate effects on rare taxa. Loss and fragmentation of habitat did not operate independently. Patterns of diversity responded markedly to decreases in number of habitats, but this effect was reduced when neighbouring habitats were proximate rather than distant. Rare rather than common taxa primarily responded to these <b>varying</b> aspects of <b>fragmentation.</b> Results highlight the importance of considering the number of suitable habitats in an area (habitat number) when testing the influence of their isolation (habitat proximity) on biodiversity in fragmented landscapes. Awareness that number and proximity of patches are not independent at local scales may provide insights needed to predict the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, particularly on components of assemblages that tend to be rare.

40|$|The {{influence}} of habitat configuration on faunal distribution and success is largely unknown, despite {{a large body}} of literature concerning implications of habitat fragmentation. In Newfoundland coastal waters, a number of juvenile fish species, including Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), are associated with eelgrass (Zostera marina), a habitat that naturally occurs in a variety of configurations and that is susceptible to anthropogenic fragmentation. Studies have shown that the strength of this association is variable at different eelgrass sites and across scales. Given this inconsistent association and the complex spatial configurations of eelgrass, I investigated the relationships between a number of spatial characteristics of eelgrass and density of three juvenile (age- 0) fish species, Atlantic cod, Greenland cod (G. ogac), and white hake (Urophycis tenuis). I used data from aerial photographs to determine perimeter and area measurements at multiple scales, fractal dimensions of perimeter (DP) and area (DA), and a measure that combines perimeter and area complexity at these scales βP/A. Age- 0 fish densities were estimated at each eelgrass site using a seine net. I found parabolic relationships between βP/A and density for all three species, indicating highest fish densities at sites of intermediate patchiness and edge regularity. Furthermore, I determined that βP/A provided a less ambiguous estimate of spatial configuration than other measures. This intermediate maximum may reflect a trade-off, whereby eelgrass sites of intermediate spatial complexity provide juvenile fish with both optimal protective cover and opportunity to feed. I assessed this hypothesis by measuring foraging success in age- 0 Greenland cod at sites of <b>varying</b> eelgrass <b>fragmentation,</b> as measured by βP/A I found that foraging success depends on cod density. I then combined this relationship and the parabolic relationship between density and fragmentation to develop a model that predicts the observed relationship between foraging success and eelgrass site configuration. My thesis demonstrates that eelgrass habitat configuration influences the density and success of resident fish fauna. Furthermore, this research demonstrates that predictive models are possible in ecology...|$|R
40|$|The {{islands of}} the Western Indian Ocean are well known for their unique biodiversity. However, much of the native habitat has been {{destroyed}} and the remainder is threatened by invasive alien species. In this review we assessed the different protected area systems, synthesised the history of invasive alien plants and actions against them, and compared contrasting approaches in habitat management across the different island groups. Of the total terrestrial area of the Western Indian Ocean Islands, a third is under formal protection (defined as all six IUCN categories of protected areas), with the proportion of protected areas and conservation status differing substantially between the islands. The awareness of the problems related to protected areas and specific invasive alien plant control actions, and which are supported by official government strategic documents, are further developed in Mauritius-Rodrigues, La Reunion, and Seychelles, but are still to be developed for the Comoros archipelago. We discuss the different approaches to management across the islands, the <b>varying</b> habitat types, <b>fragmentation</b> and degree of invasion. Invaded habitats are being managed by a range of approaches, including restoration, re-creation or inclusion as a novel ecosystem. We conclude by suggesting improvements in the protected area system in the Western Indian Ocean Islands, including priority actions {{that are necessary to}} prevent further invasion and control of invasive alien species already in the region...|$|R
40|$|The general {{topic of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{the analysis of}} impact ionization time-of-flight mass spectra of ice grains in Saturn’s E ring sampled in-situ by the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) onboard the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft. The source of these E ring ice grains is the subsurface ocean of Saturn’s cryo-volcanically active icy moon Enceladus. The Chemical Analyzer subsystem of CDA generated mass spectra of cations that form when the ice grains impinge onto the instrument’s target plate with high speed. The first aim of this work is a detailed compositional analysis of the organic material in the ice grains ejected from subsurface Enceladus’ into the E ring. Many of these ice grains carry diverse organic material that is characterized in this work. A laser-based analogue laboratory experiment is used to simulate the impact ionization CDA spectra of ice grains enriched in organic material. This experiment allowed to understand the <b>varying</b> cationic <b>fragmentation</b> patterns from organic material in a water ice matrix. Despite the relatively low mass resolution of the CDA, results of the analogue experiment allow to identify characteristic finger prints of certain classes of organic compounds in many CDA mass spectra. Three main categories are classified: (i) Amine-, (ii) Carbonyl-, and (iii) Aromatic-type mass spectra. Furthermore, some aromatic-type CDA spectra show features that correspond to breakup-products of larger complex aromatic species with masses above 200 u. On the whole, the analysis of E ring ice grains in this work gives first insights into the largely varying and complex organic chemistry inside the ocean of Enceladus. The second aim of this thesis is to infer the compositional profile of ice particles in the E ring {{in the vicinity of}} Saturn’s moon Rhea, from a series of spectra recorded on Cassini’s Rhea flyby (R 4) in 2013. No striking change in the frequency of different compositional types is observed along the spacecraft trajectory. However, a varying size distribution of different compositional populations of ice grains is observed and discussed. Sodium salts and organic compounds are more frequent in relatively large ice grains, whereas pure water ice particles become more abundant in smaller E ring grains. A generally higher number density of ice grains is observed in the close vicinity of Rhea, which might indicate either the presence of an ejecta cloud from Rhea’s surface or a general confinement of particles near the equatorial plane of the E ring...|$|R
40|$|Paleocene plutons on Kodiak Island, in Alaska, contain host-rock xenoliths {{that have}} {{undergone}} <b>varying</b> degrees of <b>fragmentation,</b> metamorphism and assimilation {{in the surrounding}} granitoid rocks, and therefore provide an excellent natural laboratory to study the processes of xenolith fragmentation and magma contamination. Kodiak Island has two belts of Paleocene plutons: the Kodiak batholith that runs along the axis of the Island, and the trenchward belt, which is comprised of plutons and dikes intruded into the Ghost Rocks Formation south of the Contact fault. Within the Kodiak batholith, {{there are two different}} populations of xenoliths, one near its exterior margin and another near its center. The exterior xenoliths are relatively rare but, where present, are angular and have retained sedimentary structures. Xenoliths {{from the center of the}} Kodiak batholith are abundant, rounded, gneissic, garnet- and sillimanite-bearing, and had an extended residence-time in the batholith. In the trenchward belt, the Shaft Peak pluton contains a high abundance of Ghost Rocks Formation xenoliths that underwent extensive fragmentation at length scales ranging from> 10 m to a submillimetric scale. The frequency-size distributions of xenolith in both the Kodiak batholith and the Shaft Peak pluton can be modeled by power-law functions and can be described by renormalization-group fractal methods of fragmentation. Our qualitative descriptions and the fractal analysis indicate that the Shaft Peak xenoliths underwent catastrophic fragmentation and were in a state of disequilibrium when its system froze, whereas the Kodiak batholith xenoliths, once they fragmented down to a diameter of < 10 cm, approached thermal and chemical equilibrium with the surrounding magma...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFoams {{have been}} used for decades as {{displacing}} fluids for enhanced oil recovery and aquifer remediation, and more recently, for remediation of the vadose zone, in which case foams carry chemical amendments. Foams are better injection fluids than aqueous solutions due to their low sensitivity to gravity and because they are less sensitive to permeability heterogeneities, thus allowing a more uniform sweep. The latter aspect results from their peculiar rheology, whose understanding motivates the present study. We investigate foam flow through a two-dimensional porous medium consisting of circular obstacles positioned randomly in a horizontal transparent Hele-Shaw cell. The local foam structure is recorded in situ, which provides a measure of the spatial distribution of bubble velocities and sizes at regular time intervals. The flow exhibits a rich phenomenology including preferential flow paths and local flow nonstationarity (intermittency) despite the imposed permanent global flow rate. Moreover, the medium selects the bubble size distribution through lamella division-triggered bubble <b>fragmentation.</b> <b>Varying</b> the mean bubble size of the injected foam, its water content, and mean velocity, we characterize those processes systematically. In particular, we measure the spatial evolution of the distribution of bubble areas, and infer the efficiency of bubble fragmentation depending on the various control parameters. We furthermore show that the distributions of bubble sizes and velocities are correlated. This study sheds new light on the local rheology of foams in porous media and opens the way toward quantitative characterization of the relationship between medium geometry and foam flow properties. It also suggests that large-scale models of foam flows in the subsurface should account for the correlation between bubble sizes and velocities...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes 1) {{the synthesis}} of disaccharide standards for mass spectrometry-based carbohydrate sequencing and 2) the automated iterative solution-phase synthesis of beta-glucans. Two libraries of mass-identical disaccharides were synthesized. Varying in linkage position and {{the identity of the}} non-reducing end monosaccharide residue, these compounds served as synthetic standards for systematic study by tandem mass spectrometry. These disaccharides were analyzed by mass spectrometry in the laboratories of Professors Edward Yeung and Young-Jin Lee. The <b>varying</b> degrees of <b>fragmentation</b> observed in the MS-MS spectra of several of these disaccharides were used to produce classification functions that were capable of correctly classifying the linkage position and identity of the non-reducing end monosaccharide residue. These results provide insight that will ultimately {{contribute to the development of}} faster carbohydrate sequencing methods. The second portion of this dissertation describes the automated solution-phase syntheses of branched and linear beta-glucans. A fluorocarbon-based tag on the growing sugar chain allows for facile purification of intermediates by automated fluorous solid-phase extraction (FSPE), and also provides a means of noncovalent attachment to a fluorinated glass slide for the direct formation of carbohydrate microarrays. Our synthetic approach allows for traditional solution-phase kinetics, reaction monitoring, and chromatographic purification, techniques that are not possible with solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis. Several new glucosyl trichloroacetimidate building blocks were synthesized and subsequently utilized for the automated synthesis of branched and linear beta-glucan fragments. Finally, conditions were developed to fully deprotect our synthetic glucans, rendering them suitable for NMR binding studies and biological assays. These studies established automation protocols that can be used for {{the synthesis of}} larger, more complex beta-glucan structures...|$|R
40|$|Aim The rate {{of climate}} change might exceed the {{migration}} capacity of plants, particularly where habitats became fragmented by human land use. Except for some tree species, {{the extent to which}} habitat fragmentation decreases migration rates has nevertheless been little evaluated. Here, we compare simulated migration rates of understorey herbs, which comprise the big part of temperate forest plant diversity, under <b>varying</b> levels of <b>fragmentation</b> at a continental scale. Location Europe. Methods We combined simulations of demography and seed dispersal to simulate migration of 16 hypothetical forest herb species through a virtual, continuously forested landscape of 50 × 50 km and through 1179 50 × 50 km regions spanning most of the European Union's territory plus Norway and Switzerland. Each region was subdivided into a 250 -m raster of sites, which were rated as suitable to a species if covered by forest according to current land cover maps and future land cover scenarios. The 16 hypothetical species were defined by combinations of those trait values that control demographic and dispersal processes. Results In continuous forests, simulated migration rates of the 16 species varied between ~ 95 and ~ 225 m/y. Current forest fragmentation was predicted to reduce migration rates to about 70 % on average across the continent, but to below 25 % in many parts of western and southern Europe. Under future land use, migration rates might slightly increase in economically marginal regions. Main conclusions Our results indicate that even on a continuously forested continent most understorey herbs would be unable to track climate warming and that habitat fragmentation will reduce migration rates to values an order of magnitude lower than expected climate velocities in parts of Europe. We conclude that, instead of concentrating conservation efforts in protected areas, facilitating the movement of species through the average countryside should become a conservation priority...|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{alteration}} {{and loss}} {{have contributed to}} the decline in populations of several woodland raptors that once inhabited most of Indiana. When forests are fragmented, these area-sensitive raptors potentially experience increased disturbance from human activity, decreased availability of nesting sites, lower prey availability and diversity, increased competition for resources, and lowered nest productivity. The Red-shouldered Hawk (Buteo lineatus) was once the most common hawk in eastern North America; however, it is now considered to be a rare and declining species throughout most of its range. Several observers have reported that larger, more generalist, Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) displace Red-shouldered Hawks from forested nesting areas. I found that nest success was significantly different between these two raptor species and among areas with different levels of forest fragmentation. Red-tailed Hawks had the highest nest survival in the forested landscape whereas nest survival of Red-tailed Hawks in the most fragmented areas was significantly lower. Red-shouldered Hawks in the continuously-forested landscape had the lowest nest survival. Based on landscape-level habitat variables, I developed models that predicted the presence of nest site areas of both raptor species in habitats with <b>varying</b> amount of <b>fragmentation.</b> I also compared the two species food habits, food niche breadth, niche overlap, and nesting behavior. Red-tailed Hawks tended to consume mammals and snakes, whereas Red-shouldered Hawks consumed amphibians and invertebrates, in addition to mammals and snakes. Food niche overlap between the two hawk species was greater in the most contiguously-forested site than in the moderately fragmented site. Radio-telemetry data from Red-tailed Hawks in fragmented sites suggest that the proportion of agricultural row-crop fields in the landscape is positively related with home-range size. The flight behavior of Red-tailed Hawks is of particular interest because of their frequent collisions with military aircraft. I found significant relationships between Red-tailed Hawk flight altitude and corresponding temporal, spatial, and weather variables. I developed predictive models for flight altitude based on these variables. These models may be used to improve Bird Avoidance Models for the U. S. Air Force. ...|$|R
