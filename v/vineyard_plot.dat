40|$|International audienceVine water {{status was}} {{measured}} on 96 blocks of three vines inside a <b>vineyard</b> <b>plot</b> of 0, 28 ha during three years: 2003, 2004 and 2005. Three physiological indicators were implemented: stem water potential, carbon isotope discrimination measured on grape sugars at ripeness (δ 13 C) and canopy temperature measured by high resolution remote sensing. For stem water potential, measurements were taken {{on every single}} vine of each block. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess (i) the spatial distribution of vine water status inside a <b>vineyard</b> <b>plot,</b> (ii) the temporal stability of this distribution from one date to another in the same year and (iii) the temporal stability of this distribution from one year to another. The three physiological indicators provided accurate data of vine water status, as was shown by high correlation coefficients between stem water potential values and canopy temperature, as well as between stem water potential and δ 13 C. Vine water status maps obtained with either stem water potential data or δ 13 C data showed similar patterns of spots that were more or less affected by water deficit stress, in relation to local soil water holding capacity. Stem water potential was measured in September 2004 on two days in a row, one cloudy day and the next day with higher temperatures and clear conditions. Stem water potential values were highly correlated between these two days, which confirms the fact that stem water potential is mainly influenced by soil water status. However, stem water potential values were in average 0. 08 MPa higher on the cloudy day, which shows a measurable but limited influence of evaporative demand on absolute stem water potential values. Both stem water potential values and δ 13 C data were well correlated from one year to another, which shows a stability of spatial distribution of vine water status inside the plot. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that soil water holding capacity is invariable from one year to another. Surprisingly, stem water potential values measured at the same time between vine 1, vine 2 and vine 3 of each block were not very well correlated, although the soil can be considered homogeneous inside a block (3 m 2). This observation shows high variability in vine to vine water status, in relation to individual vine rooting depth and canopy size. Consequently, replicates on several adjacent vines have to be averaged out to obtain accurate vine water status data for each block...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAims: The {{aim of this}} 2 D {{electrical}} resistivity tomography (ERT) survey performed on a <b>vineyard</b> <b>plot</b> of the Gaillac appellation was to investigate spatial and temporal variations in subsurface water supply in relation with pedo-geological and morphological features. Methods and results: The ERT surveys were carried out under two contrasted-dry and humid-climatic conditions. All the resistivity profiles showed the superposition of two layers: a lower layer characterized by very low resistivity values (< 40 Ω. m) corresponding to a marly molassic subsoil overlaid by an upper layer characterized by moderate to high resistivity values (300 Ω. m to 1500 Ω. m) corresponding to a silty-sandy and gravely-pebbly soil sequence. The resistivity values of the molassic subsoil stayed very low independently of water supply conditions whereas those of the soil sequence decreased by a factor 2 (300 / 750 Ω. m versus 750 / 1500 Ω. m) when the plot was close to field capacity. Conclusion: The ERT results coupled with pedological and morphological data strongly suggest that the water flow is preferentially restricted at the molassic subsoil/soil sequence interface, short-lived and of low amplitude. Significance and impact of the study: Consequently, the water supply regime, which points out a potential risk of drought stress for vine crops, implies a minimization strategy when choosing vegetal material and viticultural management operation...|$|E

Based on the captured of multispectral imagery, it was calculated a vegetation index, the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) which is related to the vigor of the vines, the plot was divided into two distinct zones and were defined two classes: High (0. 08 - 0. 18) (less vigor) and Low (0. 31 - 0. 83) (higher vigor). Additionally, with information and agronomic data collected in a sample field of grapevines it was verified that the two zones delineated based on two classes of NDVI have significant differences regarding the parameters of the canopy, yield and its components, strength, composition of the grape and wine quality. The segmentation of the harvest showed that the Low modality has significantly higher values in the parameters characterizing the canopy, yield and its components face to high modality. However, the modality High has significantly higher values for total acidity, alcohol content, anthocyanins, total phenolics, polymeric pigments and total intensity of color and organoleptic characteristics face to modality Low...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Burgundy {{vineyards}} {{have been}} recognized for the high diversity of Terroirs, controlled by complex interactions between natural features, historical parameters and soil management practices. Vineyards are known to undergo substantial soil loss in comparison {{with other types of}} agricultural land. Hydric erosion on vineyards is controlled by complex interactions of natural and anthropogenic factors leading to intra-plot spatial heterogeneities of topsoil at a scale of a metre. Studying the relationship between soils and their degradation is crucial in this situation where soil sustainability is threatened. This study explores the relative influences of historical and present-day anthropogenic factors and geomorphological processes controlling soil erosion on vineyard hillslopes. The selected area was located in the Monthelie vineyard (Côte de Beaune, France) where intensive erosion occurred during high-intensity rainfall events. Soil erosion quantification was performed at a square-metre scale using dendrogeomorphology. This method is based on the measurement of the unearthing of the stock located on the vine plants, considered as a passive marker of soil-surface vertical displacement since the year of plantation. The obtained maps, together with various complementary datasets, such as geological and geomorphological data, but also historical documents (cadastral plans, cadastral matrices and old aerial photographs) allow landscape evolution to be assessed. The combination of all these data shows that spatial distribution and intensity of erosion are controlled mainly by lithology and slope value. However, our study highlights that the sediment dynamics in this <b>vineyard</b> <b>plot</b> is highly related to historical former plot limits and present-day management practices. Nonetheless, quantification of sediment dynamic for the last decade reveals that the impacts of historical structures are disappearing gradually, in response to present-day management practices and geomorphological factors. Finally, this study shows that it is crucial {{to take into account the}} pre-plantation history of vineyard plots in order to increase our understanding of sediment dynamics on vineyard hillslopes...|$|E

40|$|The INTERFRUTA {{project is}} {{financed by the}} European Commission Interreg III-B Programme and was {{developed}} for the islands of “Madeira”, “Tenerife” and “Terceira”, {{for the improvement of}} fruit and vineyard production in these three Atlantic regions. The project goal is a better knowledge of the phytossanitary problems that affect apples, bananas, chestnut and vineyards, applying methods that will contribute to solutions based on the survey of key pests, diseases and beneficial organisms. In the three fruit crops and vineyards analyzed, the methodology used was mainly direct observation of predefined parts of each plant (such as leaves and flowers) on which pests might be expected to occur. The key pest C. capitata was monitored as adults using sexual lures in a net of traps around the island of “Terceira” up to 200 meters altitude. The beneficial insect survey was conducted using the beating technique. For diseases, a direct sampling was carried out by the observation of 10 % of the plants in each orchard or <b>vineyard</b> <b>plot</b> looking for visible symptoms. In apples and vineyards, flowers and branches were collected and tested for microorganisms using serologic and molecular techniques (Elisa and PCR). In banana plantations, the most damaging pests were banana weevil, thrips and a fungi complex that causes symptoms similar to Fusarium wilt. In chestnut, the pest that causes the most severe damage, affecting around 40 % of the nuts produced, is the Chestnut tortrix, but there were some difficulties in identifying which of the three known species was present in the Azores islands. In vineyards, diseases that are most frequent and important include grapevine downy mildew, powdery mildew and Botrytis. Invertebrate pests included grape leafhoppers, thrips and eriophyid mites. The European vine moth was also surveyed but none were found and is still not present. In apple orchards the most important problems were thrips, mites, oriental fruit moth and codling moth. Anarsia lineatella Zeller, the peach twig borer, was not detected and new Eriophyid species have been recorded {{for the first time in}} the Azores as a result of the surveys. With the information collected it was possible to create a phytossanitary diagnostic database for the Macaronesian islands (PROFITOMAC) on the project internet pages (www. interfruta. uac. pt), to help users to identify problems that affect the studied cultures...|$|E

The sustainability of these landscapes {{is threatened by}} rapid changes of soil quality, {{in the context of}} global change and intensive management practices. Considering the Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France as representative of Mediterranean soil and climate conditions, we evaluated the topsoil quality of vineyards at the regional scale, based on a set of 31 physical, chemical and biological soil indicators measured on 164 commercial <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots.</b> Almost all soil parameters were highly variable among plots. Biological activity was low but no systematic perturbation of the trophic web was noticed.

Invariant soil properties explained up to 25 % of the variance of dynamic chemical and biological indicators. Consequently as a tool to improve soil management decision and recommendations, we proposed a grouping of the 164 <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots</b> into functional soil groups determined by soil invariant properties. Information redundancy between different dynamic indicators was analyzed, and their interpretation and limitations as indicators of topsoil quality were discussed.

40|$|Although local grape growers view bird {{depredation}} as {{a significant}} economic issue, the most recent research on {{the problem in the}} Niagara Peninsula is three decades old. Peer-reviewed publications on the subject are rare, and researchers have struggled to develop bird-damage assessment techniques useful for facilitating management programmes. I used a variation of Stevenson and Virgo's (1971) visual estimation procedure to quantify spatial and temporal trends in bird damage to grapes within single <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots</b> at two locations near St. Catharines, Ontario. I present a novel approach to managing the rank-data from visual estimates, which is unprecedented in its sensitivity to spatial trends in bird damage. I also review its valid use in comparative statistical analysis. Spatial trends in 3 out of 4 study plots confirmed a priori predictions about localisation in bird damage based on optimal foraging from a central location (staging area). Damage to grape clusters was: (1) greater near the edges of <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots</b> and decreased with distance towards the center, (2) greater in areas adjacent to staging areas for birds, and (3) vertically stratified, with upper-tier clusters sustaining more damage than lower-tier clusters. From a management perspective, this predictive approach provides vineyard owners with the ability to identify the portions of plots likely to be most susceptible to bird damage, and thus the opportunity to focus deterrent measures in these areas. Other management considerations at Henry of Pelham were: (1) wind damage to ice-wine Riesling and Vidal was much higher than bird damage, (2) plastic netting with narrow mesh provided more effective protection agsiinst birds than nylon netting with wider mesh, and (3) no trends in relative susceptibility of varietals by colour (red vs green) were evident...|$|R
40|$|The soil {{management}} {{adopted in}} vineyard inter-rows {{has a great}} influence on soil hydraulic properties, and, consequently, on runoff at the field scale. Conventional management with tillage is adopted by vine-growers to improve the soil water recharge during winter. Nevertheless, this practice is known to increase runoff and soil erosion in steep areas, especially in mechanized vineyards, thus grass cover is adopted to reduce these negative impacts. The year-round values of field-saturated hydraulic conductivity and of the field-scale runoff were measured in <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots</b> from November, 2012 to March, 2016 in the Alto Monferrato vine-growing area (Piedmont, NW Italy). Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity values were obtained by 110 infiltration measurements. The tests were carried out by adopting the Simplified Falling Head methodology in two adjacent <b>vineyards</b> <b>plots,</b> where inter-rows were managed with conventional tillage (CT) and grass cover (GC), respectively. The runoff, the soil temperature and the soil water content in the two plots have also been recorded. As it was expected, the tillage increased the field-saturated hydraulic conductivity {{with respect to the}} plot with permanent grass cover. However, this effect was only temporary, since a decrease in field-saturated hydraulic conductivity was observed as a consequence of cumulative precipitation and tractor passages after the tillage operations. The field-saturated hydraulic conductivity ranged between 9 and 9119 mm h- 1 in the tilled plot and between 4 and 1775 mm h- 1 in the plot with grass cover. The response of the plots to precipitation events, in terms of runoff also varied considerably. Generally, during most of the events, the runoff in the tilled plot resulted higher (up to nearly 20 times) than in the grassed one. The grass cover was less effective in occasion of large precipitation events during the wet seasons than in other months...|$|R

Their activity increased together with that of the whole society, and during the thirty years under study they became more and more buyers rather than sellers, which shows their economic health. Their property increased slowly, as a result of numerous transactions, involving very small plots of land, which became ever smaller, particularly <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots.</b> This facilitated their activity {{and at the same time}} their activity helped to increase the number of tiny plots of land, which modified the structure of this property market.

The preliminary results presented in this paper show large spatial variations of the vineyard soil properties, which are in accordance with the distribution of the different soil types within the study area. This is particularly observable from soil electrical conductivity data, which show strong spatial correlation with large areas of comparable values delimited by well-defined discontinuities, revealing sharp variations of soil characteristics over short distances. These discontinuities almost systematically correspond to the limits of the <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots,</b> though areas of contrasted soil electrical conductivity values are also found within some plots. Furthermore, the patterns of soil electrical conductivity are in good agreement with soil stratigraphy observed from GPR measurements. Finally, these results also highlighted compaction as a likely explanation to vine vigour problems observed locally in the vineyard. Future work will focus on the full-waveform inversion of GPR and EMI data to retrieve the properties of the different soil layers and to investigate the spatial variation of soil water availability in the study area, and provide on this basis recommendations for the vineyard management...|$|R

A handheld chlorophyll meter, measuring leaf transmittance of near-infrared and red light, confirmed that reduced foliar chlorophyll concentrations were symptomatic of phylloxera stress in the sample vines.

40|$|In 1991 Napa County {{adopted an}} erosion control {{ordinance}} that regulates alterations of landscapes with slopes greater than 5 %. The {{objectives of the}} Hillside Ordinance are to reduce erosion from hillsides into streams and improve water quality. Vineyard development and management are regulated by this ordinance. Little research has directly addressed the effectiveness of erosion control strategies as recommended by the Hillside Ordinance. The Napa Conservation District (RCD) initiated the first monitoring that will compare management techniques for erosion control. They are recording suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) flowing from two <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots</b> under different management. The RCD will conduct further data analysis in May of 2004. Another study conducted by Lutrick (2000), a student in landscape Architecture 222, focused on the impacts of vineyard development to a stream in Napa. After the plots were cleared Lutrick (2000) conducted basic stream surveys and pebble counts pre and post rains. She chose an adjacent watershed as an analogous control. Her findings indicate that the grain size of the stream changed similarly to the control. In both streams, grain size decreased after one winter (Lutrick 2000). Lutrick (2000) concluded that the development had no significant measured effects on the test stream. In spring 2004 I resurveyed the streams. My objective was to analyze more longterm changes that might have occurred to Lutrick’s (2000) study sites. My findings indicate that the pebble size D 50 for cumulative percent finer in both streams seems to be decreasing.

40|$|International audienceIn vineyards, {{soil erosion}} is {{controlled}} by complex interactions between geomorphological and anthropogenic factors, leading to intra-plot spatial topsoil heterogeneities that are observed at a 1 -m scale. This study explores the relative impacts of slope, lithology, historical landscape structure and present-day management practices on soil erosion on vineyard hillslopes. The selected plot {{is located in the}} Monthelie vineyard hillslopes (Côte de Beaune, France), where intensive erosion occurs during high-intensity rainfall events. Soil erosion quantification was performed at a square metre scale using dendrogeomorphology. For the same plot, planted in 1972, an initial erosion map was drawn in 2004, with a second map being produced in 2012. These two maps, combined with lithology and slope data, the evolution of landscape structure and the evolution of management practices allow the driving factors of water erosion to be assessed. From the 2004 erosion map, we observed that the spatial distribution of erosion, for the thirty-year period after planting, was mainly controlled by lithology and historical landscape structure, whatever the slope. By subtracting 2004 data from the 2012 data, and thus evaluating erosion over the last decade, we discovered that the erosion rate had increased significantly, that spatial distribution of erosion had changed and is now basically controlled by slope steepness and present-day vineyard management practices. Erosion patterns for the last decade show that the impact of historical landscape structure is gradually declining. This study shows that it is crucial {{to take into account the}} pre-plantation history of <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots</b> and management practices to further increase our understanding of the spatial distribution of erosion on vineyard hillslopes...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{knowledge}} of soil properties regulating soil water availability for the vines is of prime importance for optimal vineyard management. As soil characteristics may vary strongly over short distances, specific tools {{are required for}} efficient assessment and monitoring of soil water distribution and dynamics with fine spatial resolution. In that respect, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electromagnetic induction (EMI) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys were carried out in a vineyard in southern France {{in order to produce}} high-resolution maps of soil stratigraphy and to retrieve soil hydrogeophysical properties of the different soil layers. The results presented in this paper show large spatial variations in vineyard soil properties, which are in accordance with the distribution of the different soil types within the study area. This is particularly observable from EMI and ERT data, which show strong spatial correlation with large areas of comparable values delimited by well-defined discontinuities, revealing sharp variations of soil characteristics over short distances. These discontinuities almost systematically correspond to the limits of the <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots,</b> though areas of contrasting soil electrical conductivity values are also found within some plots. Furthermore, the patterns of soil electrical conductivity and resistivity are in good agreement with soil stratigraphy observed from GPR measurements. Finally, these results also highlighted anthropogenic soil compaction resulting from agricultural practices during too wet soil conditions as a likely explanation to vine vigor problems observed locally in the vineyard, which is corroborated by the observation of lower values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the vine in zones where soil compaction was evidenced by both geophysical 10. 1016 /j. jattgeomeasurements and soil profile description...|$|R
40|$|Pest {{suppression}} from {{combinations of}} tactics {{is fundamental to}} pest management and eradication. Interactions may occur among tactical combinations and affect suppression. The best case is synergistic, where suppression from a combination {{is greater than the}} sum of effects from single tactics (AB >> A+B). We explored how mating disruption and insecticide interacted at field scale, additively or synergistically. Use of a pheromone delivery formulation (SPLAT™) as either a mating disruption treatment (i. e. a two-component pheromone alone) or as a lure and kill treatment (i. e. the two-component pheromone plus a permethrin insecticide) was compared for efficacy against the lightbrown apple moth Epiphyas postvittana. Next, four point-source densities of the SPLAT™ formulations were compared for communication disruption. Finally, the mating disruption and lure and kill treatments were applied with a broadcast insecticide. Population assessment used virgin female traps and synthetic pheromone in replicated 9 -ha <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots</b> compared with untreated controls and insecticide-treated plots, to investigate interactions. Lure and kill and mating disruption provided equivalent suppression; no additional benefit accrued from including permethrin with the pheromone suggesting lack of contact. The highest point-source density tested (625 /ha) was most effective. The insect growth regulator methoxyfenoxide applied by broadcast application lowered pest prevalence by 70 % for the first ten weeks compared to pre-trial. Pheromone addition suppressed the pest further by an estimated 92. 5 %, for overall suppression of 97. 7 % from the treatment combination of insecticide plus mating disruption. This was close to that expected for an additive model of interactivity between insecticide and mating disruption (AB = A+B) estimated from plots with single tactics as 98 % suppression in a combination. The results indicate the need to examine other tactical combinations to achieve the potential cost-efficiencies of synergistic interactions...|$|R
40|$|Using barcoded {{pyrosequencing}} {{fungal and bacterial}} communities {{associated with}} grape berry clusters (Vitis vinifera L.) obtained from conventional, organic and biodynamic <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots</b> were investigated in two subsequent years at different stages during berry ripening. The four most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on fungal ITS data were Botrytis cinerea, Cladosporium spp., Aureobasidium pullulans and Alternaria alternata which represented 57 % and 47 % of the total reads in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Members of the genera Sphingomonas, Gluconobacter, Pseudomonas, Erwinia, and Massilia constituted 67 % {{of the total number}} of bacterial 16 S DNA reads in 2010 samples and 78 % in 2011 samples. Viticultural management system had no significant effect on abundance of fungi or bacteria in both years and at all three sampling dates. Exceptions were A. alternata and Pseudomonas spp. which were more abundant in the carposphere of conventional compared to biodynamic berries, as well as Sphingomonas spp. which was significantly less abundant on conventional compared to organic berries at an early ripening stage in 2011. In general, there were no significant differences in fungal and bacterial diversity indices or richness evident between management systems. No distinct fungal or bacterial communities were associated with the different maturation stages or management systems, respectively. An exception was the last stage of berry maturation in 2011, where the Simpson diversity index was significantly higher for fungal communities on biodynamic compared to conventional grapes. Our study highlights the existence of complex and dynamic microbial communities in the grape cluster carposphere including both phytopathogenic and potentially antagonistic microorganisms that can have a significant impact on grape production. Such knowledge is particularly relevant for development, selection and application of effective control measures against economically important pathogens present in the grape carposphere...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts for measuring viticulture potential. In most cases, this involves {{the construction of a}} climate/viticulture based model which is then applied to a potential region. Although these climatic based models may perform well inside their original regions, they tend to fail elsewhere. Discrepancies between climatic indexes have been attributed to many factors including vineyard management, grapevine variety, phenology/climate misconceptions and regional macro/mesoclimate regimes. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the viticulture potential within two regions of the South Island of New Zealand, by implementing several climatic based models. These models have been designed to improve the predictive accuracy over other current climatic/viticulture models. A GIS, along with climatic data collected from over 80 stations within Canterbury and the surrounding region, are incorporated into several models which are used within this project as viticultural tools to improve the current understanding between topographic, climatic and grapevine relationships. Viticulture potential ratings are then assessed for two overlapping regions; the smaller sub-region of the lower Waipara catchment and the larger Canterbury region. Results show that many of the current <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots</b> in the Canterbury and lower Waipara regions do not fall within the optimal limits of the models, while there are large potential areas in both regions yet to be utilized for viticulture. However, not all of Canterbury and the lower Waipara catchment can be used for viticulture due to several limiting factors such as elevation, risk of frosts and low mean temperatures. Surprisingly, most of the Canterbury Plains fall within this 'no go' area. The model has proved to be a much more reliable tool than other existing climatic indexes such as the widely used degreeday and mean temperature of the warmest month indices...|$|R
40|$|The {{leaf area index}} (LAI) {{is defined}} as the one-side leaf area per unit ground area, and is {{probably}} the most widely used index to characterize grapevine vigor. However, LAI varies spatially within <b>vineyard</b> <b>plots.</b> Mapping and quantifying this variability is very important for improving management decisions and agricultural practices. In this study, a mobile terrestrial laser scanner (MTLS) was used to map the LAI of a vineyard, and then to examine how different scanning methods (on-the-go or discontinuous systematic sampling) may affect the reliability of the resulting raster maps. The use of the MTLS allows calculating the enveloping vegetative area of the canopy, which is the sum of the leaf wall areas for both sides of the row (excluding gaps) and the projected upper area. Obtaining the enveloping areas requires scanning from both sides one meter length section along the row at each systematic sampling point. By converting the enveloping areas into LAI values, a raster map of the latter can be obtained by spatial interpolation (kriging). However, the user can opt for scanning on-the-go in a continuous way and compute 1 -m LAI values along the rows, or instead, perform the scanning at discontinuous systematic sampling within the plot. An analysis of correlation between maps indicated that MTLS can be used discontinuously in specific sampling sections separated by up to 15 m along the rows. This capability significantly reduces the amount of data to be acquired at field level, the data storage capacity and the processing power of computers.
