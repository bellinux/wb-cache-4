40|$|Following {{the opinion}} {{expressed}} by Kramer in 1971, {{it is commonly}} accepted that the V. aspis complex is composed of 5 subspecies: <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> aspis (Linnaeus, 1758), <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> atra Meisner, 1820, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> francisciredi Laurenti, 1768, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> hugyi Schinz, 1834 and <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> zinnikeri Kramer, 1958.

We had the unique opportunity to study the sample employed by Kramer to revalidate the subspecies <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> atra and <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> francisciredi. Using Kramer’s determinations, but another set of characters, we reanalysed his sample, by applying the same statistical methods (discriminant and canonical analyses), in order to determine whether observed differences among taxa were sufficiently distinctive to warrant recognition as subspecies. The preliminary results of our morphological study allow us to admit the validity of <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> francisciredi Laurenti, 1768, but also to question the subspecific rank of <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> atra Meisner, 1820.

40|$|The asp viper, Vipera aspis, is {{distributed}} in western Europe and comprises several morphological subspecies {{other than the}} nominal form, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> aspis of northern to southern France: <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> zinnikeri, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> atra, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> francisciredi, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> hugyi. Each form is very often distinguishable, both by dorsal colour pattern and number of ventral scales.

Instead, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> francisciredi extends eastwards throughout the Po plain and southwards to southern Italy.

The vacuum-assisted closure system (<b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> C.), or {{negative}} pressure dressings, {{has been successfully}} used to manage complex wounds of the torso and extremities, but {{its role in the}} head and neck region has not been frequently described. Methods. A retrospective study was performed. The <b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> C. system (Kinetic Concepts Inc., San Antonio, TX) was used at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for management of com-plicated head and neck wounds. Results. The <b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> C. system was utilized at 13 sites for 12 patients. Nine subjects had exposed calvarium (4 had failed pedicled reconstructive flaps, 3 had ablative or Moh’s defects, and 2 had traumatic scalping injuries) necessitating bony cover-age. Three subjects had the <b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> C. system used as a bolster dressing placed over split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) used to reconstruct large defects of the face and skull, and 1 patient had a large soft tissue neck defect after radical surgical resec-tion for necrotizing fascitis. One subject used the <b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> C. system for the management of 2 distinct wounds.
