This strata dates to the Santonian stage, around 86 to 84 mya (million years ago). Ajkaceratops shared its environment with other dinosaurs such as Rhabdodon, nodosaurid ankylosaurs, Non-Avian theropods and enantiornithine birds, as well as eusuchian crocodiles, azhdarchid pterosaurs, bothremydid turtles and teiid lizards.|$|E
50|$|In the midland {{region of}} Kerala where {{lateritic}} soil is predominant, laterites form a residual deposit due to weathering of either crystalline or sedimentary rocks with thickness varying from 5 - 8 m. They also form plateaus. These laterite plateaus {{are attributed to}} various phases of uplift {{of the land in}} terraced formations in this region. However, in Malappuram, Kozhikode and Kannur districts in the plateau region, laterites are of greater thickness. It is also noted that top layer of laterite, over the crystalline rocks, is very compact. It is also reported by GSI that in Kerala:Quartz veins, joints and fractures can be traced from the top {{to the bottom of the}} laterite profile. The laterite profile over pyroxene granulites, metaultramafites and gneisses are characterised by relict foliation that conforms to those of the subjacent rocks which indicate the in situ nature of the laterite. Porous and spongy texture is discernible in laterites, after meta-ultramafites. Laterite derived from Tertiary sedimentary rocks is well indurated at the top for about 2 - 5 m. Downwards, the profile grades into soft laterite with remnants of gritstone and culminates into a zone of <b>variegated</b> <b>clay.</b>|$|E

40|$|The initial {{transgressive}} phase at the Leg 144 Guyots {{is characterized}} by a typical association of sedimentary facies (from bottom to top) : in situ weathered volcanic rocks; <b>variegated</b> <b>clays,</b> partly pyritic; gray clay, pyritic, homogeneous, or mottled; black clay, peaty, laminated, or bioturbated; and marine argillaceous limestone. Site 877 at Wodejebato Guyot represents the typical development of the initial transgressive phase. The black clay is rich in organic carbon (up to 40 %) and sulfur (up to 25 %). The organic matter is dominantly of terrestrial origin, but it has a significant marine, algal input. The <b>variegated</b> <b>clays</b> consist of a red, lower, sulfur-free part and a blue to gray-blue, sulfur-containing upper part. Organic carbon is not observed in this facies. The sulfur occurs as pyrite and organically bound sulfur. The isotope composition of pyrite varies from - 50 ‰ to 0 %e, which clearly points to bacterial sulfate reduction as the origin for the high sulfur content. Pyrite formation was limited by availability of reactive iron. Because of the origin of the clays as lateritic weathering products, the amount of reactive iron was high, and pyritization proceeded to high values. The following model is suggested for sulfur enrichment in the sediments at the initial transgressive phase: (1) marine flooding of an organic-rich back-reef mangroval swamp; (2) intense bacterial reduction of marine sulfate within the black clay; and (3) downward diffusion of H 2 S into the underlying clays, reduction of red iron oxides to blue-gray iron sulfides, and growth of pyrite...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the siliciclastic Piedimonte Fm (Sicilian Maghrebids), cropping out in north-eastern Sicily, between the Peloritani Mts. and the Etna Mt., has been carried out. The formation is tectonically covered by the Stilo-Capo d’Orlando Fm, which constitutes a siliciclastic succession unconformable above all the Internal Units of the Sicilian Maghrebids. The Piedimonte Fm resulted younger than the age previously considered in literature, being not older than late Oligocene (Late Chattian) at the base, and not older than early Miocene (Aquitanian) in the upper part. The Piedimonte Fm stratigraphically lies above the <b>Variegated</b> <b>Clays</b> Fm that, in turn, stratigraphically rests above the Monte Soro Fm. Therefore, the Piedimonte Fm constitutes the uppermost part of the Monte Soro Unit, which is re-defined in the present paper and which, from a paleogeographic point of view, is to ascribe to the innermost part (Mauretanian sub-domain) of the Maghrebian Flysch Domain. According to these results, the main phase of deformation of the most internal sector of the Sicilian Maghrebian Flysch Domain occurred not before than Aquitanian, {{in agreement with the}} Burdigalian age recognised in more external units...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{argillaceous}} fractions of three wells {{carried out in}} Samo area, located in the South-Eastern part of Côte d’Ivoire sedimentary basin. Preliminary works whose results are {{presented in this paper}} related to the mineralogical studies of clays of the levels crossed by these wells. They precede the study aiming at establishing the palynostratigraphy as well as the variation of the depositional environments in connection with the eustatic episodes which occurred in this sector of the Northern Gulf of Guinea. 							On the Absence of Oligocene in Onshore Part of Cote D’ivoire Sedimentary Basin. Preliminary Results of Clays Study of Samo Area, South-East of Cote D’ivoire, West Africa The results indicate that analyzed samples are mainly made up of quartz and kaolinite with a small proportion of illite. In the upper part sequence identified like the Continental terminal, the deposits are primarily made up of quartz and kaolinite. In bituminous gray clays of the lower section, the samples are dominated by quartz and illite. 							These results lead to distinguish two lithostratigraphical sequences: the <b>variegated</b> <b>clays</b> of Continental terminal Mio-Pliocene age are provided by Quaternary lateritic continental detritus; the Lower sequence of bituminous clays is mainly marine origin...|$|R
40|$|Lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the Bystrica and Rača {{subunits}} of the Magura Nappe {{have been}} studied {{in the southern part}} of the Beskid Wyspowy Range and on the northern slopes of the Gorce Range (Polish part of the Western Flysch Carpathians). Six new lithostratigraphic units (Jasień Formation, Białe Formation, Jaworzynka Formation, Szczawina Sandstone Formation, Krzysztonów Member, and Ropianka Formation) of the Upper Albian-Palaeocene age have been established, and five other units (Malinowa Shale Formation, Hałuszowa Formation, Łabowa Shale Formation, Beloveza Formation, Bystrica Formation) have been additionally described. The newly created formations as well as the Malinowa Shale Formation and the Hałuszowa Formation have been included to a new Mogielica Group of units (Upper Albian-Palaeocene). This group of units passes upwards into the Beskid Group (Eocene-Oligocene). The Mogielica Group, spanning over 40 myrs, represents the turbidite depositional system, separated by highstand <b>variegated</b> <b>clays</b> which can be correlated with minor sequences in terms of sequence stratigraphy. The following biostratigraphic zones have been recognised in the Cretaceous-Lower/Middle Eocene deposits: Plectorecurvoides alternans, Bulbobaculites problematicus, Uvigerinammina jankoi, U. jankoi-C. gigantea, Caudammina gigantea, Remesella varians, Rzehakina fisistomata, Glomospira div. sp., and Saccamminoides carpathicus.

40|$|The Numidian Flysch shows {{constant}} lithological features {{from the}} strait of Gibraltar to central Italy. It {{is characterized by}} quartzarenites showing grains of monocrystalline, rounded and frosted quartz, and by kaolinitic mudstones. This research {{has pointed out that}} in the southern Apennines 1) the Numidian Flysch was deposited exclusively in the Campania-Lucania carbonate platform and in the Lagonegro-Molise basin, both located on the Apulian continental margin, and never is present in tectonic units originated from the oceanic area located west of that margin; 2) in the axial zone of the Lagonegro basin it stratigraphically follows a formation consisting of varicoloured clays (Argille Varicolori Auct.); 3) its age is limited to the early-middle Langhian, that is to say, it begins to sediment about 7 million years later than in the Maghrebian chain and deposited for a time span limited to 1 - 1. 5 Ma. The thickness of the Numidian Flysch gradually decreases towards the north from about 600 - 1, 000 meters to a few tens of meters and in some of the northeastern outcrops it is represented only by some layers of quartzarenites. This is accompanied by a decrease in size of the particles becoming more and more finer. In addition, northwards and frequently in the same section, a lower mineralogical and textural maturity (from quartzarenites to litharenites, and presence of abundant matrix, sub-angular, polycrystalline and deformed quartz grains) is well recognizable. In the Campania-Lucania carbonate platform the Numidian Flysch evolves to pelagic marly-clayey deposits, followed by mineralogically immature turbidite sandstones of Serravallian age. In the Lagonegro basin the Numidian Flysch replaces Cretaceous-lower Miocene turbidite deposits, consisting of limestones and red marls, on the western side of the basin, <b>variegated</b> <b>clays</b> in the axial zone and calcareous turbidites or <b>variegated</b> <b>clays</b> in the eastern side. Since the late Langhian, it evolves to pelagic sediments followed by lower Tortonian immature turbidite sandstones. In the successions of the Molise basin the Numidian Flysch is interbedded in a succession consisting of calcareous turbidites and pelagic limestones and marls, reaching the Messinian. The lithological features and the age of the Numidian Flysch in central-southern Apennines, therefore, point out an evolution {{different from that of the}} Numidian Flysch of the Maghrebian chain. During the early Miocene, a paleogeographic barrier or other unknown obstacles prevent Numidian sands from reaching the south-Apenninic domains. In the early Langhian, the disappearance of these obstacles allows sands to reach the deep basins located on the Apulian margin. In the late Langhian the Numidian sedimentation is canceled and replaced by mainly pelagic sediments, which will evolve to foredeep deposits in the Serravallian-Messinian time span. In addition, the significant presence of feldspathic and lithic grains testifies a double detrital supply: polycyclic quartzose sands and kaolinitic mudstones from the African craton and metamorphic and plutonic grains from the Hercynian or older rocks of the internal units of the southern Apennines. The Numidian Flysch of the southern Apennines allows to assign the tectonic units in which is present to the Campania-Lucania carbonate platform or to different zones of the Lagonegro-Molise basin and therefore is of great importance in the reconstruction of both the Mesozoic-Cenozoic paleogeography and a tectono-sedimentary evolution very difficult to decipher, given the convergence of sedimentary facies in the Apenninic deep basins since Cretaceous to Miocene, the presence of several tectonic phases and of out of sequence and back-thrusts...|$|R
40|$|Nanoscale and {{crystalline}} morphology of TPU nanocomposites bearing MMT and laponite clays were studied. Laponite was dual modified using ionic and covalent modifications {{by different}} silanes. TPU-clay nanocomposites having <b>variegated</b> modified <b>clays,</b> prepared by solution casting, were characterized using TEM, SAXS, variable temperature XRD (VTXRD), and MDSC. TEM show the uniform clay dispersion in MMT nanocomposites {{as compared to}} laponite composites. SAXS showed satisfactory fitment of Guinier eqn. at lower q values. Fitment of Porod eqn. is inferior owing to contribution of internal microstructures and interfacial roughness. VTXRD (1400 C to 250 C at constant cooling rate) and MDSC studies revealed crystalline morphology development in annealed samples that {{can be related to}} the aspect ratio, microstructure, and functional grs of clays. The overall crystallinity development is less effected in laponite based composites...|$|R
5000|$|... ==Discovery and species== [...] The first {{bones of}} the Neovenator were {{discovered}} {{in the summer of}} 1978, when a storm made part of the Grange Chine collapse. Rocks containing fossils fell to the beach of Brighstone Bay on the southwestern coast of the Isle of Wight. The rocks consisted of a plant debris bed within the <b>variegated</b> <b>clays</b> and marls of the Wessex Formation dating from the Barremian stage of the Early Cretaceous, about 125 million years ago. They were first collected by the Henwood family and shortly afterwards by geology student David Richards. Richards sent the remains to the Museum of Isle of Wight Geology and the British Museum of Natural History. In the latter institution paleontologist Alan Jack Charig determined that the bones belonged to two kinds of animal: Iguanodon and some theropod. The [...] "iguanodon", later referred to Mantellisaurus, generated the most interest and in the early 1980s a team was sent by the BMNH to secure more of its bones. On that occasion an additional theropod tail vertebra was discovered. Several amateur paleontologists, among them Keith and Jenny Simmonds, now began to search for additional remains of the predator. Ultimately, the total of secured bones included the snout, teeth, a front lower jaw, most of the vertebral column, ribs, belly ribs, chevrons, the left shoulder girdle, pelvis bones and a hindlimb. These were accessioned under numbers BMNH R10001 and MIWG 6348. They equalled approximately 70% of the skeleton. In 1985, excavations undertaken by Dr Steve Hutt of the MIWG revealed two vertebrae of a second individual, specimen MIWG.5470. In 1987, Jenny Simmonds found a third skeleton, containing vertebra and pelvic bones, specimen MIWG.6352. A fourth individual is represented by specimen IWCMS 2002.186, consisting of a lower jaw, vertebrae and limb elements. In 1990 the material, then considered a possible new species of Megalosaurus, was provisionally described by Hutt. Having mistaken the ischium of MIWG 6352 for a pubic bone, Hutt suggested this specimen represented a separate species. In 1996, Steve Hutt, David Martill and Michael Barker named and described the type species Neovenator salerii. The generic name Neovenator means [...] "new hunter" [...] from the Greek neo~, [...] "new" [...] and Latin venator, [...] "hunter". The specific name salerii honours the land owners of the site, the Salero family. In view of the large number of individuals involved in the discovery process, it was considered improper to single out one of them as discoverer. The holotype is the skeleton accessioned as BMNH R10001 and MIWG 6348.|$|R
