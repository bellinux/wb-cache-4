5000|$|As {{declared}} in the MID-LIFT Patent, establishing this pivotal axis for the rocker arm {{in reference to}} both the <b>valve</b> <b>tip</b> height and push-rod tip in such a way, for a predetermined length of motion on each, so that a 90 degree relationship of these tangent axis is reached with their respective linear components, exactly when an equal, [...] "half" [...] stroke of motion (mid-lift) has been obtained, will in effect establish the ultimate minimum radial motion {{on both ends of}} the rocker arm. Anything else is termed to be [...] "over-arcing," [...] as it inevitably requires a greater period of contact with the respective linear motion components (i.e., push-rod and valve) to effect the same desired linear motion (valve lift). Thus, the rocker arm geometry is stated to be over-arcing.|$|E
5000|$|... "Over-arcing" [...] in this definition's context {{relates to}} one of two variables, {{dictated}} by which of two halves the rocker arm's pivotal axis resides in relation to the ensuing motion. In the strict definition, over-arcing pertains to the pivotal axis residing too low with regard to its starting point of motion, in providing a 90 degree relationship at exactly the mid-lift point of motion; whereby 90 degrees is reached (if ever) at some point AFTER the exact half way point of motion (mid-lift) occurs. In the opposite example to this definition, the rocker arm's pivotal axis sits too high with regard to the starting point (<b>valve</b> <b>tip)</b> of motion, thus effecting a sweep of its radial path that dominates beneath itself, whereby the 90 degree relationship of the linear component's axis (valve and push-rod, respectively) to the tangent points to the rocker arm's pivotal axis is acquired BEFORE the mid-lift point of movement is attained. In this example, the term used is under-arcing. As with over-arcing, the result in wasted motion is the same, but the consequences to the ever changing velocity delivered to the valve, which is dictated by where this 90 degree tangent point occurs, is opposite (in both symptoms and effect) to the phenomena of its counterpart. Although both terms are simple in principle, their consequences to the efficient design and implementation of high performance push-rod driven (and otherwise) valve trains is decisive.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{the design}} {{aspects of the}} rocker arm's {{geometry}} has been studied and changed to maximize the cam information exchange to the valve which the rocker arm imposes, as set forth by the Miller US Patent, #4,365,785, issued to James Miller on December 28, 1982, {{often referred to as}} the MID-LIFT Patent. Previously, the specific pivot points with rocker arm design was based on older and less efficient theories of over-arcing motion which increased wear on <b>valve</b> <b>tips,</b> <b>valve</b> guides and other valve train components, besides diluting the effective cam lobe information as it was transferred through the rocker arm's motion to the valve. Jim Miller's MID-LIFT Patent set a new standard of rocker arm geometrical precision which defined and duplicated each engine's specific push-rod to valve attack angles, then designing the rocker's pivot points so that an exact perpendicular relationship on both sides of the rocker arm was attained: with the valve and the pushrod, when the valve was at its [...] "mid-lift" [...] point of motion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Here {{we report}} {{the method of}} {{anastomosis}} based on double stapling technique (hereinafter, DST) using a trans-oral anvil delivery system (EEATM OrVilTM) for reconstructing the esophagus and lifted jejunum following laparoscopic total gastrectomy or proximal gastric resection. As a basic technique, laparoscopic total gastrectomy employed Roux-en-Y reconstruction, laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy employed double tract reconstruction, and end-to-side anastomosis {{was used for the}} cut-off stump of the esophagus and lifted jejunum. We used EEATM OrVilTM as a device that permitted mechanical purse-string suture similarly to conventional EEA, and endo-Surgitie. After the gastric lymph node dissection, the esophagus was cut off using an automated stapler. EEATM OrVilTM was orally and slowly inserted from the <b>valve</b> <b>tip,</b> and a small hole was created {{at the tip of the}} obliquely cut-off stump with scissors to let the <b>valve</b> <b>tip</b> pass through. Yarn was cut to disconnect the anvil from a tube and the anvil head was retained in the esophagus. The end-Surgitie was inserted at the right subcostal margin, and after the looped-shaped thread was wrapped around the esophageal stump opening, assisting Maryland forceps inserted at the left subcostal and left abdomen were used to grasp the left and right esophageal stump. The surgeon inserted anvil grasping forceps into the right abdomen, and after grasping the esophagus with the forceps, tightened the end Surgitie, thereby completing the purse-string suture on the esophageal stump. The main unit of the automated stapler was inserted from the cut-off stump of the lifted jejunum, and a trocar was made to pass through. To prevent dropout of the small intestines from the automated stapler, the automated stapler and the lifted jejunum were fastened with silk thread, the abdomen was again inflated, and the lifted jejunum was led into the abdominal cavity. When it was confirmed that the automated stapler and center rod were made completely linear, the anvil and the main unit were connected with each other and firing was carried out. Then, DST-based anastomosis was completed with no dog-ear. The method may facilitate safe laparoscopic anastomosis between the esophagus and reconstructed intestine. This is also considered to serve as a useful anastomosis technique for upper levels of the esophagus in laparotomy. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractParasitoid wasps {{from the}} insect order Hymenoptera can be {{deployed}} successfully as biological control agents {{for a number}} of pests, and have previously been introduced for the control of corn pest insect species from the Lepidopteran genus Ostrinia. Organs on the ovipositor of parasitoid wasps have mechanical and tactile senses that coordinate the complex movements of egg laying, and the ovipositor of Hymenopteran insects have evolved associated venom glands as part of their stinging defense. The ovipositor of parasitic wasps has evolved an additional function as a piercing organ that is required for the deposition of eggs within suitable host larvae. The morphology and ultrastructure of sense organs on the ovipositor and sheath of Macrocentrus cingulum Brischke (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) are described using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Three types of sensilla trichodea were shown to be abundant on the outer sheath of the ovipositor, with types II and III being most distal, and the inner surface of the ovipositor covered with microtrichia, more densely near the apex. Sensilla coeloconica are distributed on both ventral and dorsal valves, while campaniform sensilla and secretory pores are only located on the dorsal valve.

40|$|Objectives: It {{has been}} shown that both {{pulmonary}} venous flow and changes in mitral inflow pattern caused by reduced preload are useful in predicting left ventricular filling pressure. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that a combined application of different methods could improve the hemodynamic evaluation. Methods: 43 patients (pts) with catheterization determined wedge pressure (PCWP) were studied with transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. The Doppler data at the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>tips</b> were analyzed for the peak E and A velocities, E at onset of A, E/A, acceleration time, deceleration time of E and A, atrial filling fraction and isovolumic relaxation time. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the mitral annulus was used to acquire its diastolic velocities Ea and Aa. Parameters from transesophageal pulmonary venous systolic (S), diastolic (D), atrial reverse waves (Ar) and systolic fraction (SF) were also measured. Results: The ratio of E/Ea had the strongest relation to PCWP (r = 0. 85, PCWP = 1. 53 + 1. 48 E / Ea) irrespective of the mitral filling pattern. Univariate analysis revealed that only E/Ea was associated with PCWP (p = 0. 007). Multivariate analysis showed the combination of SF + E / Ea to be most predictive of PCWP (chi square = 11. 8, p = 0. 009). Conclusions: This study suggests that combining pulmonary venous and mitral annular indices is most promising as an echocardiographic means to evaluate left ventricular filling pressure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to set up {{reference}} values for Doppler flow-derived left ventricular filling parameters and to evaluate physiologic determinants of changes in signal expression related to maturation. Background. In left ventricular diastolic function studies, age-related modulations in signal expression are observed. Assuming degenerative myocardial changes to be absent during childhood and adolescence, the determinants of these modulations must be different from those suspected in adults. Methods. Pulsed wave Doppler signals from the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>tip</b> region were recorded in 329 healthy subjects aged 2 months to 39 years. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate statistical relations between Doppler flow signals and stroke volume in the mitral valve area. Results. Increasing early filling time velocity integral throughout maturation caused a decrease in atrial filling fraction from 0. 34 ± 0. 06 to 0. 24 ± 0. 04 (p < 0. 005). Peak flow velocities during atrial systole decreased from infancy to adolescence (66 ± 15 to 41 ± 10 cm/s). Main effects on signal modulation were caused by heart rate, stroke volume and mitral ring area with a linear model fit (R 2) of 0. 79 for early filling phase (E) -time velocity integral, 0. 6 for atrial filling phase peak velocity 0. 84 for total E duration and 0. 73 for E deceleration time. Atrial filling phase-time velocity integral, albeit significantly dependent on heart rate, was stable throughout growth. Conclusions. During infancy and childhood, the stroke volume crossing the mitral valve is a main modulator for early filling phase (E) -time velocity integral and diastolic time intervals during early filling, whereas atrial filling phase parameters are mainly dependent on heart rate. This results in a more pronounced atrial filling during infancy and childhood...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{stress wave}} propagations in a valve due to impact and stress wave {{reflections}} from its free boundaries {{account for the}} fatigue failure near the compressor <b>valve</b> <b>tip.</b> The goals of this research project are to identify {{the characteristics of the}} stress wave propagation and reflections in a valve plate in order to obtain some fundamental understanding of valve failures due to impact. ^ The analytical solution to this problem is based on the method of transformations and the Cagniard method. A Green 2 ̆ 7 s function is formulated for a vertical point load on the elastic half-space (Lamb 2 ̆ 7 s problem) since the mathematical model of the half-space is easier to handle than that of the infinite plate. A numerical solution is obtained by evaluating the complex integral equations of the Green 2 ̆ 7 s function. A simple and efficient convolution scheme is developed for numerically extending this point {{solution to the problem of}} impact pressure distribution. A superposition algorithm is developed for the purpose of obtaining the displacements and stresses of the plate interior by utilizing the half-space solutions. The superposition method consists of two steps to satisfy the free boundary conditions of the plate, which is a unique feature of the algorithm. Several numerical results are presented for the half-space and infinite plate. ^ The three dimensional stress wave solution is compared with the one dimensional solution for certain limiting cases. The agreement of the two solutions is quite excellent. ^ The stress reversal phenomenon at the free boundary of the plate and the stress fluctuation near the S wave front indicate that the plate may fail earlier than expected by using conventional S-N curves. Thus, it is suggested that new S-N curves which incorporate the impact loading be constructed for a better compressor valve life prediction. ...|$|E
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{investigated}} the effects of soot contaminated lubricants of engine components. A thorough background review demonstrated that soot related wear is a major issue for the automotive and lubricants industry. A {{detailed analysis of the}} physical properties and effects of soot contaminated lubricants highlighted that there are associated effects that will tend to reduce engine perfonnance and efficiency. The actual wear that was produced is studied for the area of the engine which is most significantly affected by soot contamination, the valve train. A typical elephant's foot to <b>valve</b> <b>tip</b> contact, known to suffer from soot related wear, fonned the basis of the specimen ball-on-flat reciprocating wear testing. A standardised wear test rig and method were developed for the testing, which investigated different lubricants (base and fonnulated oil), increasing levels of soot contamination (using carbon black as a soot surrogate) and different temperatures. The results demonstrated significant increases in wear with increasing level of carbon black contamination. Furthennore, increased temperature tended {{to increase the amount of}} wear produced and using a fonnulated lubricant reduced the amount of wear measured when compared to tests using base oil. Significant changes in wear mechanism were visible from surface imaging ofthe wear scars, showing initially lubricated sliding, which changes to abrasion at higher contamination levels, and then shifting to contact starvation as the contamination significantly reduces the flow of lubricant into the contact at very high contamination levels. Significantly, the severity of the effects of soot contamination was due to the lubricant film thickness in the contact and therefore ultimately the lubrication regime within which it is operating. Where boundary lubrication is significantly affected by soot contaminated lubricants, but these effects are reduced when the contact operates under elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication conditions. A region of the engine that is significantly affected by soot contaminated oil is the contact between the piston and the cylinder wall or liner. This is mainly due to the component's proximity to the area where soot in produced. Wear will occur in this highly sensitive region due to the breakdown of the protective oil film, which will occur when the lubricant is contaminated with soot. A method of analysing the effect sO~as been investigated 'using an ultrasonic technique to measure the oil film between a piston and a cylinder wall or liner. The ultrasonic oil film thickness measurement technique (developed at the University of Sheffield) has been used in many static and dynamic applications; therefore an initial trial was performed on a single cylinder engine, demonstrating some success. A motored test engine was then built on which to develop the technique and to provide a platform for future research. The test engine demonstrated potential for future success, as a variety of ultrasonic transducers were tested. Testing also highlighted that significant future work, regarding reducing electrical interference, improving the data processing electronics and further investigations into the different types of transducer is required to improve the technique.

The Doppler E-wave velocity-time integral (VTI) is conventionally used as the estimate of early rapid filling volume; however, this implicitly requires the assumption of a constant effective mitral valve area (EMVA). We sought to evaluate whether the EMVA is truly constant throughout early rapid filling in ten normal subjects using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contemporaneous Doppler echocardiography, synchronized via the electrocardiogram.

Both failed launches were from OSTF-2, which was repaired in only two months following Atlas 45F. Atlas 3F put the silo out of use for six months. In both cases, the failure {{was found to be}} accumulated hypergol residue in the main fuel valve from previous engine firings. On January 8, 1965, the final Atlas ICBM test, Missile 106F, successfully launched from OSTF-576G. That year, the Atlas was retired from service as an ICBM and remaining missiles used for suborbital and orbital launches over the next few decades. This included tests of ABRES, RMP, and BMRS reentry vehicles at Vandenberg. The OSTF silos were converted into dedicated launch pads for these and Nike/Zeus target missile testing (the latter were never launched with Atlas Fs). Sixty-five such tests took place between 1965 and 1974, roughly half of which used Atlas Fs. Some had a Trident solid upper stage and there were several failures, the most notable being a 1967 test where the Atlas's RSO charges were ignited by static electricity at RV separation, after which cork insulation was added to the RV to prevent a recurrence of this failure mode.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe {{majority}} of bioprosthetic venous valves {{do not have}} a sinus pocket and, in practice, they are often placed in non-sinus segments of the veins. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of the sinus pocket on the flow dynamics in a prosthetic valve. MethodsA bench top in vitro experiment was set up at physiological flow conditions to simulate the flow inside a venous system. Bicuspid bioprosthetic valves with different leaflet lengths (5 and 10  mm) were tested in tubes with and without a sinus pocket and the flows around the valve were visualized by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Velocity data measurements were made and the vorticity was calculated in the with- and without-sinus set-ups. ResultsPIV measurements showed that vortex structure was maintained by the sinus. For the 10 -mm leaflet length design with sinus, the jet width at the exit of the valve was 59 % of that without sinus. For the 5 -mm design with sinus, the jet width was 73 % of the valve without sinus. Flow from the sinus region was entrained into the main jet observed near the exit of the sinus and altered the flow at the near wall region. ConclusionsThe sinus pocket alters the flow around the valve and functions as flow regulator to smooth the flow pattern around the valve. The vortical structure inside the sinus is maintained at the <b>valve</b> leaflet <b>tip</b> during the <b>valve</b> cycle. For the prosthetic valve designated to be placed without a sinus, a shorter leaflet length is preferable and performs more closely to the valve with sinus...|$|R

40|$|Incomplete {{closure of}} the tricuspid valve without {{apparent}} cusp disease was noted on two-dimensional echocardiography in 31 patients. This abnormality {{was defined as a}} failure of the tricuspid <b>valve</b> leaflet <b>tips</b> to reach the plane of the tricuspid valve anulus by at least 1 cm in the standard apical four chamber view at the point of maximal systolic closure.

Right atrial, right ventricular and tricuspid anulus measurements were made and compared with those from a group of 67 normal subjects. The results were as follows: right atrial endsystolic area = 27. 2 ± 8. 6 cm 2 (normal = 13. 4 ± 2. 0); right ventricular end-systolic area = 25. 6 ± 8. 7 cm 2 (normal = 10. 9 ± 2. 9); right ventricular end-diastolic area = 31. 5 ± 9. 1 cm 2 (normal = 20. 1 ± 4. 9) and tricuspid valve anular end-systolic dimension = 4. 0 ± 0. 6 cm (normal = 2. 2 ± 0. 3).

50|$|A {{much more}} active {{approach}} to monitoring tire pressures involves retrofitting a tire pressure monitor to your vehicle. Vehicles manufactured after model year 2007 {{are required to}} have tire pressure monitoring systems built-in, although many older vehicles might not have it. Tire rack, for example, offers aftermarket tire pressure monitors from various companies, including one that notifies {{the driver of the}} tire pressure in each wheel, as well as exactly which tire the system is displaying the pressure of. A much less expensive way to monitor tire pressures is to install valve stem caps that alert the driver to low tire pressure. These work by first setting the pressure on the cap matching the pressure you desire your tires to be at. Once installed on the tire's <b>valve</b> stem, the <b>tip</b> of these caps will change color (from green, to yellow, to red) when the tire becomes under-inflated.

It's always a good idea to have a quality, reliable tire gauge on hand regardless of what system is installed in your vehicle, and to either check tire pressures yourself of by having someone else do it, as most tire pressure monitor systems will not alert the driver until the tire pressure falls below a certain amount, usually 20% below the recommended pressure.|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} the water-jet {{as a good}} option to be implemented as propulsion source for a probe since a water-jet can be generated via the transfer of water through a long hose with constant and relatively small diameter from a water source to an output nozzle. Additionally, such a water-jet generates a thrust force that can be controlled by the regulation of the flow rate. Taking into account that this system requires control in open areas, three different configurations are suggested. The first one is a configuration similar to the tendril from NASA with the difference that only one actuated section is required at the tip; in this way, {{it is possible to}} position the tip in the desired place in the three-dimensional space. The water-jet is directed partially backwards to the longitudinal axis of the hose, {{in the same way as}} in the piping inspection devices, and via the regulation of the flow rate, the magnitude of the thrust force can be controlled. The second option is by regulating the water-jet through servo-valves. Similar to continuum robots, at least three actuation elements are necessary to control the motion in three-dimensional space. Thus, it requires independent control of each water-jet. This necessitates at least three servo valves which should be placed at the tip of the probe in order to regulate the opening of the orifices of each water-jet, thereby controlling the flow rate and thrust force. However, the need of servo <b>valves</b> at the <b>tip</b> will increase the diameter of the device and the complexity of the manufacture. Finally, the last proposal is a device with no mobile element at the tip. Instead, it has three nozzles in circular arrangement directed partially backward. Each water-jet is generated independently, which means that each nozzle has its own feeding hose and independent pump. By regulating the speed of each pump, the flow and thrust force are controlled. Because the last option is the easiest to implement, we chose the three hose configuration to test the concept. A more detailed study of the generation of water-jet thrust force is presented next.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} denoted a swab device {{has been}} developed as a convenient means of acquiring samples of contaminants from surfaces and suspending the samples in liquids. (Thereafter, the liquids can be dispensed, in controlled volumes, into scientific instruments for analysis of the contaminants.) The swab device is designed {{so as not to}} introduce additional contamination and to facilitate, simplify, and systematize the dispensing of controlled volumes of liquid into analytical instruments. The swab device is a single apparatus into which are combined all the equipment and materials needed for sampling surface contamination. The swab device contains disposable components stacked together on a nondisposable dispensing head. One of the disposable components is a supply cartridge holding a sufficient volume of liquid for one complete set of samples. (The liquid could be clean water or another suitable solvent, depending on the application.) This supply of liquid is sealed by Luer valves. At the beginning of a sampling process, the user tears open a sealed bag containing the supply cartridge. A tip on the nondisposable dispensing head is engaged with a Luer valve {{on one end of the}} supply cartridge and rotated, locking the supply cartridge on the dispensing head and opening the <b>valve.</b> The swab <b>tip</b> includes a fabric swab that is wiped across the surface of interest to acquire a sample. A sealed bag containing a disposable dispensing tip is then opened, and the swab tip is pushed into the dispensing tip until seated. The dispensing head contains a piston that passes through a spring-loaded lip seal. The air volume displaced by this piston forces the liquid out of the supply cartridge, over the swab, and into the dispensing tip. The piston is manually cycled to enforce oscillation of the air volume and thereby to cause water to flow to wash contaminants from the swab and cause the resulting liquid suspension of contaminants to flow into the dispensing tip. After several cycles to ensure adequate mixing, liquid containing the suspended contaminant sample is dispensed. The disposable components are then removed from the dispensing head, which may then be reused with a fresh set of disposable components...|$|R
40|$|Two {{formulations}} of EPDM elastomer, one substituting a UV stabilizer for the normal antioxidant in this polymer, {{and the other}} the normal formulation, were synthesized and samples of each were exposed to gamma irradiation in initially pure deuterium gas to compare their radiation stability. Stainless steel containers having rupture disks were designed for this task. After 130 MRad dose of cobalt- 60 radiation in the SRNL Gamma Irradiation Facility, {{a significant amount of}} gas was created by radiolysis; however the composition indicated by mass spectroscopy indicated an unexpected increase in the total amount deuterium in both formulations. The irradiated samples retained their ductility in a bend test. No change of sample weight, dimensions, or density was observed. No change of the glass transition temperature as measured by dynamic mechanical analysis was observed, and most of the other dynamic mechanical properties remained unchanged. There appeared to be an increase in the storage modulus of the irradiated samples containing the UV stabilizer above the glass transition, which may indicate hardening of the material by radiation damage. Polymeric materials become damaged by exposure over time to ionizing radiation. Despite the limited lifetime, polymers have unique engineering material properties and polymers continue to be used in tritium handling systems. In tritium handling systems, polymers are employed mainly in joining applications such as valve sealing surfaces (eg. Stem <b>tips,</b> <b>valve</b> packing, and O-rings). Because of the continued need to employ polymers in tritium systems, over the past several years, programs at the Savannah River National Laboratory have been studying the effect of tritium on various polymers of interest. In these studies, samples of materials of interest to the SRS Tritium Facilities (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon{reg_sign}), Vespel{reg_sign} polyimide, and the elastomer ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)) have been exposed in closed containers to tritium gas initially at 1 atmosphere pressure. These studies have demonstrated the degradation of properties when exposed to tritium gas. Also, the radiolytic production of significant amounts of hydrogen has been observed for UHMW-PE and EPDM. The study documented in this report exposes two similar {{formulations of}} EPDM elastomer to gamma irradiation in a closed container backfilled with deuterium. Deuterium is chemically identical to protium and tritium, but allows the identification of protium that is radiolytically produced from the samples. The goal of this program is to compare and contrast the response of EPDM exposure to two different types of ionizing radiation in a similar chemical environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a passive, inexpensive technique for monitoring explosion overpressures within sealed areas in underground coal mines. From 1994 to 2000, seven explosions of methane and/or coal dust occurred within the worked-out, sealed areas (gobs) of underground U. S. coal mines. These explosions, believed to have been started by lightning, destroyed many seals and caused much damage external to the sealed area. One gob explosion went undetected until the mine operator reopened the sealed area and discovered the damage. Fortunately, these gob explosions did not cause any fatalities or injuries. Because lightning occurs in just about all mining areas, several questions arise. Could gob gas explosions be occurring in other sealed areas and going undetected? If so, what is the magnitude of the resulting explosion overpressures? The Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) undertook a study to identify and evaluate passive measuring devices to monitor and quantify the overpressures associated with such explosions. This work was done in parallel with full-scale explosion experiments for evaluating the strength characteristics of seals used for isolating areas in underground coal mines. Evaluation studies were done in PRL's 20 -liter explosion test chamber and in the full-scale Experimental Mine at Lake Lynn Laboratory to evaluate the response and accuracy of various commercially available automobile tire pressure gauges to overpressures generated from gas and dust explosions. The first series of tests was done in the 20 -liter chamber, which is used to study the explosibility and inerting of fuel dusts and gases. Data from the tire pressure gauge tests were compared to the pressure-time data obtained from the 20 -liter chamber 's traditional electronic strain gauge pressure transducer recorded on a high-speed data acquisition system. To evaluate the tire pressure gauges, the <b>valved</b> inlet (<b>tip)</b> of the candidate pressure gauge was removed and the body of the gauge was cemented with epoxy into a 0. 25 -in pipe elbow and attached to the outside of the test chamber. A second series of tire gauge evaluation tests was done at Lake Lynn during explosion-resistance testing of seals used in underground coal mines. Full-scale seals (20 ft wide by 8 ft high) were constructed as one wall of a 2, 000 -ft 3 chamber and exposed to a series of methane explosions. Average overpressures ranged from 20 to 80 psi. The seals were built with various strength materials ranging from 7 to 48 in thick. The modified tire gauges are attached on the outside of the chamber to a 0. 25 -in NPT pipe that extends into the chamber (figure 1). The axis of the gauge is mounted at a right angle to the plane of the seal to minimize the coupling of any seal movement to the stem of the gauge that may cause inaccurate readings. The internal explosion pressure history is recorded with a strain gauge pressure transducer mounted inside the chamber. Methane is injected into the chamber, mixed with air, and ignited with an electric spark located at the geometric center of the chamber. Maximum explosion overpressures are recorded and compared with the tire gauge pressure. Several constant volume explosions were conducted in the 20 -liter chamber in order to vary the maximum pressure and the time-to-peak pressure. The comparison between the maximum pressure measured by the strain gauge and that determined by the tire pressure gauge is shown in figure 2. There is fairly good agreement over the pressure range from 5. 9 to 18. 7 psi. Maximum pressure comparisons from large-scale chamber tests are also very encouraging. Maximum pressures recorded with internal electronic strain pressure gauge agreed within 1 psi of the tire gauge reading for all tests without seal failure. Results show that this simple, in- expensive, passive device can be used to monitor overpressures contained within sealed areas of underground mines or to record the gob explosion overpressures if one or more seals fail during the explosion. For in-mine use, a single pressure gauge could be installed on one seal in a set of two to six seals. If desired, two gauges covering different ranges could be attached to the same seal. Existing sampling tubes could be used to attach the gauge where seals are already built. During the construction of a new seal, a dedicated or additional 0. 25 -in-diam pass-through tube could be installed. Any pressure rise can be identified during routine weekly examinations of the seals or shortly after a lightning strike in the area. Such an inexpensive device is useful as part of a surveillance study on the number and magnitude of undetected explosion events that occur in sealed areas of underground coal mines.
