5000|$|Proxy {{voting and}} delegative {{democracy}}: Direct democracy would require each citizen to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> each policy issue each time. As this would overburden most people, the citizens in a collaborative e-democracy delegate trusted representatives (or proxies) to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> their behalf {{on all those}} issues and/or domains where they lack of time, experience, or interest for direct participation. Although the proxy <b>votes</b> <b>on</b> the principals behalf, the principal retains the final <b>voting</b> power <b>on</b> each issue. Thus proxy representation combines the best features of direct democracy and representative democracy on the social networking site.|$|R
