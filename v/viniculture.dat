40|$|The {{investigation}} of the reuse potential of liquid urban wastes from Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) for the irrigation of <b>vinicultures</b> is a new technique in Greece. It requires holistic planning, which will take into account all the parameters related to the WWTPs operation, {{as well as the}} geological, soil and hydrological characteristics of the area, the microclimate, and the wastewater quality in terms of chemical and microbiological composition. Finally, it will take into account all the equivalent quality characteristics of the soils and the <b>vinicultures,</b> for the successful and safe reuse of the wastewaters. This holistic reuse planning will substantially contribute to the protection of the environment, and to irrigated <b>viniculture's</b> expansion in the east of Attica, since grapevine culturing is a single-crop farming in the wider area...|$|R
2500|$|The {{state is}} known for dairy {{products}} and wine. Two of Querétaro’s cities, San Juan del Río and Ezequiel Montes, have thriving <b>vinicultures.</b> Some of the best comes from the Rancho Santa Marina just {{to the south of}} the capital in the municipality of El Marqués. [...] This ranch specializes in sheep milk cheese such as feta, ricotta, picodon and criollo/crottin. Rancho Hondonada is another reputable producer as well as Quesos Vai, which specializes in Mexican cheeses such as Oaxaca and panela. [...] The best known winery is Freixenet which is on the highway between Tequisquiapan [...] and San Juan del Río. The 45-hectare vineyard grows four varieties of grapes: Saint Emilion, Macabeu, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir. A cave 25 meters (82ft) below ground maintains a constant and ideal climate for wine cellaring. Other producers include La Redonda and Rancho Los Azteca.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses imminent {{innovations in}} public policy that will impact upon the whisky industry, and, through linkage adjustments, the regional Scottish economy. An analysis of the interconnectedness between the whisky industry and the wider Scottish economy reveals that such linkages are substantial. A holistic conspectus of the whisky industry {{in the first part}} of the dissertation reveals that the predominant form of structural change in the past has been merger & acquisition. Such consolidation has permitted economies in marketing & distribution, but it is contended that in this arena at least there is scope for further performance improvement in the industry. Nevertheless, with taxation forming such a significant proportion of the final price of the product, realising a sustained increase in demand is deemed to be largely outwith the capability of the industry. It is advanced, therefore, that two tax-related developments {{in public policy}} in the next few years will impact not merely upon the whisky industry, but materially upon the regional Scottish economy as well. The first of these imminent innovations examined is the proposed abolition of the intra-EU duty free concession in 1999. Whilst it is concluded that such a move is inevitable (and economically logical), it is nonetheless determined that this will have a meaningful detrimental impact upon the whisky industry and Scottish economy. Secondly, the current proposals of the European Commission for the harmonisation of alcohol excises across the European Union are critically appraised, and are shown to be grounded on no logical economic principles, but instead, enshrine protection for European <b>vinicultures.</b> The rationale for alcohol taxation is considered de novo, concluding that within the United Kingdom & across the European Union, at a minimum all alcoholic beverages should be taxed on an equal basis according to alcoholic content, at a level sufficient to cover an estimate of the negative externalities associated with alcohol consumption. Mindful of the importance of the whisky industry to the Scottish economy, it is revealed that in times past, the public authorities have been proactive in intervening to secure the continuing prosperity of the whisky industry, and it is contended that such a stance may be required of the present government. The dissertation concludes by advocating a set of reforms to the structure of alcohol excises in the United Kingdom. An approximate halving of the excise applied to spirits, such that all alcoholic beverages are taxed equally according to alcoholic content, would ensure that the whisky industry & government could lobby with credibility for comparable structures to be adopted overseas, particularly in any revised proposals for European excise harmonisation. In addition, it is suggested that the fillip such a reform would give to domestic sales of whisky would mitigate the negative effects upon the whisky industry & regional Scottish economy of losing the intra-EU duty free concession in 1999...|$|R

25|$|<b>Viniculture</b> in the archipelago, and {{especially}} in Tenerife {{dates back to the}} conquest, when the settlers brought a variety of vines to plant. In the 16th and 17th centuries, wine production {{played an important role in}} the economy, and many families were dedicated to the culture and business. Of special mention is malvasía canary, considered the best wine of Tenerife and at the time one of the most desired wines in the world, being shipped across to the major warehouses of Europe and America. Writers such as William Shakespeare and Walter Scott make reference to the wine in some of their works. Tenerife has 5 main wine growing regions. These include Abona, Valle de Güímar, Valle de La Orotava, Tacoronte-Acentejo and Ycoden-Daute-Isora.|$|E
25|$|Mizil {{reached its}} peak of {{activity}} during the 19th century, rapidly outpacing Urlați, which had possessed the advantage of having the closest market {{to most of the}} towns in that part of Wallachia. Moreover, in 1847 the Ploiești-Buzău road began to be built along the foothills, shortening and modernising the link between the capitals of the Danubian Principalities, Bucharest and Iași. It was from the latter to the former city that Alexandru Ioan Cuza passed through Mizil in 1859, on his way to become head of the United Principalities. In this period, inhabitants worked in agriculture, <b>viniculture,</b> animal husbandry and various trades. The first school was built in 1857, by the boyar Ion Căciunescu, although teaching had begun around 1838. Following the efforts of mayor Leonida Condeescu, an elementary trade school was established about 1902, with a high school opening later.|$|E

2500|$|As most brandies {{have been}} {{distilled}} from grapes, {{the regions of}} the world producing excellent brandies have roughly paralleled those areas producing grapes for <b>viniculture.</b> At the end of the 19th century, the western European markets, including by extension their overseas empires, were dominated by French and Spanish brandies and eastern Europe was dominated by brandies from the Black Sea region, including Bulgaria, the Crimea, and Georgia. In 1884, David Sarajishvili founded his brandy factory in Tbilisi, Georgia, a crossroads for Turkish, Central Asian, and Persian trade routes and a part of the Russian Empire at the time. Armenian and Georgian brandies, called cognacs in the era, were considered some {{of the best in the}} world and often beat their French competitors at the International Expositions in Paris and Brussels in the early 1900s. The storehouses of the Romanov Court in St. Petersburg were regarded as the largest collections of cognacs and wines in the world with much of it from the Transcaucasus region of Georgia. During the October Revolution of 1917, upon the storming of the Winter Palace, the Bolshevik Revolution actually paused for a week or so as the [...] participants gorged on the substantial stores of cognac and wines. The Russian market was always a huge brandy-consuming region in which home-grown varieties were common but much of it was imported. The patterns of bottles followed that of the western European norm. Throughout the Soviet era, the production of brandy was [...] a source of pride for the communist regime as [...] they continued to produce some excellent varieties, especially the most famous Jubilee Brandies of 1967, 1977, and 1987. Remaining bottles of these productions are highly sought after, not simply for their quality, but for their historical significance.|$|E
