In this way, every hand, whether strong or weak, is played in competition with others playing identical cards, and the element of skill is heightened while that of chance is reduced. Duplicate bridge stands in contrast to rubber bridge where each hand is freshly dealt and where scores may be more affected by chance in the short run.|$|E

The focus is on the law in common law jurisdictions, particularly Australia and the United States of America. United Kingdom law will also be briefly surveyed. The paper focuses on the 2006 decision of the Australian Federal Court in Comandate Marine Corp v Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd, which afforded the topic significant treatment. The theoretical bases for sustaining waiver claims are analysed, including waiver as a discrete doctrine, abandonment, estoppel, election, repudiation of contract and <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The policies that underlie and inform the development of principles for testing waiver submissions are noted...|$|E

40|$|This thesis focuses upon recent Australian {{developments}} in the law of estoppel. It provides a justification and basis in principle {{for the doctrine of}} estoppel described in cases such as Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher (1987 - 1988) 164 C. L. R. 387 and Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen (1990) 170 C. L. R. 394. This basis is found in the principle that we ought all to take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of the assumptions that we induce in others. Ensuring the "reliability" of an induced assumption means ensuring that a party who relies upon the assumption does not thereby suffer harm: harm {{in the sense that he}} is worse off because the assumption has proved unjustified than he would have been had it never been induced. The thesis suggests a pattern for the development of the Australian law of estoppel reflecting that basis in principle. It further demonstrates the potential usefulness of the doctrine with specific reference to (i) pre-contractual negotiations and letters of intent, (ii) firm offers to <b>contract,</b> (iii) <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> unsupported by consideration, and (iv) the "battle of forms". </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In large, {{distributed}} systems, such as {{a sensor}} web, allocating resources to tasks that span multiple providers presents significant challenges. Individual subtasks associated with a task could potentially be assigned {{to a number of}} agents (e. g., when there is overlap in sensor or data processing capability among constituent sensor networks). This problem is further compounded by the dynamic nature of a sensor web, in which both desired tasks and resource availability change with time and environmental conditions. This paper presents a novel <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> net protocol (CNP) for subtask allocation, which employs brokers to limit communication overhead in a two-phase CNP and aggregate domain infor-mation from groups of agents. Experimental results using this subtask allocation approach verify its efficiency and scalability.

The spin is restricted to four to profit from technical simplifications but without reducing the problem in principle. The issue includes the calculation of all Ricci tensors as multiple traces of the curvature, the derivation of all primary and secondary Bianchi identities, expressing all Ricci tensors as differential operators applied to the Fronsdal term, calculating the Weyl <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> these, and showing finally that Weyl <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> integrals over <b>contracted</b> squares <b>of</b> Ricci tensors can be used to eliminate the anomaly completely.

40|$|As the world’s {{markets are}} {{becoming}} more integrated and companies are outsourcing to other countries {{to a greater extent}} it is important for them to take the cultural aspects into consideration. We wanted to study if the different cultures affect the agent’s behaviour in a principal-agent relationship and focus on Sweden and China. When looking for research in this field we found that the cultural aspect of the principal-agent theory had been widely neglected. We studied both the multi-tasking phenomena which is a theory closely linked to the principal-agent theory, as well as different cultural differences. We found that there were large cultural differences between China and Sweden, but also similarities. We concluded our hypotheses on the different cultural differences which we then linked to the <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> preferences in <b>contracts.</b> These hypotheses were used to create, the MMA-model. To test our MMA-model we conducted an experiment which we came to call the MMA-experiment. In order to test if our cultural generalizations based on the theoretical framework were true we let the participants fill out a questionnaire before the experiment. In short, the point of the experiment was to study how the cultural differences affected the choice <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in a multi-task environment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} study of optimal trading and contracting decisions, and their impacts on modern market structures. The dissertation is composed of three chapters. Chapter 1 investigates the impact of dark pools on the informational efficiency of prices (price discovery). Traders trade an asset in either an exchange or a dark pool, with informed traders having heterogeneous private signals whose distribution is determined by an information precision level. We find that dark pools have an amplification effect on price discovery. That is, when information precision is high, adding a dark pool enhances price discovery, whereas when information precision is low, adding a dark pool impairs price discovery. The main force behind this result is a sorting effect: in equilibrium, traders with strong signals trade in exchanges, traders with modest signals trade in dark pools, and traders with weak signals do not trade. These results produce novel empirical predictions regarding dark pools that reconcile the empirical evidence. The results also provide regulatory suggestions on enhancing the informational efficiency of pricing in equity markets and in emerging markets. Chapter 2 provides a framework to study information diffusion and interaction between a centralized and a bilateral market. In the model, traders trade to hedge their positions with some agents possessing private information. All agents can trade in the bilateral market before trading with a monopolistic market maker in a centralized market. We show that an active bilateral market functions as a channel to disseminate information. Moreover, information diffusion depends on the centralized market liquidity: both overly liquid and overly illiquid centralized markets discourage bilateral trading, and only reasonable centralized market liquidity activates bilateral trading and hence information diffusion. We also find that information diffusion is conducted in an asymmetric way. Which type of news spreads faster depends on the conjecture of the uninformed traders. Lastly, when prices in the centralized market contain information, it may "squeeze out" trades and information diffusion in the bilateral market. Chapter 3, which is co-authored with Jen-wen Chang, analyzes the optimal screening decision for a monopolistic firm when consumers have time-inconsistent preferences and unobservable multiple degrees of naiveté (unawareness of their time-consistency). The firm can contract to screen their degrees of sophistication, subject to profit maximization. We characterize the optimal contracts and show that the firm offers a non-screening contract when consumers have deterministic costs and offers a screening contract when consumers have random costs. We argue that {{the uncertainty of the}} consumption costs lowers the firm's screening costs, and a discount per-usage price serves as a commitment device for the more sophisticated types.

Previous findings suggest that fewer legal complexities support lower contract enforcement costs. In addition, recent work finds that individuals may rely on informal, cultural means to enforce agreements. Building from these two main bodies of work, this paper seeks to understand the <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> the costs <b>of</b> enforcing <b>contracts</b> by examining how informal cultural enforcement mechanisms may substitute or complement formal legal procedures ultimately shaping the costs <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> enforcement. Cultural measures of trust, individualism, individual responsibility and an overall culture index dominate legal formalism suggesting a substitution effect. These results suggest that variation in contract enforcement costs may be better explained from cross-country differences in culture than formal legal rules...|$|R

We analyze the incentive effects <b>of</b> performance-based <b>contracts,</b> as well as their impacts on provider job placement rates, using unique data on Dutch cohorts of unemployed and disabled workers that were assigned to private social welfare providers in 2002 - 2005. We take advantage <b>of</b> <b>variation</b> in <b>contract</b> design over this period, where procured contracts gradually moved from partial performance-contingent pay to contracts with 100 %-performance contingent reward schemes, and analyze the impact of these changes using panel data that allow us to control for cohort types and to develop explicit measures of selection into the programs. We find evidence of cream-skimming and other gaming activities on the part of providers but little impact of these activities on job placement rates. Overall, moving to a system with contract payments fully contingent on performance appears to increase job placements for more readily employable workers, although it does not affect the duration of their jobs. social welfare, performance contracting...|$|R

40|$|BOT, Build-Operate-Transfer, is a <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> {{privatization}} <b>contracts,</b> {{in which}} the government signs a concession contract with the private contractors. A contract in this form permits the private sector to build, operate and maintain an infrastructure project for a period of time. Power station building, toll road construction, water facilities construction are good examples. The contractor should transfer the project back to the government with no reimbursement when the contract expires. Since the 197 Os, BOT has been adopted globally as a method of managing complex and, in many cases, public-concerned projects. Its popularity in most part is due to the heavy fiscal burden placed on governments in the late 20 th century. While BOT came in attempting to solve this problem by streamlining responsibilities and clarifying incentives. Since then, BOT has been exposed to extensive and careful reviews in the academic fields of economics and public relationships. As generally accepted, BOT is theoretically an effective way of privatizing public projects in that it aims to benefit all the parties (the government, the contractors, the financial institutions, etc) involved. However, does such kind of "Win-Win" model work in the real world? There are potentially moral hazard problems associated with the private sector because of the ownership structure <b>of</b> the BOT <b>contract.</b> Due to the non/limited-recourse nature <b>of</b> the <b>contract,</b> the contractor, i. e. private owner of the project, can reimburse his investment and gain profit by running the project only during his operation period. So the contractor might abuse the project to make extraordinary profit during the concession period since he has to transfer the project back to the government and lose the control over it. After analyzing the effort allocation <b>of</b> the BOT <b>contract,</b> we have set up a model and raised an option to cure the potential moral hazard problem in BOT. By introducing an option that the private owner can have some equity share of the revenue the project generated at the following period, no matter whether itself is the owner of the project, the contractor will raise its construction effort and lower its operation effort to avoid abusing the project. We have further compared the efforts level under three different ownership structure, public owned, private owned and BOT. Finally, we made our suggestions...|$|R
