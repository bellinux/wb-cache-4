5|$|Large surface {{temperature}} variations on 55Cancrie {{have been attributed}} to possible <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> releasing large clouds of dust which blanket the planet and block thermal emissions.|$|E
5|$|The Andes are {{a site of}} <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity,</b> {{which is}} usually {{subdivided}} into four separate volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. These volcanic zones are separated by gaps where no recent <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> has occurred. These gaps are not static; the gap separating the Austral and the Southern Volcanic Zones has been moving northward for the past 15-20 million years.|$|E
40|$|Coral reefs have {{recorded}} the environmental changes {{occurred in the}} adjacent regions of the southwestern Leizhou Peninsula during their growth) recess. Dominant activities relating {{to the growth of}} coral reef are fault <b>activities,</b> earthquakes, <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities,</b> etc. Quaternary volcanoes are very active in the northwest region of South China Sea especially southwest of Leizhou Peninsula, which have obviously controlled the growth of coral reef; Parts of the,volcanoes make up of reef substrates, while the minority of volcanoes are exposed to form the reef islands. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> would lead to a series of;geochemical changes, and all these changes will be recorded by contemporaneous coral skeletons. According to the relative research, principal elements relating to <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> are Al, Ti, Cu, Co, Mn, etc, most of which would get rich influenced by <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities.</b> Many researches on cores of massive morals indicate that <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> manifested by chemical anomalies in coral skeletons consist well with those recorded in historical materials, thus suggest it is feasible to reconstruct historical <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> according to geochemical changes in coral skeletons...|$|R
25|$|Increasing {{pressure}} due to {{the weight}} of the ice during glaciation may have suppressed melt generation and <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> below Iceland and Greenland. On the other hand, decreasing pressure due to deglaciation can increase the melt production and <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> by 20-30 times.|$|R

5|$|The field {{bears no}} trace of glacial erosion on its volcanoes, and reports exist of <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> in 1712, 1820 and 1926.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> of Tuzgle {{occurred}} 650,000 {{years ago}} and formed the Tuzgle Ignimbrite. Subsequently, lava domes were erupted and three lava flow units were named San Antonio, Azufre, and Tuzgle. The latest lava flows are dated at 17.5 and 1.5 Ma and <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> may have continued into the Holocene. Several thermal springs {{are associated with the}} volcano, and some have been investigated for possible geothermal energy production. Sulfur was formerly mined on the mountain. Argentina's National Route 40 runs along the foot of the volcano.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{evidence}} of <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> at Mount Hood consists of fumaroles near Crater Rock and hot springs on the flanks of the volcano.|$|E

5|$|The volcano {{is covered}} by a thick ice cap, the second largest in the tropics, that has existed {{since at least the}} Pliocene and has {{undergone}} several phases of expansion and reduction. , the ice cap is in retreat; one estimate predicts that it will disappear by 2045. The retreat of the Coropuna glaciers threatens the water supply {{of tens of thousands of}} people, and interaction between <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> and glacial effects has generated mudflows that could be a hazard to surrounding populations if the mountain returns to <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> at Kita-dake ended around 4,900years ago: {{subsequent}} eruptions {{have been}} centered on Minami-dake. Since 2006 activity has centred on Showa crater, to the East {{of the summit}} of Minami-dake.|$|E
5|$|<b>Volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> has {{occurred}} in parts of Iran since the Cretaceous period. During the Eocene and Oligocene epochs, <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> reached its maximum, with thick pyroclastic layers being deposited in central Iran and the Alborz mountains. The area around Taftan volcano belongs to a tectonic zone which is variously {{referred to as the}} Sistan suture or the Zabul-Baloch zone. There, after a previous episode of rifting and subsequent formation of an ocean, the Neh and Lut tectonic blocks collided during the Eocene epoch after a subduction episode that commenced in the Maastrichtian age.|$|E
50|$|After the {{drilling}} started, Seismic and <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> {{in the area}} threatened {{the building of the}} power station, like the major volcanic eruptions less than 2 km from the power station away, introducing the possibility that it would never start operating at all. Nevertheless, it was finished in early 1977 and was launched in 1978, though the power plant did not work to its full potential until the seismic and <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> strongly declined in 1984 and further boreholes were drilled.|$|R
40|$|<b>Volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> exert a {{significant}} influence on pore fluid property and related diagenetic processes that substantially controlled reservoirs quality. Analysis of Paleogene medium-deep sandstones on the Huanghekou Sag provides insight into relating the diagenetic processes to pore fluid property evolution influenced by <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities.</b> Three distinct types of pore fluids were identified {{on the basis of}} an integrated and systematic analysis including core and thin section observation, XRD, SEM, CL, and trace element. Alkaline aqueous medium environment occurred in E 2 s 1 + 2 where <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> have in{{significant influence on}} pore fluids, evidenced by typical alkaline diagenetic events such as K-feldspar albitization, quartz dissolution, feldspar dissolution, and carbonate cementation. During the deposition of E 3 d 3, influx of terrestrial freshwater and alteration of ferromagnesian-rich pore water result in the formation of mixing aqueous medium environment through volcanic eruption dormancy causing zeolite dissolution, clay mineral transformation, and K-feldspar albitization. Ferromagnesian-rich aqueous medium environment developed resulting from the intensive hydrolysis of the unstable ferromagnesian minerals formed due to intense <b>volcanic</b> <b>activities</b> during E 3 d 1 + 2 and corresponding predominant diagenetic processes were characterized by the precipitation and dissolution of low-silica zeolites. Therefore, the differential properties of pore fluids caused various diagenetic processes controlling reservoir quality...|$|R

5|$|Ammonia was {{tentatively}} detected on Mars by the Mars Express satellite, {{but with}} its relatively short lifetime, {{it is not}} clear what produced it. Ammonia is not stable in the Martian atmosphere and breaks down after a few hours. One possible source is <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley, {{providing}} more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and Turbid Creek {{on the southern}} flank of Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern flank of the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas of <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less dense and rises {{back to the surface}} along fissures or cracks. These features are sometimes referred to as dying volcanoes because they seem to represent the last stage of <b>volcanic</b> <b>activity</b> as the magma at depth cools and hardens.|$|E
