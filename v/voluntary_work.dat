40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{analysis}} of the political initiative ”National Civilsamfundsstrategi” (National Strategy for Civil Society) of 2010. The analysis also brings in reports drawn up by various actors within the field of <b>voluntary</b> social <b>work</b> upon which ”National Civilsamfundsstrategi” leans. The thesis is concerned with the area of policy which is why the emphasis is on document analysis. The theoretical framework of the thesis is built up around Michel Foucault. More specifically, his “theory of governmentality” is used to put the <b>voluntary</b> social <b>work</b> into a special perspective regarding power, through which the focus is on power relations of the <b>voluntary</b> social <b>work</b> where discourses and categories are put into speech. The analysis is done on the basis of Carol Bacchi’s WPR-method (What’s the Problem Represented to be) backed by Kaspar Villadsen and his take on genealogical analysis of the social work and emphasises representations of problems in “Civilsamfundsstrategien” as well as the underlying assumptions embedded in these “problems”. Through the analysis, the actors appearing in the present political initiatives regarding <b>voluntary</b> social <b>work</b> are highlighted. They are juxtaposed in order to pinpoint the underlying elements of the universal categories of “the volunteer” and “the socially exposed” to obtain an understanding about what these categories imply. By dismantling these groupings, the categories perceived as universal within the field of <b>voluntary</b> social <b>work</b> are questioned and rather left as constructions created by history. Through the perspective created by a Foucauldi{{an analysis of}} power, an understanding is reachable. Not just about how <b>voluntary</b> social <b>work</b> is handled today, but also how the entire society is built up around directional techniques...|$|R
