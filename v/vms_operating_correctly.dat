40|$|We {{describe}} the procedure and the requirements to install and to mantain an Astra Data Base Server. The Astra Data Base Server software can be installed on an account on a IBM VM host computer. An Astra Data Base Server {{is a part of}} the logical ASTRA subnetwork. An ASTRA subnetwork is a logical network constituted by some cooperating ASTRA Data Base Server, which use the EARN facilities to communicate with themself and with the end users to satisfy many database requests. Any Astra Database Server can access the following host database systems. - STAIRS/CMS, produced and distributed by IBM - ISIS, produced and distributed by LAD at UNESCO Paris. - SQL/DS produced by IBM for the <b>VM</b> <b>operating</b> system. - SASjVM produced by SAS Institute for <b>VM</b> <b>operating</b> system. - FOCUSjVM produced by IBI for <b>VM</b> <b>operating</b> system. The. SQL/DS relational DBMS, the SAS system and the FOCUS system are accessed via stored parametric quenes. The reader is supposed to be familiar with VM/CMS environement and to have a good knowledge about the system procedures to install, to mantain and to upgrade the following systems: SQL/DS, ISIS/MVS-VM, STAIRS/CMS, SASjVM-CMS,FOCUS/VM-CMS.

50|$|Commercial system {{builders}} or component resellers sometimes overclock to sell {{items at}} higher profit margins. The seller makes more money by overclocking lower-priced components which {{are found to}} <b>operate</b> <b>correctly</b> and selling equipment at prices appropriate for higher-rated components.

5000|$|Paravirtualization is a {{new term}} for an old idea. IBM's <b>VM</b> <b>operating</b> system has offered such a {{facility}} since 1972 (and earlier as CP-67).

The technology leverages 'hypervisor-based replication', which moves data replication up the server stack from the storage layer into the hypervisor. Zerto is entirely hypervisor and storage-agnostic, so data can be replicated to and from any <b>VM</b> <b>operating</b> to a different platform.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} several novel algorithms for shape formation by subtraction in {{programmable matter}} systems. These algorithms allow the simultaneous formation of multiple different shapes {{from a single}} block of host material. The resulting shapes are allowed to intertwine in arbitrarily complex ways. We also present a proof that the algorithms <b>operate</b> <b>correctly</b> to form the desired shapes. Finally, we show experimental results from close to 100 trials using both the Robot Pebbles hardware and a unique software simulator. Multiple trials of several different experiments demonstrate the algorithms <b>operating</b> <b>correctly.</b> I...|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, in 1989, IBM had {{introduced}} its own TCP/IP offering on MVS.

As the decade progressed, IBM improved its product, and Interlink's market share steadily eroded.|$|R
