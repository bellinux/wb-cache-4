40|$|Beam-excited {{higher order}} modes (HOM) in 3. 9 GHz {{accelerating}} cavities are {{planned to be}} used for beam position monitoring at the European XFEL. The selected HOMs are located around 5440 MHz, with a bandwidth of 100 MHz and 9060 MHz, with a bandwidth of 50 MHz. A downconverter electronics, built for tests at FLASH, converts the HOMs to an intermediate frequency of 70 MHz.

Usually many trade studies must be conducted {{to determine the best}} ways to meet the customer's requirements. When deciding the flight data system, one of the first trade studies normally conducted is the determination of the data bus architecture. The schedule, cost, reliability, and environments are some of the factors that are reviewed in the determination of the data bus architecture.

40|$|The {{mantra of}} 'Faster, Better, Cheaper' has {{to a large}} degree been {{interpreted}} as using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) components and/or circuit boards. One of the first space applications to actually use COTS in space along with radiation performance requirements was the Expedite the Processing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack program, for the International Space Station (ISS). In order to meet the performance, cost and schedule targets, military grade <b>Versa</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Eurocard</b> (VME) was selected as the baseline design for the main computer, the Rack Interface Controller (RIC). VME was chosen as the computer backplane because of the large variety of military grade boards available, which were designed to meet the military environmental specifications (thermal, shock, vibration, etc.). These boards also have a paper pedigree in regards to components. Since these boards exceeded most ISS environmental requirements, it was reasoned using COTS mid-grade VME boards, as opposed to designing custom boards could save significant time and money. It was recognized up front the radiation environment of ISS, while benign compared to many space flight applications, would be the main challenge to using COTS. Thus in addition to selecting vendors on how well their boards met the usual performance and environmental specifications, the board's parts lists were reviewed on how well they would perform in the ISS radiation environment. However, issues with verifying that the available radiation test data was applicable to the actual part used, vendor part design changes and the fact most parts did not have valid test data soon complicated board and part selection in regards to radiation...|$|E

VxWorks' was selected as the operating system for the rack and payload resource controller, primarily based on the proliferation of VME (<b>Versa</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Eurocard)</b> products. These products provide needed flexibility for future hardware upgrades to meet everchanging science research rack configuration requirements. On the International Space Station, there are multiple science research rack configurations, including: 1) Human Research Facility (HRF); 2) EXPRESS ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System); 3) WORF (Window Observational Research Facility); and 4) HHR (Habitat Holding Rack). The RIC (Rack Interface Controller) connects payloads to the ISS bus architecture for data transfer between the payload and ground control. The RIC is a general purpose embedded computer which supports multiple communication protocols, including fiber optic communication buses, Ethernet buses, EIA- 422, Mil-Std- 1553 buses, SMPTE (Society Motion Picture Television Engineers) - 170 M video, and audio interfaces to payloads and the ISS. As a cost saving and software reliability strategy, the Boeing Payload Software Organization developed reusable common software where appropriate. These reusable modules included a set of low-level driver software interfaces to 1553 B. RS 232, RS 422, Ethernet buses, HRDL (High Rate Data Link), video switch functionality, telemetry processing, and executive software hosted on the FUC computer. These drivers formed the basis for software development of the HRF, EXPRESS, EXPRESS ARIS, WORF, and HHR RIC executable modules. The reusable RIC common software has provided extensive benefits, including: 1) Significant reduction in development flow time; 2) Minimal rework and maintenance; 3) Improved reliability; and 4) Overall reduction in software life cycle cost. Due to the limited number of crew hours available on ISS for science research, operational efficiency is a critical customer concern.

The AD machine at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is presently being used to decelerate antiprotons from 3. 57 GeV/c to 100 MeV/c for matter vs anti-matter comparative studies. The ELENA machine, presently under commissioning, {{has been designed to}} provide an extra deceleration stage down to 13. 7 MeV/c. The AD orbit system is based on 32 horizontal and 27 vertical electrostatic Beam Position Monitor (BPM) fitted with existing low noise front-end amplifiers while the ELENA system consists of 24 BPMs equipped with new low-noise head amplifiers. In both systems the front-end amplifiers generate a difference (delta) and a sum (sigma) signal which are sent to the digital acquisition system, placed tens of meters away from the AD or ELENA rings, where they are digitized and further processed. The beam position is calculated by dividing the difference signal by the sum signal either using directly the raw digitized data for measuring the turn-by-turn trajectory in the ELENA system or after down-mixing the signals to baseband for the orbit measurement in both machines. The digitized sigma signal will be used in the ELENA system to calculate the bunched beam intensity and the Schottky parameters with coasting beam after passing through different signal processing chain. The digital acquisition arrangement for both systems is based on the same hardware, also used in the ELENA Low Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) system, which follows the VME Switched Serial (VXS) enhancement of the <b>Versa</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Eurocard</b> 64 x extension (VME 64 x) standard and includes VITA 57 standard Field Programmable Gate Array Mezzanine Card (FMC).

40|$|Particle Induced X-ray Emission is a {{well-established}} technique for quantitative elemental analysis down to trace levels. During microbeam analysis, where the beam is collimated and focused {{into a small}} spot, the beam current reduces to nA or less. The generation of characteristic X-rays is reduced in the same proportion, leading to long data-acquisition times. This can partly be compensated for by using detectors with a large solid angle. In this work, the performance of an annular eight-element silicon drift detector with a total solid angle of 261 msr is described. The initial calibration of the detector was performed using thin elemental standards. Charge measurement was carried out both in a Faraday Cup positioned after the sample and by a pre-sample electrostatic deflection system sampling the beam charge into another Faraday Cup. The two methods were used in parallel and compared during the calibration measurements.

40|$|Abstract. Aspect-Oriented Programming {{languages}} allow pointcut descriptors {{to quantify}} over the implementation points of a system. Such pointcuts are problematic {{with respect to}} independent development because they introduce strong mutual coupling between base modules and aspects. This position paper addresses {{the views of the}} base module. These abstract views should be towards the architectural viewpoints of the system under development. Since the inception of Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) in 1997, it has been known that Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) languages introduce strong coupling between base modules and aspects. AOP languages allow pointcut descriptors to refer directly to the implementations of modules to capture joinpoints, points where aspects inject behavior through advices. This practice is problematic with respect to modularity and independent development.

40|$|Staying {{competitive}} in today's digital consumer market increasingly requires building complex systems {{with a small}} and well defined time-to-market. The integration of third-party, ready-touse IPs is therefore becoming wider as a way reduce design and verification efforts. One of the key points when choosing an external IP is looking at its bus interface (and associated protocol) {{and trying to figure}} out how difficult it will be to integrate it with the rest of the SoC interconnect. OCP (by OCP-IP) was born to provide a standard, yet highly configurable way to specify the communication between IPs, no matter what is the underlying interconnect implementation. The STBus is an interconnect fabric designed and developed within ST which is able to support most of the OCP capabilities, including heavy-pipelined transactions and out-of-order management. The STBus appears then a good candidate to be interfaced with OCP, and this paper is intended to present the complete flow which is being defined for this purpose. The flow is built upon 2 main components, namely a generic (and configurable) OCP-STBus bridge and a Configuration engine. The generic bridge is an RTL module converting OCP-IP transactions into STBus based ones (and vice <b>versa).</b> This <b>module</b> can be configured at generation time to support a broad range of OCP interface configurations, i. e. in terms of protocol subsets, data sizes and so forth. The Configuration engine is at the heart of the flow, as it parses the configuration files that every OCP IP must come with (namely the RTL configuration file and the synthesis configuration file) and accordingly sets the configuration parameters for the generic RTL of the OCP-STBus bridge, as well as the technology to be used for its synthesis. This solution will then enable a very quick and seamless plug-in of any OCP-based IP onto an STBus backbone. 1...|$|R
