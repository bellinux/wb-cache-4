5|$|During World War I, in his {{capacity}} as chair of the New England Forestry Commission, Brown worked with the War Industries Board to send 10 sawmills abroad. The equipment went to Scotland to meet Britain's need for lumber. When the war effort in France subsequently required more than 73 million board feet of lumber per month, Brown was commissioned as a major to oversee sawmill operations there, but ultimately was not allowed to serve in France because of his poor <b>vision,</b> <b>as</b> he was partially blind in one eye.|$|E

5|$|Kieswetter's {{career was}} cut short owing to an injury {{sustained}} while batting for Somerset in July 2014: a ball penetrated the gap between his helmet's grille and visor and struck him in the face, damaging his vision. There was initially some hope of a full recovery and he was named in a provisional England squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, but he continued to experience difficulties with his <b>vision.</b> <b>As</b> {{a result of these}} problems, in June 2015, aged 27, he announced his retirement from professional cricket. In 2017, he became a professional golfer.|$|E
5|$|Later, Millennium Group {{offender}} profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate the}} disappearance of a bus full of schoolchildren. They believe the driver was also a victim, and not responsible; they meet with the local sheriff, John Cayce (Steven Rankin), who has dredged the bus from a lake. It is empty, but inside, Black experiences the same <b>vision</b> <b>as</b> Prine. He also finds paint transfer on the exterior, indicating the perpetrator was driving a white van. A false positive results as police apprehend storm chasers in a different van, who warn that a violent tornado is approaching.|$|E
5|$|Photons {{can also}} be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, {{provoking}} transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular transition of retinal (C20H28O), {{which is responsible for}} <b>vision,</b> <b>as</b> discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Britain in November 1916, Crean resumed naval duties. On 15 December 1916 {{he was promoted}} to the rank of warrant officer (as a boatswain), in recognition of his service on the Endurance, and was awarded his third Polar Medal. On 5 September 1917, Crean married Ellen Herlihy of Annascaul. In early 1920, Shackleton was organising another Antarctic expedition, later {{to be known as the}} Shackleton-Rowett Expedition. He invited Crean to join him, along with other officers from the Endurance. By this time, however, Crean's second daughter had arrived, and he had plans to open a business following his naval career. He turned down Shackleton's invitation. On his last naval assignment, with HMS Hecla, Crean suffered a bad fall which caused lasting effects to his <b>vision.</b> <b>As</b> a result, he was retired on medical grounds on 24 March 1920. He and Ellen opened a small public house in Annascaul, which he called The South Pole Inn. The couple had three daughters, Mary, Kate, and Eileen, although Kate died when she was four years old.|$|E
5|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} destroy the Horcrux, the trio take turns wearing it to dilute its power. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing the wand-maker Gregorovitch, who claims that a teenage boy had once stolen the legendary Elder Wand from his shop. While Ron is wearing the locket, he is overcome by negative feelings and argues with Harry before leaving him and Hermione behind. Hermione deduces that the sword of Gryffindor can destroy Horcruxes and decides with Harry to go to Godric's Hollow. They visit Harry's parents' graves and the house where they were killed. They encounter Bathilda Bagshot, who they believe may have the sword. Bathilda lets Harry and Hermione into her house, and is revealed to actually be Nagini, controlling Bathilda's reanimated corpse from inside of her. Hermione and Harry escape into the Forest of Dean, but Hermione accidentally breaks Harry's wand whilst fighting Nagini. Hermione is then {{able to identify the}} mysterious thief seen in Harry's <b>vision</b> <b>as</b> Gellert Grindelwald.|$|E
5|$|Eddard says Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and the Mad King {{have been}} killed and asks why Ser Arthur was not present at the Battle of the Trident. Ser Arthur replies that he has been ordered to stay at the tower. After Eddard demands to know where his sister is, a battle ensues. Eddard is able to defeat Ser Gerold, but Ser Arthur - {{wielding}} dual swords - easily defeats most of Eddard's men by himself. As Eddard and Ser Arthur duel one-on-one, Bran is puzzled by this <b>vision,</b> <b>as</b> his father had repeatedly boasted of his defeat of Ser Arthur. It is quite apparent that his father is no match for the superior swordsman. Just as Ser Arthur is about to defeat and kill Eddard, a wounded Howland rises and plunges his dagger through the back of Ser Arthur's neck, before Eddard delivers the fatal blow, leaving Bran shocked.|$|E

5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color <b>vision,</b> <b>as</b> they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi {{does not}} respond to prey if the light is under 100lux (like a {{restaurant}} with only subdued artificial lighting), but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10centimetres as the light level increases. A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by <b>vision,</b> <b>as</b> prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures got the same responses from P. schultzi as live prey, and then more detailed testing with the lures showed that: if the target moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; if the target was totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the same spot, P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if a lure was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color <b>vision,</b> <b>as</b> they lack S-cones.|$|E
5000|$|Gwenfair Adams {{describes}} <b>visions</b> <b>as</b> “events {{that were}} believed to involve direct encounters with or communications from the supernatural world”. A vision could be experienced by anyone, anywhere at any time. Generally, visions of the medieval time period had some type of religious, supernatural component consisting of a saint, angel, ghost or demon. [...] It is unclear exactly how many visions María de Ajofrín had throughout her life, but majority of those which Corralez cites centralize around {{the theme of the}} immoral clergy in need of reform. Maria experienced her first vision in 1484, but first had to establish her credibility before the clergy took her <b>visions</b> <b>as</b> honest words from God.|$|R

5|$|In Challenge mode, {{the player}} must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is {{indicated}} above thought bubbles which float above {{the heads of}} the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but they will lose their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow cone of vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described this narrow cone of <b>vision</b> <b>as</b> being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a noise meter. Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires sneaking up behind an NPC or surprising them from a hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the challenges on a level opens the way to the next level. Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked. Gamerscore is rewarded for achieving certain goals or style on the Xbox 360 version.|$|E
