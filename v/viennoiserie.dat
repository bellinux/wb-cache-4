50|$|One legend is {{that the}} {{croissant}} was invented in Vienna, either in 1683 or during the earlier siege in 1529, to celebrate {{the defeat of the}} Ottoman attack on the city, with the shape referring to the crescents on the Ottoman flags. This version of the origin of the croissant is supported by the fact that croissants in France are a variant of <b>Viennoiserie,</b> and by the French popular belief that Vienna-born Marie Antoinette introduced the pastry to France in 1770.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} {{signature}} challenge, the bakers {{had to make}} <b>Viennoiserie</b> in {{three and a half}} hours. They had to make two different types of the pastry. In the technical, the judges decided to bring things [...] "back to basics" [...] by asking the bakers to bake 12 Victoria Sandwiches, Tartes au citron and Scones. The challenge, however, was that they had only two hours to make this and only three instructions. The final Showstopper was a Pièce montée. The bakers were given five hours to make this, and the judges said it must be in some self-standing structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{birth of}} the {{croissant}} itself-that is, its adaptation from the plainer form of Kipferl, before the invention of viennoiseries-can be dated to at least 1839 (some say 1838) when an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris. This bakery, which served Viennese specialities including the Kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, of <b>viennoiserie,</b> a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries). The French version of the Kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant) shape and has become an identifiable shape across the world.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional rugelach {{are made}} {{in the form of a}} {{crescent}} by rolling a triangle of dough around a filling. [...] Some sources state that the rugelach and the French croissant share a common Viennese ancestor, crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the lifting of the Turkish siege, possibly a reference to the Battle of Vienna in 1683. This appears to be an urban legend however, as both the rugelach and its supposed ancestor, the Kipferl, pre-date the Early Modern era, while the croissant in its modern form did not originate earlier than the 19th century (see <b>viennoiserie).</b> This leads many to believe that the croissant is simply a descendant of one of these two.|$|E
