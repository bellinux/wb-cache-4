The two {{disagreed}} on the valuation of the site, Davies offered what {{was believed to be}} the market price of GB£3.5M, Goodway demanded £14M for the relocation of Council staff. In October 1997, both the Welsh Office and Cardiff Council agreed to the District <b>Valuer</b> providing an independent assessment of the market value of Cardiff City Hall and the cost of staff relocating to an equivalent standard of accommodation. The District <b>Valuer</b> advised that the open market value of Cardiff City Hall was £3.5M. There was not enough information available for the District <b>Valuer</b> to make a decision. A bid of £2.5M was made by the Welsh Office on 14 November 1997, which was rejected on 21 November 1997. A final offer of £3.5M was made on 24 November and this too was rejected by Cardiff County Council.

In order to investigate the most preferred adjustment techniques applied by <b>valuers</b> in Malaysia as well as the elements of adjustment, a questionnaire survey is conducted that involves <b>valuers</b> from government and private sectors as respondents. The research reveals that the most preferred adjustment technique among <b>valuers</b> in Malaysia is the summative percentage method with the sequence of adjustment based on the ranking order of tenure, date of transaction, location, physical characteristics, economic, land use and zoning, quantum, topography, and financial terms.

25|$|The {{district}} auditors {{operated under}} the control of the Audit Commission, which was a body established by (although operationally independent of) central government. Given the highly politicised fight, there was speculation that the Government was encouraging the Commission. Looking back on the history, Martin Loughlin noted that the Government did not appear to be formally directing the Commission, but that there was probably extensive consultation. The Commissioners had on 6 June 1985 directed the extraordinary audits of Lambeth and Liverpool, although by that time the district auditors were already planning to take this course. The auditors calculated the loss to the council as being the amount lost from interest payments on the amount paid by the Department of Health and Social Services and the Treasury <b>Valuer</b> which were unable to be paid until a rate was set; Martin Loughlin notes that this interest had instead accrued to the Government and therefore no money was lost to the public purse.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the influence of consumer behaviour on the variables determining residential property values in Lagos metropolis and how Nigerian <b>valuers</b> are incorporating these in their valuation exercise. The survey which was carried out within a period of three months (January, February and March 2006) involved buyers and <b>valuers</b> which participated in the sales of some properties within Lagos Metropolis. These buyers and <b>valuers</b> were asked to rank on a 4 -point likert scale; the relative importance of each of the property attributes which affect the price of the property as perceived by them. The significance of each attribute was then assessed using Relative Importance Index (RII). The significant difference between the ranking of the buyers and <b>valuers</b> was assessed at each variable level and when all the variables were combined using the Kendall test of concordance and tested at. 05 level of significant using chi- square approximation. Regressing the attributes of each property against the actual property paid, the significance of each attribute was determined; which was then compared with the ratings of both the <b>valuers</b> and the buyers.

40|$|Studies in {{a number}} of {{countries}} have identified certain factors as major contributors to inaccuracy in real property valuation. Of these, individual characteristics of <b>valuers</b> and to a lesser degree, the ethical culture of the firms that engage them, are foremost and universal. This study evaluates the predictive and relative importance of individual characteristics of valuers/valuation firms that contribute to inaccuracy in residential property valuation in Lagos, Nigeria. It also includes the results of an empirical study on the level of accuracy achieved by <b>valuers</b> in the study area. Information elicited from senior partners of 250 firms of Estate Surveyors and <b>valuers</b> (appraisers) operating within Lagos metropolis were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The study revealed a degree of inaccuracy that is beyond the industry’s tolerance limits. The study also identified the experience and exposure of valuers; the number of valuations undertaken by <b>valuers</b> within a period of time; professional status of valuers; valuers’ familiarity with relevant markets; and interestingly, the gender of <b>valuers,</b> in that order, as factors that significantly contribute to inaccuracy in residential property valuation in the study area.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the second of two papers which aim to examine the major legal {{liability}} implications of changes to the commercial property loan valuation process caused by the recession in the UK property market and to make recommendations to <b>valuers</b> and their professional institutions {{to improve the quality}} of the process and the result. The objectives of this paper are to address a number of the practical implications of changes to the loan valuation process within the context of legal liability. The results of an interview survey of lenders and <b>valuers</b> are reported and analysed. The survey examined the loan valuation process including the selection and instruction of <b>valuers,</b> bases of valuation and valuation reporting. In the selection and instruction process, the findings of the survey reveal two potential problems within the valuer/lender relationship. First, <b>valuers</b> still occasionally accept instructions from borrowers and this could lead to a conflict of interest as lenders may rely on the survey. Second, the occasional lack of formal instructions prior to the delivery of reports casts doubt on the <b>valuer’s</b> ability to correctly identify the needs of clients. Regarding the basis of valuation, it was found that <b>valuers</b> are providing valuations on bases which they do not think are appropriate. <b>Valuers</b> may be legally liable if they do not inform clients of their reservations and this situation must be urgently addressed. The survey also confirms previous research that valuation reports are considered to be light on contextual information concerning markets. The paper concludes by making a number of specific recommendations concerning possible improvements to the commercial property loan valuation process...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to damages {{for not getting}} the thing promised itself, a contract breaker must compensate for the costly consequences of the breach that one would reasonably expect to exist. There must be a causal connection between the breach and the consequence complained of. In Saamco v York Montague Ltd it was held a bank could not recover damages from property <b>valuer</b> {{for all of the}} difference in what the properties it bought after getting the valuations were assured to be and actual property values, because {{a large part of the}} difference resulted from generally depressed market prices following [...] "Black Wednesday" [...] in 1992. In a business deal, calculation will typically be based on the forgone profits that one could reasonably have expected to make. This could also include the [...] "loss of a chance" [...] to profit, so in Chaplin v Hicks an entrant in a beauty contest wrongfully excluded from the final round was awarded 25% of the final prize money to reflect her 1 in 4 chance of having won. One limit lies at consequential losses that are too [...] "remote", or are not a natural result of the breach, and are not in the parties' contemplation. In Hadley v Baxendale a miller tried to recover damages from Baxendale's delivery company for the lost profits from his mill grinding to a halt, after they were late delivering a crankshaft back from being fixed. But Alderson B held that because millers would usually be expected to keep spare crank shafts, and because he had not informed Baxendale of the importance of the timely delivery, an award for profits could not be compensated. More recently in The Achilleas the majority of the House of Lords preferred to express the remoteness rule as one of construing the contract to reflect the parties' [...] "background of market expectations". Transfield Shipping returned The Achilleas late to its owner, Mercator, which led Mercator to lose a lucrative contract with Cargill that would make over $1.3million, an occurrence that was plainly a natural consequence of the breach and easily foreseeable. Yet because the standard practice and expectation in the shipping industry was that if a ship were returned late only the ordinary sum for hire would be due, this was the limit on recovery. It is also possible to lose one's entitlement to damages if steps are not taken to mitigate further losses, that any prudent person would, rather than sitting back and letting losses run up. But the burden of proof of a failure to mitigate is on a contract breaker, to whom the courts are unlikely to be sympathetic. A contract breaker could may also, if a concurrent liability arises in tort, argue a claimant's damages should be reduced to reflect their contributory fault, and the courts can reduce an award to achieve a just and equitable result. Sometimes potential profits will be too uncertain, or a general fall in market prices means that even claiming damages for the thing itself would leave one in a negative position, and so the courts allow a claimant to choose whether to sue, not for a failure in expectations, but to cover her expenses in preparing for the contract, or the [...] "reliance interest". In Anglia Television Ltd v Reed a TV channel successfully sued Robert Reed for not turning up for shooting a film. It was unclear whether the film would make any profits at all, and so Anglia TV got compensated for its wasted expenses in preparing the set. The level of damages is generally assessed at the date of the breach, but this is variable if the court thinks another time would be fairer.|$|E
