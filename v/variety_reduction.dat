These varieties generalize the <b>varieties</b> of <b>reductions</b> for the Severi varieties studied by Iliev and Manivel, which are Fano varieties. We develop a theoretical basis to the study these <b>varieties</b> of <b>reductions,</b> and relate the geometry of these variety to some problems in representation theory.

40|$|To {{meet the}} demand for variety, many firms widen their product ranges, {{increasing}} not only revenues but also operational inefficiencies. Managerial choices can mitigate the negative effects on costs, but they also limit {{the ability of a}} firm to deliver variety to the market within the timeframe and costs requested by clients. Therefore, the variety actually offered in the market can be different from the level of variety that had been defined during, for instance, product development. We call the series of decisions whose interaction results in the variety actually distributed in the market the process of <b>variety</b> <b>reduction.</b> This paper introduces a descriptive model of this process. The model has been applied to a real case to highlight the main <b>variety</b> <b>reduction</b> decisions. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|To define BPS, {{we first}} look at {{standardization}} in general. In this, we follow David (1987) who identifies compatibility and interface standardization, minimum quality standardization, and <b>variety</b> <b>reduction</b> standardization by categorizing standardization according to the economic problems it solves. Compatibility and interface standardization introduces technology standards to facilitate communication and ensure product compatibility. The economic phenomenon associated {{with this type of}} standardization is network externalities, the theory of which posits that the value of standardization depends on the number of adopters (Gowrisankaran and Stavins 2002). Interface standardization requires information technology (IT) and process standardization (Venkatesh and Bala 2012). Minimum quality standardization sets reference points for the quality of goods and services to reduce customers’ uncertainty. It prevents Akerlof’s (1970) markets for lemons where only poor-quality products are traded, which can occur if customers cannot properly evaluate the quality of goods and services. <b>Variety</b> <b>reduction</b> standardization reduces planned or unintentional variation to exploit economies of scale (Swann 2000).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} hierarchy in human systems. Two kinds of self-organizing processes are distinguished: conservative and dissipative self-organization. The former leads to rather stable, specialistic systems, whereas the latter leads to continuously changing generalistic systems. When conservative and dissipative self-organization are combined, autonomous self-organization emerges. Autonomous self-organization, characterized by intertemporal stability, appears to be fundamental to human organizations. In the context of autonomous self-organization, the traditional concept of hierarchy as a chain of command is replaced by hierarchy as a vertical sequence based on different degrees of abstraction. Moreover, a simple model shows that autonomous self-organization requires large human systems to {{use a variety of}} information processing systems, including administrative hierarchy.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to bring a new element to the academic (and industrial) debate concerning the optimum level of variety in component design in mass production companies. Many authors have explored the trade-off between functional and variety costs, and this could be considered as a well acknowledged management issue, at least from an engineering perspective. Nevertheless, while defining the theoretically optimal level of component variety, there are other elements, more related to operators’ attitude or to operative conditions, which may intervene and prevent effective exploitation of the existing variety. These elements have been given scant attention in literature, while they may play a relevant role in real organisations. In this paper, we will present a case study and an analytic model for these “behavioural costs” in manufacturing environments, so as to show how the theoretically optimal amount of variety changes if one takes into account these aspects. Researchers (and practitioners) might leverage on this contribution in order to rejuvenate the <b>Variety</b> <b>Reduction</b> paradigm, and to increase their awareness in designing and managing mass production manufacturing processes...|$|E
30|$|An often-discussed {{issue is}} the {{relationship}} between BPS and process flexibility. Process flexibility is the ability of a process to cope with contextual changes by adapting its structure and behavior in a goal-oriented manner (Wagner et al. 2011). From an operational perspective, process flexibility splits into functional and volume flexibility (Afflerbach et al. 2014). While volume flexibility enables increasing or decreasing the amount of the process output above or below the installed capacity (Goyal and Netessine 2011), functional flexibility enables delivering the output variety demanded by the organization’s customers (Anupindi et al. 2012). Volume flexibility relates to the establishment of scalable resources for process execution, whereas functional flexibility deals with variety at the process design level. In other words, functional flexibility relates to the creation of process designs and volume flexibility to the designs’ execution. Thus, functional flexibility is much closer to BPS as conceptualized from a <b>variety</b> <b>reduction</b> perspective, where process variants and the alignment of variants against a master process play a central role. This difference in closeness to BPS is corroborated by the fact that volume flexibility has been mainly researched from a capacity and a revenue management perspective, whereas functional flexibility has a rich tradition in BPM (Kumar and Narasipuram 2006; Reichert and Weber 2012). Moreover, {{one of the most popular}} means for implementing functional process flexibility is “flexibility by design”, a strategy that requires incorporating alternative process variants in a process design at build time and selecting the most appropriate variant at runtime (Schonenberg et al. 2008). This strategy shows the direct relationship between BPS and process flexibility, particularly functional process flexibility. This is why we henceforth focus on functional process flexibility.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two empirical studies of the industrial organization of food retailing. Chapter 1 investigates consumer behavior in response to changes in variety in grocery store offerings. Using a rich panel dataset of consumer purchases from one national retailer, we measure the effects of changes in product variety on sales of ice cream, where the assortment changes were gradually introduced to stores. We use a difference in differences approach to measure treatment effects against trends in stores prior to treatment. Our results show an adjustment to product variety causes consumers to alter their purchasing behavior, {{at least in the}} subsequent eight weeks of the change. When the rearrangement consisted of adding additional products, consumers purchased more on average in the immediate term, but sales increases mitigated over time, with smaller magnitude increases in <b>variety</b> experiencing sales <b>reductions</b> in later weeks. Product groups treated with reduced variety experienced decreased sales both in the immediate and longer term. We find that extending and reducing assortment have asymmetric effects, with a marginal change to increased variety boosting sales less than a marginal change in decreased <b>variety.</b> Larger magnitude <b>reductions</b> perform poorly in the short run, but actually perform better than both smaller <b>variety</b> <b>reductions</b> and small <b>variety</b> increases in later weeks. In Chapter 2, I investigate the following question: do firms respond to quality disclosure by nearby competitors? This paper utilizes exogenous variation provided by Los Angeles County's introduction of restaurant hygiene grade cards to explore inter-firm responses in markets for differentiated goods. Under this program, a subset of cities adopted mandatory grade card posting, requiring restaurants to disclose hygiene. This study demonstrates that restaurants under a voluntary hygiene disclosure policy improved hygiene more when located closer to restaurants in mandatory disclosure areas. The proximity effect implies that mandatory disclosure policies influenced restaurant hygiene in nearby voluntary disclosure areas, thus providing direct evidence that quality-disclosure regulations affect non-targeted firms...|$|R

30|$|Depending on the context, the {{relationship}} between BPS and process flexibility {{can be interpreted as}} conflicting or complementary (Afflerbach et al. 2014). On the one hand, BPS and flexibility appear to conflict, as BPS reduces the number of process variants and prohibits deviating from variants, whereas more process variants and degrees of freedom during execution help cope with a higher desired output variety (Pentland 2003). On the other hand, BPS and flexibility appear complementary when, for instance, processes are defined as modules with interfaces that enable assembling processes at runtime to meet the customers’ demands (Münstermann et al. 2009). In our case, where BPS is conceptualized from a <b>variety</b> <b>reduction</b> perspective, BPS and process flexibility conflict. If the reduction of process variants leads to a reduced output variety in the sense of output standardization, an organization loses the ability to assign that process variant to a context that fits it best (Ludwig et al. 2011). Instead, an organization must use the master process, which generally fits a distinct process context worse than the related context-specific process variant (Hall and Johnson 2009; Hammer and Stanton 1999). This negative effect on functional flexibility is supported by Davenport (2005) as well as by Hall and Johnson (2009), who identified output standardization as the main reason for BPS failure. They argue that individuality creates value for customers, which may not be available for highly standardized processes. Böhmann et al. (2005) share this line of argument. In the service domain, where customers are in many cases tightly integrated in an organization’s processes, the mere reduction of process variants may be enough to decrease the customers’ perceived individuality even if the output itself is not standardized.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{links the}} {{theoretical}} framework of technological innovation systems to standardization and standards arguing {{that there are}} analytical benefits in integrating these theoretical perceptions within the literature of innovation. The paper seeks to address how technological change evolves, are obtained and maintained by applying this conceptual framework to the European offshore wind industry. I ask what role standardization and standards have in the innovation processes of offshore wind power in Europe, and investigate the relationship through examples from the industry, and viewpoints from Norwegian actors. Empirical studies need to be analyzed from different theoretical perspectives {{in order to be}} fully understood and provide effective solutions, further supporting the theoretical combination. Concerns have been expressed about the competitiveness of European offshore wind setting the political goals for expanding this renewable resource under pressure. As we near 2020 offshore wind subsidies will be phased out, and offshore wind energy has to become less cost intensive in order to become competitive with other energy resources. We therefore need to investigate different solutions for bringing down the costs of offshore wind {{in order to make it}} a viable contributor to the future energy market. Higher level of standardization in the industry enable transfer of knowledge, and standards have functionalities such as ensuring quality and reliability, providing information, creating compatibility and contributing to <b>variety</b> <b>reduction</b> further influencing the systemic performance of the offshore wind innovation system. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between standardization and systemic functions in the offshore wind industry through Norwegian actors and European examples this paper concludes, though rather humbly, that standardization is an important factor in the energy transition strategy. This is further valid on theoretical, analytical and empirical terms in innovation studies in general, and in the energy transition and diffusion of offshore wind more specifically...|$|E
30|$|To {{validate}} {{whether the}} decision model’s design specification suitably addresses the research question from an ex-ante artificial evaluation perspective, we discuss its characteristics against {{the design objectives}} derived from justificatory knowledge. Regarding design objective (O. 1), the decision model allows for different process contexts and process variants. It also splits process variants into context-specific process variants and a standardized master process. Whereas context-specific process variants only fit a single context, the master process fits more than one and up to all process contexts. Conceptualizing BPS from a <b>variety</b> <b>reduction</b> perspective, the decision model considers all process variant profiles to determine the optimal BPS level, checking which contexts should be served by the respective variants or the standardized master process. As for design objective (O. 2), the decision model treats process performance as a multi-dimensional construct. More precisely, it measures process performance {{in line with the}} performance dimensions included in the Devil’s Quadrangle. The partially conflicting effects of BPS on these dimensions make up the BPS trade-off. The decision model addresses the BPS trade-off by first modeling the effects of BPS on each performance dimensions separately and then integrating the partial models into an overarching objective function. On the one hand, the Gini coefficient as a measure for demand concentration and standardization incorporates learning effects in the dimensions time, quality, and costs. On the other, variant-specific cost and flexibility effects account for the peculiarities of process contexts. The objective function adopts the principles of VBM, reflecting the contribution of different process variant profiles to the organization’s long-term firm value. This makes the decision model comply with decision objective (O. 3). To sum up, the decision model’s design specification addresses all design objectives. We therefore consider the design model as valid from an ex-ante artificial evaluation perspective. Accordingly, the decision model contributes to answering the research question. We revert to the mentioned limitations and ideas for future research in the conclusion.|$|E
