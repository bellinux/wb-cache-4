40|$|INTRODUCTION: Iatrogenic {{injuries}} to the urogenital tract are rare, with the bladder being the organ most affected. We describe {{a case of}} a <b>vesical</b> <b>calculus</b> that formed on non-absorbable sutures that were used to repair an inguinal hernia. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 45 -year-old male presented with frank haematuria and dysuria 2 years following an open left inguinal hernia repair. A CT urography showed a <b>vesical</b> <b>calculus</b> adherent to the left anterio-lateral wall of the bladder. Cystoscopy revealed that the calculus formed on non-absorbable sutures. Cystolapaxy was performed followed by cystoscopic excision of the sutures. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful. DISCUSSION: Foreign bodies in the urinary bladder always act as a nidus for formation of a calculus. Iatrogenic bladder injuries are common during hernia repair. It is however rare for sutures used to repair an inguinal hernia to involve the urinary bladder wall. The patient most likely had a full bladder at the time of hernia repair or the bladder was part of the contents of the hernia sac. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the need to ensure that the bladder is empty prior to pelvic surgery and for surgeons to have a good understanding of inguinal anatomy to avoid injuring the contents of the hernia sac...|$|E

Materials and Methods: This study included 67 patients of bladder stone treated in this hospital from between June 2006 to December 2009 who were randomly assigned in three groups-group 1 (transurethral removal using a nephroscope), group 2 (transurethral removal using a cystoscope), and group 3 (percutaneous removal using a nephroscope). Results: Statistical significant difference was observed in operating time-group 1 (32. 1 + 8. 5 mins), group 2 (69. 2 + 16. 3), and group 3 (46 + 7. 3). Statistically significant difference was also observed in the postoperative stay of the patient, which was highest for the group 3 patients. Complete clearance was achieved in all the patients.

40|$|The {{medical records}} of 1000 {{asymptomatic}} male air force personnel were examined retrospectively {{for the results}} of 15 yearly examinations of urinary sediment. The study covered the period 1968 - 82, beginning with the subjects aged 18 - 33 years. The cumulative incidence of two to four or more red blood cells per high power field found at one or more examinations was 38. 7 % after an average of 12. 2 yearly examinations per person. In 161 subjects two to four or more red blood cells per high power field were found at two or more yearly examinations within a five year period. Intravenous pyelography in 58 cases disclosed asymptomatic nephrolithiasis in six. Cystoscopy performed in 11 cases identified one patient with urethritis, one with a <b>vesical</b> <b>calculus,</b> and one with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Two years before diagnosis the patient with carcinoma had had a single transient finding of 10 - 12 red blood cells per high power field which was not investigated further. Cystoscopy was performed after an episode of macroscopic haematuria. Renal biopsy in one subject with recurrent microhaematuria and trace proteinuria disclosed focal glomerulonephritis. None of the remaining subjects with microhaematuria developed hypertension or proteinuria, {{and at the end of}} the study period all were active and free of urinary symptoms. The observed cumulative incidence of urological neoplasms at 15 years (0. 1 %) was consistent with that expected in Israeli men aged 18 - 40 (0. 09 %).

40|$|Abstract Background Some tetraplegic {{patients}} {{may wish to}} undergo urological procedures without anaesthesia, but these patients can develop autonomic dysreflexia if cystoscopy and vesical lithotripsy are performed without anaesthesia. Case presentation We describe three tetraplegic patients, who developed autonomic dysreflexia when cystoscopy and laser lithotripsy were carried out without anesthesia. In two patients, who declined anaesthesia, blood pressure increased to more than 200 / 110 mmHg during cystoscopy. One of these patients developed severe bleeding from bladder mucosa and lithotripsy was abandoned. Laser lithotripsy was carried out under subarachnoid block a week later in this patient, and this patient did not develop autonomic dysreflexia. The third patient with C- 3 tetraplegia had undergone correction of kyphoscoliotic deformity of spine with spinal rods and pedicular screws from the level of T- 2 to S- 2. Pulmonary function test revealed moderate to severe restricted curve. This patient developed <b>vesical</b> <b>calculus</b> and {{did not wish to}} have general anaesthesia because of possible need for respiratory support post-operatively. Subarachnoid block was not considered in view of previous spinal fixation. When cystoscopy and laser lithotripsy were carried out under sedation, blood pressure increased from 110 / 50 mmHg to 160 / 80 mmHg. Conclusion These cases show that tetraplegic patients are likely to develop autonomic dysreflexia during cystoscopy and vesical lithotripsy, performed without anaesthesia. Health professionals should educate spinal cord injury patients regarding risks of autonomic dysreflexia, when urological procedures are carried out without anaesthesia. If spinal cord injury patients are made aware of potentially life-threatening complications of autonomic dysreflexia, {{they are less likely to}} decline anaesthesia for urological procedures. Subrachnoid block or epidural meperidine blocks nociceptive impulses from urinary bladder and prevents occurrence of autonomic dysreflexia. If spinal cord injury patients with lesions above T- 6 decline anaesthesia, nifedipine 10 mg should be given sublingually prior to cystoscopy to prevent increase in blood pressure due to autonomic dysreflexia. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the nature of prostatic overgrowth with reference to the relative and absolute amounts of epithelium, stroma, and acinar space in a series of normal and a series of enlarged organs by the methods of projectometry. Historical A review of the literature has revealed a confusing mass of observations and theories on the nature and etiology of the condition. Home 7, in 1812, described urinary obstruction frequently caused by the "middle lobe " projecting from the region of the trigone and occasionally by proliferation of the periurethral tissues of the prostate. The cause, he thought, was anything that produced congestion. He considered it analogous to apoplexy and thought the tumors were in reality blood clots. Many lesser contributions to the knowledge of prostatic overgrowth were made during the following fifty years. By most investigators it was believed to be essentially a fibrous change. A host of etiological agents were named, among which were irritability of the trigone, sexual excess, <b>vesical</b> <b>calculus,</b> strong diuretics, alcohol, straining at stool, chronic diarrhea, stricture, use of catheters and bougies, syphilis, gonorrhea, scrofula, and old age. Virchow" 5 was the first to believe that enlargement was a true hypertrophy. He divided hypertrophic nodules into two types, the myomatous and the glandular. He pointed out that the fibrous change formerly recognized was a reaction to the growth of the nodules. Lannois 8 declared that hypertrophy was part of a senile arteriosclerotic change involving the whole urinary system. In a voluminous report Ciechanowski 3 noted evidence of chronic infection in all hypertrophic organs and concluded that chronic infection, almost always gonorrhea, was the cause. Scar formation causing occlusion produced the nodules. Atrophy according to him was an identical process with scar formation predominant over cyst formation. Albarran 2 described the periurethral or accessory prostatic glands that exist behind the verumontanum and are known by his name.

40|$|A {{statistical}} observation {{was made on}} 861 cases of urolithiasis experienced during the past thirty-two years, 1928 to 1959. 92 of them showed multilocation of stones in the urinary tract. They consisted of 221 cases (25. 6 %) of renal calculus, 291 (33. 7 %) of ureteral, 252 (29. 2 %) of vesical, 54 (6. 2 %) of urethral and 43 (4. 9 %) of prostatic. In the early period of above 32 years, calculus in the lo w er urinary tract showed higher incidence {{than that of the}} upper, but this ratio lately reversed with greatly increasing incidence of upper urinary tract calculus. Age distribution of calculus was 223 cases (25. 9 %) in the third decade, 182 (21. 1 %) in the fourth decade. In young adults, there were many cases of calculus of the upper urinary tract; on the other hand, there were many cases of the lower urinary tract calculus in the aged and children. 729 cas e s (84. 6 %) were male and 132 cases (15. 3 %) were female. The ratio of male to female on sites of stones was 3. 2 to 1 in renal calculus, 4. 2 to 1 in ureteral, 9. 1 to 1 in vesical and 54 to 0 in urethral. By occupations, farm er was in the first and business man was in the next place. In the upper urinary calculus, the ratio of renal to ureteral calculus was 1 to 1. 3. Affected side was a little more on the left than the right. Ureteral stones were found more in the lower ureter than in the upper or mid-ureter. Male to female ratio of upper urinary calculus was 3. 7 to 1, highest incidence of which was seen in the trird decade in both male and female. V e sical calculus showed highest incidence in the seventh decade and next in the fifth decade. It was interesting that 30 cases (11. 8 %) of <b>vesical</b> <b>calculus</b> were found in one to ten years of age. Urethral c alculus occupied 6. 8 % of all urinary calculus and was most frequent in one to sixten years of age, but there was no case of female. Prostatic calculus was mostly seen in man over 40 and occupied 5. 09 % of all urinary calculus. As far as the treatment of urolithiasis is concerned, in the early periods, those who received treatment for urinary calculus were only 44. 8 % of all the urolithiatic patients occupying 2. 4 % of outpatients. Recently, however, cases of urolithiasis have progressively increased and those who received treatment became more than 50 %. Treatment of urolithiasis was, as a whole, surgical.

Objectives: To discuss {{the role of}} disodium etidronate therapy for prevention of calcium phosphate vesical calculi in persons with spinal cord injury, who have hypercalciuria and biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption. Setting: Regional Spinal Injuries Centre, Southport, UK. Methods: A 21 -year-old male sustained paraplegia (T- 10; ASIA scale: A) in a road traffic accident in June 2001. He had an indwelling urethral catheter {{until the end of}} August 2001, when he started self-catheterisation. He developed bladder stones and electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) was performed in May 2002. All stone fragments were removed. Recurrence of vesical calculi was noted in October 2002. These stones were fragmented by lithoclast lithotripsy in two sessions, in December 2002 and February 2003; all stone fragments were removed {{at the end of the}} second session. This patient reverted to indwelling catheter drainage when vesical calculi recurred. in September 2003, X-ray of the abdomen showed recurrence of vesical calculi. By February 2004, the stones had increased in size and number. EHL of vesical calculi was again performed in April 2004. Complete clearance was achieved. Results: A 24 -h urinalysis detected hypercalciuria - 18. 7 mmol/day (reference range: 2. 5 - 7. 5). Biochemical analysis of <b>vesical</b> <b>calculus</b> revealed calcium phosphate (85 %) and magnesium ammonium phosphate (15 %). Plasma C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) was increased - 1. 06 ng/ml (reference range: 0. 1 - 0. 5 ng/ml). Free deoxypyridinoline/creatinine ratio (fDPD/Cr) in urine was also increased - 20. 2 (reference range: 2. 3 - 5. 4). in April 2004, this patient was prescribed disodium etidronate 400 mg day. Nearly 3 months after commencing therapy with etidronate, plasma CTX decreased to 0. 87 ng/ml. fDPD/Cr in urine also decreased to 12. 4. After 4 months of etidronate therapy, 24 - h urinary calcium excretion had decreased to 6. 1 mmol/day. Conclusion: Etidronate (400 mg daily) is a very effective inhibitor of calcium phosphate crystallisation. Etidronate decreased urinary excretion of calcium, an important factor in prevention of calcium phosphate bladder stones. Etidronate therapy is not a substitute for other well-established methods for prevention of vesical calculi in spinal cord injury patients, for example, large fluid intake, avoiding long-term catheter drainage. Intermittent therapy with etidronate may be considered in selected patients, in whom hypercalciuria persists after instituting nonpharmacological therapy for an adequate period, for example, early mobilisation, weight-bearing exercises, and functional electrical stimulation. However, possible side effects of etidronate, and the fact that etidronate is not licensed in United Kingdom for prevention of urolithiasis, should be borne in mind.
