5|$|DNA {{contains}} the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function, grow and reproduce. However, {{it is unclear}} how long in the 4-billion-year history of life DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material. RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis as part of ribozymes. This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the evolution of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases. This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes. However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years, and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution. Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of the isolation of a <b>viable</b> <b>bacterium</b> from a salt crystal 250 million years old, but these claims are controversial.|$|E

The mean number of tumors initiated per <b>viable</b> <b>bacterium</b> on pinto bean leaves was greatest after a 1 -hr exposure to 15 μg of the drug per ml. Chlorpromazine had no significant effect on tumor initiation when applied to previously inoculated leaves. Chlorpromazine at 10 μg/ml was bacteriostatic; concentrations of 20 μg/ml and higher were bactericidal. In contrast to mitomycin C, which also enhances A. tumefaciens infectivity, chlorpromazine failed to induce temperate phage in several lysogenic strains of A. tumefaciens.

40|$|The present study, using {{robotized}} DNA {{isolation and}} quantitative PCR {{based on the}} Neisseria meningitidis-specific capsular transport A gene, demonstrates the ease, rapidity, specificity, and sensitivity of quantifying neisserial DNA in plasma (n = 65) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 12) from patients with systemic meningococcal disease. We found a close correlation between the levels of neisserial DNA and lipopolysaccharides in plasma (r = 0. 905) and in CSF (r = 0. 964). The median concentration of neisserial DNA in plasma in 23 patients with persistent shock was 2 × 107 copies/ml, versus < 103 copies/ml in 42 nonshock patients. Furthermore, quantitative PCR made possible estimates {{of the total number}} of meningococci in plasma, as opposed to conventional blood cultures, suggesting about 1, 000 dead meningococci for every <b>viable</b> <b>bacterium.</b> Finally, with logistic regression analyses, neisserial DNA may predict a patient's disease severity and outcome at hospital admission. The number of meningococci in plasma and CSF appears to be the main determinant of the lipopolysaccharide levels, clinical presentation, and outcome...|$|E

30|$|For each {{bacterial}} strain and species, {{one needs to}} optimize the PI concentrations to keep the bacteria viable, as done here for Escherichia coli (E. coli) K- 12 MG 1655. E. coli K- 12 derivatives {{have been widely used}} as model strains in surface adhesion and biofilm studies [4, 31, 37 – 39]. We expressed eGFP from the pHis plasmid {{under the control of the}} IPTG inducible tac promoter to replace the growth inhibiting DNA stain SYTO® 9 as live bacterial marker. To exclude negative effects of GFP expression as well as IPTG and antibiotic addition on bacterial viability and adhesion, we compared the adhesion properties and growth kinetics of the K- 12 AAEC 191 A background strain [24] to a constitutive eGFP expressing strain (rpsm-GFP) and the IPTG inducible pHis-GFP strain (Figure  4 a,b). No significant difference in adhesion and growth was observed. Furthermore, no significant difference in the fraction of GFP-expressing bacteria was found for the eGFP expression under the constitutive and inducible promoter used in this study (Figure  4 c,d). However, even non-toxic gene products like GFP can have detrimental effects on bacteria when overexpressed [40], since overexpression of an introduced gene requires a lot of resources and thus might disorganize the bacterial metabolism. Therefore, the inducible IPTG-based expression system, as compared to constitutive expression systems, allows for a control of GFP expression and guarantees a balance between fluorescent and healthy bacteria (Figure  4 c,d). Since eGFP is a very stable protein [41, 42] new GFP variants with reduced half-lives, e.g. GFP(LVA), have been suggested to study transient gene expression in bacteria [43]. The enzymatic degradation of unstable GFP(LVA) however, requires a metabolically active <b>viable</b> <b>bacterium</b> (Additional file 1 : Figure S 3). Thus, the use of GFP(LVA) variants does not improve our assay to limit false-positive detection of dead bacteria.|$|E
40|$|DQ- 113 {{is a new}} {{quinolone}} with potent activity against gram-positive pathogens. The in vivo {{activity of}} DQ- 113 against Streptococcus pneumoniae was {{compared with those of}} gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin in a mouse model. For this purpose, two strains of S. pneumoniae were used: penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). The survival rates of mice infected with PSSP and PRSP at 14 days after infection were 80 % in the DQ- 113 -treated group and 0 to 10 % in the other three groups. In murine infections caused by PSSP, the 50 % effective doses (ED 50 s) of DQ- 113, gatifloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 6. 0, 41. 3, and 131. 6 mg/kg, respectively. Against PRSP-caused pneumonia in mice, the ED 50 s of DQ- 113, gatifloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 7. 6, 64. 7, and 125. 9 mg/kg, respectively. Compared with the other drugs, DQ- 113 showed excellent therapeutic efficacy and eradicated viable bacteria in both PSSP- and PRSP-infected mice. The means ± standard errors of the means of <b>viable</b> <b>bacterium</b> counts in the lungs of gatifloxacin-treated, ciprofloxacin-treated, and untreated control mice infected with PSSP were 2. 91 ± 0. 34, 3. 13 ± 0. 48, and 3. 86 ± 0. 80 log 10 CFU/ml, respectively. The same counts in mice infected with PRSP treated with the same three agents were 6. 57 ± 0. 99, 6. 54 ± 0. 40, and 7. 17 ± 0. 43 log 10 CFU/ml, respectively. DQ- 113 significantly decreased the number of viable bacteria in the lungs compared with gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Of the drugs analyzed, the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameter of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) /MIC ratio for DQ- 113 was significantly higher than those for gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Our results suggest that DQ- 113 has potent in vivo efficacy against both PSSP and PRSP...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that probiotics are {{beneficial}} in T-cell-mediated inflammatory diseases. The molecular mechanism by which probiotics work remains elusive, but accumulating evidence indicates that probiotics can modulate immune cell responses. Since T cells express receptors for bacterial products or components, we examined whether different strains of lactobacilli directly regulate the functions of human T cells. CD 4 (+) T cells were isolated from blood and intestinal lamina propria (LP) of normal individuals and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mononuclear cells were also isolated from Peyer's patches. Cells were activated with anti-CD 3 /CD 2 /CD 28 in {{the presence or absence of}} Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei B 21060, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei F 19, or L. casei subsp. casei DG. Cell proliferation and death, Foxp 3, intracellular pH, and cytokine production were evaluated by flow cytometry. We showed that L. paracasei subsp. paracasei B 21060 but neither L. paracasei subsp. paracasei F 19 nor L. casei subsp. casei DG inhibited blood CD 4 (+) T-cell growth. This effect was associated with no change in cell survival, expression of Foxp 3, or production of gamma interferon, interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), IL- 5, and IL- 10. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei B 21060 -mediated blockade of CD 4 (+) T-cell proliferation required a <b>viable</b> <b>bacterium</b> and was associated with decreased MCT- 1 expression and low intracellular pH. L. paracasei subsp. paracasei B 21060 also inhibited the growth of Peyer's patch mononuclear cells, normal lymphocytes, and IBD CD 4 LP lymphocytes without affecting cytokine production. The data show that L. paracasei subsp. paracasei B 21060 blocks T-cell growth, thus suggesting a mechanism by which these probiotics could interfere with T-cell-driven immune responses...|$|E

40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this study}} was to use {{confocal}} laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to examine the spatial distribution of both <b>viable</b> and non-viable <b>bacteria</b> within microcosm dental plaques grown in vitro. Previous in vivo studies have reported upon the distribution of <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria</b> only. Methods and Results. Oral biofilms were grown on hydroxyapatite (HA) discs in a constant-depth film fermenter (CDFF) from a saliva inoculum. The biofilms were stained with the BacLightTM LIVE/DEAD system and examined by CLSM. Fluorescence intensity profiles through the depth of the biofilm showed an offset between the maximum viable intensity and the maximum non-viable intensity. Topographical differences between the surface properties of the viable and non-viable biofilm virtual surfaces were also measured Conclusions. The profile of fluorescence intensity from viable and non-viable staining suggested that the upper layers of the biofilm contain proportionally more <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria</b> than the lower regions of the biofilm. Significance and Impact of Study. Viability profiling records the transition from predominantly <b>viable</b> to non-viable <b>bacteria</b> through biofilms suggesting that this technique may be of use for quantifying the effects of antimicrobial compounds upon biofilms. The distribution of <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria</b> was similar to that found in dental plaque in vivo suggesting that the CDFF produces in vitro biofilms which are comparable to their in vivo counterparts in terms of the spatial distribution of <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} bacterial detection is {{the identification of}} <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria</b> over debris, specifically post decontamination. Of increasing concern are antibiotic resistant strains that require accurate and rapid post decontamination analysis. Current strategies are fraught with disadvantages {{and most of them}} are not selective for <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria.</b> However, bacteria are critically dependent upon iron sequestration, synthesizing and releasing siderophores (SDPs) to tightly bind iron, with the subsequent uptake of iron bound SDPs. This is a highly conserved process that occurs only in intact bacteria.

METHODS [...] Sputum samples were homogenised with dithiothreitol, sterile saline or glass beads to determine which method recovered {{the greatest number of}} <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Culture broths were also incubated with dithiothreitol and sampled over time to determine its effect on bacterial viability. Sputum samples homogenised with dithiothreitol were diluted in sterile saline and sampled using either standard bacteriological loops or a precision pipette to determine which method resulted in the least variation. RESULTS [...] Homogenisation of sputum using dithiothreitol increased the recovery of <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria</b> compared with sterile glass beads and/or saline, with no apparent effect on bacterial viability when incubated with culture broths. By inoculating agar plates with 10 (- 3), 10 (- 4) and 10 (- 5) dilutions of the homogenised sputum sample, all potential pathogens could easily be identified. A 10 microliter sample volume dispensed by precision pipette and spread with a "hockey stick" resulted in the least variation between plates (less than 16 %) and an even distribution of bacterial colonies.

By comparing mice immunized with either viable or killed L. monocytogenes, {{it was found that}} IFN-gamma was produced at the initial stage only after immunization with <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria.</b> This finding prompted us to investigate the effect of neutralizing the IFN-gamma on the final generation of protective T cells against L. monocytogenes. When endogenous IFN-gamma was neutralized by administration of anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody for the initial 2 days in mice immunized with <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria,</b> the generation of protective T cells on day 6 was completely blocked, as revealed by T-cell adoptive transfer. The generation of listeria-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells was also abolished. These results clearly demonstrated that endogenous IFN-gamma, which is produced at the initial stage of immunization, actually plays a critical role in the generation of protective T cells against L. monocytogenes in vivo. Moreover, this study suggested that the lack of IFN-gamma-inducing ability is responsible for the inability of killed L. monocytogenes to induce protective T cells in mice...|$|R

40|$|The medical device-related {{infections are}} {{frequently}} {{a consequence of}} Staphylococcus biofilm, a lifestyle enhancing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Antibiotic susceptibility tests are usually performed on planktonic forms of clinical isolates. Some methods {{have been developed to}} perform antibiotic susceptibility tests on biofilm. However, none of them counts bacterial inoculum. As antibiotic susceptibility is related to bacterial inoculum, the test results could be mistaken. Here, a new method, BidTimer Assay (BTA), able to count bacteria in biofilm without any manipulation of samples, is presented. Moreover, the BTA method is applied to analyze antibiotic susceptibility of six Staphylococcus strains in biofilm and to deter-mine the number of <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the presence of sub-inhibitory doses of four different antibiotics. To validate BTA, the new method was compared to reference methods both for counting and antibiotic susceptibility tests. A high agreement between BTA and reference methods is found on planktonic forms. Therefore, BTA was employed to count bacteria in biofilm and to analyze biofilm antibiotic susceptibility. Results confirm the high resistance to antibiotics of Staphylococcus biofilm. Moreover, BTA counts the number of <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the presence of sub-inhibitory doses of antibiotics. The results show that the number of <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria</b> depends on sub-inhibitory doses, age of biofilm and type of antibiotic. In particular, differently to gentamicin and ampicillin, sub-inhibitory doses of ofloxacin and azithromycin reduce the number of <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria</b> at lower extent in young than in old biofilm.

In contrast, internalization of heat killed C. jejuni was low at early time points and did not peak until 96 h. These cells were gathered in large spacious vacuoles that were part of the degradative pathway as determined by the uptake of fluorescently labeled dextran. The amount of heat killed bacteria internalized by A. polyphaga did never reach the maximal amount of internalized <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria.</b> These results suggest that the uptake and intracellular survival of C. jejuni in A. polyphaga i...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} qualify the {{germicidal}} efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) disinfection system, we generally determine the reduction of <b>viable</b> <b>bacteria</b> after UV-C irradiation. However, the simple count of <b>viable</b> and cultivable <b>bacteria</b> in usual media cannot reflect {{whether or not the}} UV dose applied to disinfect water is sufficient to inactivate bacteria. Indeed, there is a bacterial mix in the UV-treated water: dead <b>bacteria,</b> <b>viable</b> and cultivable <b>bacteria</b> and <b>viable</b> but noncultivable <b>bacteria</b> (VBNC). The third type of bacteria can constitute a potential risk for public health. In fact, VBNC bacteria can be active and cause diseases. Consequently, the combination of a conventional method used to measure colony-forming ability after UV disinfection and the determination of adsorption constants of a lytic Qβ phage in relation to irradiated host cells by an increased UV dose (Escherichia coli ATCC 13965) allows the detection of active bacteria, which lose their cultivability in usual growth media, but keep the phage susceptibility...|$|R
