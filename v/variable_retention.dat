Among first-year college students with depressive symptoms, controlling for academic performance, do variables reflecting non-academic <b>variables</b> influence <b>retention?</b> Among first-year college students with depressive symptoms, how does the interaction between academic and non-academic <b>variables</b> influence <b>retention?</b> Factor analysis did not yield reduced sets of components for Input and Environmental <b>variables.</b> <b>Retention</b> was analyzed through a series of logistic regressions to theoretical groupings of input and environmental <b>variables.</b> One <b>retention</b> model, Pre-Entry Characteristics + Self Perception + Academic/Social Characteristics + Environment (Involvement) was significant. Students who did not express a self-concern for academic adjustment were 3. 7 times more likely to be retained than students who did express a self-concern for academic adjustment in college. First semester GPA had a positive impact on student retention, illustrated by the fact that for each one-point increase in GPA, students were 3. 2 times more likely to be retained in school. An inverse relationship is noted for exercise, as students who did not appear to exercise at the institution's fitness center were 1. 2 more times likely to be retained than students who exercised at the on-campus fitness center.

Retained forest structure is composed of live and dead trees that enhance structural diversity, and provide a hospitable habitat for variety of living organisms that prevail in the unlogged forest.

We hypothesized {{that the combination of}} modafinil and d-amphetamine, at low doses, would show equivalent or greater benefit in reducing cocaine use compared to higher doses of each individual medication or placebo. Methods: Sixteen week, randomized, parallel-group design with four treatment arms comparing placebo to modafinil 400 mg; d-amphetamine 60 mg; modafinil 200 mg plus d-amphetamine 30 mg. Primary outcome <b>variables,</b> <b>retention</b> and cocaine use, were analyzed on the sample of 73 participants who received the first dose of the study medication. Results: Retention rates did not differ between groups and were generally low, with 40 % remaining in treatment at week 12 and 20 % at week 16. Participants receiving the combination of modafinil and d-amphetamine showed a trend of increased cocaine use over time with a corresponding low Bayesian probability of benefit (33 %). Relatively better cocaine outcomes were observed in the placebo and d-amphetamine only groups.

5000|$|Since trees {{can grow}} larger than other plant life-forms, {{there is the}} {{potential}} {{for a wide variety of}} forest structures (or physiognomies). The infinite number of possible spatial arrangements of trees of varying size and species makes for a highly intricate and diverse micro-environment in which environmental variables such as solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed can vary considerably over large and small distances. In addition, an important proportion of a forest ecosystem's biomass is often underground, where soil structure, water quality and quantity, and levels of various soil nutrients can vary greatly. [...] Thus, forests are often highly heterogeneous environments compared to other terrestrial plant communities. This heterogeneity in turn can enable great biodiversity of species of both plants and animals. Some structures, such as tree ferns may be keystone species for a diverse range of other species [...]A number of factors within the forest affect biodiversity; primary factors enhancing wildlife abundance and biodiversity are the presence of diverse tree species within the forest and the absence of even aged timber management.

The data set contained 7, 198 student records. The independent variables included: High school GPA, cumulative college GPA {{at the end of the}} freshman year, ACT score, gender, ethnicity, and residency status. The dependent <b>variable</b> was <b>retention</b> to sophomore year. Research question 1 used correlation analysis to establish relationships between the independent <b>variables</b> and <b>retention.</b> Point-biserial correlation analysis was performed for the three scale independent variables, ACT score, high school GPA, and cumulative college GPA. Pearson’s chi-square was performed for the 3 nominal independent variables, gender, residency status, and ethnicity. The correlation analysis showed that 5 of the 6 variables had statistical significance with retention. Research question 2 used regression analysis to examine the independent variables’ ability to predict retention to sophomore year. Cumulative college GPA and residency status showed the strongest ability to predict retention to sophomore year. Results from this study may encourage colleges and universities to begin or promote programs designed to assist students with maintaining a favorable GPA, such as study skills sessions or active learning environments.
