40|$|The {{growth of}} {{containerised}} sea transport {{has caused a}} demand for improved efficiency and increased capacity in the transit through seaports {{as well as in}} the transport to and from seaports in the hinterland. To stimulate the development of those seamless intermodal transport chains, the concept of dry ports has been established. The purpose of this paper is to analyse how <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> can support the transformation of a conventional inland terminal into a dry port and how an existing dry port can be further developed through the use of <b>value-added</b> <b>services.</b> This conceptual paper combines literature from the field of dry ports with literature addressing <b>value-added</b> <b>services,</b> with data obtained through interviews with actors in the transport system. The conclusions indicate that the development of dry ports and their viability may depend on different <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> being available at the dry port, however only once the infrastructure and basic services are in place. Furthermore, the availability of <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> may increase the dry port’s attractiveness. This paper provides a platform for further research on the importance of <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> for dry ports’ development...|$|R

Therefore, this paper pursues a comprehensive study identifying the key mobile grid regulations on a European level, while such grid services are considered to be of major importance for upcoming <b>value-added</b> <b>services.</b> The focus is put mainly on those regulatory determinations affecting areas neglected by the eCommunications framework, namely the areas of <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> in mobile grids and of determinations governing relations among service providers and between service consumers and service providers. Thus, the major achievement here outlines the potential for open and unregulated mobile grid applications as well as services markets. Due to the lack of eCommunications determinations— as shown in a previous study [38]—, this new work ensures the careful consideration of fundamental consumer rights and competition efficiency for <b>value-added</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|With the {{globalization}} of industries since the 1980 's, logistics parks have emerged as a solution for the consolidation of operations and logistics services for global companies. In the beginning, logistics parks were limited to enabling companies to centralize their operations using shared warehousing and transportation infrastructures; however, these logistics parks now additionally offer a range of <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> to enhance the supply chain. Most of these logistics parks were developed in the past decade, {{and there is little}} research on these facilities and the <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> they are providing. The impact of these services on the global supply chain is also not well understood. Managers of logistics parks from around the world were interviewed and surveyed about the general infrastructures at their parks, and about the <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> they provide for the companies operating at their facilities. Elements of the physical infrastructure and <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> were grouped and ranked based on their impact on supply chains, and attractiveness to customers. (cont.) The physical location and infrastructure of these facilities represent the most important factors in selecting logistics parks; however, other <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> are gradually gaining importance and attractiveness due to increasing customer requirements and supply chain complexities. To cope with this change, logistics parks must carefully select the <b>value-added</b> <b>services</b> that are the most attractive to their customers, and which have the most positive impact on their supply chains. by Ali El Amrani.

The recommender system is based on an adapted conjoint analysis method combined with a stepwise componential segmentation algorithm to collect preference and willingness-to-pay data for <b>value-added</b> <b>services.</b> Compared to other conjointbase...|$|R
