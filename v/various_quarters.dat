The most notable {{of these were}} Migrin (or Muqrin) and Mi'kal, though the name Hajr continued to appear in local folk poetry. The earliest known reference to the area by the name Riyadh comes from a 17th-century chronicler reporting on an event from the year 1590. In 1737, Deham ibn Dawwas, a refugee from neighboring Manfuha, took control of Riyadh. Ibn Dawwas built a single wall to encircle the <b>various</b> <b>quarters</b> of Riyadh, making them effectively a single town.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to Bosco and {{his work}} came from <b>various</b> <b>quarters.</b> Traditionalist clergy accused him of {{stealing}} the young and old people away from their own parishes. Nationalist politicians (including some clergy) saw his several hundred young men as a recruiting ground for revolution. The Marquis de Cavour, chief of police in Turin, regarded the open-air catechisms as overtly political and {{a threat to the}} State, and was highly suspicious of Bosco's support for the powers of the papacy. Bosco was interrogated on several occasions, but no charges made. Closure may have been prevented by orders from the king that Bosco was not to be disturbed.|$|E
25|$|Although {{most of the}} Jewish {{people during}} this period, {{especially}} the wealthy families, were {{to be found in}} Babylonia, the existence they led there, under the successive rulers of the Achaemenids, the Seleucids, the Parthians, and the Sassanians, was obscure and devoid of political influence. The poorest but most fervent of the exiles returned to Judah / the Land of Israel during the reign of the Achaemenids (c. 550–330 BCE). There, with the reconstructed Temple in Jerusalem as their center, they organized themselves into a community, animated by a remarkable religious ardor and a tenacious attachment to the Torah as the focus of its identity. As this little nucleus increased in numbers with the accession of recruits from <b>various</b> <b>quarters,</b> it awoke to a consciousness of itself, and strove once again for national independence and political enfranchisement and sovereignty.|$|E

25|$|In his 1825 annual {{message to}} Congress, Adams {{presented}} a comprehensive and ambitious agenda. He called for major investments in internal improvements {{as well as}} the creation of a national university, a naval academy, and a national astronomical observatory. Noting the healthy status of the treasury and the possibility for more revenue via land sales, Adams argued for the completion of several projects that were in various stages of construction or planning, including a road from Washington to New Orleans. He proposed the establishment of a Department of the Interior as a new cabinet-level department that would preside over these internal improvements. Adams's programs faced opposition from <b>various</b> <b>quarters.</b> Many disagreed with his broad interpretation of the constitution, and favored stronger state governments {{at the expense of the}} federal government. Others disliked any government interference and were opposed to central planning. Some in the South feared that Adams was secretly an abolitionist and that he sought to suborn the states to the federal government.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{all these}} advantages, Casaubon {{considered}} many schemes for leaving Paris and settling elsewhere. Offers {{came to him}} from <b>various</b> <b>quarters,</b> including Nîmes, Heidelberg and Sedan, France. His friends Lect and Giovanni Diodati wished, rather than hoped, {{to get him back}} to Geneva. In Paris, Casaubon was still uneasy about his religion: the life of a Parisian Huguenot was always insecure, for the police were likely not strong enough to protect them against a sudden mob uprising. Since the Fontainebleau Conference, an impression prevailed that Casaubon was wavering. The Catholics told him he could gain a professorship only if he renounced Protestantism. When it became clear that Casaubon could not be bought, Henry IV, who liked Casaubon personally, took it upon himself to try to convert him. (Henry himself had converted to Catholicism in order to rule France.) The king's cardinal Duperron, in his capacity of aumonier, argued with Casaubon in the king's library. On the other hand, the Huguenot theologians, especially Pierre du Moulin, chief pastor of the church of Paris, accused Casaubon of conceding too much, and of having departed already from the lines of strict Calvinistic orthodoxy.|$|E
