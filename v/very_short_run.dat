25|$|Rorke, who is {{six feet}} four inches, has a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>run</b> which {{produces}} tremendous pace, and is another bowler whose action {{is subject to}} criticism. His delivery, to say the most, was unusual, and it was {{amazing to me that}} a bowler could generate so much pace from such a short run...he lands some four feet beyond the batting crease at the moment of delivery, with a tremendous drag, and it means he delivers the ball from some nineteen yards.|$|E

Neidhart left the WWF shortly afterward, and Hart {{set out on}} a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>run</b> as a singles wrestler, including a match at WrestleMania VIII against Skinner. Shortly after WrestleMania, Hart was teamed up with Koko B. Ware to form the duo known as High Energy. They had only one pay-per-view match as a team, at the Survivor Series where they lost to The Headshrinkers. The team was quietly dropped at the start of 1993 with Hart starting a singles career.|$|E
25|$|Some smoking {{restrictions}} {{were introduced in}} German hotels, restaurants, and bars in 2008 and early 2009. The restaurant industry has claimed that some businesses in the states which restricted smoking in late 2007 (Lower Saxony, Baden-Württemberg, and Hessen) experienced reduced profits. The German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA) claimed that the smoking ban deterred people from {{going out for a}} drink or meal, stating that 15% of establishments that adopted a ban in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50%. However, a study by the University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) finds negative impacts on revenues, if any, only in the <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>run.</b> In the medium and long run, a recovery of revenues took place. These results suggest either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, that negative revenue impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers. Smoking is not permitted in any public transit or in or around railway stations except for the locations expressly indicated for smoking. Smoking on trains was banned completely by the Deutsche Bahn AG in 2007. Smoking has been restricted in airports and all Lufthansa planes since the late 1990s.|$|E

This was no easy task in the Restoration theatre; the limited pool of audience members meant that <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>runs</b> were the norm for plays and fifty different productions might be mounted in the nine-month season lasting from September to June.

2500|$|James Lawrence was {{the star}} of the game for Michigan. In his first game after Fielding Yost moved him to the fullback position, Lawrence scored four touchdowns and kicked nine goals after touchdown, {{accounting}} for 29 of Michigan's 60 points. The Michigan Alumnus wrote that Lawrence [...] "was called upon repeatedly to take the ball and would always advance it eight or ten yards" [...] with big holes being opened by guards Carter and McGugin. [...] Michigan's [...] "most spectacular play" [...] of the game was a 75-yard touchdown run by Maddock. The Alumnus gave particular praise to the defense: [...] "Only once was Indiana able to make an impression on her impregnable wall and that on a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>run</b> by Clevenger." ...|$|E
2500|$|Collisions {{were also}} too common, when steamboats {{continued}} {{to operate in}} fog or night, without radar or other modern navigation aids, and often caused greater loss of life than fire. [...] Unlike fire, which often could be fought until the vessel reached a beach where passengers and crew could evacuate, collisions came suddenly. [...] Where [...] a substantial difference existed between the size or construction of the vessels, such as steel against wooden hull, destruction could be quick. [...] Thus, {{on the night of}} November 18, 1906, the small, lightly built passenger steamer Dix (130 tons), designed specifically for the <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>run</b> across Elliott Bay from Seattle to Alki Point, collided with the much larger steam schooner [...] [...] The night was clear, and the collision seems to have been caused by an error of the Dixs unlicensed mate, who had the wheel while the captain, consistent with the practice of the day, collected the fares. [...] Though the collision speed was small, Dix was lightly built and top-heavy; she quickly heeled over, filled with water, and sank in 103 fathoms, taking 45 people down with her, including her mate. [...] The wreck was so deep that no bodies could be recovered. [...] Similarly, but less tragically, the wooden sternwheeler Multnomah was rammed (also in Elliott Bay, scene of much marine traffic) by the much larger, steel-hulled, express passenger Iroquois on October 28, 1911, sinking Multnomah in 240 feet of water; fortunately with no one reported killed.|$|E

50|$|Instead of {{starting}} with <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>runs,</b> usually a hybrid algorithm is used, where the initial pass will read many records into memory, do an internal sort {{to create a}} long run, and then distribute those long runs onto the output set. The step avoids many early passes. For example, an internal sort of 1024 records will save 9 passes. The internal sort is often large because it has such a benefit. In fact, there are techniques that can make the initial runs longer than the available internal memory.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Because of the {{emergence}} of e-commerce and developments in print engines designed for economical output of <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>runs,</b> there are increased business opportunities and consumer options for print-on-demand books and photobooks. The current state of these printing modes allows for direct uploading of book files via the web, printing on nonoffset printers, and distributing by standard parcel or mail delivery services. The goal of this research is to assess the image quality of print-on-demand books and photobooks produced by various Web-based vendors and to identify correlations between psychophysical results and objective metrics. Six vendors were identified for one-off (single-copy) print-on-demand books, and seven vendors were identified for photobooks. Participants rank ordered overall quality of a subset of individual pages from each book, where the pages included text, photographs, or a combination of the two. Observers also reported overall quality ratings and price estimate...|$|R
40|$|Unpredictability in {{the running}} time of {{complete}} search procedures can often {{be explained by the}} phenomenon of "heavy-tailed cost distributions", meaning that {{at any time during the}} experiment there is a non-negligible probability of hitting a problem that requires exponentially more time to solve than any that has been encountered before (Gomes et al. 1998 a). We present a general method for introducing controlled randomization into complete search algorithms. The "boosted" search methods provably eliminate heavy-tails to the right of the median. Furthermore, they can take advantage of heavy-tails to the left of the median (that is, a nonnegligible chance of <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>runs)</b> to dramatically shorten the solution time.
