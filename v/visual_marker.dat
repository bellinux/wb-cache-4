500|$|The Bridgeport Harbor Light, {{later the}} Bridgeport Harbor Lighthouse, was a {{lighthouse}} in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States. It {{is located on}} the west side of the Bridgeport Harbor entrance and the north side of Long Island Sound. Originally constructed in 1851 and rebuilt in 1871 with a dwelling, it had a red-fixed light throughout its service life. The builder and first keeper of the light was Abraham A. McNeil who is also credited as improvising the first light for the Bridgeport Harbor in 1844. By 1953, the lighthouse was in poor condition and the United States Coast Guard opted to build a skeleton tower in its place. In the 2014 edition of the Light List Volume 1, the skeleton tower is marked as [...] "Light 13A" [...] with a height of [...] and a <b>visual</b> <b>marker</b> of a square green dayboard with a green reflective border. The lighthouse was sold and an attempt was made to move it to serve as a monument for Connecticut's maritime history, but it was later decided to scrap the structure. The lighthouse caught fire and was destroyed during the dismantling in 1953.|$|E

The algorithm uses an adaptive thresholding technique {{to produce a}} binary image with an accurate representation of each <b>visual</b> code <b>marker</b> from an input RGB image. <b>Visual</b> code <b>marker</b> detection is performed on the binary image using {{a series of tests}} that leverage prior knowledge of the distinctive features of a <b>visual</b> code <b>marker,</b> namely, the long and short guide bars and three cornerstones. Embedded data bits are subsequently extracted using a projective transformation matrix that maps the code plane to the image plane and prior knowledge of the data area in the code plane. The algorithm is able to detect <b>visual</b> code <b>markers</b> in an image, correctly identify the origin coordinates, and accurately extract the data in each <b>visual</b> code <b>marker</b> under challenging imaging conditions.

40|$|We report {{results from}} an {{experiment}} on ranking <b>visual</b> <b>markers</b> and node positioning techniques for network visualizations. Inspired by prior ranking studies, we rethink the ranking when the dataset size increases {{and when the}} markers are distributed in space. Centrality indices are visualized as node attributes. Our experiment studies nine <b>visual</b> <b>markers</b> and three positioning methods. Our results suggest that direct encoding of quantities improves accuracy by about 20 % compared to previous results. Of the three positioning techniques, circular {{was always in the}} top group, and matrix and projection switch orders depending on two factors: whether or not the tasks demand symmetry, or the nodes are within closely proximity. Among the most interesting results of ranking the <b>visual</b> <b>markers</b> for comparison tasks are that hue and area fall into the top groups for nearly all multi-scale comparison tasks; Shape (ordered by curvature) is perhaps not as scalable as we have thought and can support more accurate answers only when two quantities are compared; Lightness and slope are least accurate for quantitative comparisons regardless of scale of the comparison tasks. Our experiment is among the first to acquire a complete picture of ranking <b>visual</b> <b>markers</b> in different scales for comparison tasks...|$|R

50|$|During the 1940s {{there was}} a large black {{coloured}} hangar at the site of Karachi Airport, constructed for the British R101 Airship. Only three hangars were ever built in the world to dock and hangar the R101 airships. However, the R101 airship never arrived in Karachi (then part of the British Raj) as it crashed early in its journey in France. This hangar was so huge that aircraft often used it as a <b>visual</b> <b>marker</b> while attempting VFR landings at Karachi.

40|$|Current {{definitions}} of prosody present {{a problem for}} signed languages since {{they are based on}} languages that exist in the oral-aural modality. Despite this, researchers have illustrated that although signed languages are produced in a different modality, a prosodic system exists whereby a signed stream can be structured into prosodic constituents and are marked by systematic manual and non-manual phenomena (see Nespor & Sandler, 1999; Wilbur, 1999, 2000). However, there is little research examining prosody in British Sign Language (BSL). This thesis represents the first serious attempt to address this gap in the literature by investigating the type and frequency of a number of <b>visual</b> <b>markers</b> at intonational phrase (IP) boundaries in BSL narratives. An analysis of 418 IP boundaries shows linguistic <b>visual</b> <b>markers</b> are not frequently observed. The most frequent marker observed were single head movements (46 %) followed by holds (30 %) and brow movement (22 %) and head nods (21 %). This finding suggests that none of the <b>visual</b> <b>markers</b> included in this study can be considered a consistent marker to IP boundaries in BSL narratives. As well as examining the production of markers at IP boundaries, the perception of boundaries by different groups in a series of online segmentation experiments is investigated. Results from both experiments indicate that boundaries can be identified in a reliable way even when watching an unknown signed language. In addition, an analysis of responses suggests that participants identified a boundary corresponding to a discourse level (such as when a new theme is established). The results suggest that <b>visual</b> <b>markers</b> (to these boundaries at least) are informative in the absence of cues that can only be perceived by native users of a language (such as cues deriving from lexical and grammatical information). Following presentation of results, directions for future research in this area are suggested. ...|$|R
50|$|Concerned {{about the}} high cost of the most {{complete}} commercial solutions, Pamplona et al. propose a new input device: an image-based data glove (IBDG). By attaching a camera to the hand of the user and a <b>visual</b> <b>marker</b> to each finger tip, they use computer vision techniques to estimate the relative position of the finger tips. Once they have information about the tips, they apply inverse kinematics techniques in order to estimate the position of each finger joint and recreate the movements of the fingers of the user in a virtual world. Adding a motion tracker device, one can also map pitch, yaw, roll and XYZ-translations of the hand of the user, (almost) recreating all the gesture and posture performed by the hand of the user in a low cost device.|$|E
50|$|The {{points on}} a compass rose were {{frequently}} labeled by the initial {{letters of the}} mariner's principal winds (T, G, L, S, O, L, P, M). However, from the outset, the custom also began to distinguish the north from the other points by a specific <b>visual</b> <b>marker.</b> Medieval Italian cartographers typically used a simple arrowhead or circumflex-hatted T (an allusion to the compass needle) to designate the north, while the Majorcan cartographic school typically used a stylized Pole Star for its north mark. The use of the fleur-de-lis as north mark was introduced by Pedro Reinel, and quickly became customary in compass roses (and is still often used today). Old compass roses also often used a Christian cross at Levante (E), indicating the direction of Jerusalem {{from the point of}} view of the Mediterranean sea.|$|E
5000|$|Both in the {{laboratory}} and in the clinic {{it is useful to}} have a simple means of identifying cells infected by the experimental virus. This can be done by equipping the virus with 'reporter genes' not normally present in viral genomes, which encode easily identifiable protein markers. One example of such proteins is GFP (Green fluorescent protein) which, when present in infected cells, will cause a fluorescent green light to be emitted when stimulated by blue light. [...] An advantage of this method is that it can be used on live cells and in patients with superficial infected lesions, it enables rapid non-invasive confirmation of viral infection. Another example of a <b>visual</b> <b>marker</b> useful in living cells is luciferase, an enzyme from the firefly which in the presence of luciferin, emits light detectable by specialized cameras.|$|E
