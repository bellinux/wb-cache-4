40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to clarify the effect of {{temperature}} on the tactile response of building materials. The tactile (warmth, hardness, roughness, dryness, comfort) values of sixty materials were experimentally determined at the temperature of 10, 20 and 30 ℃. Within the room temperature of 10 ℃ to 30 ℃, psychological values of hardness, roughness and dryness are constant. Warmth values can be obtamned by the following equation. W_T=W_ + 0. 030 (T- 20) Where WT is tactile warmth <b>value</b> <b>at</b> T℃, W_ is tactile warmth <b>value</b> <b>at</b> 20 ℃, and T is the room temperature ℃.

40|$|The <b>Value</b> <b>at</b> Risk of a {{portfolio}} {{differs from the}} sum of the <b>Values</b> <b>at</b> Risk of the portfolio's components. In this paper, we analyze the problem of how a single economic risk figure for the <b>Value</b> <b>at</b> Risk of a hypothetical portfolio composed of different commercial banks might be obtained for a supervisor. Using the daily profits and losses and the daily <b>Value</b> <b>at</b> Risk figures of twelve German banks for the period from 2001 to 2003, we estimate the <b>Value</b> <b>at</b> Risk of the entire portfolio. We assume a reduced-form model and neglect the effects of a potential bankruptcy of one of the banks. We analyze different models for the cross-correlation of the banks? profits and losses. In an empirical study, we apply backtesting methods to determine which aggregation model leads to the best out-of-sample estimates for the portfolio's economic risk figure. Our main findings can be summarized in three statements. (i) The portfolio's <b>Value</b> <b>at</b> Risk can be estimated from time series data very well. (ii) During "normal" times, the portfolio's <b>Value</b> <b>at</b> Risk is much lower than {{the sum of the}} single <b>Values</b> <b>at</b> Risk. (iii) The relative marginal risk contribution depends on the bank in question and is between 0. 05 and 0. 62.

40|$|As we know, {{there is}} {{a belief in the}} finance {{literature}} that <b>Value</b> <b>at</b> Risk (VaR) and Conditional <b>Value</b> <b>at</b> Risk (CVaR) are new approaches to manage and control the risk. Regard to, <b>value</b> <b>at</b> risk is not a coherent risk measure and it is not sub-additive and convex, so, we have considered conditional <b>value</b> <b>at</b> risk as a risk measure by different confidence level in the Mean-CVaR and multi objective proportional change Mean-CVaR models and compared these models with our previous mean-VaR models. This paper focuses on the performance evaluation process and portfolios selection by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Conventional DEA models assume non-negative values for inputs and outputs, but many of data take the negative value. Therefore, we have used our models based on Range Directional Measure (RDM) that can take positive and negative <b>values.</b> Here <b>value</b> <b>at</b> risk is obtained by non-parametric methods such as historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation.
