40|$|Determination {{of fetal}} left {{ventricular}} (LV) volume in two-dimensional echocardiography (2 DE) is significantly important for quantitative analysis of fetal cardiac function. A backpropagation (BP) neural network method is proposed to predict LV volume more accurately and effectively. The 2 DE LV border and volume are considered as the {{input and output}} of BP neural network correspondingly. To unify and simplify the input of the BP neural network, 16 distances calculated from the border to its center with equal angle are used instead of the border. Fifty cases (forty frames for each) were used for this study. Half of them selected randomly are used for training, {{and the others are}} used for testing. To illustrate the performance of BP neural network, area-length method, Simpson’s method, and multivariate nonlinear regression equation method were compared by comparisons with the <b>volume</b> <b>references</b> in concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots. The ICC and CCC for BP neural network with the <b>volume</b> <b>references</b> were the highest. For Bland-Altman plots, the BP neural network also shows the highest agreement and reliability with <b>volume</b> <b>references.</b> With the accurate LV volume, LV function parameters (stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (EF)) are calculated accurately...|$|R

40|$|Judgements {{of volume}} may {{influence}} the rate of consumption of alcohol and, in turn, the amount consumed. The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the impact of the size and shape of wine glasses on perceptions of wine volume. Online experiment: Participants (n = 360; recruited via Mechanical Turk) were asked to match the volume of wine in two wine glasses, specifically: 1. the Reference glass holding a fixed <b>reference</b> <b>volume,</b> and 2. the Comparison glass, for which the volume could be altered until participants perceived it matched the <b>reference</b> <b>volume.</b> One of three comparison glasses was shown in each trial: 'wider' (20 % wider but same capacity); 'larger' (same width but 25 % greater capacity); or 'wider-and-larger' (20 % wider and 25 % greater capacity). <b>Reference</b> <b>volumes</b> were 125 ml, 175 ml and 250 ml, in a fully factorial within-subjects design: 3 (comparison glass) x 3 (<b>reference</b> <b>volume).</b> Non-zero differences between the volumes with which participants filled comparison glasses and the corresponding <b>reference</b> <b>volumes</b> were identified using sign-rank tests. Participants under-filled the wider glass relative to the reference glass for larger <b>reference</b> <b>volumes,</b> and over-filled the larger glass relative to the reference glass for all <b>reference</b> <b>volumes.</b> Results for the wider-and-larger glass showed a mixed pattern across <b>reference</b> <b>volume.</b> For all comparison glasses, in trials with larger <b>reference</b> <b>volumes</b> participants tended to fill the comparison glass less, relative to trials with smaller <b>reference</b> <b>volumes</b> for the same comparison glass. These results are broadly consistent with people using the relative fullness of glasses to judge volume, and suggest both the shape and capacity of wine glasses may influence perceived volume. Perceptions that smaller glasses contain more than larger ones (despite containing the same volume), could slow drinking speed and overall consumption by serving standard portions in smaller glasses. This hypothesis awaits testing...|$|R

5000|$|In 2010, the Museum and the Austrian Verein Gedenkdienst {{joined forces}} to launch the Lithuanian Holocaust Atlas project.

Dr. Arūnas Bubnys served as the project's historian.Whilst this is a vitally important endeavor, it was recently revealed that elements within the Museum published inaccurate accounts of the Lithuanian Holocaust in a seemingly deliberate attempt to cover-up {{the role of the}} Lithuanians themselves in the massacre of the Jews. One example was an informatory text on the date 1941-06-23, claiming that [...] "the first killings of Jews have been performed {{in the context of the}} war chaos, the anti-Soviet rebelion sic the withdraw sic of the Red Army and rapid attack of the German army". The justification and rationalization of the murder of Jews by nationalistic Lithuanians alongside the Nazis is just one example of how elements within the educational framework regarding the Holocaust in Lithuania are tainted by that government's refusal to acknowledge the cruel and pivotal involvement of Lithuanians in the Holocaust and its refusal to bring war-time Lithuanian murderers of Jews to justice.|$|E

5000|$|... "Lasts" [...] only {{became an}} area of study once the area of [...] "firsts" [...] (generally {{referred}} to as [...] "Famous Firsts") was well established for decades. Today {{there are dozens of}} books that have been published about specific areas using the now established term, [...] "famous first..." [...] "Famous Firsts" [...] are often heralded as news stories and may be documented with patents and even with celebrations. [...] "Firsts" [...] have been recorded {{for a long time and}} are a widely documented area of study, most particularly in the core library reference work Famous First Facts by Joseph Nathan Kane, first published by H. W. Wilson Company in 1933. Kane was the first to provide a comprehensive collation of [...] "famous firsts." [...] To this day, with each subsequent edition released (now in its 5th edition), [...] "Kane's" [...] remains H.W. Wilson's largest-selling single <b>volume</b> <b>reference</b> work. Many of Kane's entries are actually rather obscure, so the term [...] "famous first" [...] can be misleading; they are more accurately termed [...] "notable;" [...] hence the term [...] "notable last" [...] was chosen for the study of lasts, rather than [...] "famous lasts." [...] The term [...] "famous last" [...] could have not only a similarly misleading connotation, but also be potentially confused with the cautionary words of advice, [...] "famous last words", often uttered sarcastically when an undertaking or prediction is made. Recognition of [...] "firsts" [...] has received more attention given the importance our society places on innovation, ingenuity and discovery. Thus, [...] "firsts" [...] are easier to research and authenticate. A [...] "last", on the other hand, frequently is difficult to track down, as there is not an analogous historical record. A few small trivia books have compiled a limited number of [...] "lasts" [...] (particularly two small British works by Christopher Slee and a generalized work by trivia compiler Charles Panati). These are works that include general [...] "lasts," [...] not only [...] "notable lasts" [...] as defined in the first substantial work on [...] "notable lasts" [...] called Notable Last Facts published by Reference Desk Press, Inc. by William B.
