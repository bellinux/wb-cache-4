5000|$|The volume (expressed in {{cubic feet}} per minute or cubic meters per second) of air {{required}} to ventilate an underground mine is determined by mining engineers based {{on a wide variety}} of parameters. In most countries minimum requirements are outlined by law, regulation or standards. However, in some developing countries the mandated ventilation requirement may be insufficient, and the mining company may have to increase the ventilation flow, in particular where ventilation may be required to cool the ambient temperature in a deep hot mine, however auto-compression must also be taken into account. as per CMR 130-2-(i) in every ventilating district, not less than six cubic metres per minute of air per personemployed in the district on the largest shift or not less than 2.5 cubic metres per minute of air per daily tonne output whichever is larger, passes along the last <b>ventilation</b> <b>connection</b> in the district which means the inbye-most gallery in the district along which the air passes; ...|$|E

You’ll find energy-smart appliance choices in almost all price ranges. Before heading to the local appliance retailer or “big-box” store, measure the space the new appliance will occupy to make sure it will fit—and that there’s enough room to fully open the door (or lid), as well as adequate clearances for <b>ventilation,</b> plumbing <b>connections</b> and other hookups.

40|$|This {{amendment}} to Appendix B contains the specific ALARA evaluations for installing flex-pipe on riser spools to accommodate <b>ventilation</b> duct <b>connections</b> {{to the north}} risers of each tank. The work will be a routine task {{that is part of}} the Equipment Installation and Mobilization phase of the project. The dose rates were estimated using the recent Radiological Surveillance Section radiological survey: SAAS- 97 - 063 S. Task B- 6 has been added to the OHF Project ALARA review process to address a field decision to modify an approach to installing the tank ventilation system. The revised approach will incorporate 12 -in. diameter, 36 -in. long, stainless steel flex-pipe connected to each north riser spool to address the problem of pipe fitting multiple bends and turns expected with the 12 -in. PVC duct. This improved approach will reduce the time necessary to install the duct system between the tanks and the ventilation skid. However, the task includes opening the 12 -in. riser spool connections to replace the currently installed blind gaskets. Since a riser spool for each tank will be opened, there is a potential for significant personnel exposure and spread of contamination that will addressed through this ALARA review process...|$|R

As of 2006 all public educational facilities in confrontation areas are ordered to be built bomb proof (can sustain a direct hit from a katusha missile) and must have an option {{to be connected to}} chemical and biological purifying systems, with an exception for kindergartens and special care education systems that must have a central air purifying system. All medical or treatment facilities must have a shelter that can be gas proof (can be sealed in a form that the only source of air would be via the purifying <b>ventilation</b> systems) with <b>connection</b> to purifying systems. All long term treatments facilities must be built as a bomb shelter and must be built to sustain 4 hours of isolation.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiac output (CO) {{measurement}} {{is often}} required in critically ill patients. The performances of newer, less invasive techniques require evaluation {{in patients with}} severe sepsis and septic shock. OBJECTIVES: To compare calibrated arterial pressure waveform analysis-derived CO (COap, VolumeView/EV 1000) and the uncalibrated form (COfv, FloTrac/Vigileo) with transpulmonary thermodilution derived CO (COtptd). DESIGN: A prospective, observational, single-centre study. SETTING: ICU of a general teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty consecutive patients with severe sepsis or septic shock requiring haemodynamic monitoring by VolumeView/EV 1000 and receiving mechanical <b>ventilation.</b> INTERVENTION: <b>Connection</b> of FloTrac/Vigileo to radial artery catheter already in situ. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radial (COfv) and femoral (COap) arterial waveform-derived CO measurements were compared with COtptd with respect to bias, precision, limits of agreement and percentage error, and the percentage error {{in the course of}} time since the last calibration of COap by COtptd. RESULTS: In comparing COap with COtptd (n = 267 paired measurements), the bias was 0. 02 and limits of agreement were - 2. 49 to 2. 52 l min, with a percentage error of 31 %. The percentage error between COap and COtptd remained less than 30 % until 8 h after calibration. In comparing COfv with COtptd (n = 301), the bias was - 0. 86 l min and limits of agreement were - 4. 48 to 2. 77 l min, with a percentage error of 48 %. The biases of COap and COfv correlated with systemic vascular resistance [r = 0. 13 (P = 0. 029) and r = 0. 42 (P < 0. 001), respectively]. Clinically significant changes in COap and COfv correlated positively with COtptd at r = 0. 51 (P < 0. 001) and r = 0. 64 (P < 0. 001), respectively. CONCLUSION: There was moderate agreement when measuring CO with either arterial waveform analysis technique. Compared with the uncalibrated COfv, the recently introduced calibrated arterial pressure waveform analysis-derived COap was more accurate and less dependent on vascular tone for up to 8 hours after callibation when monitoring CO in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The COap and COfv methods have poor to moderate CO-tracking abilities...|$|R
40|$|Background: low {{air quality}} and {{airborne}} particles in hospital wards, particularly in operating rooms {{can have a}} negative impact on the health of patients and staff. Purpose: This study was conducted aimed to investigate the relationship between indoor air quality and performance of ventilation systems in operating rooms in Qazvin. Method: This study is a cross-sectional study conducted from January to March 2015 in operating rooms of Kosar hospital, Qazvin. In this study, samples of particles (PM 2 / 5 and PM 10) were measured using microdust-pro device, environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide using Indoor Air Quality Meter, and ventilation system performance by hot wire anemometer (KIMO VT- 100) and pressure gauge (Air Flow-APM 50 K) in operating rooms of Kosar hospital, Qazvin. Results: The highest concentration of PM 2 / 5 and PM 10 reported in the pre-operative conditions was related to the outside (0. 46 mg per cubic meter) and the highest average concentrations during and after surgery in the operating room 2 (0. 57 mg per cubic meter) that were more than the WHO and EPA standards. Pearson test showed no significant correlation between the air quality inside and outside. Conclusion: The results indicate poor <b>ventilation</b> and no <b>connection</b> of the air inside the wards with air outside hospital. The most important resources of indoor and environmental pollution in this study can be attributed to the lack of air conditioning systems, high traffic of personnel, types of surgery, and the proximity of the hospital to one of the main streets of the city, and measures should be taken to reduce particulate matter and control air quality in operating rooms of Kosar hospital, Qazvin...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{assessment}} of an ultrasonic flowmeter {{for use in}} ventilated infants P. Scalfaro*, J. Cotting**, P. D. Sly* In vitro {{assessment of}} an ultrasonic flowmeter for use in ventilated infants. P. Scalfaro, J. Cotting, P. D. Sly. #ERS Journals Ltd 2000. ABSTRACT: An ultrasonic flowmeter could be advantageous over a differential pressure pneumotachograph having a constant error in varying conditions. The in vitro accuracy of ultrasonic tidal volume (VT) estimates for ventilated infants were evaluated. Flow linearity and frequency response were tested, as was the influence of humidity and oxygen content on the accuracy of VT estimates. The linearity was within the 5 % limits between- 350 and 350 mL. sec- 1 and was not affected {{by the presence of}} an endotracheal tube (ET). The frequency response was flat and unaffected by an ET up to 4. 5 Hz. The VT in the range 7 – 100 mL, in air showed a mean error of 0. 1 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 2 – 0. 4 %) with a maximum and minimum of 6. 5 and- 3. 5 % respectively. Humidity did not affect accuracy. After calibration in air, the maximal mean error for measurements in pure oxygen was 3. 0 % (95 % CI 1. 9 – 4. 1 %). Repeated measurements over 5. 5 h had a mean error of 0. 4 % (95 % CI- 0. 7 – 0. 1 %). The in vitro evaluation of an ultrasonic flowmeter showed stable accuracy in mechanical <b>ventilation</b> conditions. Changing <b>connection</b> geometry and oxygen content did not increase the error to a clinically relevant degree. The flowmeter could therefore be a better alternative than the pneumotachograph for ventilated infants...|$|R
