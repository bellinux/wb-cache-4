60|$|Now though Peter didn't know it, {{he was in}} the <b>very</b> worst <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> mischief. <b>You</b> see, when he {{took off}} all the bark {{all the way around the}} young peach tree he killed the tree, for you know it is on the inside of the bark that the sap which gives life to a tree and makes it grow goes up from the roots to all the branches. So when Peter ate the bark all the way around the trunk of the young tree, he had made it {{impossible}} for the sap to come up in the spring. Oh, it was the worst <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> mischief that Peter Rabbit was in.|$|R
5000|$|The soundtrack to {{the film}} {{features}} three songs composed by Bijibal, two romantic melodies and a folk song, and a song written by Malayalee rock band Avial, [...] "Aanakkallan". It is the band's first release since their self-titled debut album released in 2008. Avial singer Tony John says that [...] "this song {{is more or less}} like a teaser for our second album". A music video was filmed which shows in the film at the end. John said: [...] "We had loads of fun shooting the video, which is <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> like what <b>you</b> would see in a music video rather than a filmy number". The video, directed by Aashiq Abu, is the second one for Avial after their first hit [...] "Nada Nada". It is also the first Avial track with John as the lead singer and Benjamin Isaac as the bass player.|$|R

R. # 1, San Benito, Texas Personal - Please Forward (PERMANENT MAIL ADDRESS) San Antonio, Texas July 17, 1943 Greetings to all- Today I {{received}} {{your letter}} of May 30, 1943, postmarked July 9, 1943, which {{was sent to}} my home address as per my instructions of the past, and was forwarded by my folks. It was <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> and thoughtful <b>of</b> <b>you</b> all to write the school news to me, and I want you all to know that I and other Bryant graduates appreciate, very very much, {{what you are doing}} for us in the way of letters, cigarettes, etc. It helps a great deal, believe me! In your letter, you mentioned that you had sent a package on May 28, 1943, and that I had not acknowledged receipt of same. I received the two flat fifties of Camel’s [sic] and immediately mailed you a short note to thank you all, but apparently it was not received. It did not return to my permanent mail address in San Benito, Texas, so I assumed you received it. Anyhow, many thanks again to each <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> Please keep my permanent mailing address, as given above, as my address on your records. Thanks! Most sincerely, W. E.

60|$|Afterward {{he came to}} have a bolder spirit about it, and he went {{hunting with}} it a good deal. It was a <b>very</b> curious <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> gun; <b>you</b> had to snap a good many caps on it, {{sometimes}}, before the load would go off; and sometimes it would hang fire, and then seem to recollect itself, and go off, maybe, just when {{you were going to}} take it down from your shoulder. The barrel was so crooked that it could not shoot straight, but this was not the only reason why the boy never hit anything with it. He could not shut his left eye and keep his right eye open; so he had to take aim with both eyes, or else with the left eye, which was worse yet, till one day when he was playing shinny (or hockey) at school, and got a blow over his left eye from a shinny-stick. At first he thought his eye was put out; he could not see for the blood that poured into it from the cut above it. He ran homeward wild with fear, but on the way he stopped at a pump to wash away the blood, and then he found his eye was safe. It suddenly came into his mind to try if he could not shut that eye now, and keep the right one open. He found that he could do it perfectly; by help of his handkerchief, he stanched his wound, and made himself presentable, with the glassy pool before the pump for a mirror, and went joyfully back to school. He kept trying his left eye, to make sure it had not lost its new-found art, and as soon as school was out he hurried home to share the joyful news with his family.|$|R
40|$|Disjunctivism about perceptual appearances, as I {{conceive}} of it, {{is a theory}} which seeks to preserve a naïve realist conception of veridical perception {{in the light of}} the challenge from the argument from hallucination. The naïve realist claims that some sensory experiences are relations to mind-independent objects. That is to say, taking experiences to be episodes or events, the naïve realist supposes that some such episodes have as constituents mind-independent objects. In turn, the disjunctivist claims that in a case of veridical perception like this <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> experience that <b>you</b> now have, the experiential episode <b>you</b> enjoy is <b>of</b> a <b>kind</b> which could not be occurring were you having an hallucination. The common strategy of arguments from hallucination set out to show that certain things are true of hallucinations, and hence must be true of perceptions. For example, it is argued that hallucinations must have non-physical objects of awareness, or that such states are not relations to anything at all, but are at best seeming relations to objects. In insisting that veridical perceptual experience is <b>of</b> a distinct <b>kind</b> from hallucination, the disjunctivist denies that any of these conceptions of hallucination challenges our conception of veridical perceptions as relations to mind-independent objects. More specifically, I assume that the disjunctivist advocates naïve realism because they think that this position best articulates how sensory experience seems to us to be just through reflection. If the disjunctivist is correct in this contention, then anyone who accepts the conclusion of the argument from hallucination must also accept that the nature of sensory experience is other than it seems to us to be. In turn, one may complain that any such error theory is liable to lead to sceptical consequences. A Humean scepticism about the senses launches a challenge about our knowledge of the world through questioning the conception we have of what sense experience is, and how it can provide knowledge of the world. If the conception one has of how one knows something is falsified, then one’s claim to that knowledge can seem to be undermined. We seem to be cut off from the world through lacking the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> contact with it that we supposed ourselves to have. Note that this sceptical problem is not the same as the more familiar scepticism with regard to the external world associated wit...|$|R
