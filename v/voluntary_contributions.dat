40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of leading by example in <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution</b> experiments. Leadership is {{implemented}} by letting one group member contribute to the public good before followers do. Such leadership increases contributions in comparison to the standard <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution</b> mechanism, especially so when it goes along with authority in the form of granting the leader exclusion power. Whether leadership is fixed or rotating among group members has no significant influence on contributions. Only a minority of groups succeeds in endogenously installing a leader, even though groups with leaders are much more efficient than groups without a leader. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>contribution</b> experiment, leadership, exclusion power, endogenous selection...|$|R

5|$|Once the {{revolution}} concluded following the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949, Soeman was recalled to Pekanbaru {{and made the}} head of the regional branch of the Department of Education and Culture. His main task was reestablishing and reinvigorating the education system in Riau following three years of the Japanese occupation and four years of revolution. Desks had been used for firewood, school buildings had been razed to prevent enemy forces from using them, and much of the population had been unable to attend regular classes. Furthermore, the department did not have sufficient funding to support reconstruction. Over the next three years Soeman led communal work projects dedicated to restoring Riau's education facilities, relying on <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions</b> from the populace.|$|E

5|$|In London, {{there was}} a great massing of the poor, and the Reformation {{threatened}} to eliminate some of the infrastructure used to provide for the poor. As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions,</b> so it instituted the first definite compulsory Poor Rate in 1547 which replaced Sunday collections in Church with a mandatory collection for the poor. In 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of poor who could work, but yet could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King’s Palace at Bridewell where poor could receive shelter and work at cap-making, feather-bed making, and wire drawing.|$|E
5|$|This {{practice}} was replaced in 1900 by {{a far more}} complex system of assessments and donations designed {{to raise the money}} to support strikes. This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical. The 1901 system required every local union and the central committee to create strike funds. Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances, and the central Business Committee's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the average wage of their members. This system, too, proved problematic because it penalized the larger, wealthier unions— especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also higher costs of living. From 1901 to 1903, many small organizations joined the federation, yet the FVdG's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove some larger unions out. In 1903, the federation not only changed its name to the Free Association of German Trade Unions but also decided to return to the old system of <b>voluntary</b> <b>contributions.</b> This system remained in place until 1914. The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed as much as they could. Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike. Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement, but local organizations still had far more autonomy than their counterparts in other German labor federations.|$|E

40|$|Utility-based green {{electricity}} programs provide {{market opportunities}} {{for consumers to}} reduce the carbon footprint of their electricity use. These programs deploy three types of public-goods <b>contribution</b> mechanisms: <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution,</b> green tariff, and all-or-nothing green tariff (Kotchen and Moore, 2007). We extend the theoretical understanding of the all-or-nothing green tariff mechanism by showing that an assumption of warm-glow preferences is needed to explain widespread participation in programs deploying this mechanism. We conduct the first experimental test to compare the revenue generating capacity of a pure public good (based on the <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution</b> mechanism) and an impure public good (based on the green tariff mechanism). In experimental play, the <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution</b> mechanism raises 50 % more revenue than the green tariff mechanism. With the all-or-nothing green tariff, experimental play and regression estimates show that a warm-glow preference positively affects participation, as predicted by the theory...|$|R

The article summarizes the results of series of experiments that have been conducted with several groups of Czech university students.

The results confi rm, to a great extent, fi ndings published by foreign studies.

40|$|The {{vision of}} the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is the {{achievement}} of societal benefits through <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution</b> and sharing of data, metadata and products at no or minimum cost. Such undertakings, where contribution provides positive externalities, benefiting contributors and non-contributors alike, are often described as "social dilemmas," usually resulting in small levels of <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution.</b> We investigate the benefits and challenges of <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution</b> to GEOSS, surveying economic and game theoretic literature and examining how the concepts of social dilemmas apply to the provision of GEOSS. We conduct an exploratory survey among individuals involved in the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) to understand their perception of voluntarily contribution. Even though contribution to GEOSS was perceived as rather low, e. g. because of a perceived lack of funds, commitment or organization, survey respondents also perceived many (exclusive) benefits of contribution, e. g. networking, visibility for their work or collaborating with motivated individuals. To increase participation, respondents suggested increasing financial support and raising awareness of GEOSS. We conclude that communicating the efficacy of individuals' contributions, the personal benefits of contribution and strengthening of group identity and knowledge about fellow participants' work can constitute incentives for future <b>voluntary</b> <b>contribution.</b> This could be facilitated by an externally established institution providing a framework for cooperation, or by institutions, agreements or frameworks agreed upon by contributors themselves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we assume that}} a public project creates {{different}} payoffs to different contributors. Within this environment we study two institutions: Rank Order <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Contribution</b> Mechanism (Rank-Order-VCM) and Random Order <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Contribution</b> Mechanism (Random-Order-VCM). In Rank-Order-VCM individuals compete with their observable contributions towards a public project for {{a larger share of}} the payoff that the project generates while in Random-Order-VCM the shares are assigned randomly. We observe that competition outweighs incentives to free-ride and find that Random-Rank-VCM elicits median contributions equal to the full endowment throughout the whole experiment, including the last period. In Random-Rank-VCM the contributions are significantly lower and decline over time...|$|R
