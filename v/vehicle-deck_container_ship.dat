40|$|Abstract: The paper dose {{research}} about the optimization of <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> of sea –carriage {{for meeting the}} goods transport requirement by use of integer programming. Both laden and empty containers are combined into a system. In particular, the effect of special laden <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> capacity on the shipping plan is investigated. In the model, the objective function is to maximize the total profit of <b>container</b> <b>shipping.</b> The profit caused by laden <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> minus the cost caused by both laden and empty <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> equal to the total profit. The constraints to the model include meeting the need of both laden and empty <b>containers,</b> <b>shipping</b> limit to both common and special laden containers, the number of empty container supported. Lingo 9. 0 is used to solve the model and shipping methods in varied parameters are shown by simulation.

We have refined and implemented the <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> design [2], and have measured its performance for local IPC, FDDI datagrams, and video display [1, 3]. Measured throughput with <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> {{is up to}} seven times greater than with conventional Unix I/O. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> is an I/O data transfer mechanism composed of six system calls. Implemented {{as a supplement to}} or a replacement of a user-level I/O API, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> provides copy-free I/O through selective virtual memory remapping. Unlike related efforts, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> is not limited to one type of device, does not restrict access to data, and does not perform unnecessary memory mappings or copy-on-write operations. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> unconditionally eliminates copies by moving all data with virtual memory remapping. I/O data (in blocks of memory called Containers) is mapped in and out of process address spaces. Copy elimination provides a large reduction in latency and a corresponding improvement in throughput. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> also eliminates unnecessary memory mapping operations, by mapping data only as requested by a process, thereby providing additional latency and throughput gains. Because mapping is directed by user request, no expensive page faults are required to access data. Finally, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> makes possible additional optimizations which exploit the predictable behavior of long-lasting I/O pathways, for further performance gains. We have implemented <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> alongside the traditional Unix I/O API in DEC’s OSF/ 1 v 2. 0 operating system. Tests were conducted by running our modified kernel on DEC 3000 model 800 (“Alpha”) workstations. First, we measured local IPC performance between two processes.

5000|$|Since {{even very}} large <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> are vessels with {{relatively}} low draft compared to large tankers and bulk carriers, {{there is still}} considerable room for vessel growth. Compared to today's largest <b>container</b> <b>ships,</b> Maersk Line's [...] Emma Mærsk-type series, a [...] <b>container</b> <b>ship</b> would only be moderately larger in terms of exterior dimensions.
