50|$|Cane is a 1923 {{novel by}} noted Harlem Renaissance author Jean Toomer. The novel is {{structured}} {{as a series}} of <b>vignettes</b> revolving around the origins and experiences of African Americans in the United States. The <b>vignettes</b> alternate in structure between narrative prose, poetry, and play-like passages of dialogue. As a result, the novel has been classified as a composite novel or as a short story cycle. Though some characters and situations recur between <b>vignettes,</b> the <b>vignettes</b> are mostly freestanding, tied to the other <b>vignettes</b> thematically and contextually more than through specific plot details.|$|R

40|$|IntroductionOne of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for emergency healthcare services in low to middle income countries (LMICs) is limited capacity to deal with heavy emergency caseloads. The process of triage is one mechanism for mitigating this challenge. MethodsIn a two-round consensus building process (the Delphi process), a panel of emergency centre (EC) experts were asked to independently triage 50 clinical <b>vignettes</b> using one of four acuity levels: emergency (patient to be seen immediately), very urgent (patient to be seen within 10 min), urgent (patient to be seen within 60 min), or routine (patient to be seen within four hours). The <b>vignettes</b> were based on real paediatric EC cases in South Africa. <b>Vignettes</b> that reached a minimum of 80 % group consensus for acuity ratings on either round one or two {{were included in the}} final set of reference <b>vignettes.</b> ResultsOf the 50 <b>vignettes</b> presented to 11 EC experts, in the first round, 80 % group consensus on acuity ratings was obtained for 10 (20 %) of the <b>vignettes.</b> In the second round, 80 % consensus was reached for 30 of the 40 remaining <b>vignettes.</b> Thus, overall, 40 (80 %) of the <b>vignettes</b> reached a minimum group consensus of 80 % (emergency n= 4; very urgent n= 8; urgent n= 12; routine n= 16). ConclusionThis study demonstrates how context-specific reference <b>vignettes</b> can be developed to provide a cheap, effective, and feasible means by which to evaluate paediatric triage systems in LMICs...|$|R
5|$|One of Orton's first {{official}} WWF appearances was March 16, 2002 at WrestleMania X8's Fan Axxess, {{where he was}} defeated by Tommy Dreamer.

In September 2002, Orton was drafted to the Raw brand, where he defeated Stevie Richards in his debut on the show. Within weeks of his debut on the Raw brand, Orton suffered a shoulder injury, leaving him sidelined for months. While recovering, Orton still appeared on Raw in his own Randy News Network segment, a weekly <b>vignette</b> featuring him talking about his condition. The show interrupted other segments of Raw programming, which caused Orton to slowly transition himself into a narcissistic and self-centered villain.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} ability of two {{different}} clinical practice guideline formats to influence physician ordering of electrodiagnostic tests in low back pain. DATA SOURCES/STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial {{of the effect of}} practice guidelines on self-reported physician test ordering behavior in response to a series of 12 clinical <b>vignettes.</b> Data came from a national random sample of 900 U. S. neurologists, physical medicine physicians, and general internists. INTERVENTION: Two different versions of a practice guideline for the use of electrodiagnostic tests (EDT) were developed by the U. S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Low Back Problems Panel. The two guidelines were similar in content but varied in the specificity of their recommendations. DATA COLLECTION: The proportion of clinical <b>vignettes</b> for which EDTs were ordered for appropriate and inappropriate clinical indications in each of three physician groups were randomly assigned to receive <b>vignettes</b> alone, <b>vignettes</b> plus the nonspecific version of the guideline, or <b>vignettes</b> plus the specific version of the guideline. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The response rate to the survey was 71 percent. The proportion of appropriate <b>vignettes</b> for which EDTs were ordered averaged 77 percent for the no guideline group, 71 percent for the nonspecific guideline group, and 79 percent for the specific guideline group (p =. 002). The corresponding values for the number of EDTs ordered for inappropriate <b>vignettes</b> were 32 percent, 32 percent, and 26 percent, respectively (p =. 08). Pairwise comparisons showed that physicians receiving the nonspecific guidelines ordered fewer EDTs for appropriate clinical <b>vignettes</b> than did physicians receiving no guidelines (p =. 02). Furthermore, compared to physicians receiving nonspecific guidelines, physicians receiving specific guidelines ordered significantly more EDTs for appropriate <b>vignettes</b> (p =. 0007) and significantly fewer EDTs for inappropriate <b>vignettes</b> (p =. 04). CONCLUSIONS: The clarity and clinical applicability of a guideline may be important attributes that contribute to the effects of practice guidelines...|$|R

5|$|Some apologists {{also believe}} that there are {{differences}} between the <b>vignette</b> and other comparable vignettes that render the standard interpretation incorrect. Apologists have also challenged the Egyptologists' means of successfully interpreting the facsimiles, arguing that the papyrus had likely been written, not for future Egyptologists or even contemporary Egyptians, but rather for Egyptian Jews. These apologists contend that the papyri may have been created by a Jewish redactor, adapting Egyptian religious sources, but imbuing them with new Semitic religious context. Apologists give examples of such Jewish adaptations to help explain how the facsimiles can support Smith's possible translation of the book. Mormon apologists also allege the assertion that Smith's reconstructions were flawedan assertion that has been put forth by several Egyptologistsis mere speculation that fallaciously presupposes that the Egyptologist interpretation is correct. These apologists therefore assert that Smith's reconstruction was either correct, was done so as to make the images more aesthetically pleasing, or was inconsequential to the original interpretation of the Book of Abraham.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was {{to determine whether or not}} different virginity status groups make different causal attributions about virginity and sexual choices, to determine whether self-monitoring influences this attribution process, and to determine whether or not there were any group sex differences. This research attempted to answer several questions: 1) What virginity status groups are most likely to be high self-monitors? Low self-monitors? Are there any sex differences? 2) What kinds of causal attributions do the different virginity status groups make about other virginity status groups? Are there any sex differences?The present research used Russell's Causal Dimension Scale (CDS) and Snyder's selfmonitoring scale to assess information about causal attributions and individual self-monitoring styles. One-hundred and ninety-eight subjects participated. Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted to determine whether self-monitoring and virginitystatus were statistically related. Based on these correlation results, multivariate analyses were conducted. Wilke's Lambda coefficients were computed via a four-way factorial MANOVA analysis. Univariate analyses and F-tests were also computed based on the multivariate results. Post-hoc comparisons of significant univariate means (main effects and interactions) were then calculated using the Tukey B test. Results indicated that 1) self-monitoring and virginity status were not correlated although male subjects were significantly higher in self-monitoring than were female subjects. 2) Although univariate analyses revealed significant effects for attributions of internality and stability, using the conservative Tukey B procedure, there were no significant differences. 3) Adamant virgin subjects attributed significantly more internality to <b>vignettes</b> of males than Potential Non-virgin subjects did to <b>vignettes</b> of males. 4) Subjects attributed significantly more controllability to <b>vignettes</b> of female Regretful Non-virgins than to <b>vignettes</b> of female Adamant virgins. 5) Regretful Non-virgin subjects attributed significantly more stability to <b>vignettes</b> of Regretful Non-virgins than to <b>vignettes</b> of Adamant virgins. 6) Male subjects attributed significantly more controllability to <b>vignettes</b> of Potential Non-virgins than to <b>vignettes</b> of Adamant virgins. 7) Regretful Non-virgin subjects attributed significantly controllability to <b>vignettes</b> of male Potential Non-virgins than they did to <b>vignettes</b> of female Adamant virgins. 8) Non-virgin subjects attributed significantly more stability to <b>vignettes</b> of female Potential Non-virgins than they did to <b>vignettes</b> of female Regretful Non-virgins.

40|$|Cross-country {{comparisons}} of subjective assessments are rendered difficult {{if not impossible}} because of sub-population specific response style. To correct for this, the use of <b>vignettes</b> has become increasingly popular, notably within cross-country health studies. However, the validity of <b>vignettes</b> {{as a means to}} re-scale across sample populations critically rests on the assumption of "response consistency" (RC) : that <b>vignettes</b> and self-assessments are evaluated on the same scale. In this paper, we seek to test this assumption by applying objective measures of health along with subjective measures and <b>vignettes.</b> Our results indicate that the assumption of RC is not innocuous and that our extended model relaxing this assumption improves the fit and significantly changes the cross-country rankings of health vis-à-vis the standard Chopit model. cross-country health comparison, <b>vignettes,</b> subjective and objective measures...|$|R

A qualitative design was used to collect data on how 4 teachers responded to 10 videotaped <b>vignettes</b> of science instruction. The 4 -minute <b>vignettes</b> showed urban teachers engaging students in hands-on activities to discover scientific principles. Three of the responding teachers were in their second year of teaching and the fourth had taught for 8 years. The teachers provided responses to the <b>vignettes</b> in interviews, videotaped data, and journals, and during classroom observations. Data were transcribed into protocols and categorized according to prevalent themes. The data were verified using juxtapositioning, recurring data, and triangulation. Although three of the four teachers were initially skeptical of <b>vignettes</b> that did not match their classroom environment, they seemed to construct their own meaning of the <b>vignettes</b> as they reflected upon their classroom practices. The findings suggest that <b>vignettes</b> could be valuable tools for professional development, particularly with the support of an external person or other staff members.
