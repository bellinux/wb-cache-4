In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds of its population) within two months, extremely compromising the species' <b>viable</b> <b>population.</b> While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided, the most likely cause is a morbilivirus or a toxic algae bloom.|$|E

The first twelve lambs were removed from the island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, which kept it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to adverse conditions.|$|E

5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil {{will be in the}} more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may not seem like a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a <b>viable</b> <b>population</b> and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The Sulu bleeding-heart has always been considered a rare bird, and only two specimens, both males, have ever been taken of the species. The specimens, collected in October 1891 on the small islet of Tataan, are the last time anyone has definitely seen the Sulu bleeding-heart alive. The bleeding-heart was searched for 22 days in December 1971 and briefly in September 1991 without success. Most of Tawi-Tawi's forests were cleared by August 1994, and the Sulu bleeding-heart may well be extirpated on the mainland. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 generated reports that the bleeding-heart survives and is regularly seen on the nearby islets of Tandubatu, Dundangan, and Baliungan. It was also reported that the species was quite common until the 1970s. Despite this, an expedition in 2009 failed to find any signs of the species or discover a new report of the species' continued existence. The islets it reportedly survives on may also be too small to support a <b>viable</b> <b>population.</b> Any surviving population of Sulu bleeding-hearts is likely to be small, possibly numbering fewer than 50 birds, and would be threatened by continued habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting. As the Mindanao and Luzon bleeding-hearts are popular cagebirds, any bleeding-heart found on Tawi-Tawi could also be an escaped bleeding-heart instead of the indigenous Sulu bleeding-heart. There are no protected areas in the Sulu Archipelago, and other than two environmental education initiatives in the 1990s nothing has been done to protect any surviving population.|$|E

40|$|Peat bogs {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{characteristic}} ecosystems of Central Russian landscape. Because of peat mining and transformation of peat bogs into agricultural land after drainage, suitable habitats for several characteristic species now show a very fragmented pattern. The potentials for <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of characteristic species were assessed using a decision support system Landscape ecological Analysis and Rules for the Configuration of Habitat (LARCH). Two butterfly species (C. hero, P. optilete) and three bird species (L. excubitor, P. trydactylus, G. grus) show low potential for <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> and four butterfly species (A. melanaria, C. palaeno, E. maturna, A. laodice) and one bird species (T. nebularia) medium potential.

To maintain and increase potential for <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of characteristic species of peat bogs both protection and restoration are important measures. To identify sites where restoration will be most effective, all moderately damaged peat bogs were changed to undisturbed.

25|$|Along {{with the}} Rothschild giraffe, the eastern bongo is arguably {{one of the}} most {{threatened}} large mammals in Africa, with recent estimates numbering less than 140 animals, below a minimum sustainable <b>viable</b> <b>population.</b> The situation is exacerbated because these animals are spread across four isolated populations. Whilst the bongo endangered species program can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe, it has not yet become actively involved in the conservation of this species in the wild in a coordinated fashion. The plan is to engage in conservation activities in Kenya to assist in reversing the decline of the eastern bongo populations and genetic diversity in Africa, and in particular, applying population management expertise to help ensure the persistence of genetic diversity in the free ranging wild populations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{hypotheses}} also seek {{to explain}} the regional extinction of mammoths in specific areas. Scientists have speculated that the mammoths of Saint Paul Island, an isolated enclave where mammoths survived until about 8,000 years ago, died out as the island shrank by 80–90% when sea levels rose, eventually making it too small to support a <b>viable</b> <b>population.</b> Similarly, genome sequences of the Wrangel Island mammoths indicate {{a sharp decline in}} genetic diversity, though the extent to which this played a role in their extinction is still unclear. Another hypothesis, said to be the cause of mammoth extinction in Siberia, comes from the idea that many may have drowned. While traveling to the Northern River, many of these mammoths broke through the ice and drowned. This also explains bones remains in the Arctic Coast and islands of the New Siberian Group.|$|E

25|$|No {{data are}} {{available}} on minimal hammock size needed to support a <b>viable</b> <b>population</b> of tree snails. Suitable habitat would have to include an area large enough to provide for foraging and nesting requirements, {{as well as provide}} for the microclimate (air temperature and humidity) needed by the Orthalicus reses reses. Preferences for edge or interior hammock have been observed in Liguus populations on Lignumvitae Key. Age-class differences were seen where older individuals were found in the central mature hammock, while younger individuals were found more often along the edges of the hammock. Tuskes (1981) suggested this may be an adaptation of younger snails to move to the edge to escape competition from older snails. It is not known whether Orthalicus reses reses prefer interior or edge hammock areas. Recent surveys of snails in the Key Largo populations have shown higher numbers of snails {{along the edge of the}} hammock than in the interior, but this result may be affected by the differences in visibility during surveying.|$|E
25|$|The {{saltwater}} crocodile has been extirpated from {{much of its}} former range within the Philippines and currently populations remain {{in only a few}} scattered locations. On the island of Mindanao the species is present within the Ligawasan Marsh and adjacent waterways in the southwest of the island and also within the Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary in the eastern portion of the island, where in September 2011 a 20.24 foot/6.17 meter {{saltwater crocodile}}, the largest reliably measured, was captured by locals following two fatal attacks. This species is also reported to be found within the mangroves of Languyan Island of the Tawi-Tawi province southwest of Mindanao and within the mangroves of Del Carmen municipality on Siargao Island northeast of Mindanao. On Luzon Island the species has been reported from three areas in the northeast: the Blos River of barangay Reina Mercedes, the Divilacan mangroves of barangay Dimasalansan and the Palanan River estuary of barangay Culasi. On the island of Palawan the species appears to remain within only the southern portion of the country and in recent years, attacks on humans have occurred within the Rio Tuba area near Bataraza on the southeast coast and from near Rizal on the southeastern coast. The species is also reported to be present within the islands of the Balabac Strait between the island of Palawan and the Malaysian Borneo state of Sabah. The status of the species within Naujan Lake on the island of Mindoro is unclear; crocodile eye-shines have been spotted in recent years and these are believed to belong to the saltwater crocodile, but it is unknown whether a <b>viable</b> <b>population</b> remains.|$|E

40|$|Estimates of minimum areas {{required}} for effective biodiversity conservation differ substantially. Scientific reserve design and placement procedures indicate that between 30 and 75 % of any region {{may be required}} to sample biodiversity features. These estimates do not routinely incorporate measures for sampling <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of species or explore the area requirements of sampling <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of species assemblages. To determine the area requirements for sampling <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of a herbivore assemblage, spatially explicit abundance data from the Kruger National Park, South Africa, were analyzed. Area requirements were consistently above 50 % and were unaffected by selected target population sizes. In addition, area requirements appeared to be insensitive to selection unit size (analytical grain), habitat quality, the coarseness of the land classification system used or the presence of low-density species. Thus, traditional conservation area targets of 10 - 15 % appear inadequate for representing <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of a herbivore assemblage from African savanna regions. This suggests that conservation targets of at least 50 % of land classification units may represent a more appropriate conservation rule of thumb, or alternatively, that the use of data independent conservation targets may need to be abandoned.

500|$|Although {{the species}} is widely distributed, it is locally rare in all regions, making fossas {{particularly}} vulnerable to extinction. The effects of habitat fragmentation increase the risk. For its size, the fossa has a lower than predicted population density, which is further threatened by Madagascar's rapidly disappearing forests and dwindling lemur populations, which make up {{a high proportion of}} its diet. The loss of the fossa, either locally or completely, could significantly impact ecosystem dynamics, possibly leading to over-grazing by some of its prey species. The total population of the fossa living within protected areas is estimated at less than 2,500adults, but this may be an overestimate. Only two protected areas are thought to contain 500 or more adult fossas: Masoala National Park and Midongy-Sud National Park, although these are also thought to be overestimated. Too little population information has been collected for a formal population viability analysis, but estimates suggest that none of the protected areas support a <b>viable</b> <b>population.</b> If this is correct, the extinction of the fossa may take as much as 100years to occur as the species gradually declines. In order for the species to survive, it is estimated that at least [...] is needed to maintain smaller, short-term viable populations, and at least [...] for populations of 500 adults.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{protected}} areas {{are essential for}} the conservation of native biota. However, only the protected area establishment does not guarantee the persistence of threatened species. Here, we assessed the efficiency of the Cerrado {{protected areas}} in maintaining <b>viable</b> <b>populations</b> of giant anteater and analyzed the impact of roadkills. We used the software VORTEX to model the viability of giant anteater populations in 18 Cerrado protected areas.
