40|$|International audienceThere {{are many}} motivations for {{investigating}} the view selection problem. At first, materialized views {{are increasingly being}} supported by commercial database systems and are used to speed up query response time. Therefore, the problem of choosing an appropriate set of <b>views</b> <b>to</b> materialize in the database is crucial {{in order to improve}} query processing cost. Another application of the view selection issue is selecting <b>views</b> <b>to</b> materialize in data warehousing systems to answer decision support queries. The problem addressed in this paper {{is similar to that of}} deciding which <b>views</b> <b>to</b> materialize in data warehousing. However, most existing view selection methods are static. Moreover, none of these methods have considered the problem of de-materializing the already materialized views. Yet it is a very important issue since the size of storage space is usually restricted. This chapter deals with the problem of dynamic view selection and with the pending issue of removing materialized <b>views</b> in order <b>to</b> replace less beneficial views with more beneficial views. We propose a view selection method for deciding which <b>views</b> <b>to</b> materialize according to statistic metadata. More precisely, we have designed and implemented our view selection method, including a polynomial algorithm, <b>to</b> decide which <b>views</b> <b>to</b> materialize...|$|R

Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously.
