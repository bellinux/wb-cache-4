50|$|The planned {{list price}} {{is set at}} 8,900 € for the base version, {{including}} VAT but excluding the monthly lease rate for the lithium iron phosphate battery of 55 €. Assuming an electricity price of 0.20 € per kWh, total costs per kilometer driven would be 0.17 €, including <b>vehicle</b> <b>depreciation,</b> battery lease, maintenance, taxes, insurance and energy. Compared to the most cost-efficient city car which, according to the German ADAC, costs around 0.30 €, a light elective vehicle like the Colibri saves 0.13 € / km. A compact car easily exceeds 0.40 € / km.|$|E

5000|$|Much of the mileage-related {{cost of an}} {{electric}} <b>vehicle</b> is <b>depreciation</b> of the battery pack. To calculate the cost per kilometer of {{an electric}} vehicle it is therefore necessary to assign a monetary value to the wear incurred on the battery.|$|R
40|$|Improvements to {{transportation}} networks, {{especially those in}} growing areas, tend to have impacts on local land markets. In principle, an improvement to a link in the network will confer economic benefits to adjacent and nearby properties. Depending {{on the type of}} improvement (construction of a new link, capacity addition to an existing link, or upgrading an existing link), the benefit could represent a reduction in the time cost of travel or other variable costs, such as fuel consumption or mileage-related <b>vehicle</b> <b>depreciation.</b> It could also represent an improvement to the level of access that a given transportation network provides. Urban economic theory would suggest that these benefits are capitalized into local property values, yielding a localized spillover benefit.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. We {{introduce}} a practically important and theoretically challenging problem: finding the minimum cost path for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) {{in a network}} with refueling and battery switching stations, considering electricity and gasoline as sources of energy with different cost structures and limitations. We show that this problem is NP-complete even though its electric vehicle and conventional vehicle special cases are polynomially solvable. We propose three solution techniques: (1) a mixed integer quadratically constrained program that incorporates non-fuel costs such as <b>vehicle</b> <b>depreciation,</b> battery degradation and stopping, (2) a dynamic programming based heuristic and (3) a shortest path heuristic. We conduct extensive computational experiments using both real world road network data and artificially generated road networks of various sizes and provide signifi- cant insights {{about the effects of}} driver preferences and the availability of battery switching stations on the PHEV economics. In particular, our findings show that increasing the number of battery switching stations {{may not be enough to}} overcome the range anxiety of the drivers...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} {{repairing}} damages to concrete pavement require {{a certain amount}} of time, regardless of the scale of the harm. The area must first be cleaned; this means that the damaged section must be separated from the surrounding area by sawing around its edges. The failing concrete is then broken up and removed. After pouring fresh concrete into the resulting hole, the U. S. Department of Transportation recommends waiting at least seven days before proceeding to the next step. Vehicles must be detoured for the entirety of this period, which often results in <b>vehicle</b> <b>depreciation</b> by as much as $ 140, 000 per a repair project. Considering the indirect losses that can be caused by this process, stakeholders often find it difficult to decide when palm-size spall damage should be repaired. Many government agencies wait until the damaged sections become severe enough to justify a road closure. This dissertation presents a novel idea for speeding up the repair process for palm-size spall damage of concrete pavement: the use of 3 D scanning and 3 D printing. This study presents the suggested method to repair small damage on a concrete pavement using a prefabricated concrete segment tailored for the damaged area. The suggested method begins with scanning the damaged area using photogrammetry to get a 3 D model. After that, printing out the obtained 3 D model using a 3 D printer. The output of a 3 D printer is used as a formwork. And then pouring concrete in the formwork and curing a concrete segment tailored for the damaged area. Last, plug a pre-fabricated concrete segment in the damaged area after the adhesive is applied. However, each step of this spall repair sequence has its tolerance such as the level of the accuracy of the 3 D scanner and the shrinkage of the output of the 3 D printer. When these errors are accumulated, we can simply assume {{that there will be a}} certain space between the bottom of the prefabricated concrete segment and the surface of the spall when the concrete segment is later inserted into the spall. This space will be filled with an adhesive. But it is not known yet to what extent the adhesive layer will be formed. However, it can be predicted that the thickness of the adhesive layer will have some effect on how it will hold the concrete segment. Therefore, this study identifies the maximum shear stress and proposes a modified slant shear test method to experimentally investigate the influence of bond line thickness of epoxy-resin adhesive on shear strength when the glue applied to a concrete adherend. Also, this research investigates the attached concrete segment is strong enough to handle the maximum applied stress. The conclusions of this research are that first, it was found that having an adhesive layer between a concrete segment and a spall has better adhesive strength than a perfect fit between a concrete segment and a spall. Also, it was found that the spall repair method using 3 D printer is sufficiently realistic. Last, the ultimate shear strength of three epoxy-resin adhesives that were used in this study can be predicted when the measured bond line thickness applied to the variable of the determined mathematical relationships of each adhesive...|$|E

40|$|There are {{dramatic}} {{changes taking place}} in the U. S. automotive industry as it moves to meet stringent government mandated Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) requirements. Clean diesel engine technology represents one of the technologies companies are using to improve fuel economy. This report not only compares the fuel efficiency of clean diesel vehicles to comparable gasoline versions of the same vehicle (sold at auction during the 2012 - 2013 timeframe), but it also compares the total cost of ownership (TCO) between the two types of technologies. The report is a followup to our previous work on the total cost of ownership comparison of vehicles sold at auction during the 2010 and 2011 timeframe. The TCO model is built by developing three- and five-year cost estimates of depreciation by modeling used-vehicle auction data, as well as developing estimates for fuel costs by modeling government data. This report differs from the previous report in that it controls for the trim levels of the different <b>vehicles.</b> The <b>depreciation</b> and fuel cost estimates are added to three- and five-year estimates for repairs, fees and taxes, insurance, and maintenance from an outside data source. The results show that clean diesel vehicles provide a return on investment in both the three- and five-year timeframes, though there are differences in the amounts of return among mass market vehicles, medium duty pickup trucks, and luxury vehicles, as well as passenger cars, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and medium duty pickup trucks...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} {{road transportation}} network {{is an important}} factor in economic and social development. It is also costly. Road construction and maintenance consume a large proportion of the national budget, while the costs borne by the road-using public for <b>vehicle</b> operation and <b>depreciation</b> are even greater. It is therefore vitally important that policies be pursued which, within financial and other constraints, minimize total transport costs for the individual road links and for the road network as a whole. To do this meaningfully, particularly when dealing with large and diverse road networks, alternatives must be compared and the tradeofffs between them carefully assessed. This in turn requires the ability to quantify and predict performance and cost functions for the desired period of analysis. Because of the need for such quantitative functions, the World Bank initiated a study in 1969 that later became a large-scale program of collaborative research with leading research institutions and road agencies in several countries. This Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Study (HDM) has focused both on the rigorous empirical quantification of the tradeoffs between the costs of road construction, road maintenance, and vehicle operation and on the development of planning models incorporating total life-cycle cost simulation as a basis for highways decisiomnaking. This volume is one in a series that documents the results of the HDM study. The other volumes are...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} a car in a {{relation}} to accounting and tax laws. This thesis {{is divided into two}} basic parts, theoretical and practical. The theoretical part is concerned with a car perception in accounting and the influence of tax laws on the car perception. The theoretical part is divided into three main parts. The first part is focused on a general view of vehicles in accounting, for example, <b>vehicle</b> valuations, acquisitions, <b>depreciation,</b> valuation changes and disposals of vehicles. The other part is focused on specifications of the vehicle perception in a tax evidence of individual entrepreneurs. In the third part there are described the vehicle perception in business corporations. It is focused on a value-added tax, mainly on a value-added tax in cross-border buying and selling of vehicles. Furthermore, there are analyzed a deferred tax and issues of cars in a relation to employers and employees. In the theoretical part there is dealt with the usage of vehicles for private purposes. In the practical part there is analyzed the usages of company cars by an employee for private purposes. There is compared a rent and a free of charge usage. In this part there is also verified whether the law is followed in practice. There are stated atypical transactions. These include using grants to acquire a car, updating of a depreciation plan and disposing of a vehicle by its sale to a foreign entity...|$|R
