40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{dosimetry}} to organs at risk (OARs) in lithotomy position with a planned time-dose pattern obtained from supine position. Methods: The sample consists of thirty patients with {{carcinoma of the}} uterine cervix, Stage II and III. Patients often feel discomfort in supine <b>position</b> (<b>S</b> <b>position)</b> when compared to lithotomy position (M position) due to relaxation of pelvic floor muscles after the insertion of applicator (tandem and ovoids) or before delivery of the treatment. Each patient was imaged with orthogonal X- ray radiographs simultaneously in two <b>positions,</b> i. e. <b>S</b> <b>position</b> and M position. Dwell time and dwell position pattern obtained from the optimized plan in <b>S</b> <b>position</b> was used to generate plan in M position. Following dose reference points (point A, pelvic wall points, bladder points, rectal, anorectum (AR point) and rectosigmoid (RS point) points) were identified for analysis in <b>S</b> and M <b>positions.</b> The dosimetric data for reference points generated by the Brachyvision TPS was analyzed. Results: Pelvic wall points registered lower doses in M position when compared to <b>S</b> <b>position.</b> Mean doses for right pelvic wall point (RPW) and left pelvic wall point (LPW) were reduced by - 10. 02 % and - 11. 5 % in M position, respectively. International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) bladder point also registered lower doses in M position with a mean dose of - 6. 8 %. Rectal point showed dose reduction by mean of - 6. 4 %. AR and RS points showed an increased dose in M position by a mean of 16. 5 % and 10 %, respectively. Conclusion: Current dosimetry procedure serves as a model with time-dose pattern planned for <b>S</b> <b>position,</b> but delivered in M position, without dose optimization. Prioritization of comfort and position can be considered in conjunction with optimization of dose.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{impedance}} tomography {{is a novel}} technology {{capable of}} quantifying ventilation distribution in the lung in real time during various therapeutic manoeuvres. The technique requires changes to the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>position</b> to place the electrical impedance tomography electrodes circumferentially around the thorax. The impact of these position changes on the time taken to stabilise the regional distribution of ventilation determined by electrical impedance tomography is unknown. This study aimed to determine the time taken for the regional distribution of ventilation determined by electrical impedance-tomography to stabilise after changing position. Eight healthy, male volunteers were connected to electrical impedance tomography and a pneumotachometer. After 30 minutes stabilisation supine, participants were moved into 60 degrees Fowler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>position</b> {{and then returned to}} supine. Thirty minutes was spent in each position. Concurrent readings of ventilation distribution and tidal volumes were taken every five minutes. A mixed regression model with a random intercept was used to compare the positions and changes over time. The anterior-posterior distribution stabilised after ten minutes in Fowler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>position</b> and ten minutes after returning to supine. Left-right stabilisation was achieved after 15 minutes in Fowler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>position</b> and supine. A minimum of 15 minutes of stabilisation should be allowed for spontaneously breathing individuals when assessing ventilation distribution. This time allows stabilisation to occur in the anterior-posterior direction as well as the left-right direction...|$|R

40|$|The {{document}} discusses {{a procedure}} for localizing the Mars rovers in site frame, a locally defined reference frame on the Martian surface. MER onboard position within a site frame is estimated onboard {{and is based}} on wheel odometry. Odometry estimation of rover position is only reliable over relatively short distances assuming no wheel slip, sinkage, etc. As the rover traverses, its onboard estimate of position in the current site frame accumulates errors and will need to be corrected on occasions via relocalization on the ground (mission operations). The procedure provides a systematic process for ground operators to localize the rover. The method focuses on analysis of acquired images used to declare a site frame and images acquired post-drive. Target selection is performed using two main steps. In the first step, the user identifies features of interest from the images used to declare the current site. Each of the selected target <b>s</b> <b>position</b> in site frame is recorded. In the second step, post-traverse measurements of the selected features positions are recorded again, this time in rover frame, using images acquired post-traverse. In the third step, we transform the post-traverse target <b>s</b> <b>positions</b> to local level frame. In the fourth step, we compute the delta differences in the pre- and post-traverse target <b>s</b> <b>position.</b> In the fifth step, we analyze the delta differences with techniques that compute their statistics to determine the rover <b>s</b> <b>position</b> in the site frame...|$|R

40|$|Democracies {{are more}} {{supportive}} of U. <b>S.</b> <b>positions</b> on important votes in the UN General As-sembly than non-democracies. Is this because democracies share common perspectives, or does this pattern reflect coercion? Since 1985, U. S. law has stipulated that the State Department identify important votes and that aid disbursements reflect voting decisions. To unravel these alternative explanations, we introduce a strategic statistical model {{that allows us to}} estimate voting preferences, vulnerability to influence, and credibility of linkage, which are theoretical quantities of interest that are not directly observable. The results reject the hypothesis of shared democratic values: poor democracies have voting preferences that are more oppositional to U. <b>S.</b> <b>positions</b> than autocracies, and they are more willing than autocracies to take symbolic stands that may cost them foreign aid. Democracies support U. <b>S.</b> <b>positions,</b> however, because U. S. aid linkages are more credible when directed towards democratic countries. Splitting the sample into Cold War and post-Cold War segments, we find {{that the end of the}} Cold War changed the way U.

Various indices of group loyalty (ingroup homogeneity, motivation to work for the group, and evaluation of a motivated group member) showed that when group members anticipated future rejection, the lower the identification the less loyal they were. In contrast, those who expected future acceptance were more loyal (more motivated to work for the group) the lower their identification. Current group behavior depends on both intragroup future expectations and level of identification...|$|R

In the summer of 1901 the spur and railroad station were built. The station was named Fair Oaks Bridge Depot. The spur to the main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad Co. helped Fair Oaks farmers and fruit companies prosper by enabling growers to distribute fresh fruit to a vast market.|$|R
