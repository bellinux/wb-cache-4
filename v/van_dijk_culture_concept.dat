30|$|Both Castells and <b>Van</b> <b>Dijk</b> {{demonstrate}} how networked practices {{can lead to}} the formation of cultural identities, connecting users in virtual communities online (Castells 2004; <b>Van</b> <b>Dijk</b> 2006). Since <b>culture</b> is enacted through communication, culture itself can be transformed and shaped by new technological systems, such as the Internet. In this vein, egao can be a site where cultural transformation and social stratification intersect through digital technologies (Gong and Yang 2010, 4). The conditions in which egao has flourished have rendered it a distinctly Chinese cultural phenomenon, which often appropriates the variety of available homophones in Mandarin Chinese to entertain netizens. Yet, it is at this node, when conceptualizing egao as a cultural practice in the network society, that some particularly revealing trends and patterns emerge in the data.|$|R
