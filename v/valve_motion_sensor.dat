40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct a {{comprehensive}} evaluation of the effect that walking speed, gender, leg length, <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> tilt angle, brand, and placement have on <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> step-counting error. Fifty-nine participants performed treadmill walking trials at 6 speeds while wearing 5 <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> brands placed on the anterior (Digiwalker,DW; Walk 4 Life, WFL; New Lifestyles, NL; Omron, OM), midaxillary (DW; WFL; NL; ActiGraph, AG), and posterior (DW, WFL, NL) aspects of the waistline. The anterior-placed NL and midaxillary-placed AG were the most accurate <b>motion</b> <b>sensors.</b> <b>Motion</b> <b>sensor</b> step-count error tended to decrease at faster walking speeds, with lesser tilt angles,and with an anterior waistline placement.

40|$|Recognition of body {{posture and}} motion is an {{important}} physiological function that can keep the body in balance. Man-made <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> have also been widely applied for {{a broad array of}} biomedical applications including diagnosis of balance disorders and evaluation of energy expenditure. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art sensing components utilized for body motion measurement. The anatomy and working principles of a natural body <b>motion</b> <b>sensor,</b> the human vestibular system, are first described. Various man-made inertial sensors are then elaborated based on their distinctive sensing mechanisms. In particular, both the conventional solid-state <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> and the emerging non solid-state <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> are depicted. With their lower cost and increased intelligence, man-made <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> are expected to play an increasingly important role in biomedical systems for basic research as well as clinical diagnostics...|$|R

40|$|Valve {{systems in}} rocket {{propulsion}} systems and testing facilities are constantly subject to dynamic events {{resulting from the}} timing of <b>valve</b> <b>motion</b> leading to unsteady fluctuations in pressure and mass flow. Such events can also be accompanied by cavitation, resonance, system vibration leading to catastrophic failure. High-fidelity dynamic computational simulations of valve operation can yield important information of valve response to varying flow conditions. Prediction of transient behavior related to <b>valve</b> <b>motion</b> can serve as guidelines for valve scheduling, which is of crucial importance in engine operation and testing. In this paper, we present simulations of <b>valve</b> <b>motion</b> utilizing a multi-element unstructured computational approach that permits the use of variable grid topologies, thereby permitting solution accuracy and resolving important flow physics in the seat region of the valve. The approach {{is based on a}} mesh library strategy in which generalized mesh movement is applied between a sequence of meshes and the solution is transferred between meshes at specific valve positions pre-defined in the library. We discuss important valve flow characteristics such as valve response to variable plug control speeds as part of our simulations. Furthermore, we present an alternative methodology that utilizes a single grid that deforms and adapts during <b>valve</b> <b>motion.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of motion sensing technology, <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> based services have been put into {{a wide range of}} applications in recent years. Demand of consuming such service on mobile devices has already emerged. However, as most <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> are specifically designed for some heavyweight clients such as PCs or game consoles, there are several technical challenges prohibiting <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> from being used by lightweight clients such as mobile devices, for example: There is no direct approach to connect the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> with mobile devices. Most mobile devices don't have enough computational power to consume the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> outputs. To address these problems, I have designed and implemented a framework for publishing general <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> functionalities as a RESTful web service that is accessible to mobile devices via HTTP connections. In the framework, a pure HTML 5 based interface is delivered to the clients to ensure good accessibility, a websocket based data transferring scheme is adopted to guarantee data transferring efficiency, a server side gesture pipeline is proposed to reduce the client side computational burden and a distributed architecture is designed to make the service scalable. Finally, I conducted three experiments to evaluate the framework's compatibility, scalability and data transferring performance...|$|R

Experimental evaluation using commercial off-the-shelf smartwatches and smartphones show that key press inference using smartwatch <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> is not only fairly accurate, but also comparable with similar attacks using smartphone <b>motion</b> <b>sensors.</b> Additionally, hand movements captured by a combination of both smartwatch and smartphone <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> yields better inference accuracy than either device considered individually...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Replacing {{physical}} activity with videogaming has {{been implicated in}} causing obesity. Studies have shown that using motion-sensing controllers with activity-promoting videogames expends energy comparable to aerobic exercise; however, effects of motion-sensing controllers have not been examined with traditional (nonâ€“exercise-promoting) videogames. Materials and Methods: We measured indirect calorimetry and heart rate in 14 subjects during rest and traditional videogaming using <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> and joystick controllers. Results: Energy expenditure was higher while subjects were playing with the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> (1. 30 Â± 0. 32 [*]kcal/kg/hour) than with the joystick (1. 07 Â± 0. 26 [*]kcal/kg/hour; P< 0. 01) or resting (0. 91 Â± 0. 24 [*]kcal/kg/hour; P< 0. 01). Oxygen consumption during videogaming averaged 15. 7 percent of predicted maximum for the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> and 11. 8 percent of maximum for the joystick. Minute ventilation was higher playing with the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> (10. 7 Â± 3. 5 L/minute) than with the joystick (8. 6 Â± 1. 8 L/minute; P< 0. 02) or resting (6. 7 Â± 1. 4 L/minute; P< 0. 001), predominantly because of higher respiratory rates (15. 2 Â± 4. 3 versus 20. 3 Â± 2. 8 versus 20. 4 Â± 4. 2 beats/minute for resting, the joystick, and the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor,</b> respectively; P< 0. 001); tidal volume did not change significantly. Peak heart rate during gaming was 16. 4 percent higher than resting (78. 0 Â± 12. 0) for joystick (90. 1 Â± 15. 0; P= 0. 002) and 17. 4 percent higher for the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> (91. 6 Â± 14. 1; P= 0. 002); mean heart rate did not differ significantly. Conclusions: Playing with a <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> burned significantly more calories than with a joystick, but the energy expended was modest. With both consoles, the increased respiratory rate without increasing tidal volume and the increased peak heart rate without increasing mean heart rate are consistent with psychological stimulation from videogaming, rather than a result of exercise. We conclude that using a <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> with traditional videogames does not provide adequate energy expenditure to provide cardiovascular conditioning...|$|R

The conventional methods of simulation were shown to generate misleading information regarding electric demand charges and life-cycle costs of the building.
