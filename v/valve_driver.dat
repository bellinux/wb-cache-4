By theoretically analyzing the characteristics of solenoid <b>valve</b> <b>driver,</b> we found out that one of the factors that affect the closing and opening speed of solenoid valve is drive current. In this paper, GT-Flow software is used to simulate and analyze the drive current, and come to the optimal combination of current. The selected drive current is used to analyze the emission performance of 16 V 265 H diesel engine, to determine the best advance angle for fuel supply, and to compare the simulation results with the experimental values. ...|$|E

50|$|When {{the driver}} {{shuts off the}} steam to the {{cylinders}} of a steam locomotive while it is in motion, the moving pistons could create a partial vacuum in the cylinders. This would give rise to two problems. Firstly, the pumping action would absorb energy and prevent the engine from coasting freely. Secondly, when the exhaust valve opened, soot and cinders from the smokebox could be sucked down the exhaust pipe and into the valve chest or cylinder, causing damage. (The exhaust {{is open to the}} smokebox because in normal running the exhaust steam is sent through the blastpipe to draw the fire and eject the combustion products from the chimney.) These problems are avoided by using snifting valves to allow air to be drawn into the cylinder. On railways which did not use snifting <b>valves,</b> <b>drivers</b> were instructed to keep the regulator slightly open when coasting to avoid the creation of a vacuum.|$|R

40|$|THE {{inductive}} pulsed plasma thruster (IPPT) is an electrodeless space propulsion device where {{a capacitor}} is charged to an initial voltage and then discharged producing a high current pulse through a coil. The field produced by this pulse ionizes propellant, inductively driving current in a plasma {{located near the}} face of the coil. Once the plasma is formed it can be accelerated and expelled at a high exhaust velocity by the electromagnetic Lorentz body force arising from the interaction of the induced plasma current and the magnetic field produced by the current in the coil. In the present work, we present a summary of the IPPT research and development conducted at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). As a higher-power, still relatively low readiness level system, there are many issues associated with the eventual deployment and use of the IPPT as a primary propulsion system on spacecraft that remain to be addressed. The present program aimed to fabricate and test hardware to explore how these issues could be addressed. The following specific areas were addressed within the program and will be discussed within this paper. a) Conical theta-pinch IPPT geometry thruster configuration. b) Repetition-rate multi-kW thruster pulsing. c) Long-lifetime pulsed gas valve. d) Fast pulsed gas <b>valve</b> <b>driver</b> and controller. e) High-voltage, repetitive capacitor charging power processing unit. During the course of testing, a number of specific tests were conducted, including several that, to our knowledge, have either never been previously conducted (such as multi-KW repetition-rate operation) or have not been performed since the early 1990 s (direct IPPT thrust measurements). 2 Conical theta-pinch IPPT thrust stand measurements are presented in Fig. 1 while various time-integrated and tim...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Attitude Control System (ACS) along with detailed in-flight performance results for each operational mode. The TRMM spacecraft is an Earth-pointed, zero momentum bias satellite launched on November 27, 1997 from Tanegashima Space Center, Japan. TRMM is a joint mission between NASA and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan designed to monitor and study tropical rainfall and the associated release of energy. Launched to provide a validation for poorly known rainfall data sets generated by global climate models, TRMM has demonstrated its utility by reducing uncertainties in global rainfall measurements by a factor of two. The ACS is comprised of Attitude Control Electronics (ACE), an Earth Sensor Assembly (ESA), Digital Sun Sensors (DSS), Inertial Reference Units (IRU), Three Axis Magnetometers (TAM), Coarse Sun Sensors (CSS), Magnetic Torquer Bars (MTB), Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA), Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Drivers</b> (EVD) and thrusters. While in Mission Mode, the ESA provides roll and pitch axis attitude error measurements and the DSS provide yaw updates twice per orbit. In addition, the TAM in combination with the IRU and DSS can be used to provide pointing in a contingency attitude determination mode which does not rely on the ESA. Although the ACS performance to date has been highly successful, lessons were learned during checkout and initial on-orbit operation. This paper describes the design, on-orbit checkout, performance and lessons learned for the TRMM ACS...|$|R

The key developments of the DSA power system effort are five power ASICs and a mod ule for power switching.

40|$|The Dawn {{mission is}} part of NASA's Discovery Program and has as its goal the {{scientific}} exploration {{of the two most}} massive main-belt asteroids, Vesta and Ceres. The Dawn spacecraft was launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on September 27, 2007 on a Delta-II 7925 H- 9. 5 (Delta-II Heavy) rocket that placed the 1218 -kg spacecraft onto an Earth-escape trajectory. On-board the spacecraft is an ion propulsion system (IPS) developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory which will provide a total ?V of 11. 3 km/s for the heliocentric transfer to Vesta, orbit capture at Vesta, transfer between Vesta science orbits, departure and escape from Vesta, heliocentric transfer to Ceres, orbit capture at Ceres, and transfer between Ceres science orbits. Fullpower thrusting from December 2007 through October 2008 was used to successfully target a Mars gravity assist flyby in February 2009 that provided an additional ?V of 2. 6 km/s. Deterministic thrusting for the heliocentric transfer to Vesta resumed in June 2009 and concluded with orbit capture at Vesta on July 16, 2011. An additional 210 hours of IPS thrusting was used to enter the first Vesta science orbit, called Survey orbit, on August 3, 2011 at an altitude of approximately 2, 735 km. To date the IPS has been operated for 23, 621 hours, consumed approximately 252 kg of xenon, and provided a delta-V of approximately 6. 7 km/s. The IPS performance characteristics are very close to the expected performance based on analysis and testing performed pre-launch. The only significant issue in over the almost four years of IPS operations in flight was the temporary failure of a <b>valve</b> <b>driver</b> board in the Digital Control and Interface Unit- 1 (DCIU- 1), resulting in a loss of thrust of approximately 29 hours. Thrusting operations resumed after switching to DCIU- 2, and power cycling conducted after orbit capture restored DCIU- 1 to full functionality. After about three weeks of Survey orbit operations the IPS will be used to transfer the spacecraft to the other planned science orbit altitudes. After approximately one year of science operations the IPS will be used for escape from Vesta and then for thrusting to Ceres with a planned arrival date at Ceres in February 2015. This paper provides an overview of Dawn's mission objectives and the results of Dawn IPS mission operations through the start of science operations at Vesta...|$|E
50|$|The S160's were {{designed}} for quick and efficient building, not long-term operations, thus compromises in design led to some difficulties in operation. The axle-box grease-lubricators were not very efficient, particularly when maintenance procedures lapsed or were delayed for operational war reasons, and so axle-boxes often ran hot. Braking was poor by European standards, with a Westinghouse steam brake used for the locomotive, which was woefully insufficient, due to the long distance from the <b>driver's</b> <b>valve</b> to the brake cylinder.|$|R
50|$|In service, {{some trouble}} was {{experienced}} with transmission shaft joints and with worn cams and rollers. If the valves were set {{with the engine}} cold, {{there appeared to be}} some distortion under working conditions due to the high temperature of superheated steam which caused deterioration of the <b>valve</b> events. <b>Drivers</b> also reported that, when the engines were standing or moving at very slow speed, it was difficult to reverse since the cam rollers were not readily able to climb over the inclined surfaces leading from one cam to another. Trouble was also experienced with steam leaking past the tappet spindles into the cam boxes where it boiled up the oil and caused it to overflow from the cam boxes. This was overcome by serrating the collars of the spindle bushes to allow the steam to escape and prevent entry into the cam boxes.|$|R
50|$|When introduced, these engines {{were up to}} {{date with}} {{contemporary}} locomotive practice. They were superheated, with Belpaire fireboxes. The cylinders were arranged outside the plate frames, with the 10 in diameter outside admission piston valves arranged above the cylinders and actuated by Walschaerts <b>valve</b> gear. The <b>drivers</b> and intermediate coupled wheels were flangeless. The motion, axleboxes and several other details were identical or similar to equivalent parts of the Class 10, which was built {{at the same time}} by the same manufacturer, and their Type XM2 two-axle bogie tenders were identical.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{locomotives}} {{have been fitted}} with emergency flashers {{on the roof of}} the cab, and these flashers are also activated when the brake pipe pressure is lost for any reason other than the driver's application of the brake <b>valve.</b> This alerts <b>drivers</b> of oncoming trains of the possibility of a derailed or parted rake which may foul other tracks (since brake pressure may have been lost for those reasons as well); at the locomotive, it is not possible to tell whether the loss of brake pressure is due to the pulling of the alarm chain.|$|R
50|$|Built by the Merryweather Fire Engine {{company in}} Greenwich, in 1888, the Butler Petrol Cycle (first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term) was a three-wheeled petrol vehicle. The rear wheel was directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four-stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery), equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach), and Ackermann steering, {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle <b>valve</b> lever. The <b>driver</b> was seated between the front wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{release of}} {{compressed}} {{air into the}} brake cylinders is achieved by triple valves, which are themselves controlled by the pressure of air in the train pipe, a pneumatic pipe running {{the length of the}} train. When the driver wishes to make a brake application, he operates the <b>driver’s</b> brake <b>valve</b> which releases some air from the train pipe, so operating the triple <b>valves.</b> When the <b>driver</b> wishes to release the brakes, his operation of the <b>driver’s</b> brake <b>valve</b> returns compressed air (stored in a cylinder near the driving position) into the train pipe and this moves the triple valve so as to release the air in the brake cylinders to atmosphere, allowing the brake blocks to move clear of the wheels. Although, in multiple-unit operation, the air reservoirs on the vehicles can be relatively quickly charged, the restoration of pressure to the train pipe takes some time as air has to travel physically {{down the length of the}} train.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{safety valve}} {{was invented by}} Denis Papin for his steam digester, an early {{pressure}} cooker rather than an engine. A weight acting through a lever held down a circular plug valve in the steam vessel. By using a [...] "steelyard" [...] lever a smaller weight was required, also the pressure could easily be regulated by sliding the same weight back and forth along the lever arm. Papin retained the same design for his 1707 steam pump. Early safety valves were {{regarded as one of}} the engineman's controls and required continuous attention, according to the load on the engine. In a famous early explosion at Greenwich in 1803, one of Trevithick's high-pressure stationary engines exploded when the boy trained to operate the engine left it to catch eels in the river, without first releasing the safety valve from its working load. By 1806, Trevithick was fitting pairs of safety valves, one external <b>valve</b> for the <b>driver's</b> adjustment and one sealed inside the boiler with a fixed weight. This was unadjustable and released at a higher pressure, intended as a guarantee of safety.|$|R
50|$|With {{a service}} brake relay valve installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service brake chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service brake chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay <b>valve.</b> When the <b>driver</b> partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service brake chambers.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to combine {{traditional}} power shovel with electronic elements to establish automatic control system. The power shovel is a hydraulic system. This research investigated the relation between the strokes of three hydraulic cylinders and shovel position. MATLAB software was used to simulate the motion of manipulator. The optimum models for regular moving and evading barrier routes were established. The results were applied to control system. LabVIEW software was used to design the control system. The relations between the strokes of three cylinders and elapsed time while hydraulic valve was opened were investigated. Then we can control shovel position by varying these elapsed times. Hardware configuration of control system provides the channel for communication between PC and control <b>valve</b> <b>drivers.</b> It consists of data acquisition card, I/O card, and PLC. The PC handles signal transformation, PLC programming, signal magnifying for relays and the settings of flow rate, pressure, direction of control valves. Accordingly, by using elapsed time to control the stroke of cylinder obtained unsatisfactory result. Therefore, to improve this problem will be the future study. 本研究以PC為基礎，結合田間作業挖土機與電子訊號構件，建立自動控制系統。此挖土機的動力來自油壓設備，主要著重在三組油壓缸行程與作業手臂動作定位關係。首先使用MATLAB軟體模擬機構動作，探討移動路徑與障礙物規避之最佳化模式，進而應用在控制部分，由LabVIEW圖控軟體設計完成：行程－時間關係量測與計時控制介面，以時間控制三缸的行程變化。 控制系統硬體架構負責PC與油壓驅動器的訊號傳遞，包含資料擷取卡、I/O卡、PLC等，其中輸入輸出訊號轉換、PLC動作規劃、繼電器信號放大及各式控制閥流量、壓力、方向的設定均由PC控制。 實驗結果顯示控制油壓缸行程進行定位作業效果不甚理想，更精確的定位方法有待開發。目錄 摘要I ABSTRACTII 目錄III 圖目錄IV 表目錄V 第一章 前言 1 1. 1 研究動機 1 1. 2 研究目的 2 第二章 文獻探討 3 2. 1 機械手臂 3 2. 2 圖控軟體與應用 5 第三章 理論分析 7 3. 1 機器人反運動學理論公式之推導 7 3. 1. 1 Denavit-Hartenberg(D-H) 參數的表示 7 3. 1. 2 參考座標系統之建立 9 3. 1. 3 不同座標間之連桿轉換矩陣 9 3. 1. 4 運動學公式之推導 10 3. 1. 5 鏟斗末端反運動式之推導 13 3. 1. 6 各關節角與其對應油壓缸行程之關係式推導 18 3. 2 最佳化路徑模式之建立 27 3. 3 閃避障礙物模式之建立 30 第四章 實驗設備與方法 34 4. 1 實驗設備 34 4. 1. 1 硬體 34 4. 1. 2 硬體接線說明 41 4. 1. 3 軟體 49 4. 2 實驗方法 49 4. 2. 1 LabVIEW軟體之應用 49 4. 2. 2 訂定不同的工作轉速 50 4. 2. 3 建立活塞行程與時間的關係式 50 4. 2. 4 初步驗證程式可行性 52 4. 2. 5 建立移動路徑資料表 52 第五章 結果與討論 54 5. 1 手臂動作模擬 54 5. 2 最佳化路徑模式 61 5. 3 閃避障礙物模式 67 5. 4 不同工作轉速之行程-時間關係式 73 5. 4. 1 結果分析 74 5. 5 初步試驗結果 77 5. 5. 1 結果分析 79 5. 6 建立固定路徑資料表 87 5. 6. 1 偏差值結果分析 89 5. 6. 2 討論 89 第六章 結論 96 第七章 建議 99 參考文獻 100 圖目錄 圖 3. 1 連桿座標與參數 8 圖 3. 2 挖土手臂之區域座標系統 10 圖 3. 3 挖土手臂之側視 16 圖 3. 4 a 手臂第一部份 18 圖 3. 4 b 第一部份之照片 19 圖 3. 5 a 手臂第二部份 21 圖 3. 5 b 第二部分之照片 21 圖 3. 6 a 手臂第三部份 23 圖 3. 6 b 第三部份之照片 23 圖 3. 7 四連桿機構 24 圖 3. 8 各變數與各點相對位置 31 圖 4. 1 挖土機(YB 10) 34 圖 4. 2 控制箱 36 圖 4. 3 可程式控制器(AXon- 40 MR) 36 圖 4. 4 油壓設備 37 圖 4. 5 DAQ卡(PCI- 6024 E) 37 圖 4. 6 I/O卡(PCL- 730) 38 圖 4. 7 Relay Board(研華PCLD- 785) 39 圖 4. 8 接線盒(CB- 50 Box) 40 圖 4. 9 CB- 50 Box接點功能 40 圖 4. 10 輸入部分接線圖 43 圖 4. 11 輸出部分接線圖 46 圖 4. 12 三缸極限開關 47 圖 4. 13 試驗設備配置示意圖 48 圖 4. 14 冷卻風扇轉速量測 51 圖 4. 15 兩段移動路徑示意 53 圖 5. 1 手臂 2 D 初始位置 54 圖 5. 2 鏟斗運動軌跡 56 圖 5. 3 鏟斗運動模擬使用者介面 57 圖 5. 4 三維鏟斗作動模擬 58 圖 5. 5 a 鏟斗尖端在第二位置(- 52. 15,- 52. 15, 45. 78) 59 圖 5. 5 b 鏟斗尖端在第一位置(- 98. 77,- 57. 02,- 22. 25) 59 圖 5. 5 c 鏟斗尖端回到起始位置(- 47. 66, 0, 127. 69) 60 圖 5. 6 理想路徑 61 圖 5. 7 a 實際路徑(一缸二缸三缸) 62 圖 5. 7 b 實際路徑(三缸二缸一缸) 62 圖 5. 7 c 實際路徑(二缸一缸三缸) 63 圖 5. 8 多點路徑 64 圖 5. 9 不同inst下最佳化路徑 68 圖 5. 10 不同 下最佳化路徑 70 圖 5. 11 不同轉速下最佳化路徑 72 圖 5. 12 LabVIEW程式：前置面板 73 圖 5. 13 時間－行程關係(1200 rpm) 75 圖 5. 14 時間－行程關係(1500 rpm) 76 圖 5. 15 時間－行程關係(2000 rpm) 77 圖 5. 16 油壓缸驅動程式 78 圖 5. 17 三轉速下各點定位分布情形 80 圖 5. 18 第一缸行程 82 圖 5. 19 第二缸行程 84 圖 5. 20 第三缸行程 85 圖 5. 21 三點精準度分布 86 圖 5. 22 5 條路徑模擬之情形 88 表目錄 表 3. 1 挖土手臂各區域座標系統之連桿參數表 11 表 3. 2 各連桿尺寸參數值 17 表 3. 3 油壓缸伸縮距離 17 表 4. 1 YB 10 規格表 35 表 4. 2 TM- 4010 規格 35 表 5. 1 各點間行程變化值 65 表 5. 2 各轉速不同點數耗費之時間 66 表 5. 3 不同inst下最佳值 69 表 5. 4 不同 下最佳值 71 表 5. 5 不同rspeed下最佳值 71 表 5. 6 不同轉速定位數據 79 表 5. 7 路徑第一部份 90 表 5. 8 路徑第二部份 9...|$|R
5000|$|The 431-cubic-inch {{displacement}} 1938-40 Cadillac V16 {{was one of}} {{the last}} new American auto engine designs prior to World War Two. As such, it incorporated some of the latest thinking. Nine main bearings provided a crankshaft main bearing support between each 135 degree opposing pair of cylinders. The square bore and stroke lowered piston speed and promoted crankshaft rigidity, no small matter for an engine with eight cylinders in line per cylinder bank. The side valve engine design was no handicap for the time because the era's typical top engine speed of 3400-3700 rpm provided little opportunity to exploit the high speed breathing efficiency of overhead <b>valves.</b> Luxury car <b>drivers</b> presumably valued smoothness and silence more than high speed power. Hydraulic valve lifters promoted silent running and an absence of periodic adjustment. Unlike most cars of the era, an external oil filter safeguarded the precision valve lifters. Despite the use of side valves, the engine produced as much power as the prior 45 degree V16, and with much less complexity. The earliest engines produced featured an innovative friction wheel drive to the generator. This was soon replaced by a conventional V belt drive. Cadillac claimed that the 1938, 1939, and 1940 Series 90 Sixteen had the best performance of any production car in the world at the time and would accelerate 10-60 in high gear only in 16 seconds. The definitive engineering report on the 135 degree Cadillac V16 engine is [...] "The Evolution of the Cadillac Sixteen engine," [...] by E.W. Seaholm, in charge of Cadillac engine design. It was published by the industry journal [...] "Automotive Industries," [...] November 27, 1937.|$|R
