5|$|The IFC {{is governed}} by its Board of Governors which meets {{annually}} and consists of one governor per member country (most often the country's finance minister or treasury secretary). Each member typically appoints one governor and also one alternate. Although corporate authority rests with the Board of Governors, the governors delegate most of their corporate powers and their authority over daily matters such as lending and business operations to the Board of Directors.

The executive directors collectively represent all 184 member countries. When the IFC's Board of Directors votes on matters brought before it, each executive director's vote is weighted according to the total share capital of the member countries represented by that director. The IFC's Executive <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> CEO oversees its overall direction and daily operations.
