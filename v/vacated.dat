40|$|In present {{days the}} {{wireless}} communications are widely increases {{because of this}} reason spectrum utilization can be rapidly increased. For efficient usage of spectrum we can implement the <b>Vacate</b> on demand algorithm in different networks. CR users also need to sense the spectrum and <b>vacate</b> the channel upon the detection of the PU‟s presence to protectPUs from harmful interference. To achieve these fundamental CR functions, CR users usually coordinate with each other by using a common medium for control message exchange ensuring a priority of PUs over CR users. This paper presents the <b>Vacate</b> on Demand (VD) algorithm which enables dynamic spectrum access and ensures to <b>vacate</b> the assigned channel in case of PU activity and move the CR user to some other vacant channel to make spectrum available to PUs {{as well as to}} CR users. The basic idea is to use a ranking table of the available channels based on the PU activity detected on each channel. To improve the spectrum efficiency we can implement the <b>Vacate</b> on demand algorithm in MANET Network...|$|R
