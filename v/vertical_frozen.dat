They share overlapping clinical and histopathologic findings. The {{goal of this}} dissertation has been to fmd reliably distinguishing features between these two conditions. Toward this goal, three different studies were conducted. Study 1 was a retrospective cross-sectional data analytic review of histologic features from patients identified by diagnosis of LPP or CCCA. Horizontal sections at level of the infundibulum, isthmus and inferior from scalp biopsies of 24 patients (19 CCCA and 5 LPP) were analyzed. The findings of unaffected follicular units, retained sebaceous glands and mild perifollicular inflammation were found to favor the diagnosis of CCCA. Dilated eccrine glands and heavy perifollicular inflammation were found to favor the diagnosis of LPP. Study 2 was a prospective cross-sectional data analysis study designed to identify and compare direct immunohistochemical findings in patients with LPP or CCCA. <b>Vertical</b> <b>frozen</b> sections of scalp biopsies from eleven patients (4 CCCA and 7 LPP) were stained with IgG, IgA, IgM, C 3 and fibrinogen. No DIF finding that reliably distinguishes LPP from CCCA was found. The presence of a positive DIF was significantly correlated {{with the amount of}} inflammation. Study 3 investigated and compared T lymphocyte subsets, including T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, Th 17 lymphocytes and regulatory T cells between LPP and CCCA cases. Subjects in this study were identical to study 2. There were no significantly distinctive T lymphocyte populations that differentiate between CCCA and LPP. There were higher numbers and percentages of CD 8 positive cells in LPP compared to CCCA. The CD 4 :CD 8 ratios were decreased in LPP and increased with duration of disease approaching proportions found in the normal hair follicle and CCCA. There were higher CD 1 a:CD 3 ratios in LPP compared to CCCA. The CD 1 a:CD 3 ratios in LPP decrease over time, approaching those found in CCCA. Results of this study confirm role of Langerhans cells as antigen presenting cells and role of cytotoxic lymphocytes in pathogenesis of LPP in early disease. Th 17 lymphocytes and Tregs may have a role in both CCCA and LPP...|$|E

Skin specimens were taken 24 hours after the last exposure. Six hours prior to sacrifice, 40 μCi of tritiated thymidine was injected intradermally at each site irradiated. <b>Frozen</b> <b>vertical</b> sections and split epidermal sheets were incubated for the dopa reaction and then processed with auto-radiographic labeling technique. The uptake of tritiated thymidine by epidermal melanocytes was seen in the autoradiograms using vertical sections but not in those using split epidermal sheets. Cell counts revealed that approximately 1. 1 per cent of dopa-positive melanocytes were labeled. It seems unlikely, based on our results, that the populational increase in melanocytes during repeated ultraviolet radiation is due exclusively to the proliferation of melanocytes. Accordingly, it would suggest that the increase in melanocytes is induced through activation of pigment formation in inactive melanocytes or another possible mechanism as yet undemonstrated in addition to the proliferation of melanocytes...|$|R
40|$|Global {{precipitation}} measurements from space-based radars {{and microwave}} radiometers {{have been the}} subject of numerous studies during the past decade. Rainfall retrievals over land from spaceborne microwave radiometers depend mainly on scattering from frozen hydrometeors. Unfortunately, the relationship between frozen hydrometeors and rainfall varies considerably. The large field of view and related beam filling of microwave radiometer footprints introduce additional difficulties. Some of these problems will be addressed by the improved sensors that will be placed on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core satellite. Two shuttle missions demonstrated that X-band synthetic aperture radar (X-SAR) could observe rainfall over land. Several X-band SARs that can provide such measurements will be launched in the coming decade. These include four Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean Basin Observations (COSMO-SkyMed), two TerraSAR-X, and a fifth Korea Multipurpose Satellite (KOMPSAT- 5) to be launched by the Italian, German, and Korean Space Agencies, respectively. Data from these satellites could augment the information available to the GPM science community. The present study presents computations of normalized radar cross sections (NRCS) that employed a simple, idealized two-layer cloud model that contained both rain and frozen hydrometeors. The modeled spatial distributions of these hydrometeors varied with height and horizontal distance. An exploratory algorithm was developed to retrieve the shape, width, and simple representations of the <b>vertical</b> profiles of <b>frozen</b> hydrometeors and rain from modeled NRCS scans. A discussion of uncertainties in the retrieval is presented...|$|R
40|$|Friction {{is one of}} the key {{phenomena}} {{during the}} interaction of ice with offshore structures and ships, ice rafting and ridging processes, and the brittle compressive failure of ice. Therefore, knowledge of the ice friction laws and a better understanding of this phenomenon are needed for the design of safe and reliable offshore structures and successful operations in ice-infested waters. This thesis presents experimental studies on ice friction in the field and in the laboratory and can be divided into three parts: field study of ice friction and the effects of different parameters on the kinetic and static friction coefficients; investigation of geometrical stick-slip interaction between ice and stainless steel in small-scale laboratory tests; field investigation of the vertical ice forces exerted on isolated <b>vertical</b> piles <b>frozen</b> in a level sea due to changes in the water level. The first version of the experimental setup for the field tests to study ice friction was relatively simple and was used only in 2010. Significant modifications and improvements were made to the setup in 2011 that allowed us to better control the test conditions (i. e., velocity, normal load). The available range of sliding velocities (between 6 mm s - 1 and 43 mm s - 1) did not cover the whole range of our interest. Therefore, a new pulling mechanism was introduced in the tests in 2012 that allowed us to extend the sliding range up to 110 mm s- 1. The field experiments were conducted with first year sea ice in the Barents Sea and in fjords at Spitsbergen during three springs (2010 - 2012). In September of 2012, the ice friction tests were performed with multiyear sea ice northeast of Greenland. Most of the tests were performed to investigate the friction between sea ice and sea ice, while the rest were to study the friction between sea ice and corroded steel. The aim of the study was to survey the most important factors that affect ice friction in field conditions and to determine whether the existing friction models correctly predict the dependences observed in the field tests. The effects of the sliding velocity (6 mm s - 1 to 105 mm s - 1), air temperatures (- 2 °C to - 20 °C), normal load (300 N to 2000 N), presence of sea water in the interface, and ice grain orientation with respect to the sliding direction on the friction coefficient were investigated. The effect of the hold time on the static friction coefficient was also studied. The test campaigns showed that ice surface roughness is likely to be the most important parameter in determining the friction coefficient. Repeated sliding over the same track led to surface polishing and decreased the kinetic friction coefficient from 0. 48 to 0. 05. When sliding occurs between unsmoothed surfaces, the friction coefficient was found to be independent of the sliding velocity. As the contacting surfaces become smoother, the kinetic friction coefficient begins to depend on the velocity, as predicted by existing ice friction models. Some attempts were made to characterise ice surface irregularities and real contact area using two techniques: 1) the production of an ice surface cast and its further analysis using an optical microscope and 2) measurements of the pressure distribution and real contact area using tactile sensors. The static friction coefficient increases logarithmically with the hold time and changes from approximately 0. 6 at 5 s to 1. 26 at 960 s. The small-scale laboratory studies on the stick-slip interaction between ice and stainless steel were performed at the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS). A specially designed device allowed us to study the effect of well controlled steel surface roughness on the interaction between ice and steel under various test conditions. The effects of the relative sliding rate (1. 67 × 10 - 6 m s - 1 to 0. 83 × 10 - 3 m s - 1), temperature (- 5 °C to - 25 °C) and applied constant pushing force were also investigated. Stick-slip interaction was always observed in the tests on samples with an arithmetic average roughness (Ra) between 2 μm and 15 μm. Both steady state sliding and stick-slip were observed in the tests on samples with the lowest (Ra = 2 μm) and the highest (Ra = 25. 2 μm) roughness. The slip distance was found to be equal to the mean pitch profile (mean profile wavelength) for all velocities studied. The elasticity of the ice was found to be an important factor in the stick-slip interaction. The field studies of the vertical ice forces exerted on isolated <b>vertical</b> piles <b>frozen</b> in the ice were performed in Svea, Spitsbergen, in March of 2010. Four different piles made of steel and aluminium were used in the experiments. The piles were pushed through the ice using a hydraulic jack. The first peak load measured in the tests is associated with the onset of the ice-pile relative movement. Because we always observed failure at or very near the ice-pile interface, the first peak load can be treated as the strength of adhesion or the cohesive failure of ice in the vicinity of the interface. Elastic plate theory was used to estimate theoretically the vertical forces exerted on a pile. PhD i bygg, anlegg og transportPhD in Civil and Transport Engineerin...|$|R
