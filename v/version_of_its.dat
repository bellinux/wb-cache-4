5|$|Designing {{reversible}} {{rules for}} block cellular automata, and {{determining whether a}} given rule is reversible, is easy: for a block cellular automaton to be reversible it is necessary and sufficient that the transformation applied to the individual blocks at {{each step of the}} automaton is itself reversible. When a block cellular automaton is reversible, the time-reversed <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> dynamics can also be described as a block cellular automaton with the same block structure, using a time-reversed sequence of partitions of cells into blocks, and with the transition function for each block being the inverse function of the original rule.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 both Volvo and Saab {{introduced}} to the Sweden market their flexifuel models. Saab began selling its 9-5 2.0 Biopower, joined in 2006 by its 9-5 2.3 Biopower. Volvo introduced its S40 and V50 with flexible-fuel engines, joined in late 2006 by the new C30. All Volvo models were initially restricted to the Sweden market, until 2007, when these three models were launched in eight new European markets. In 2007, Saab also started selling a BioPower <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> popular Saab 9-3 line. In 2008 the Saab-derived Cadillac BLS was introduced with E85 compatible engines, and Volvo launched the V70 with a 2.5-litre turbocharged Flexifuel engine.|$|E

5|$|The game runs on an {{upgraded}} version of Valve's proprietary Source engine, and features both the engine's advanced lighting effects, {{and a new}} <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> facial animation/expression technology. Upgrades to enemy AI allow Combine soldiers to utilize tactics previously unavailable to them. For example, Combine soldiers were given the ability to crouch while being fired upon in order to duck underneath the player's line of fire. The game's soundtrack was composed by Kelly Bailey. The music is used sparingly throughout; it plays primarily during scenes of major plot developments or particularly important action sequences such as large battles or when encountering a new enemy.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the subway}} system {{operates}} on a 24-hour basis, during late night hours {{some of the}} designated routes do not run, run as a shorter route (often {{referred to as the}} 'shuttle train' <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> full-length counterpart) or run with a different stopping pattern. These are usually indicated by smaller, secondary route signage on station platforms. Because there is no nightly system shutdown for maintenance, tracks and stations must be maintained while the system is operating. This work sometimes necessitates service changes during midday, overnight hours, and weekends.|$|E
5|$|While Burger King still {{utilizes}} a <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> revamped franchising {{system in}} the United States, outside of North America its international locations licenses are still sold on a regional basis with franchises owning exclusive development rights for a region or country.

5|$|As {{a spiritual}} {{successor}} to Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark shares many gameplay similarities with its predecessor and runs on a upgraded <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> engine. The game features a single-player mode that requires players {{to complete a}} series of missions under certain difficulty settings. It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative mode and traditional deathmatch settings. Perfect Dark was developed {{over the course of}} three years and is technically one of the most advanced games for the Nintendo 64, offering an optional high resolution graphics mode, widescreen support, and Dolby's surround sound. A Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is required to access the game's single-player mode and most of the multiplayer features.|$|E

5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} {{were introduced in}} Sweden as a demonstration test in 1994, when three Ford Taurus were imported to show the technology existed. Because of the existing interest, a project was started in 1995 with 50 Ford Taurus E85 flexifuel {{in different parts of}} Sweden: Umeå, Örnsköldsvik, Härnösand, Stockholm, Karlstad, Linköping, and Växjö. From 1997 to 1998 an additional 300 Taurus were imported, and the number of E85 fueling grew to 40. Then in 1998 the city of Stockholm placed an order for 2,000 of FFVs for any car manufacturer willing to produce them. The objective was to jump-start the FFV industry in Sweden. The two domestic car makers Volvo Group and Saab AB refused to participate arguing there were not in place any ethanol filling stations. However, Ford Motor Company took the offer and began importing the flexifuel <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Focus model, delivering the first cars in 2001, and selling more than 15,000 FFV Focus by 2005, then representing an 80% market share of the flexifuel market.|$|E
5|$|In September 1999 the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) {{released}} a provisional calendar for the 2000 season, dropping the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps from the Formula One World Championship due to Belgian tobacco-advertising laws which threatened {{to cancel the}} race; several teams had tobacco sponsorship. The FIA had the revived Dutch Grand Prix at the Circuit Park Zandvoort and the Portuguese Grand Prix at the Autódromo do Estoril as alternatives if the Belgian Grand Prix was cancelled. The dispute was resolved when the Belgian government exempted the race from the advertising law, and it was reinstated at the FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Paris on 6 October. Ferrari arrived at the circuit with a lighter, more-powerful <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Tipo 049 V10 engine with for Saturday's qualifying session, returning to the development power plant used at the Hungarian Grand Prix. They also had a revised aerodynamic package.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka, and produced by Tetsuhisa Tsuruzono. Artwork was produced by manga and anime artist Nobuteru Yūki, while the music was composed by Secret of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta. Although the game was only published in Japan, English-speaking players {{have been able to}} play Seiken Densetsu 3 due to an unofficial English fan translation, first released in 2000. Seiken Densetsu 3 received considerable acclaim from reviewers, who praised the graphics as among the best ever made for the Super Famicom and the gameplay as an improved <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> predecessor's. The plot received mixed reviews by critics, who found the overlapping stories to be interesting and to enhance replayability, but the characters and plotlines themselves to be flat and clichéd. Overall, the game is considered by some critics to be a Super Famicom classic {{and one of the best}} role-playing games of the 16-bit era.|$|E
