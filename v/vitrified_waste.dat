40|$|Durable {{phosphate}} {{glasses were}} formed by <b>vitrifying</b> <b>waste</b> filter cakes from two metal finishing operations. Some melts formed crystalline components during cooling. Compositional analysis of dried, heat treated and vitrified samples was made using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, inductively-coupled plasma spectroscopy and Leco induction furnace combustion analysis. Hydrolytic dissolution, measured by an adapted product consistency test, was reduced {{by up to}} 3 orders of magnitude upon heat treatment or vitrification, surpassing the performance of borosilicate glass in some cases. This was attributed to {{the high levels of}} iron and zinc in the wastes, which greatly improve the durability of phosphate glasses. One of the wastes arose from a metal phosphating process and was particularly suitable for vitrification due to its high P 2 O 5 content and favourable melting behaviour. The other waste, which arose from a number of processes, was less suitable as it had a low P 2 O 5 content and during heating it emitted harmful corrosive gases and underwent violent reactions. Substantial volume reductions were obtained by heat treatment and vitrification of both wastes.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} to test the stability of vitrified municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator bottom ash under the presence of bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and plants (corn). The substratum used for the plant growth was a humus-rich soil mixed with <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste.</b> For the first time, information on the stability of waste glasses {{in the presence of}} bacteria and plants is given. Results show that inoculated plant samples contained always about two times higher lanthanide and actinide element concentrations. Bacteria support the element transfer since plants growing in inoculated environment developed a smaller root system but have higher trace element concentrations. Compared with the substratum, plants are light rare earth element (LREE) enriched. The vitrified bottom ash has to some extent been corroded by bacteria and plant activities as indicated by the presence of Nd (REE) and Sr from the <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste</b> in the plants. (87) Sr/(86) Sr and (143) Nd/(144) Nd isotope ratios of plants and soil components allow the identification of the corroded soil components and confirm that bacteria accelerate the assimilation of elements from the vitrified bottom ash.

40|$|International audienceManagement of {{domestic}} wastes often relies on incineration, {{a process that}} eliminates large amount of wastes but also produces toxic residues that concentrate heavy metals. Those hazardous secondary wastes require specific treatment. Vitrification {{is seen as a}} powerful way to stabilise them. However, concern exists about the long term behaviour of these glass wastes and the potential release of toxic species into the environment. The answers will come with further investigation into the physico-chemical evolution of the <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> and the mobility of hazardous elements within the matrix with appropriate analytical methods. Laser ablation coupled with inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a challenging technique for the chemical analysis of trace elements in solid materials. This paper presents an evaluation of the potential of LA-ICP-MS for macro and microanalysis of trace metals in domestic <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> with regards to other physical analytical techniques of solids such as scanning electronprobe X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDXS). Two typical samples, vitreous and crystallized, are used to compare the analytical performances of the two techniques.

Relative micro-analysis and bulk quantitative analysis of 30 major, minor and trace elements was performed by LA-ICP-MS: precision was between 10 and 20 % for most elements and quantitative analysis proved possible with an accuracy of 20 % and relative detection limits of 0. 1 mg kg- 1...|$|R

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the feasibility of}} emplacing DOE-owned defense nuclear waste from weapons production into a permanent borehole repository drilled ~ 4 km into granite basement rock. Two canister options were analyzed throughout the report: the canister currently used by the DOE for vitrified defense waste and a reference canister with a smaller diameter. In a thermal analysis, the maximum temperatures attained by the rock surrounding the waste, waste form, canister, liner, and gaps during the post-emplacement period were calculated. From this data, simple analytic equations were formed {{that can be used}} to calculate the maximum temperature differences for both defense waste and spent fuel when one does not want to repeat the analysis. Canister corrosion and waste form dissolution analyses were performed using Pourbaix diagrams. Finally, the cost and time for drilling the borehole and emplacing the defense waste were calculated. The temperature change in the granite is 15. 1 ¬∞C for the reference canister and 45. 7 ¬∞C for the DOE Canister. The resulting maximum temperature at the bottom of the borehole is 135. 1 ¬∞C (reference canister) and 165. 7 ¬∞C (DOE canister) for the bounding defense waste. The centerline temperature for the borosilicate glass waste package is approximately 150 ¬∞C for the reference canister and 207 ¬∞C for the DOE canister. Because of the thermodynamic properties, overall corrosion resistance, and reasonable cost, pure copper was shown to be the best borehole outer canister material. High-chromium stainless steel could also be a good option for borehole canisters because it has been shown to be highly corrosion-resistant in environments similar to predicted borehole environments. Cesium ion was found to have the highest concentration in the borehole environment. However, the relatively low half life of the most abundant cesium isotope suggests that the cesium would decay before the canister is breached. For the reference canister, the drilling and emplacement costs are not expected to exceed $ 46 /kg of <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste</b> and the total disposal cost was found to be $ 153 /kg of <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste.</b> The total cost of disposal of defense waste in DOE containers is not expected to exceed $ 53 /kg of <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste.</b> Based on these analyses, disposal of vitrified defense waste in deep boreholes is expected to be technically and economically feasible.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{evaluate}} the final forms that have been proposed for radioactive-containing solid wastes and to determine their application to the solid wastes that will result from the treatment of newly generated liquid low-level waste (NGLLLW) and Melton Valley Storage Tank (MVST) supernate at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Since cesium and strontium are the predominant radionuclides in NGLLLW and MVST supernate, this review {{is focused on the}} stabilization and solidification of solid wastes containing these radionuclides in cement, glass, and polymeric materials-the principal waste forms that have been tested with these types of wastes. Several studies have shown that both cesium and strontium are leached by distilled water from solidified cement, although the leachabilities of cesium are generally higher than those of strontium under similar conditions. The situation is exacerbated by the presence of sulfates in the solution, as manifested by cracking of the grout. Additives such as bentonite, blast-furnace slag, fly ash, montmorillonite, pottery clay, silica, and zeolites generally decrease the cesium and strontium release rates. Longer cement curing times (> 28 d) and high ionic strengths of the leachates, such as those that occur in seawater, also decrease the leach rates of these radionuclides. Lower cesium leach rates are observed from <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> than from grout waste forms. However, significant quantities of cesium are volatilized due to the elevated temperatures required to <b>vitrify</b> the <b>waste.</b> Hence, vitrification will generally require the use of cleanup systems for the off-gases to prevent their release into the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in fiscal year 1998 by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to evaluate potential incorporation of radionuclides in secondary mineral phases that form from weathering <b>vitrified</b> nuclear <b>waste</b> glasses.

Chemical weathering of LD 6 glass at 90 oC in contact with an aliquot of uncontaminated Hanford Site groundwater resulted in the formation of a Crystalline zeolitic mineral, phillipsite. In contrast similar chemical weathering of SRL 202 glass at 90 "C resulted in the formation of a microcrystalline smectitic mineral, nontronite. A second experiment was conducted at 90 "C to assess the degree to which key radionuclides would be sequestered in the structure of secondary crystalline minerals; namely, phillipsite and nontronite. Chemical weathering of LD 6 in contact with radionuclide-spiked Hanford Site groundwater indicated that substantial ilactions of the total activities were retained in the phillipsite structure. Similar chemical weathering of SRL 202 at 90 "C, also in contact with radionuclide-spiked Hanford Site groundwater, showed that significant fractions of the total activities were retained in the nontronite structure. These results have important implications regarding the radionuclide mobilization aspects of the ILAW-PA.
