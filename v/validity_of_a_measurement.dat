40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this paper}} was to examine the {{reliability}} and <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>measurement</b> device that counters the disadvantages of the traditional method of arm circumference measurements. METHODS: We measured the arm on the non-operated side of breast cancer patients. Sixty-four patients were measured twice by the same assessor and 48 patients were measured twice by two different assessors. The arm circumferences were measured at the olecranon and each 4 cm proximal and distal of the olecranon. The measurements were performed with a self-developed device consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stainless steel bar on which a tapeline was fixed at every 4 cm distance. The arm volume was calculated from the circumference measurements with the frustrum formula and was also measured directly with the water displacement method. RESULTS: For the circumference measurements, intrarater and interrater ICCs ranged between 0. 942 and 0. 998. ICCs for the calculated arm volume were also very high. No systematic changes between the first to the second assessment could be found. The standard error of measurement for the circumference measurements {{as well as for the}} calculated arm volume was low (between 0. 8 % and 2. 0 %). An increase of 1. 0 cm or more of the arm circumference at any measurement side and of 55 ml or more of the calculated arm volume was clinically significant.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} glenohumeral joint laxity and stiffness using instrumented arthrometry. To evaluate the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> instrumented <b>measurement</b> system we compared cutaneous and bone-pinned measures of laxity and stiffness that replicate previously reported in vivo methodology. Characterization of capsular laxity was achieved through determination of the sagittal plane translational area at increasing levels of quantified force. Finally, a method for increasing the objectivity of the standard manual laxity examination was developed for the orthopaedic clinician to quantify humeral head translation and capsular volume in vivo. We hypothesized that: 1) cutaneous measures could accurately predict bone-pinned measures, 2) capsular laxity would increase with increasing levels of applied force, and 3) manual cutaneous, manual bone-pinned, and force-displacement bone-pinned measures of translation would be equal. Thirty fresh frozen cadaveric shoulder specimens (mean age= 70 ± 14 years) were tested. The shoulders were thawed and mounted to a custom-made shoulder-testing apparatus. Displacement was measured using an electromagnetic tracking system. Sensors were secured cutaneously and with bone-pins to the scapula and humerus. Force-displacement testing was performed using a load applicator and manual displacement testing utilized the anterior/posterior drawer and inferior sulcus tests. <b>A</b> comparison <b>of</b> cutaneous and bone-pinned measures of laxity and stiffness revealed good to excellent criterion validity (r= 0. 68 to 0. 79). Examination of displacement measures at increasing levels of force revealed increasing capsular laxity with symmetric directional compliance. No significant difference was observed between anterior and posterior translation (0. 4 mm, p=. 55), with significant differences between inferior and anterior (4. 6 mm, p<. 0001) and between inferior and posterior (5. 1 mm, p<. 0001). <b>A</b> comparison <b>of</b> manual cutaneous to bone-pinned manual and kinetic measures <b>of</b> translation revealed <b>a</b> significant difference between methods (p=. 0024) and between directions (p<. 0001) with no significant interaction (p=. 0948).

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the reliability and <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> newly developed <b>measurement</b> tool for dental gagging: the Gagging Problem Assessment (GPA). An experimental group (n = 13) comprising individuals with gagging problems, and a control group (n = 12) that had received dental care without gagging, completed a questionnaire focused on general health aspects and dental anxiety and the patient part of the GPA. The dentist part consisted of tests with increasing intrusiveness. This part was completed by two dentists. Statistical analyses concerned inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa), reliability of the questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha, Pearson correlation coefficient) and the statistical difference between the GPA and two dental anxiety questionnaires (Mann-Whitney U-test, alpha = 0. 05).

For those reasons, being able to assess the quality of an analytical method is far more than a statistical challenge; it's a matter of ethic and good business practices. The validity of an analytical method must be assessed at two levels. The “pre-study” validation aims at proving, by an appropriate set of designed experiments, that the method is able to achieve its objectives.

A crucial point is also to ensure that the decisions taken at the pre-study stage and in routine are compatible.

40|$|In {{industry}} and in laboratories, {{it is crucial}} to continuously control the validity of the analytical methods used to follow the products' quality characteristics. Validity must be assessed at two levels. The 'pre-study' validation aims at demonstrating be re use that the method will be able to achieve its objectives. The 'in-study' validation is intended to verify, by inserting quality control (QC) samples in routine runs, that the method remains valid over time. At these two levels, the analytical method will be claimed valid if it is possible to prove that a sufficient proportion of analytical results is expected to lie within given acceptance limits [-lambda, lambda] around the nominal value. This paper presents and compares four approaches to checking the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>measurement</b> method at the pre-study level. They can be classified into two categories. In the first, a lower confidence bound for the estimated probability pi of a result lying within the acceptance limits is computed and compared with a given acceptance level.

Two approaches are then proposed to derive the confidence bound: the asymptotic maximum likelihood approach and a method proposed by Mee (Commun. Stat. Theory Methods 1988; 17 (5) : 1465 - 1479). The second category of approaches checks whether a tolerance interval for hypothetical future measurements ties within the predefined acceptance limits [-lambda, lambda]. beta-expectation and beta-gamma-content tolerance intervals are investigated and compared in this context. These four approaches are illustrated on a bioanalytical HPLC-UV analytical process and compared through simulations. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|In {{industries}} that involve either chemistry or biology, analytical methods {{are necessary to}} keep an eye on all the material produced. If the quality of an analytical method is doubtful, then the whole set of decisions based on those measures is questionable. For this reason, being able to assess the quality of an analytical method is far more than a statistical challenge; it is a matter of ethics and good business practices. The validity of an analytical method must be assessed at two levels. The "pre-study" validation aims to show, by an appropriate set of designed experiments, that the method is able to achieve its objectives. The "in-study" validation is intended to verify, by inserting QC samples in routine runs, that the method remains valid over time. At these two levels, the total error approach considers a method as valid if a sufficient proportion of analytical results are expected to lie in a given interval around the (unknown) nominal value. This paper discusses two methods, based on this total error concept, of checking the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>measurement</b> method at the pre-study level. The first checks whether a tolerance interval for hypothetical future measurements lies within given acceptance limits; the second calculates the probability of a result lying within these limits and computes, whether it is greater than a given acceptance level. For the "in-study" validation, the paper assesses the properties of the s-n-lambda rule recommended by the FDA. The properties and respective advantages and limitations of these methods are investigated. A crucial point is to ensure that the decisions taken at the pre-study stage and in routine use are coherent. More precisely, a laboratory should not see its method rejected in routine use when it has been proved to be valid and remains so. This paper shows how this goal may be achieved by choosing compatible validation parameters at both pre- and in-study levels. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the reliability and <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new pain <b>measurement</b> tool, Pictorial Representation of Pain (PRP), in order to determine its ability to measure the intensity of pain and burden of pain for patients in Emergency Department (ED). Methods: Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self Measure (PRISM) has been used as a tool in psychiatric interviews in order to determine the burden <b>of</b> <b>an</b> illness. With modification, a new software named PRP was developed for use in Akdeniz University Hospital ED (Antalya, Turkey). Patients presented to the ED with acute pain were enrolled into the study. Study patients were asked to rate their pain levels at 0, 1, 30, 31, 60 and 61 minutes with PRP and a verbal descriptive scale in order to determine the minimum clinically significant difference. Results: <b>A</b> total <b>of</b> 246 patients were included into the study with mean age of 40. 6 ± 15. 4. Eighty seven (35 %) were men. The correlation coefficient between PRP scores one minute apart were 0. 95 (95 % CI: 0. 94 to 0. 96), 0. 95 (95 % CI: 0. 93 to 0. 96) and 0. 98 (95 % CI: 0. 83 to 0. 99) at the three preset time (0 min, 30 min, 60 min) respectively. And the overall correlation coefficient was 0. 96 (95 % CI: 0. 96 to 0. 97). The minimum clinically significant change in pain was 28. 7 mm (95 % CI: 27 to 30) with <b>a</b> median <b>of</b> 28 mm (IQR: 23 - 34, 95 % CI: 26 to 30). Conclusions: PRP could be considered as a reliable and consistent tool for measuring the intensity of pain. However, further studies are needed to determine the use of PRP in measuring burden of pain...|$|R
40|$|Effectively {{integrating}} {{technology into}} classroom instruction presents teachers with several dilemmas about {{their understanding of}} how students learn, their approach to designing learning activities, and their conceptualization of their role as teachers (Windschitl, 2002). Using the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model (Koehler 2 ̆ 6 Mishra, 2005, 2009; Mishra 2 ̆ 6 Koehler, 2006) as the conceptual model undergirding the research, {{this study was designed}} to build evidence towards establishing the <b>validity</b> and reliability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>measurement</b> instrument employed to assess the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge teachers utilize, as well as gain <b>an</b> understanding <b>of</b> how this knowledge is affected by teacher beliefs about technology use in classroom practice. Three contextual factors were also investigated, namely leadership support for technology, teaching self-efficacy, and traditional beliefs about children. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was selected for analyzing data gathered in this research design. The relationships among four latent factors and three latent variables were examined using measurement models to determine a final structural model. Results (N = 75) suggest that the TPACK-deep scale has potential as <b>a</b> measure <b>of</b> teachers’ beliefs about their technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge. The findings yielded by the present exploratory study pertain to Design, Exertion, Ethics, and Proficiency—which are considered the four factors of the TPACK-deep scale (Kabakci-Yurdakul et al., 2012). Furthermore, this study’s findings indicate positive predictive relationships between leadership support for technology and teachers’ beliefs about using technology in their classrooms. While positive predictive relationships between teachers’ teaching self-efficacy and their beliefs about technology integration in classroom practice were found, no statistically significant association between teachers’ beliefs about using technology and their traditional beliefs about children could be established for three (Design, Exertion, Ethics) of the four TPACK-deep factors under investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for drug evaluation in rare diseases is the often heterogeneous course of these diseases. Traditional outcome measures may not be applicable for all patients, {{when they are in}} different stages of their disease. For instance, in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, the Six Minute Walk Test is often used to evaluate potential new treatments, whereas this outcome is irrelevant for patients who are already in <b>a</b> wheelchair. <b>A</b> <b>measurement</b> instrument such as Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) can evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intervention on an individual basis, and may be able to include patients even when they are in different stages of their disease. It allows patients to set individual goals, together with their treating professional. However, the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> GAS as <b>a</b> <b>measurement</b> instrument in drug studies has never been systematically reviewed. Therefore, we have performed a systematic review to answer two questions: 1. Has GAS been used as <b>a</b> <b>measurement</b> instrument in drug studies? 2 : What is known <b>of</b> the <b>validity,</b> responsiveness and inter- and intra-rater reliability of GAS, particularly in drug trials? Methods We set up a sensitive search that yielded 3818 abstracts. After careful screening, data-extraction was executed for 58 selected articles. Results Of the 58 selected articles, 38 articles described drug studies where GAS was used as an outcome measure, and 20 articles described measurement properties of GAS in other settings. The results show that validity, responsiveness and reliability of GAS in drug studies have hardly been investigated. The quality of the reporting <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> in studies in which GAS was used to evaluate a non-drug intervention also leaves much room for improvement. Conclusions We conclude that there is insufficient information to assess the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> GAS, due to the poor quality <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> studies. Therefore, we think that GAS needs further validation in drug studies, especially since GAS can be a potential solution when a small heterogeneous patient group is all there is to test a promising new drug. Trial registration The protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO international prospective register for systematic reviews, with registration number CRD 42014010619. [URL]...|$|R
