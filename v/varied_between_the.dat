5|$|M-18 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the traffic volumes along the roads under its jurisdiction using a measurement called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This is a metric for the level of traffic along a roadway segment for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT calculated that 14,017vehicles used the section of M-18 along the M-61 concurrency, the highest traffic levels along M-18. The lowest AADT was found along the highway in Crawford County in the 2009 surveys. Commercial traffic <b>varied</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 50trucks daily in Crawford County and the 214trucks a day north of Gladwin. No section of M-18 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|M-72 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all {{other parts of the}} state trunkline highway system. As a part of its maintenance duties, the department tracks the traffic volumes along its roads using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This figure is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, the MDOT surveys found that the highest traffic levels along M-72 were the 33,720vehicles per day in Traverse City. The lowest AADT was 807vehicles near Hubbard Lake Road in Alcona County near Lincoln. Commercial traffic <b>varied</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 555trucks a day in Graylling and the 72trucks daily west of Harrisville. M-72 has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) between the intersection of Division Street and Grandview Parkway in Traverse City and the southern junction with BL I-75 in Grayling. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's defense, mobility and economy. In addition to the NHS listing, M-72 has been included on the Lake Michigan Circle Tour along its segments concurrent with M-22 and US31 in the Traverse City area.|$|E

Opinions of objectives <b>varied</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> coastal city of Caesarea and Jerusalem. Abu Ubaidah could see the importance of both these cities, which had resisted all Muslim attempts at capture. Unable {{to decide on the}} matter, he wrote to Caliph Umar [...] for instructions.

500|$|The Ekaterina II-class {{ships were}} {{originally}} designed with a short, heavily armored, central citadel, {{but this was}} changed during construction to a full waterline belt. The three older ships used compound armor imported from Charles Cammell of the United Kingdom. The maximum thickness of the belt was 16inches which reduced, in [...] steps, to eight inches at the bow and stern. The belt was [...] high, and tapered down to a thickness of six inches at the bottom edge for the 16-inch plates. The upper [...] of the belt {{was intended to be}} above the waterline, but the ships were overweight and much of the belt was submerged. For example, Ekaterina II only had [...] above the waterline. The central citadel was above the belt, [...] long and [...] high. It had 12-inch sides and was closed off by a [...] forward bulkhead (partition) and a [...] rear bulkhead. The triangular redoubt was [...] high and protected the guns with plates 12inches thick. Sinops redoubt was about [...] shorter to save weight. Armored hoods were fitted over the barbettes to protect the crews from small arms and splinters. Ekaterina IIs was [...] thick, but those of Chesma and Sinop were [...] thick. The 6-inch guns and torpedoes were completely unprotected. The thickness of the conning tower's sides <b>varied</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> ships; it was six inches on Ekaterina II, eight inches on Chesma and nine inches on Sinop.

500|$|Kaze of Beneath The Tangles, however, {{disagreed}} with these interpretations of koi {{and the notion}} that the story was a [...] "bittersweet romance" [...] or [...] "another love story", and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized. Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding, Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukari lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends, a view shared by reviewer Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer. Together through their conversations—in their [...] "garden of words"—they found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery <b>varied</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. According to Kaze, [...] "romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings, but that is not what the story is about". Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship [...] "without needing to cling to each other". However, neither could [...] "learn to walk again" [...] if they continued to isolate themselves {{from the rest of the}} world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen.|$|E
