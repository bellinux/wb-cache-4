Archived tweets from 17 chats occurring from July through November 2016, Twitter profile information, questionnaire responses, and semi-structured interviews with four participants were collected and analyzed. Wenger's (1998) social learning theory served as the theoretical framework, and the four main constructsmeaning, practice, identity, and communitywere used as a lens through which the community interactions were viewed and interpreted. Four broad themes emerged from the data: Sharing, Connecting, Socializing, and Exploring. Participants shared ideas and resources most often. They made connections by interacting with and following others, and they socialized by sharing feelings and identifying with each other, which created a positive social climate. Participants explored new ideas through public reflection and negotiation of meaning very little. Findings revealed that the nature of learning in this environment is personalized and supportive, but there were obstacles to learning, such as the voluntary nature of participation and low levels of perceived efficacy. The Twitter chat structure was found to limit participants' depth of learning.

40|$|Magister Artium (Development Studies) - MA(DVS) Over {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a marked {{convergence}} in thinking regarding the importance of social cash transfers in poverty alleviation. As such, most governments especially in the developing world have began embracing the idea of rolling out various social cash transfers programmes in a bid to address poverty, social exclusion and vulnerability. This study which is predominantly centred on the LEAP social grant programme in Ghana aims at assessing the impact of the programme in alleviating household poverty in rural Ghana, specifically in the Tolon-Kumbungu district of the Northern region. Through a combination of both qualitative and quantitative strategies, the study focuses on unravelling in how far the programme has contributed to improving the livelihoods and general welfare of beneficiary households in the case study area. Using data from structured household questionnaires, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews conducted in two rural communities (Dingoni and Woribogu), the study establishes that the LEAP social grant has a significant positive impact on food consumption, frequency of utilization of healthcare facilities and the school enrolment rate for children aged 6 - 13 years in beneficiary households. However, although hypothesised, no significant impact is observed in relation to the incidence of child labour in the household. Thus, in line with Rawls’ theory of justice, the researcher argues that the LEAP social grant programme is a very useful mechanism for promoting social justice in the Ghanaian society. Despite its successes, the study also uncovers that, the insufficient nature of the cash transfer, irregular payment periods, lack of access to complimentary services and lack of transparency and accountability on the part of payment officials are some key challenges confronting the programme from the perspective of beneficiaries, whilst limited staff capacity, the non availability of training opportunities for staff, inadequate logistical support and no motivation for programme staff and <b>voluntary</b> <b>structures</b> also constitute some key challenges from the institutional perspective. In all, the study recommends that government increases the cash amount and pay transfers regularly, link beneficiaries to existing complimentary services in the district, recruit more staff and provide in-service training opportunities for them, strictly monitor compliance to LEAP conditionalities and ensure transparency and accountability in the payment of transfers to beneficiaries...|$|R

40|$|Forest {{certification}} {{is perhaps}} {{the best example of}} a <b>voluntary</b> governance <b>structure</b> for addressing environmental spillovers. Competing forest certification schemes have evolved. At the global level, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 certification and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification focus on environmental processes and sustainable management of forestland, respectively. Regional/domestic schemes have been started by industry and/or landowners to compete with the FSC system. The main difference between FSC certification and the others is that the FSC relies on regulation by a non-state private regulator, while the others employ a form of self-regulation. In this study, survey data from firms in Canada, the United States and Germany are used to investigate factors that cause firms to prefer and/or choose a particular certification scheme. The findings indicate that market access is an important reason why forest firms certify, but it is an insufficient reason for them to pick the FSC system despite opinion polls that reveal a preference for FSC-style certification. Rather, firms prefer (participate in) FSC certification because they perceive it to confer environmental benefits, while those choosing another certification scheme do so on economic grounds.

40|$|Abstract Large racial inequities {{in health}} care use {{continue}} to be reported, rais-ing concerns about discrimination. Historically, the health system, with its profes-sionally dominated, autonomous, <b>voluntary</b> organizational <b>structure,</b> has presented special challenges to civil rights efforts. De jure racial segregation in the United States {{gave way to a}} period of aggressive litigation and enforcement from 1954 until 1968 and then to the current period of relative inactivity. A combination of factors— declining federal resources and organizational capacity to address more subtle forms of discriminatory practices {{in health care}} settings, increasingly restrictive interpre-tations by the courts, and the lack of any systematic mechanisms for the statistical monitoring of providers—offers little assurance that discrimination does not con-tinue {{to play a role in}} accounting for discrepancies in use. The current rapid trans-formation of health care into integrated delivery systems driven by risk-based financ-ing presents both new opportunities and new threats. Adequate regulation, markets, and management for such systems impose new requirements for comparative sys-tematic statistical assessment of performance. My conclusion illustrates ways that current “report card ” approaches to monitoring performance of such systems could be used to monitor, correct, and build trust in equitable treatment. Large racial inequities in health care use continue to be reported (Rice and Winn 1990; Rice and Winn 1991). Household surveys have docu-mented the racial discrepancies in access to primary care (Blendon et al. 1989; Lieu, Newacheck, and McManus 1993).

40|$|Research PaperAs {{the various}} {{mechanisms}} of fisheries resources management have matured, fishermen increasingly have responded by devising and developing {{different forms of}} collective representation. Within the European Union (EU), Producer's organisation (POs) provide a <b>voluntary</b> organisational <b>structure</b> which has evolved {{since its inception in}} the 1970 s. During the intervening period, POs have become a major institutional force within the EU fisheries sector. Recent research into the PO concept in four countries in the EU found a variety of emphasis and roles adopted by the POs present at each vocation; for example, in some member states POs have become established as key players within the existing resource management system of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) whilst elsewhere their role was more focused upon management of the market. If such organisations are to continue to play a pivotal role in industry representation, it is essential that fishermen's perceptions of the organisational structure are reviewed to ensure their continued support and to assess any predisposition towards possible further evolutionary change. This paper presents the results of one such investigation of the attitudes of a PO membership, that of the Shetland Fish Producers Organisation Ltd (SFPO), to this evolving organisation which represents them. Face to face, in-depth interviews were conducted in an attempt to explore their perceptions and attitudes to membership, along with possible expansion of the resource management role of the POs within the future evolution of the CFP. Analysis used Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and qualitative methods. Whilst the membership's view of the SFPO was found to be positive, some other interesting aspects did emerge, which may have implications for the future evolution of POs. Further resource management powers for POs would, on this evidence, seem to necessitate sensitive and considered implementation and should be only a component part of wider reform of the CFP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{focus of}} the study was on the {{comprehension}} of visual rhetoric in printed health learning visuals by literate and illiterate adults. The broad aim {{of the study was}} to establish whether visual rhetorical codes, which usually perform a strong phatic function, constitute a significant readability barrier in an illiterate adult target group. The literature investigation of the study covered (1) a semiotic perspective of the distinction between visual and verbal texts, (2) visual rhetorical articulation for closed visual texts and (3) the readability of development visuals with the emphasis on health education. The design of the empirical component of the study involved the production of three health education posters with a Tuberculosis theme which were encoded with varying degrees of visual rhetoric taking existing guidelines for the design of development visuals into account. In order to measure the semantic (or literal) and pragmatic (or figurative) comprehension of the visual rhetoric, 300 <b>voluntary,</b> confidential, <b>structured</b> interviews were conducted with clinic patients attending Primary Health Care clinics in the greater Bloemfontein area following the refinement of the test visuals and questionnaires during a pilot phase. The mainly Sesotho speaking and pre-dominantly female study population consisted of 150 literate adult patients (> 21 years of age, 12 years of formal schooling or higher) and 150 illiterate adult patients (> 21 years of age, 6 years of formal schooling or lower and the demonstrated inability to read and understand the full text of an acronym). The working hypotheses of the study, which read that (1) on the semantic level, the comprehension of visual rhetorical codes in a closed visual text does not differ between literate and illiterate adults, and that (2) on the pragmatic level, the comprehension of visual rhetorical codes in a closed visual text differs between literate and illiterate adults, were both accepted following chi-square analysis which tested for independence of the literate and the illiterate study population groups. Flowing from the result obtained, design guidelines for the utilisation of visual rhetorical codes in a development communication context, as well possibilities for further research, were formulated...|$|R

The mission of a volunteer centre is the promotion and support of the voluntary work in the society. The theoretical part of this thesis is focused on the explanation of the basic terms, history and the types of voluntary work. The Czech Voluntary Work Act (zákon o dobrovolnické službě [...] Law No. 198 / 2002 Sb.) which defines the terms as volunteer, <b>voluntary</b> work, <b>structures</b> organizations, that deals with the acreditations of volunteer centres, is also mentioned. This thesis is further dedicated to the types of volunteers from the aspect of motivation, social rank and values.

A concern for a social decline amongst the working classes, in particular a rise in the values of self-interest and focussed on young men, coupled with a concern for the fitness of the British army, largely made up of these young men, led to several influential „moral entrepreneurs” developing early forms of outdoor education to tackle these issues. I will suggest that informal education is again drawing on these early roots in outdoor education to respond to modern social issues concerning young people. I will argue that the meanings and values attached to the organisations involved in these endeavours, state, private and <b>voluntary,</b> and the <b>structure</b> of the activities that were used as the content of their programmes were specific to that Victorian culture in that time and place. However, I will suggest that the organisations and activities have often persisted in some form and are involved in and used as vehicles for personal development today. Sometimes the meanings and values that they hold persist with them despite the cultural changes in the society within which they operate. Sometimes the meanings and values change but the same activities are practised as tradition. These may hold tacit understandings structured in to them that are not necessarily constructive given their current use...|$|R

The experiment utilised the company's {{cable network}} available to 14, 000 subscribers. It {{was a local}} based channel of communication intent on involving local volunteers {{in all aspects of}} programme making and granting them full access to the means of programme production and transmission. The experiment was seen by the cable television industry as a preliminary step towards the fuller exploitation of the cable technology itself. The research presented here, carried out between 1972 and 1975, examines the history of the industry whose growth has long been contained by private and public interests. Interviews with volunteers and salaried staff were the main sources of information on the extent of participation in the medium, the production (by volunteers) of programmes and the development of the experiment. The information confirmed the variety of forms that participation could take ranging from helping out to making entire programmes and the low level of participation in the experiment as a whole. A small number of volunteers did, however, become heavily involved in all stages of programme production and took on special responsibilities for both entire programmes and other <b>voluntary</b> participants. A <b>structure</b> {{similar to that of the}} mass media thus evolved where none had been intended. Surveys of local residents and of local voluntary associations highlighted the low level of participation in both programme making and viewing despite knowledge of the channel's existence. Ceblevision partially succeeded in its aims to involve and interest local people in programme production. Its closure reflects the economic background to the experiment and the need to find alternative sources of finance to fund novel and financially unprofitable forms of broadcasting...|$|R
