5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While <b>virtually</b> <b>everyone</b> connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E

Professor Gustav Adolf Michaelis from a maternity institution in Kiel replied positively to Semmelweis' suggestions— eventually he committed suicide, however, because he felt {{responsible for the death}} of his own cousin, whom he had examined after she gave birth.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 2005, it {{is shown}} (to the audience) that Dixie did indeed survive the {{automobile}} accident that {{was thought to}} have claimed her life {{while she was in}} Europe. Di, the only one who knows that Dixie is alive, goes to visit her, and urges her to return to Pine Valley and let her family know that she is alive. Dixie seems adamant on not taking Di's advice at first, but soon returns to Pine Valley in February 2006. She attends the Mardi Gras ball thrown by Erica Kane. Because her face is hidden by a mask, no one from her family recognizes her. She does, however, witness a tender moment between Tad and Di, as well as JR and Babe. Janet Dillon rigs the hot water heater at the mansion where the ball is being held so that it will explode. When it does, many people die and are injured and Dixie is trapped by some rubble. She manages to escape without being discovered by anyone. She goes to Wildwind, where Di is staying. In the middle of confronting her sister, Tad arrives and Dixie runs off before he can see her. Later, she runs into Zach Slater, and he promises not to reveal {{the fact that she is}} still alive. Later, she secretly watches in horror as her son holds a gun to Krystal Carey at a cabin, demanding to know where his ex-wife, Babe, has taken their son. Dixie hides as Tad arrives and tries to wrestle the gun away from JR, but the gun goes off and hits Dixie (who is outside) in the arm. It is soon revealed that Tad and Dixie's baby, Kate, is in fact alive, but was taken by Dr. Greg Madden, a famous surgeon who is hated by <b>virtually</b> <b>everyone</b> in Pine Valley. A few months earlier, Tad had informed Erica that Greg stole her baby, the one she aborted twenty-something years ago, and Erica's son is also alive, going by the name Josh Madden.|$|E

There, he re-grouped, {{and was able}} to regain the WBC's world championship when Camacho left it vacant in 1987, by edging out Terrence Alli with another close but unanimous 12 round decision. In his first title defense, he defeated former champion Cornelius Boza Edwards by fifth round knock out. In his second defense, he was awarded a 12 round split decision victory against future multiple world champion Pernell Whitaker. The consensus among both media and fans was that Whitaker deserved to win the fight; the resulting decision, to this day, ranks at the top or in the top 5 of <b>virtually</b> <b>everyone's</b> list of most controversial ever in boxing.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the dynamics between a private developer, local administrators and citizens in the Dutch city of Utrecht during {{the construction of the}} privately initiated shopping and business centre ‘Hoog Catharijne’ (1962 - 1973). At the time of its conception <b>virtually</b> each and <b>everyone</b> praised this inner city redevelopment project, but by the late- 1960 s several protest groups came to the fore. Simultaneously the municipal executive wanted to offer its citizens joint decision making in spatial planning. These democratizing tendencies increasingly collided with the technocratic stance of the private developer involved. By systematically analyzing how this developer, local administrators and citizens positioned themselves in- and outside of the political arena, the growing democratic tensions in a period of rapid societal modernization will be investigated...|$|R
5000|$|Hamilton began posting {{messages}} after I-5 {{was constructed}} across his turkey {{farm in the}} early 1960s. The first message he and his wife, Ruth, posted was based on their anger towards the government for funding welfare programs. Hamilton further resented the government for interfering with his ability to lease billboard space following Lady Bird Johnson's Highway Beautification Act. The New York Times described Hamilton as a [...] "cranky crusader" [...] who [...] "loved a fight" [...] and a [...] "stubborn man, a turkey farmer with a big belly full of opinions". According to the paper, [...] "Mr. Hamilton minced no words in attacking <b>virtually</b> everything and <b>everyone</b> that irritated him: gun control, the government and gays, Russians and radicals, Kissinger and Kerry."

40|$|Obtaining an MBA {{degree is}} an {{expensive}} and time-consuming process. The cost is ameliorated, however, if a tax deduction can be taken. Although many {{in the business community}} believe they are entitled to deduct the costs of obtaining an MBA, {{the fact of the matter}} is that a deduction is not a certainty. There have been numerous litigated cases concerning whether a deduction for the cost of an MBA should be allowed. The cases reveal, however, that it all depends on the particular facts and circumstances. This paper reviews the case law concerning the deductibility of the costs of obtaining an MBA: first some older cases, then some more recent cases, and finally the most recent case decided in 2005. Based upon two cases decided by the Tax Court in 2002 and 2004, in which the taxpayers lost, tax practitioners were concerned that a tax deduction for the cost of an MBA was <b>virtually</b> foreclosed for <b>everyone.</b> But in the case decided in 2005, it appears that the Tax Court softened its position. Accordingly, it seems that there is still the possibility of deducting the cost of an MBA. But again, it’s not automatic and will depend on the facts...|$|R
30|$|The {{day of the}} <b>Virtually</b> Connecting session <b>everyone</b> logs in a {{few minutes}} before the time to go live, across their various time zones - it is {{afternoon}} at the conference location in Germany and for Bali but it is early morning for Caines and evening for the Australian participant. As the participants join the call they are in connection with one another but the live stream has not yet been started so no one from the outside can see them. Since they are not live streaming yet, the tone is much more informal and lighthearted. Bali has taken {{on the role of the}} lead Virtual Buddy for this session and so she greets each participant as they enter noting the quality of their audio and video and troubleshooting with them if necessary. Once those who are onsite at the conference join the call with the onsite guests Bali similarly checks with them about the quality of their connection and once determining that all technology is working as well as can be expected everyone prepares to go live. Bali double checks to make sure that everyone is aware and consenting to the conversation being live streamed and recorded before she starts broadcasting the stream. Once she does, Caines and other virtual participants Tweet the link to the live stream on the conference hashtag and from time to time Tweet out insights from the conversation.|$|R
500|$|Initially {{the stay}} at Singapore was peaceful, and Judy stayed with a customs {{official}} {{and his family}} for a week ashore. The ship was rarely deployed until January 1942 when it was deployed with other gunboats to provide covering bombardments {{along the coast of}} Malaya for retreating troops, and occasionally to carry out evacuations. By this time, Judy was primarily being looked after by Petty Officer George White. The Battle of Singapore took place between 8–15 February. On the first day, along with the other military vessels, Grasshopper was sailed out to sea to provide anti-aircraft fire. By 11 February, Grasshopper and its sister ship Dragonfly were the largest vessels left at Singapore. On 13 February, the vessels were ordered to evacuate personnel and leave Singapore. The ships left at 9pm that evening, and travelled together. White later reported that Judy had [...] "personally greeted <b>virtually</b> <b>everyone</b> on board".|$|E

500|$|In 1995, a CIAR-funded {{study on}} secondhand smoke {{exposure}} by Peter Lee was published. The tobacco industry {{hoped that the}} study would undermine the validity of a 1981 study by Takeshi Hirayama, which reported a positive association between secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk. The final paper concluded that studies like Hirayama's were subject to misclassification bias, and therefore, had [...] "little scientific basis". In 1995, the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology published two studies funded by the CIAR examining the association between ETS and heart disease. Both studies concluded that ETS exposure from spouses did not {{increase the risk of}} heart disease, and that previous conclusions to the contrary were due to publication bias. Both of these studies have been criticized for suffering from exposure misclassification, because both studies failed to distinguish between current and former smokers. In 2003, a study funded by the center was published in the BMJ. Authored by James Enstrom and Geoffrey Kabat, the study found little association between secondhand smoke and coronary heart disease or lung cancer. This study has been criticized for failing to distinguish between those who were exposed to second-hand smoke and those who were not, because, according to the American Cancer Society, the study's participants were enrolled in 1959, [...] "when exposure to secondhand smoke was so pervasive that <b>virtually</b> <b>everyone</b> was exposed to ETS, {{whether or not they were}} married to a smoker." ...|$|E
