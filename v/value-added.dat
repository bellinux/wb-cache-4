5|$|Because of poor-quality soil, much of Wales is {{unsuitable}} for crop-growing and livestock farming {{has traditionally been}} the focus of agriculture. The Welsh landscape (protected by three national parks) and 45 Blue Flag beaches, as well as the unique culture of Wales, attract large numbers of tourists, who play an especially vital role in the economy of rural areas. Wales has struggled to develop or attract high <b>value-added</b> employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high <b>value-added</b> employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK – in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, Chengdu {{has also}} {{attracted}} many other major global corporations, including Citigroup, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, ABN AMRO, BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ {{in the banking}} sector. It is expected that by 2012, <b>value-added</b> financial services will make up 14% of the added-value service industry and 7% of the regional GDP. By 2015, those figures are expected to grow to 18% and 9% respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Delrina made deals with <b>value-added</b> resellers like NCR and GE Information Services {{who had the}} staff to {{customize}} the product {{to the needs of}} corporate customers looking to move away from paper-based forms. The forms products sold well and the annual revenues for the firm grew steadily; 1989 annual revenues (in Canadian dollars) were $5,630,393, in 1990 they were $8,759,623, and by 1991 they were $11,894,474.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, {{largely based}} on livestock, has {{traditionally}} been the main occupation in the central and western parts of the county. There are a mix of large and small farm businesses, and a thriving dairy sector in the Vale of Clwyd. Many of the towns have livestock markets and the farming industry supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, contractors and all the ancillary trades connected with agriculture. With their incomes on the decline, farmers have found opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and <b>value-added</b> food products.|$|E

5|$|The {{sovereign}} {{is subject}} to indirect taxes such as <b>value-added</b> tax, and since 1993 the Queen has paid income tax and capital gains tax on personal income. Parliamentary grants to the Sovereign are not treated as income as they are solely for official expenditure. Republicans estimate that the real cost of the monarchy, including security and potential income not claimed by the state, such as profits from the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall and rent of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, is £334 million a year.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{calls for}} Nan Chiau High to {{consider}} attaining independent status surfaced amidst shrinking student population, stating of the institution's ample human and financial backing {{along with its}} affiliation with several Special Assistance Plan primary schools, {{under the auspices of}} Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan. Nearing the end of the decade, the declining student population became more significant and the institution {{was on the verge of}} permanent closure. In 2000, Nan Chiau High School relocated to Sengkang New Town under an agreement with the Singapore Land Authority. The primary section separated to form Nan Chiau Primary School and relocated to 50 Anchorvale Link. That year, Nan Chiau High School was also ranked the top <b>value-added</b> school in the Ministry of Education's 1999 ranking of Special/Express schools in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The Economic Development Board {{had been}} set up in 1961 to {{formulate}} and implement national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore's manufacturing sector. Industrial estates were set up, especially in Jurong, and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher <b>value-added</b> goods and achieved greater revenue. The service industry also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like Shell and Esso to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world. The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, {{which is}} an {{equivalent}} 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted {{as part of the}} federal budget and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income for the federal government are the <b>value-added</b> tax (33%) and the direct federal tax (29%) and the main expenditure is located in the areas of social welfare and finance & tax. The expenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been growing from 7% of GDP in 1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and to 10.7% in 2010. While the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been growing from 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defence; from 26.5% in to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015).|$|E
5|$|The concept {{behind a}} Qualifying Industrial Zone is {{credited}} to Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman. In 1993, {{in anticipation of}} the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Salah traveled to Israel with the intention of doing business with Israeli businessmen. He was also interested in business ventures that could take advantage of the eight-year-old free trade agreement between the United States and Israel that allowed Israeli goods to enter the US markets duty-free. After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where labor was transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low labor costs that were forty to seventy percent lower than in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then leveraging it to produce <b>value-added</b> goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited. In addition, he surmised that economic cooperation between the two nations would help foster peace in the region.|$|E
5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo Argentino and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the <b>value-added</b> tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E
25|$|Revenues from a <b>value-added</b> tax are {{frequently}} lower than expected {{because they are}} difficult and costly to administer and collect. In many countries, however, where collection of personal income taxes and corporate profit taxes has been historically weak, VAT collection has been more successful than other types of taxes. VAT has become more important in many jurisdictions as tariff levels have fallen worldwide due to trade liberalization, as VAT has essentially replaced lost tariff revenues. Whether the costs and distortions of <b>value-added</b> taxes are lower than the economic inefficiencies and enforcement issues (e.g. smuggling) from high import tariffs is debated, but theory suggests <b>value-added</b> taxes are far more efficient.|$|E

Quality and technology of products were also increased as the competition increased. The variety of products were widened. Hong Kong companies also used flexible ways of producing goods. Faced with the severe restrictions of foreign countries, companies made use of the diversity of their products so that another kind of products can be exported when one kind is restricted. The high <b>value-added</b> industry, the jewellery industry, started to emerge in the 1970s.|$|E
