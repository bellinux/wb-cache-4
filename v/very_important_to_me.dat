Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E

500|$|Paige {{transferred}} to the New York production of Sunset Boulevard to make her Broadway debut at the Minskoff Theatre on 12 September 1996, staying with the show until it closed on 22 March 1997. On the Sunset Boulevard set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15cm) {{in order to accommodate}} Paige's short stature, or it would have been hard to see her behind the banister. [...] Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: [...] "The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, to put it simply, incredible", wrote one critic, whilst another said [...] "Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force". Paige was the first Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to sing one of the show's key songs, [...] "With One Look", which she did first at Lloyd Webber's wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called [...] "Just One Glance". Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige's performance of one of the show's other prominent songs, [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye", that it was [...] "as good, if not the best, of anything I've ever heard of mine". [...] Regarding the key lyric in the song, [...] "This world's waited long enough. I've come home at last", Paige had sought to change the way the melody was sung, despite being fully aware of Lloyd-Webber's fastidious tendencies. To her, the moment was not exploited to its fullest potential, so she approached the show's musical director, David Caddick, and expressed her wish to hold the word [...] "home", to which he agreed. Although she had been disappointed when she hoped to perform on Broadway in Evita, Cats and Chess, Paige stated of her debut there, [...] "It was just the most perfect time to go with that particular show". After Sunset Boulevard finished, she suffered from depression, commenting that the show's closing [...] "was the most terrible feeling....

The song was noted by Campbell for the mix of choir and organ, which according to him paved the way for gospel music to be more mainstream than before. In 1999, the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance held a seminar on the different implications and metaphors present in the song; it was headed by professors Martin Katz, George Shirley and Michael Daugherty.

Using a German text that her husband translated for her, she slowly rebuilt her skills over the next two decades. The book was Max Doerner's Malmaterial und seine Verwendung im Bilde. She said: [...] "The reading of the Doerner book was <b>very</b> <b>important</b> personally <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It took <b>me</b> years <b>to</b> understand the technique really, I mean the meaning of it."

There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy.

60|$|One day, {{during a}} visit to the city of Buenos Ayres, I {{discovered}} in a mean street, {{in the southern part of}} the town, a second-hand bookshop, kept by an old snuffy spectacled German in a long shabby black coat. I remember him well because he was a <b>very</b> <b>important</b> person <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It was the first shop of the kind I had seen--I doubt if there was another in the town; and to be allowed to rummage by the hour among this mass of old books on the dusty shelves and heaped on the brick floor was a novel and delightful experience. The books were mostly in Spanish, French, and German, but there were some in English, and among them I came upon Thomson's Seasons. I remember the thrill of joy I experienced when I snatched up the small thin octavo in its smooth calf binding. It was the first book in English I ever bought, and to this day when I see a copy of the Seasons on a bookstall, which is often enough, I cannot keep my fingers off it and find it hard to resist the temptation to throw a couple of shillings away and take it home. If shillings had not been wanted for bread and cheese I should have had a roomful of copies by now.|$|R
