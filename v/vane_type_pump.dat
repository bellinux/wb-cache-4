This research aimed to design most critical components of this vacuum forming machine with clear understanding of it's practical operational requirement.

The experiment was conducted {{with the help of}} a subsonic wind tunnel together with the experimental set-up of the <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> rotor and a spring balance. To ensure a Reynolds number independent approach, different stream flow was maintained. The flow velocities varied from 5 m/s to 9 m/s covering the Reynolds number from 0. 6375 X 10 5 to 1. 2 X 10 5. A four, five and six bladed vertical axis <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> rotor was used to determine the aerodynamic properties in dynamic condition.

40|$|Abstract. Satellites {{store and}} manage {{propellant}} by surface tension. A surface tension propellant management device (PMD) {{consists of a}} propellant refillable reservoir (PRR) for propellant storage and propellant acquisition vanes (PAVs) for propellant transportation. PRR is {{a key part of}} <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> surface tension tank (STT), and its storage performance determines the fluid management of <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> STT. In the present paper, a model test system was established and microgravity drop tower tests conducted based on experimental study of fluid storage and transportation behavior of PRR. Laws of fluid storage and transportation of PRR in microgravity environment were obtained. The test results show that two types of PRR both have good liquid storage capacity, and the double cone PRR exhibits good liquid storage capacity in lateral acceleration. A rational design of PRR can effectively store liquid and control liquid transportation velocity. The test results offer a guideline for optimization of new-style <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> PMD, and also provide a new method for fluid control in space environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of swirler design parameters namely, vane shape (flat or curved), vane outlet angle, aspect ratio and space-to-chord ratio (number of vanes), on the pressure drop-mass flow characteristics {{and the size}} and turbulence characteristics of the downstream recirculation region has been determined experimentally. A five-hole spherical pressure probe and hot-wire anemometry {{have been used for}} the investigation. A technique for simple and reasonably accurate interpretation of the signals from the hot-wire anemometer has been formulated. Its performance has been tested at first in round jets for which experimental turbulence data are already available for comparison purposes. The method has been applied subsequently to swirling flows issuing from the swirlers; the mean and turbulence characteristics of the flow fields have been determined in this way. In addition to these, the turbulent viscosities Ĭrr, Ĭrz, Ĭrθ and Ĭθθ have been calculated. Also, detailed accounts of the previous experimental work on swirling flows and of some finite difference procedures for the computation of weakly and strongly swirling flows have been given. It has been shown that the hot-wire formulation developed provides a simple, economic and efficient procedure for the measurement of the turbulence quantities in swirling flows. The results have shown that curved <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> swirlers operate more efficiently than flat <b>vane</b> <b>types</b> such that a larger recirculation region and a stronger shear zone are induced at a lower pressure drop. The pressure drop through both the flat and curved <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> swirlers increases with increasing vane angle, decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing space-to-chord ratio. The size of the downstream recirculation region, the reverse mass flow and the decay rates of the axial and swirl velocities increase with increasing vane angle and decreasing aspect ratio in the case of curved <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> swirlers. The effect of the space-to-chord ratio has not been found very significant in the cases of I 6 and I 2 vanes for the vane angle of 60 ° and the aspect ratio 0. 4. Higher turbulence and stronger shear zones can be obtained in swirling flows with increasing vane angle, decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing space-to-chord ratios. Turbulence is anisotropic in strongly swirling jets issuing from <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> swirlers. The most dominant stresses are in turn ww, uw, and uu; all the other stresses are smaller. In parallel to the anisotropy in the stresses, the turbulent viscosities are also anisotropic; the turbulent viscosity Ĭθθ has shown domination among the four viscosities which have been calculated. Ĭrr values have shown too much scatter. For these reasons, curved <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> swirlers should prove much more efficient than flat <b>vane</b> <b>types</b> in the application to combustion process...|$|R

40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. Piston <b>type</b> <b>pumps</b> are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this <b>type</b> of <b>pump</b> due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump.</b> The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011).
