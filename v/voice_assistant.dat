40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>assistants</b> like Siri {{enable us}} to control IoT devices {{conveniently}} with voice commands, however, they also provide new attack opportunities for adversaries. Previous papers attack <b>voice</b> <b>assistants</b> with obfuscated <b>voice</b> commands by leveraging the gap between speech recognition system and human voice perception. The limitation is that these obfuscated commands are audible and thus conspicuous to device owners. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to directly attack the microphone used for sensing voice data with inaudible voice commands. We show that the adversary can exploit the microphone's non-linearity and play well-designed inaudible ultrasounds to cause the microphone to record normal voice commands, and thus control the victim device inconspicuously. We demonstrate via end-to-end real-world experiments that our inaudible voice commands can attack an Android phone and an Amazon Echo device with high success rates at a range of 2 - 3 meters...|$|R
500|$|Xbox One's user {{interface}} uses Microsoft's Fluent Design System; previous iterations of the console's software used the Metro design language. The dashboard {{is divided into}} [...] "Home", [...] "Mixer", [...] "Community", [...] "Entertainment", and [...] "Store" [...] sections, with the [...] "Home" [...] page further divided into [...] "blocks" [...] that can display pinned games/apps, {{as well as other}} content. Pressing the Xbox Guide button opens a sidebar with access to common functions such as the friends list, apps, the user's party, and settings. [...] Users can go back to the dashboard while using games or apps using either the Xbox button on their controller or a voice command; up to four apps can run (either actively or in the background) at once, but only one game can run at a time. Use of Kinect enables the ability to control the console via voice commands. Xbox One's voice control capabilities are similar to, albeit richer than those of Xbox 360. The <b>voice</b> <b>assistant</b> Cortana was added in 2016 to provide expanded voice command functionality with natural language recognition.|$|E

He also praised the improvements to the Siri <b>voice</b> <b>assistant,</b> writing that Siri [...] "is much better".

The new design was implemented throughout the operating system, including the Notification Center, which was updated with three tabs offering different views of information; notifications visible on the lock screen; a redesigned Siri <b>voice</b> <b>assistant</b> offering visual indicators; and a Control Center offering easy access to the most commonly used features. iOS 7 also introduced AirDrop, a wireless sharing technology; CarPlay, phone and car integration; and automatic app updates in the App Store.|$|E
