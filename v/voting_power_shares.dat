40|$|This {{article focuses}} on German pension and health care reform {{politics}} under the Grand Coalition. All rich democracies face functional pressures to reform these sectors but are confronted with political and sometimes also institutionalobstacles. This holds in particular for the German party system, where traditionally two large centre parties compete for <b>votes</b> and <b>power</b> is <b>shared</b> with the Bundesrat, and often – informally – with the social partners. We hypothesise that a formal grand coalition provides a promising configuration for radical reforms as it neutralises these obstacles. This is done by analysing in some depth the major reforms of the Grand Coalition, {{the rise in the}} legal retirement age to 67 and the 2007 health care reform, and by comparing them with the main reforms of the preceding government, in particular the Red–Green coalition. We find that, although a Grand Coalition is not necessary for paradigmatic reform, it makes significant reform more likely, be it paradigmatic in the levels-of-policychange literature or electorally costly as conceived in the welfare state literatur...|$|R

40|$|We analyze how {{efficiency}} of {{firms in the}} Czech Republic is affected by their size, age, competition, capital structure, ownership types, and global financial crisis. We employ the stochastic frontier approach, use a large and detailed dataset, and cover time span 2001 - 2012. We show that larger firms cannot be associated with better efficiency in general. Effect of their age has only negligible impact. Impact of the capital structure is shown to be strong in large and more leveraged firms. Higher competition is not contributive to efficiency neither on individual nor aggregate levels. While effects of firm characteristics are small, the effects of ownership are economically substantial. We show that majority owners are most contributive with respect to firm's efficiency {{when compared to other}} categories we analyze. Minority owners with legally grounded power are able to impose significant efficiency improvement. The effect of the foreign ownership is strongest when foreign owners control firms with less than majority of <b>voting</b> <b>power.</b> Minority owners <b>sharing</b> the control do not seem to contribute to efficiency. The impact of crisis is not balanced but can be regarded as negative in general. The firms' characteristics change only a little. In contrast, worsening impact of the crisis is evidenced for controlling ownership categories. Minority owners exhibit a limited disciplining effect to improve efficiency after the crisis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Power</b> <b>sharing</b> {{institutions}} {{are currently being}} established to end war and lay the foundations for peace and democracy {{in a number of}} states emerging from civil war, such as Burundi, Rwanda, Sudan and Côte d’Ivoire. While a number of authors have contributed to develop theory on <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> and have drawn attention to the strengths and weaknesses of such systems of governance (Lijphart, 1990; Lake and Rotchild, 1996; Snyder and Jervis, 1999; Paris, 2004 etc.), little empirical evidence has been gathered on how <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> works on the ground. This thesis therefore sets out to assess <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> as a strategy to manage conflict in a post-war state. The analysis takes a closer look at a state that is currently implementing a recent <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> agreement, namely Burundi. Burundi has been chosen as a case study because it provides new insights on several levels, both theoretical and empirical. Firstly, Burundi is currently making its second attempt at <b>power</b> <b>sharing,</b> which allows for making a comparative case study between two <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> agreements within a single context. Secondly, Burundi’s second <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> agreement combines two different models of <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> so far seen as opposites in the literature; the consociational model and the integrative model. This will improve our understanding of the consequences of mixing the two models. Finally, Burundi is an example of <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> in a neo-patrimonial state. Whereas the mainstream analysis in the literature has been centred on <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> in weak and failed states, the case study of Burundi will shift the focus to how <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> fares in a neo-patrimonial state...|$|R
