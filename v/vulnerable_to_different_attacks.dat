Identity deceptions attacks are hard to detect attack. e. g. sinkhole attack, wormhole attack, Sybil attacks. Trust aware routing framework based on trust values of sensor nodes is proved effective for preventing Identity deception attacks. But DOS attacks or link failure conditions are not discussed in existing system. This paper focuses on the study behavior of Trust aware routing framework with backup path generation algorithm for link failure recovery. Link failure happens during packet routing results into packet loss. We have to recover that link failure and avoid packet loss and increasing packet delivery by using recovery phenomena of backup path generation for making routing framework robust.

In high mobility VANETs, routing is a very difficult task because vehicle moves with various speeds [30 – 32]. High mobility makes a frequent topology change in result over a short time connection that is established between nodes in VANETs.

The unique properties of sensor networks such bounded power, stringent bandwidth, dynamic topology due to nodes failures, high network density and large scale deployments of sensor nodes have caused many critical challenges in the sensor networks. Due to this, the network is <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> <b>different</b> severe <b>attacks</b> like blackhole attack that deplete the energy resources of the sensor nodes. These network demand energy awareness and robust security protocol designs at all layers of protocol stack. Energy consumption is an important issue in the design of wireless sensor networks which typically rely on non-renewable energy sources like batteries for power. Efficient utilization of sensor’s energy resources and maximizing the network lifetime and the network security are still the main design considerations for the most proposed protocols for sensor networks.
