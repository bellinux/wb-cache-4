5|$|The Childhood Of Jack Harkaway is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from S. Bracebridge Hemyng's Jack Harkaway story series by Lloyd Lonergan, the film depicts {{the life of the}} title character. Given to the care of strangers after his birth, Jack grows up and is sent to a school at age 12. After being severely and unjustly punished by the schoolmaster, Jack runs away and comes across two thieves plotting a robbery. Jack hurries to the house and warns the mistress of the planned robbery. The robbery is foiled and the lady of the house is <b>very</b> <b>grateful,</b> but Jack's schoolmaster and his guardian arrive to take him back. She recognizes the guardian as the man who forced her to turn over Jack and turns them out of the house. The film's cast and production credits are unknown. The film was released on December 23, 1910, it was met with favorable reviews and saw a wide national release. In 1988, a severely deteriorated nitrate print of the film was known to exist and it was likely transferred to the Library of Congress archives in 1997.|$|E

25|$|As Dunhuang {{was located}} near foreign lands, many traders often {{travelled}} {{from the west}} to China through the Silk Road to pay tribute or to trade. However, many wealthy locals in Dunhuang objected to trading and had even cheated foreign traders, resulting in much unhappiness among foreigners. When Cang Ci heard about this, he personally went to reassure the foreign traders and opened up special routes leading to Luoyang exclusively for those traders, while ordering his men to protect and escort the traders as they passed through. The foreigners were <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> to Cang Ci.|$|E

25|$|To these Three Kings I mainly owe {{the happy}} Christmas seasons of my {{childhood}} and I should have remained <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> to them. Instead, I came to America and soon forgot all about them, for here at Christmas time one sees so many Santa Clauses scattered all over town. Then there is the big Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza, the elaborate toy windows on Fifth Avenue, the one-hundred-voice choir in Grand Central Station, the innumerable Christmas carols on radio and television—and all these things made me forget the three dear old Kings of my old childhood.|$|E

25|$|The Halifax Borough Committee and Watch Committee had {{complete}} {{control over the}} Force at this time. There {{was a great deal}} of discontent in the Halifax Force and Richardson thought his men were getting a raw deal from the Borough Watch Committee but got short shrift from them when he tried to improve their working life. Apparently he got very tenacious about their working hours and would not back down after repeated attempts to get them a better deal got dragged out over a period of time. In the end, however, he won the day. His men were <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> for his efforts and a brass plaque was cast in 1910 and erected in the entrance hall of Harrison Road Police Station from 1910 until 1985. When the Station moved to a new location it was re-erected at the new station at Richmond Close, Halifax. Both Alfred Richardson and his brother Ernest Frank Richardson were involved in improving the indexing of police procedures on identifying past law-breakers by fingerprints and body measurements. Alfred Richardson tended to favour the Bertillon (1853–1914) method which involved several body measurements being recorded. His brother, Frank Richardson preferred indexing the records after photographing on-site fingerprints. (He had been working in conjunction with the Home Office, London, for many years on experimenting to find the best method.) Alfred Richardson gave lectures locally on the differences between the Bertillon method and photographic fingerprinting.|$|E

500|$|The novel's {{tone and}} {{structure}} place {{it within the}} serious literary tradition for which Kostova was aiming. For example, the alternating timelines are suggestive of A. S. Byatt's Possession (1990) and the intermingling of academia and the occult suggests Arturo Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas (1993). Although many reviewers compared The Historian to Dan Brown's historical thriller The Da Vinci Code (2003), Kostova has said her book [...] "is part of a tradition where literary craft and experiments in form are all as important as action...the only overlap is this idea of people searching for something in history. I'm still surprised when people make this comparison, I'm <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> my publisher has never pushed it." [...] Moreover, the only real historical personage in her novel is Vlad Țepeș and she changed the name of some locations [...] "fearing some readers might confuse fantasy and reality, as they have with Brown's novels".|$|E

There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing.|$|E

[...] Falk even {{came up with the idea}} of teaming Bugs Bunny and Jordan together in a feature film, and then sold the concept to Warner Bros. in 1993. [...] The ensuing film, Space Jam, was executive produced by Falk and released in 1996.
