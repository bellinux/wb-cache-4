40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{research}} activity {{related to the}} development of a twin-spark Sl engine equipped with a <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> (VVT) <b>device.</b> Improvements on the fuel consumption at part load are expected when an high internal exhaust gas recirculation (internal EGR) level is realized with a proper phasing of the VVT device. The twin-spark solution is implemented to improve the burning speed at low load, and to increase the EGR tolerance levels. Both experimental and theoretical analyses are carried out to investigate the real advantages of the proposed engine architecture. In particular an original quasi-dimensional model for the simulation of the burning process in a twin-spark engine is presented. The model is mainly utilized to find the proper combination of VVT device position (and hence EGR level) and spark advance for different engine operating conditions. A comparison with the single-spark solution is also provided. In addition, a procedure for the estimation of the sound pressure levels originated from the combustion process is utilized, to estimate the increased radiated noise associated to the double ignition. The model is well suited to define the control strategy maps of the engine in its whole operating range...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the development of}} a fully continuous, hydraulics-based <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system. This hydraulics based <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system is capable of controlling an engine valves lift height and infinitely varying the engine valves lift profile. Along with full valve controllability during normal operation, the <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system is capable of providing the same operation as a classic cam shaft under engine power loss conditions. This is possible due to the rotating hydraulic spool valves coupled to the engines crank shaft, which are used to actuate the engine poppet valves. The main focus of this thesis is to investigate, alter and implement a new iteration of the hydraulic <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system on a standalone test bench to validate the systems operating principles. The test bench utilizes servo motors to act as an engines crank shaft which runs the rotating hydraulic spool valves and hydraulic pump. This serves as an intermediate step to full engine implementation of the <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system. The research begins by analyzing the current mechanical spool valve and hydraulic cylinder design for any potential problems that may occur either during assembly or full operation. The basic system equations are presented to give a glimpse into the working principles of the rotary valves. The mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic subsystems are discussed in terms of what was considered during the design and implementation process. Then design changes that were performed on the rotary valve system to overcome any failures. Lastly the resulting data is presented from the current <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> design to verify proper system functionality...|$|R

50|$|The valves {{within an}} {{internal}} combustion engine are used to control {{the flow of the}} intake and exhaust gases {{into and out of the}} combustion chamber. The timing, duration and lift of these valve events has a significant impact on engine performance. Without <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> or <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> lift, the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> must be the same for all engine speeds and conditions, therefore compromises are necessary. An engine equipped with a <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> actuation system is freed from this constraint, allowing performance to be improved over the engine operating range.|$|R
