40|$|From 2000 - 2003 a {{range of}} Farm Scale Evaluation (FSE) trials were {{established}} in the UK to assess {{the effect of the}} release and management of herbicide tolerant (HT) crops on the abundance and diversity of farmland wildlife compared with their conventionally managed non-GM-equivalents. The objective of this research project was to investigate gene flow within the winter (WOSR) and spring oilseed rape (SOSR) FSE trials and to develop a statistical model for the prediction of cross-pollination frequency {{that can be used to}} evaluate current separation distance guidelines. Seed samples were collected from the non-GM half of the trial sites and were tested for evidence of cross-pollination from the GM HT halves using a quantitative PCR assay specific to the HT (bar) gene. Rates of cross-pollination were found to decrease rapidly with increasing distance from the GM source. The quantitative data were subjected to statistical analysis and a two-step model was found to provide the best fit for the data. Significant differences were found between the results for WOSR, SOSR and <b>varietal</b> <b>association</b> (VA) crops. The model predicted that the %GM content (including upper 95 % confidence limits) of a sample taken at a distance of 50 m away from the GM source would be 0. 04 % (0. 84 %) for WOSR, 0. 02 % (0. 39 %) for SOSR, 0. 77 % (21. 72 %) for WOSR VA and 0. 37 % (5. 18 %) for SOSR VA. The data and models presented here are discussed in the context of necessary separation distances to meet various possible thresholds for adventitious presence of GM in OSR...|$|E
40|$|Since 1994 several {{oilseed rape}} hybrid types were {{proposed}} to farmers. Following registration experiments, Cetiom and different equivalent institutions in European Union have tested them in different post registration national networks. Grain yield productivity increases were demonstrated and a first synthesis {{could be done}} to check avantages and difficulties which had occurred. For winter types, Hybrid Composits were widely used, mainly in France and in the United Kingdom. Grain yield increases were important in the South and West part of France where their market shares increased up to 50 - 80 %. Nevertheless, many fecondation problems occurred in several places all over Europe. Reasons of such problems were difficult to identify. Several factors, as cold temperatures, nutritionnal competitions, pollen avaibility may be involved to explain low seed sets. Restored Hybrids made with the NPZ hybridation system were successfully tested widely, and has reached significative market shares during 1999 - 2000 season. Less experiments were carried out with others hybrid types (Ogu-INRA Restored Hybrids, Mixed Hybrids). Ogu-INRA Restored Hybrids reached the highest grain yield levels but users are waiting for lower glucosinolates seed content hybrids which would come in the next future. Performances comparisons among countries have to be done carefully. Productivity increases with hybrid types could have been over estimated depending of pollinic environments or plot size and possible neighbouring effects. For France, results from field trials networks are coherent with results coming from postal surveys. For spring varieties, Polima restored hybrids and <b>varietal</b> <b>associations</b> have demonstrated a significative advantage compared to classical lines...|$|R
40|$|Describing {{the genetic}} {{diversity}} in the gene pool of crops will provide breeders with novel resources for <b>varietal</b> improvement. Nested <b>Association</b> Mapping (NAM) populations are uniquely suited for characterizing parental diversity through the shuffling and fixation of parental haplotypes. Here, we describe a set of 1879 rice NAM lines created through the selfing and single-seed descent of F 1 hybrids derived from elite IR 64 indica crossed with 10 diverse tropical japonica lines. Genotyping data indicated tropical japonica alleles were captured at every queried locus {{despite the presence of}} segregation distortion factors. Several distortion loci were mapped, both shared and unique, among the 10 populations. Using two-point and multi-point genetic map calculations, our datasets achieved the âˆ¼ 1500 cM expected map size in rice. Finally, we highlighted the utility of the NAM lines for QTL mapping, including joint analysis across the 10 populations, by confirming known QTL locations for the trait days to heading.
