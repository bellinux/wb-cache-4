5000|$|Upon {{completing}} {{her education}} at Trinity College, Namono was accepted into Makerere University Kampala. The Makerere University Kampala is Uganda’s largest and third-oldest establishment of higher education. She received a bachelor's degree {{in art history}} from Makerere University [...] {{and went on to}} pursue her master's degree in South Africa. In her master’s program, she analyzed a distinct rock art tradition practiced by Bantu speakers. Namono explored the rock art produced by the Bantu and noticed that there was a rock art theme associated with boys' and girls' initiation. When Namono went to examine the boys’ art, she noted that the art was covered by previous archaeologist which caused her to study the girls’ art instead, also known as the <b>virgin</b> <b>area</b> located in the Limpopo region of South Africa. Namono soon after discovered her passion for art history which then prompted her to pursue a second master's degree in art history. Namono states, [...] "The market was flooded with art historians. I wanted to generate new information on a <b>virgin</b> <b>area,</b> so I enrolled for another master’s degree in rock art studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. That degree marked my shift from art history to archaeology”. Uganda’s rock art has not been thoroughly examined along with the fact that source and date of this art remains unidentified because of the unclear geometric symbols. Once she received her second master's degree, Namono pursued a PhD in archaeology. Namono expressed her shift in her educational direction in which she stated, [...] "When I was studying art history, I did not know that rock paintings were part of archaeology. The urge to explore more made me go for archaeology”. Once she received her PhD, she made history as Uganda’s first female archaeologist to acquire a PhD. Another great achievement obtained by Catherine Namono was the fact that she also became the second archaeologist in Uganda after the late Professor David Mulindwa Kiyaga.|$|E

40|$|The Bureau of Mines is in {{the process}} of degasifying a <b>virgin</b> <b>area</b> in {{northern}} West Virginia from the base of an 839 -foot-deep vertical borehole. An in situ gas pressure hole 199 feet long, and seven degasification holes ranging in depth from 500 to 850 feet (average 618 feet) were drilled in an 8 -foot-thick virgin Pittsburgh coalbed from the enlarged (14 -foot diameter) bottom of this borehole. The in situ pressure at the back end of the hole and the range of gas and water flows from degasification holes as they were completed and closed off were 203 psi, 79, 000 to 257, 000 cfd (average 160, 000 cfd), and 5 to 8 gpm per hole (average 6. 8 Gpm), respectively. Twenty-four hours after the seven holes were connected through individual water traps to a common collector for natural venting of the gas through pipes to the atmosphere, the total gas and water flows and the in situ pressure dropped, respectively, to 971, 000 cfd, 1. 3 Gpm, and 18 psi.
