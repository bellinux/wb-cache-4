50|$|The sheer {{scale of}} the scam came to light in 2013, when the Indore police arrested 20 people {{who had come to}} {{impersonate}} candidates for PMT 2009. The interrogation of these people led to the arrest of Jagdish Sagar, the leader of an organized racket involved in the scam. The state government established a Special Task Force (STF) on 26 August 2013. Subsequent interrogations and arrests uncovered the involvement of several politicians, bureaucrats, MPPEB officials, racket leaders, middlemen, candidates and their parents in the scam. By June 2015, more than 2000 people had been arrested in connection with the scam. These included the state's ex-education minister Laxmikant Sharma and over a hundred other politicians. In July 2015, the Supreme Court of India issued an order to transfer the case to the country's premier investigating agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

5000|$|The French Intelligence Agency DCRI {{contacted}} the Wikimedia Foundation, {{who refused to}} remove a French Wikipedia article about the Military radio station of Pierre-sur-Haute because the article only contained publicly available information, in accordance with Wikipedia's verifiability policy. In April 2013 DCRI forced the deletion of the article when it summoned a volunteer with administrator's access to the French language Wikipedia and ordered him to take down the article that had been online since 2009. DCRI claimed the article contained classified military information and broke French law. The volunteer, who had no connection with the article, explained [...] "that's not how Wikipedia works" [...] and told them he {{had no right to}} interfere with editorial content, but was told he would be held in custody and charged if he failed to comply. The article was subsequently restored by a Swiss Wikipedia contributor. The article became the most <b>viewed</b> <b>page</b> on the French Wikipedia as of April 6, 2013. Christophe Henner, vice-president of Wikimedia France, said [...] "if the DCRI comes up with the necessary legal papers we will take down the page. We have absolutely no problem with that and have made it a point of honour to respect legal injunctions; it's the method the DCRI used that is shocking." [...] The Wikimedia Foundation issued a communiqué in response.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Recommendations {{play a very}} {{important}} role for revealing related topics addressed in the wikis beyond the currently <b>viewed</b> <b>page.</b> In this paper, we extend KiWi, a semantic wiki with three different recommendation approaches. The first approach is implemented as a traditional tag-based retrieval, the second takes into account external factors such as tag popularity, tag representativeness and the affinity between user and tag and the third approach recommends pages in grouped by tag. The experiment evaluates the wiki performance in different scenarios regarding the amount of pages, tags and users. The results provide insights for the efficient widget allocation and performance management...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the study. The {{scientific}} and educational organizations use traditionally e-mail with Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and Microsoft Word documents for operational data collection. The disadvantages {{of this approach}} include the lack of control of the correctness of the data input, the complexity of processing the information received due to non-relational data model, etc. There are online services that enable to organize the collection of data in a relational form. The disadvantages of these systems are: the absence of thesaurus support; a limited set of elements of data input control; the limited control {{the operation of the}} input form; most of the systems is shareware, etc. Thus, it is required the development of Internet data collection and analysis technology, which should allow to identify quickly model the data collected and automatically implement data collection in accordance with this model. Materials and methods. The article describes the technology developed and tested for operational data collection and analysis using "Faramant" system. System operation "Faramant" is based on a model document, which includes three components: description of the data structure; visualization; logic of form work. All stages of the technology are performed by the user using the browser. The main stage of the proposed technology is the definition of the data model as a set of relational tables. To create a table within the system it’s required to determine the name and a list of fields. For each field, you must specify its name and use the control to the data input and logic of his work. Controls are used to organize the correct input data depending on the data type. Based on a model system "Faramant" automatically creates a filling form, using which users can enter information. To change the form visualization, you can use the form template. The data can be <b>viewed</b> <b>page</b> by page in a table. For table rows, you can apply different filters. To summarize the information there is a mechanism of data grouping, which provides general data of the number of entries, maximum, minimum, average values for different groups of records. Results. This technology has been tested in the monitoring requirements of the services of additional professional education and the definition of the educational needs of teachers and executives of educational organizations of the Irkutsk region. The survey has involved 2, 780 respondents in 36 municipalities. Creating the data model took several hours. The survey was conducted during the month. Conclusion. The proposed technology allows a short time to collect the information in relational form, and then analyze it without the need for programming with flexible assignment of the operating logic for form. </p...|$|E
