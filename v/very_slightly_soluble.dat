25|$|Diazepam {{occurs as}} solid white or yellow {{crystals}} with a melting point of 131.5 to 134.5°C. It is odorless, {{and has a}} slightly bitter taste. The British Pharmacopoeia lists it as being <b>very</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble</b> in water, soluble in alcohol, and freely soluble in chloroform. The United States Pharmacopoeia lists diazepam as soluble 1 in 16 ethyl alcohol, 1 in 2 of chloroform, 1 in 39 ether, and practically insoluble in water. The pH of diazepam is neutral (i.e., pH = 7). Due to additives such as benzoic acid/benzoate in the injectable form. (Plumb's, 6th edition page 372) Diazepam has a shelf life of five years for oral tablets and three years for IV/IM solutions.|$|E
2500|$|Temazepam is a white, {{crystalline}} substance, <b>very</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble</b> in water, and {{sparingly soluble}} in alcohol. Its main pharmacological action {{is to increase}} the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor. This causes sedation, motor impairment, ataxia, anxiolysis, an anticonvulsant effect, muscle relaxation, and a reinforcing effect. [...] As a medication before surgery, temazepam decreased cortisol in elderly patients. [...] In rats, it triggered the release of vasopressin into paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and decreased the release of ACTH under stress.|$|E
40|$|The project {{started with}} {{studying}} the unique {{characteristics of the}} zwitterionic drug (norfloxacin), considered {{as an example of}} <b>very</b> <b>slightly</b> water <b>soluble</b> drug. The study focused on the effects of its chemical structure on its interaction with surfactants (PEG 200 and Synperonic TM PE/L- 61) in liquisolid systems and, consequently, on its release into water dissolution medium. The next stage was an approach to solve the problems of the dissolution, compressibility and flowability of norfloxacin liquisolid formulations through adding water as a liquid binder to make wet granulated liquisolid formulations. The water in the liquisolid formulations works as a liquid binder to the carrier and coating particles, creating a wider space inside their structure, which allows the amount of the liquid vehicle (PEG 200 and Synperonic TM PE/L- 61) to increase inside the formulations. This feature reflects positively on the flowability (decreasing the angle of the slide), compressibility (increasing the load factor) and the dissolution behaviour of norfloxacin (increasing drug release to more than 20...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{outcrops}} of the [...] "Mosul marble" [...] {{gypsum rock}} normally used at several {{places in the}} Assyrian realm, though not especially close to the capitals. The rock is <b>very</b> soft and <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble</b> in water, and exposed faces degraded, {{and needed to be}} cut into before usable stone was reached. There are reliefs showing quarrying for Sennacherib's new palace at Nineveh, though concentrating on the production of large lamassu. Blocks were extracted, using prisoners of war, and sawed into slabs with long iron sawed. This may have happened at the palace site, which is certainly where the carving of orthostats was done, after the slabs had been fixed into place as a facing to a mud-brick wall, using lead dowels and clamps, with the bottoms resting on a bed of bitumen. [...] For some reliefs an [...] "attractive fossiliferous limestone" [...] is used, as in several rooms in the South-West Palace at Nineveh. [...] In contrast to the orthostats, the lamassu were carved, or at least partly so, at the quarry, no doubt to reduce their enormous weight.|$|R
60|$|There {{is another}} class of instances, {{of the nature}} {{required}} by the Method of Difference, which seem at first sight to conflict with the theory. Soluble salts of silver, such for instance as the nitrate, have the same stiffening antiseptic effect on decomposing animal substances as corrosive sublimate and the most deadly metallic poisons; and when applied to the external parts of the body, the nitrate is a powerful caustic, depriving those parts of all active vitality, and causing them to be thrown off by the neighboring living structures, {{in the form of}} an eschar. The nitrate and the other salts of silver ought, then, it would seem, if the theory be correct, to be poisonous; yet they may be administered internally with perfect impunity. From this apparent exception arises the strongest confirmation which the theory has yet received. Nitrate of silver, in spite of its chemical properties, does not poison when introduced into the stomach; but in the stomach, as in all animal liquids, there is common salt; and in the stomach there is also free muriatic acid. These substances operate as natural antidotes, combining with the nitrate, and if its quantity is not too great, immediately converting it into chloride of silver, a substance <b>very</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>soluble,</b> and therefore incapable of combining with the tissues, although to the extent of its solubility it has a medicinal influence, though an entirely different class of organic actions.|$|E
