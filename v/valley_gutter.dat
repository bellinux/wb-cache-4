5000|$|Water from a {{pitched roof}} flows {{down into a}} <b>valley</b> <b>gutter,</b> a parapet gutter or an eaves gutter. An eaves gutter {{is also known as}} an eavestrough (especially in Canada), eaves channel, dripster, {{guttering}} or simply as a gutter. The word gutter derives from Latin gutta(noun), meaning [...] "a drop, spot or mark".|$|E
50|$|Guttering in its {{earliest}} form consisted of lined wooden or stone troughs. Lead {{was a popular}} liner and is still used in pitched <b>valley</b> <b>gutters.</b> Many materials {{have been used to}} make guttering: cast iron, asbestos cement, UPVC (PVCu), cast and extruded aluminium, wood, and bamboo.|$|R
50|$|Box gutters are {{essentially}} placed between parallel surfaces, as {{in a valley}} between parallel roofs or at the junction of a roof and a parapet wall. They {{should not be confused}} with so-called <b>valley</b> <b>gutters</b> or <b>valley</b> flashings which occur at the non-parallel intersection of roof surfaces, typically at right angled internal corners of pitched roofs. Provision is made in the design of the gutter to have a rain flow to the outlet with a maximum slope of 1:200 and a minimum of 1:400.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} brick built with stone {{dressings}} and steep-pitched slated roofs. The aisles have individual double-pitched roofs with deep <b>valley</b> <b>gutters</b> alongside the nave's clerestory. There is a four-bay nave, the west bay being incomplete with no clerestory {{and what was}} intended to be a temporary slated gable end. It is flanked by narrow aisles and porches (now used for other purposes). The nave is flanked by the Lady Chapel in the north aisle and All Souls Chapel in the south aisle. The apsidal chancel is enclosed by a narrow ambulatory. To the north the Lady Chapel has its own arcaded chancel with ambulatory. To the south of the chancel the space is occupied by the organ chamber and vestries.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{extension}} on {{the east}} side is elongated with two windows in the east side elevation. It is clad with fibrous-cement sheeting, with a galvanised corrugated iron mono-pitch roof running down to form a <b>valley</b> <b>gutter</b> with the extension on the west side. There is a small lean-to extension at the northern end of this extension, also clad in fibrous-cement sheeting, with a window in the western side wall. There are two lean-to corrugated iron roofs running off these two single-storey extensions at the rear.|$|E
5000|$|A roof must be {{designed}} with a suitable fall {{to allow the}} rainwater to discharge. The water drains into a gutter that is fed into a downpipe. A flat roof will have a watertight surface with a fall of 1 in 60, or 1 {{in the case of}} lead. They can drain internally or to an eaves gutter, which has a minimum 1 in 360 fall towards the downpipe. [...] The pitch of a pitched roof is determined by the construction material of the covering. For slate this will be at 25%, for machine made tiles it will be 35%. Water falls towards a parapet gutter, a <b>valley</b> <b>gutter</b> or an eaves gutter. [...] When two pitched roofs meet at an angle, they also form a pitched valley gutter: the join is sealed with valley flashing. Parapet gutters and valley gutters discharge into internal rainwater pipes or directly into external down pipes {{at the end of the}} run. The capacity of the gutter is a significant design consideration. The area of the roof is calculated (metres) and this is multiplied by rainfall (litres/sec/metres²) which is assumed to be 0.0208. This gives a required discharge outfall capacity. (litres/sec) [...] Rainfall intensity, the amount of water likely to generated in a two-minute rainstorm is more important that average rainfall, the British Standards Institute notes that an indicative storm in Essex, (annual rainfall 500mm per annum) delivers 0.022 l/s/m²- while one in Cumbria (annual rainfall 1800mm per annum) delivers 0.014 l/s/m².|$|E
40|$|The sun {{is in the}} north. The {{house is}} only {{accessible}} by boat and is located on a steep promontory on the Hawkesbury River, 40 km north of Sydney, latitude 33 ˚ south. The climate is coastal temperate Australian with highs of 38 ˚C and lows of 5 ˚C. The site faces east and is seriously overshadowed after 2. 00 pm in winter by the high headland behind. The site is 15 m wide and 90 m up a steep hill from a 15. 5 m waterfront. It is strewn with large rocks and boulders. It is a holiday house with living/dining/kitchen opening to a large deck overlooking the waterfront and with four self-contained bedrooms accessed from an open roofed verandah stepping up the hill at the rear from a small courtyard which captures available sun and is protected from the prevailing winds. The roof profiles are set to maximise solar access from the north in winter and the main butterfly roof also admits south light to the living area while providing a north facing pitch for solar collectors. The roof to the bedrooms is pitched in two directions giving each bedroom natural cross-ventilation and a stepped south wall allows {{a view of the}} river from each bed. Rainwater is collected from the roofs via the large <b>valley</b> <b>gutter</b> and stored in water tanks, effluent is treated by a worm activated septic tank. The house had to meet stringent bushfire protection regulations. Built off the ground on steel poles, the undercroft is enclosed to reduce bushfire risk. The walls and floors are timber framed and roof is composite timber and steel to accommodate the large overhangs. External wall cladding is colour coded horizontal corrugated steel – silver for the living areas, black for the bedroom areas and red for the utility areas. The house was designed using a series of physical models employed to take account of the rock strewn site, study solar access and develop the complex roof forms. A plunge pool beside the rear courtyard has yet to be built...|$|E
50|$|The water {{repelled}} by the roof during a rainstorm is potentially {{damaging to the}} building that the roof protects. If it runs down the walls, it may seep into the mortar or through panels. If it lies around the foundations it may cause seepage to the interior, rising damp or dry rot. For this reason most buildings have a system in place to protect {{the walls of a}} building from most of the roof water. Overhanging eaves are commonly employed for this purpose. Most modern roofs and many old ones have systems of <b>valleys,</b> <b>gutters,</b> waterspouts, waterheads and drainpipes to remove the water from the vicinity of the building. In many parts of the world, roofwater is collected and stored for domestic use.|$|R
5000|$|The former Burns Philp {{building}} is a large timber-framed structure elevated on masonry and timber stumps and clad in vertically fixed corrugated iron sheeting. Behind a distinctive curved triple-fronted parapet facing south-east to Landsborough Street, the {{building is}} divided into three bays of varying width, each with a gabled roof and <b>valley</b> <b>gutters</b> running the length of the building. Two roof ventilators are positioned along the ridge of the middle bay. A timber-framed corrugated iron clad awning with ogee eaves gutter supported on posts (one early timber post survives) extends over each footpath. Two entrances are located on Caroline Street accessed by stairs and a connecting ramp. The kerbing to both streets is made from local stone and cast iron gutter covers inscribed with the words [...] "Normanton Municipal Council" [...] span the channel between the asphalt concrete road surface and concrete path to the footpath.|$|R
50|$|In 1887 {{there was}} a {{proposal}} to build a narrow-gauge steam tramway along the main road from Hemel Hempstead to Bourne End, and then along the Bourne <b>Gutter</b> <b>Valley</b> to Chesham. Campaigners sought to extend this route via Berkhamsted, but the project also came to nothing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{work of the}} Smith came to {{an abrupt}} halt in 1914 with the {{outbreak}} of war and the requisitioning of the building for military purposes. This happened twice in the twentieth century. From 1914 to 1921 and 1939 to 1948 the Smith was rendered inoperable as a gallery and museum, being used for the billeting of troops and other military purposes. Stirling was a garrison town from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries, and the billeting of troops in times of crisis was one of the domestic hazards of life in the burgh for most people. The Smith suffered badly from the experience of the two wars. The damage list of 1919 makes for particularly dismal reading - damaged front steps, broken and bent railings; choked <b>valley</b> <b>gutters</b> leading to dampness, water ingress and damage to the collections stacked high in the side rooms; broken windows, plaster, flooring, lamps, ventilation grating; eleven sheets of roof glass broken; flooring stained with oil and urine; doors and door furniture removed; damage to the boiler. An entrance with rough wooden steps for the curator and his family had been created {{on the east side of}} the building. Worse still, the public were banned from coming near the building: “Loitering of any kind on any portion of the Institute grounds to be rigorously prevented by the Military Authorities. No person other than troops to be permitted with the grounds…” ...|$|R
50|$|The roof of {{the house}} has been amalgamated and {{extended}} over time. Once a pair of simple hip roofs surrounded by lower pitched verandah roofs, various extensions and alterations have created a complex roofscape of interlocking hipped roofs with box <b>gutters,</b> <b>valleys</b> and ridges. The roof is modest in scale and appearance due to the relatively low pitches used and {{the small size of}} the original elements.|$|R

40|$|The Centre for Applied Archaeology (CfAA) was {{commissioned}} by Mr Lea to carry out an archaeological building survey and research on the history and development of Rock House, Barton Road, Worsley (centred on NGR: SD 74800 00453; LB II, no. 1067483; GMHER 1501. 1. 0). It lies on the western bank of the Bridgewater Canal immediately south of Worsley Delph and the Worsley Road bridge at a height of c. 35 m AOD. Rock House is a two-storey, brick-built, structure with a cellar. In plan it has a central hall and staircase and is two-rooms deep, with room spaces flanking {{either side of the}} hallway. There is a rear, northern, single-storey out building, on the roof of which is a water tank. The roof structure comprises a double pitch with a central <b>gutter</b> <b>valley</b> and gable chimneys...|$|R
