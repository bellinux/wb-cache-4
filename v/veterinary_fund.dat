40|$|This report {{analyzes}} the agricultural {{risk management system}} in the Netherlands, applying a holistic approach that considers the interactions between all sources of risk, farmers’ strategies and policies. The policy analysis is structured around three layers of risk that require a differentiated policy response: normal (frequent) risks that should be retained by the farmer, marketable intermediate risks that can be transferred through market tools, and catastrophic risk that requires government assistance. The main risk-related policies in the Netherlands are implemented {{as part of the}} EU policy framework. Specifically, national policies focus on the management of catastrophic risks by promoting public-private partnerships, such as Livestock <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Fund,</b> to manage the costs of livestock epidemics. The mutual insurance companies specialised in the coverage of specific types of risks are also promoted, with some of them receiving start-up capital and re-insurance support. The recently launched subsidised multi-peril yield insurance exploits the new opportunities created by the EU framework. agricultural policy, muti-peril insurance, pest and disease risk, risk-management, risk perceptions, Livestock <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Fund...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of animal health crises has considerably {{increased over the}} last few years. When a crisis occurs, farmers can receive financial support through various public, private and mixed compensation schemes. Economic losses resulting from diseases may be direct and indirect. If a disease is covered by European Union regulations then countries have a legal obligation to partly compensate farmers for direct losses, either directly through the national budget, or through a specific fund. The European <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Fund</b> also cofinances these losses. Only a few countries provide compensation for indirect losses. The private insurance sector also provides protection against some direct and indirect losses but the risks covered are variable. To encourage farmers to subscribe to this kind of insurance, some public authorities provide subsidies to help pay the premium. Insurance companies do not generally cover the risks linked to contagious diseases, but some companies do extend cover to include this type of risk. Several alternatives, such as mutual funds, are available to improve risk coverage. There is a lack of harmonisation among the various compensation schemes of different countries. Public authorities cannot provide full compensation, but mutual funds and private insurance companies are alternatives that should be further investigated and their use should be extended to other countries. A classification of diseases would harmonise the situation at the European level. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Dental care is an {{integral}} part of equine veterinary practice. The objectives of this cross sectional study were to describe the prevalence of dental disorders in an abattoir population of horses, and to compare oral examination of intact and bisected heads. Heads from 40 horses were examined, 19 males and 21 females, divided into immature, adults and older horses. Older horses in this abattoir population had a significantly higher prevalence of infundibular caries (91. 7 %), diastemata (66. 7 %) and fractures (58. 3 %), whereas dental wear disorders affected all age groups. Gasterophilus larvae were detected in 20 % of the horses. The oral examination performed on intact heads was adequate for diagnosing gross disorders, but further examination is needed for reliably diagnosing minor disorders.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of untreated and alphacypermethrin-treated {{high density polyethylene}} (HDPE) mesh against Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) was determined using Onderstepoort downdraught black light traps and a contact bioassay. Three traps were operated overnight in four replicates of a 3 x 3 randomised Latin square design near horses under South African field conditions. Both the untreated and alphacypermethrin-treated HDPE mesh significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced the numbers of Culicoides midges, predominantly Culicoides (Avaritia) imicola Kieffer, collected in the light traps by 4. 2 and 7. 2 times respectively. A repellent effect of the alphacypermethrin-treated mesh was not confirmed {{because the number of}} midges collected in the light traps with untreated and alphacypermethrin-treated HDPE mesh were not significantly different (P = 0. 656). Bioassay of the insecticidal contact efficacy indicated median C. imicola mortality of 100 % from 30 and 10 min following exposure to the alphacypermethrin-treated HDPE mesh for 1 or 3 min, respectively. In the bioassay, mortality was significantly higher (P = 0. 016) at 5 min post exposure in the midges exposed to the alphacypermethrin-treated mesh for 3 min (74. 8 %) compared to the 1 min exposure group (59. 5 %). The HDPE mesh could be used to reduce exposure of housed animals to Culicoides midges, specifically C. imicola, and viruses transmitted by these midges. Mesh treated with alphacypermethrin had the additional benefit of a rapid insecticidal effect on C. imicola.

40|$|CONTEXT : Numerous {{plants are}} used by the local {{communities}} of South Africa for the treatment and management of type II diabetes. OBJECTIVES : For this study, we undertook {{a survey of the}} plants sold for the management of diabetes in the town of Newcastle, South Africa. Identified plants were subsequently evaluated for their in vitro antidiabetic activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS : Plants were identified through an interview with a herbalist at the market. Antidiabetic activity of extracts of purchased plants was evaluated using in vitro a-amylase and a-glucosidase activity, as well as islets of Langerhans excretory activity. RESULTS : Senna alexandrina Mill. (Fabaceae), Cymbopogon citrates Stapf. (Poaceae), Cucurbita pepo L. (Cucuribitaceae), Nuxia floribunda Benth. (Stilbaceae), Hypoxis hemerocallidea Fisch. and Mey (Hypoxidaceae), and Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Lauraceae) were identified. The hexane extract of S. alexandrina (EC 50 ¼ 0. 083 mg/ml), ethyl acetate extract of H. hemerocallidea (EC 50 ¼ 0. 29 mg/ml), and methanol extracts of Cymbopogon citratus (EC 50 ¼ 0. 31 mg/ml) and Cinnamomum cassia (EC 50 ¼ 0. 12 mg/ml) had the highest a-amylase inhibitory activity, albeit lower than acarbose (EC 50 ¼ 0. 50 mg/ml). All the plants had good a-glucosidase inhibitory activity (450 %) with the exception of some methanol (Cinnamomum cassia, N. floribunda, and Cymbopogon citratus) and acetone extracts (Cucurbita pepo and N. floribunda). Only the H. hemerocallidea acetone extract had an insulin stimulatory effect (2. 5 U/ml at 8 mg/ml). CONCLUSION : All the evaluated plants demonstrated inhibitory activity against the specific GIT enzyme systems evaluated. Only H. hemerocallidea had insulin secretory activity, adding evidence to the traditional use of these purchased plants in the management of the type II diabetic post-prandial hyperglycemia.

The main objectives of the surveillance effort were to identify {{avian influenza}} viruses (AIVs) circulating in wild birds and to investigate the role of backyard poultry flocks in the dynamics of infection in a densely populated poultry area (DPPA). Over two years (2004 - 2006) 164 backyard flocks and 4, 083 wild birds (mainly migratory Anseriformes and Charadriiformes) were sampled in three regions in the North of Italy. Samples collected were screened by means of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and the positive samples were processed for attempted virus isolation in embryonated fowl's specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs. At {{the end of the}} study period 27 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses had been isolated from backyard flocks and 49 strains obtained from wild birds. Of these 26 belonged to the H 5 or H 7 subtype and were closely related to contemporary low pathogenic strains of Eurasian lineage.

After growing up caring for the family farm animals, he {{graduated}} from the University of Wisconsin in pre-veterinary studies in 1941. He received his veterinary degree from Iowa State University in 1944. After practicing for a while and becoming frustrated with the limited scientific means with which to treat animals, he began his graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, where he received a M. S. in 1946 and a Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine in 1949. As a member of the faculty at the University of Minnesota since 1949, Dr. Weber has been involved {{in the development of the}} College of Veterinary Medicine almost since its foundation in 1947. He was the head of the department of Veterinary Anatomy between 1965 and 1973. He did research on cattle leukemia on two international NIH fellowships in 1959 - 60 and 1971 - 72 and was on the International Anatomical Nomenclature Committee. Dr. Weber’s research has focused on cytology, ultrasound and cytogenetics in relation to reproductive and hematopoietic systems. Alvin F. Weber begins by discussing the influence of his rural upbringing on his decision to pursue veterinary medicine through college, at the University of Wisconsin, veterinary school, at the University of Iowa, and graduate studies, again at the University of Wisconsin. He discusses his close brush with military service and his move to the University of Minnesota in 1949.

40|$|Artículo de Publicación ISIOur aim was {{to compare}} Corpus luteum (CL) {{development}} and blood plasma concentration of progesterone ([P(4) ]) in thoroughbred mares after spontaneous (Control: C) or human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) -induced ovulation. Lactating mares (C = 12; hCG = 21) were daily teased and mated during second oestrus post-partum. Treated mares received 2500 IU hCG i. v. at first day of behavioural oestrus when dominant follicular size was > 35, = 45 mm. Dominant follicle before ovulation, CL and gestational sac were measured by ultrasound and [P(4) ] by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Blood sampling and ultrasound CL exams were done at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 60 and 90 after ovulation and gestational sac from day 12 after ovulation in pregnant (P) mares; non-pregnant (NP) were followed until oestrus returned. Data analyses considered four subgroups: hCG-P, hCG-NP, C-P and C-NP. Preovulatory follicular size was smaller in hCG mares than in C: 39. 2 +/- 2. 7 mm vs 51. 0 +/- 1. 8 mm (p < 0. 0001). All hCG mares ovulated 24 - 48 h after treatment and presented similar oestrus duration as controls. C. luteum size in P mares showed {{the same pattern of}} development through days 4 - 35, presenting erratic differences during initial establishment. Thus, on days 1 and 3, CL was smaller in hCG-P (p < 0. 05); while in hCG-NP, CL size was greater than in C-NP on day three (p = 0. 03). Corpus luteum size remained stable until day 90 in hCG-P mares, while in C-P a transient and apparently not functional increase was detected on days 40 and 45 (p < 0. 05) and the decrease from day 60 onwards, made this difference to disappear. No differences were observed in [P(4) ] pattern between P, or between NP subgroups, respectively. So, hCG-induced ovulation does not affect CL development, neither [P(4) ] during early pregnancy. One cycle pregnancy rate tended to be lower in hCG mares while season pregnancy rates were similar to controls.

40|$|The non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) diclofenac {{is highly}} toxic to Gyps vultures and its recent widespread use in South Asia caused catastrophic declines {{in at least three}} scavenging raptors. The manufacture of veterinary formulations of diclofenac has since been banned across the region with mixed success. However, at least 12 other NSAIDs are available for veterinary use in South Asia. Aceclofenac is one of these compounds and it is known to metabolise into diclofenac in some mammal species. The metabolic pathway of aceclofenac in cattle, the primary food of vultures in South Asia, is unknown. In this study, we give six cattle the recommended dose of aceclofenac (2 mg/kg), collect blood along a time series and undertake a pharmacokinetic analysis of aceclofenac and diclofenac-metabolites in their plasma using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. We found that nearly all of the aceclofenac administered to the cattle was very rapidly metabolised into diclofenac. Therefore, treating livestock with pure diclofenac or aceclofenac poses the same risk to vultures. This fact, coupled with the risk that aceclofenac may replace diclofenac in the veterinary market, fortifies the need for an immediate ban on all aceclofenac formulations {{that can be used to}} treat livestock. Without such a ban, the recovery of vultures across South Asia will not be successful. This study was largely funded by the RSPB Centre for Conversation Science.

There are several antigens {{have been identified as}} vaccine candidates and an in vitro bioassay technique has been developed for assessing the immunoresponses of vaccine in sheep. Three antigens were used for vaccines in this study, these included protein peritrophic membrane (PM), soluble extract (SE) and pellet extract (PE) of 1 st instar larvae of Chrysomya bezziana. Twenty four experimental sheep were divided into 4 groups of 6 animals, 3 groups of animals were injected with PM, SE and PE vaccines with the dose rate of 0. 5 g PM/head, 0. 8 g PE/head and 4. 2 ml LE/head respectively, and the other one group was injected with 4 ml PBS/head as a control group. Vaccination with the same dose was repeated 4 weeks after the 1 st vaccination as a booster, and 2 weeks after the booster the sheep were challenged with live larvae, 3 days after challenge animals were killed. Sera were collected at the day of vaccination, 4 weeks after vaccination, 2 weeks after booster, and 3 days after challenge. An in vitro bioassay technique was conducted by culturing 1 st instar larvae on five media containing sera collected from each experimental animal.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{environmental}} unpleasant odours {{have become a}} serious concern caused by the awareness {{of the population in}} respect to human health and wellbeing issues. Odour exposure may short time not acutely represent a risk for human health, but the exposure causes different negative effects, ranging from emotional stress to physical symptoms. As a matter of fact, environmental odours are considered to be major causes of public complaints. Residents living near odour emitting sources complain to local authorities, regional or national environmental agencies or directly to the personnel involved with the odour emitting source for problem reduction or elimination. Therefore odour is on the top agenda in the field of air quality programs of environmental agencies all over the world. In general odour emission can be handled like any other airborne pollutant. Starting with the release of the odour at an emission rate depending on the source, the emitted odorous substances are dispersed in the atmosphere. This dilution process can be calculated by various dispersion models, which permit the assessment of the odour exposure. By national odour impact criteria this exposure is calculated to decide if odour annoyance can be expected at a certain site. The odour chain, which starts with the emission and ends with the perception of a resident, was the framework of the 1 st Chinese-Austrian Workshop on Environmental Odour held in Tianjin, China in February 2015. The contributions to this workshop are published in this issue of the Austrian Contributions to Veterinary Epidemiology. The workshop was successful to stimulate the dialogue between China and Austria on air pollution and to develop innovative and successful strategies to handle environmental odour. This bilateral meeting laid paths for the community of scientists involved in odour assessment to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} specific aspects connected to odour problems.

40|$|At {{the end of}} August 1989 {{more than}} 200 scientists, {{government}} officials and representatives of international institutions from 42 different countries gathered in Wageningen in the Netherlands for the sixth conference of the Association of Institutes for Tropical Veterinary Medicine (AITVM). The aim of the meeting, which was sponsored by CTA, the German Foundation for International Development (DSE), the University of Utrecht (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine) and the International Agricultural Centre, was to identify the achievements, difficulties and future prospects {{in the field of}} tropical animal health and production in four main livestock areas (the subject of workshop discussions) : pastoral systems, dairy production systems, livestock production systems of the humid and sub-humid zones, and helminthiasis in tropical areas. An integrated approach covering technical matters, livestock policies and socio-economic aspects was the organizers' goal. The conference proceedings, published in May 1990, contain the scientific papers as well as the workshop summaries, conclusions and recommendations. The recommendations have also been published in a separate volume for wider distribution. Among the principal recommendations of the workshops was that in project planning, the views, needs and interests of the target group should play a decisive role in the formulation of objectives and operations, laying the foundation for active and sustainable participation. Special attention should be given to an inter-disciplinary approach to activities. Farmers' groups should be strengthened. Special efforts in extension, involving women workers, is needed to reach women farmers. Credit systems and pricing policies should be more realistic. The commitment and dedication of extension personnel is essential for earning farmers' confidence and thereby adoption of improvements. Training and motivation of such personnel requires more time and more funds. In the sub-humid tropics the deficiency of animal products makes livestock development particularly sensitive to policy issues, and lack of clear and appropriate policies have been a major impediment to successful project implementation. Both urban and rural communities need less restrictive pricing policies. Finally, appropriate control strategies for helminth infections, adapted to local conditions, should be worked out They should be based on anthelminthic treatments and also on improved management. Further studies on parasites and on the immune response and status of the hosts must be undertaken.

40|$| the Recruitment of Researchers {{that aims}} at {{realising}} good working conditions for early stage researchers. The DK Programme actively supports female talent in science, {{this is done}} by a 30 % quota for females among faculty. From the data {{it became clear that}} among doctoral students nearly a balance in the participation of females and males has been achieved: on average about 46 % {{of the students in the}} DK were females. At the faculty level there was a growing awareness about the goal to increase the percentage of females among the faculty members. Unfortunately the goal has not been realized yet. Depending on the discipline it is hard to realize the integration of a sufficient number of females: in some disciplines there are only a few female professors, also a lack of excellent research among female faculty was mentioned here. Most of the speakers of DK tried to compensate the lack of female faculty by increasing the number of female doctoral students. This practice confronts the speakers of DK with new challenges: practices in achieving a more family friendly work environment are discussed, additionally it was mentioned that more family friendly regulations need to be developed. Universities’ views on the DK Programme In the view of the university managements the FWF Doctoral Programme is an excellence scheme, the DK are internally brand marked as excellent. This view is strongly supported by the quality assurance implemented by the FWF. Because of this excellence confirmed by the FWF allows researchers to request commitment by the university management in terms of additional funds and resources. In this respect the DK are sometimes evaluated as expensive. The kind and amount of support provided for the DK strongly depends on the university’s budget and the actors involved. While representatives of the university management strongly welcome the establishment of a DK as a means to strengthen the profile of their institution. The performance agreements between the universities and the federal government also explicitly consider the establishment of new and the continuation of existent DK. Impact of DK on doctoral training The visibility and the impact of a DK at universities depend to a large extent on the time it has been existing at its host institution. Generally, the majority of (guest) lectures and some other training events are open to all doctoral students at the host institution. Only a number of trainings that have in particular been designed for the DK (like hands on training in laboratories) are limited to the doctoral students of the DK. To what extent the doctoral training in the DK is different from doctoral training outside a DK is mainly dependent on the discipline and also the host institution. At some departments there is actually no difference between the both forms of training, here the DK mainly provide add-ons to doctoral training like the funding of a coordinator, international recruitment, travel costs, research stays abroad, the chance to invite international guest researchers or the funding of summer schools. There are also differences in the way doctoral training inside and outside the DK is organized. In particular in the Life Sciences structural forms of doctoral training are already common. Also in the Natural and Technical Sciences structural forms of doctoral training became more widespread (also depending on the faculty). In the Social Sciences and Humanities structural doctoral training only plays a minor role. In this disciplines the DK only function as a leverage to a very limited extent. This is also due to the fact that there are only a few DK established in these disciplines and that most of these are still young. Thus, doctoral training outside the DK is very different from training inside the DK for these disciplines, and the traditional master-apprenticeship is still prevalent here. In line with this the DK are regarded as highly specialised training centres that in particular prepare for an academic career in the Social Sciences and Humanities. The complementary role of the DK Programme In the recent years Austrian universities started own initiatives in structural doctoral training. These were mostly related to the developments on the European level, in particular the Bologna process. Also the implementation of the DK Programme has contributed to this development as it funds the implementation of structural elements in doctoral training. Besides this, there is a multitude of different initiatives to reform doctoral training in Austria. At the University of Vienna for example the so-called Initiativkollegs have been implemented. These are currently replaced by the Vienna Doctoral Academies and the funding of individual doctorates (uni:docs). At the University of Graz and Technical University of Graz Doctoral Schools have been implemented. Also at Medical Universities PhD programmes became more widespread as these institutions had to change their curricula in line with the Bologna reforms. Some Medical Universities also established doctoral schools, e. g. the Medical University of Graz. Here the guidelines of the FWF DK Programme served as a role model; also the quality assurance of the doctoral schools is organized by the FWF. Summarizing these developments there are a number of initiatives and reforms implemented at universities that build on the experiences that were made within the framework of the FWF DK Programme. For the funding of doctoral candidates a number of different models have been implemented: Some universities (University of Vienna, University of Salzburg, <b>Veterinary</b> University) <b>fund</b> positions for doctoral candidates, also as part-time employment. Other universities do not fund positions for doctoral candidates in the framework of their doctoral schools (e. g. University of Klagenfurt). Some universities also provide additional positions for doctoral candidates in the FWF DK (e. g. Medical University of Vienna), other prolong the funding of doctoral candidates for a limited period in case the funding for the FWF DK stops (e. g. University of Economics Vienna). In total all of these initiatives and activities have a common goal: they motivate to further proceed with the implementation of structural doctoral training and to increase the quality of doctoral studies in Austria. The increase in the quality of doctoral study should include a more sensitive usage of resources and synergies and the strategic linkage of those initiatives to the profile building of the universities. Also, a more tactical approach in the regulation of the so far open access to doctoral studies in Austria should be considered. Nonetheless, when considering further changes it should be clear that the resources of universities are limited, they cannot provide as many ressources as the FWF DK Programme and might in their initiatives not achieve a similar effect. In this respect it has to be stated that the FWF DK has a very important complementary role to the initiatives and activities implemented by universities. The university’s commitment Facing the increasing numbers of applications for the FWF DK Programme and the current budget constraints of the FWF it has to be investigated to what extent the universities will be able to increase their commitment towards the DK. In particular the question to what extent the universities can realistically contribute to the costs of a DK in order to decrease the funding provided by the FWF. Therefore in the evaluation different scenarios on the future funding of the DK have been discussed with the Principal Investigators of the DK and the managing board of universities (Rectors and Vice-Rectors). These discussions revealed that currently the universities will not be able to further contribute to the costs of the DK (besides their actual commitments). Also the fact that the FWF currently does not contribute to the overhead costs of large-scale research projects (and thus also not for the DK) needs to be considered here. Those scenarios that described a situation where the FWF would only provide initial funding or where universities would have to cover an increasing amount of the costs of the DK were rated as inpracticable or even as an illusion given the current tight budget of Austrian universities. Only very few Principal Investigators could image that the funding of the FWF would gradually decline. Summing up the statements of the representatives of universities it can be concluded that most universities already participate to the funding of DK to a large extent (provision of additional funds, additional positions for doctoral students, provision of research infrastructure, reduction of the teaching load for Principal Investigators). In the current situation an additional contribution to the DK was seen as a too big burden for the university’s budget. Conclusion The evaluation of the FWF DK Programme revealed that it is functioning very well. Researchers as well as the university management evaluate the programme as an excellence scheme. The programme achieved most of its goals (good performance in research, implementation of structural elements in doctoral training, internationalisation etc.). The programme also functions as a stimulus for the further reform and improvement of doctoral training in Austria. Here the programme serves as a role model and plays via funding an important complementary role. Nonetheless, experiences from other European countries point to an on-going further reform of doctoral training in the recent years. In particular in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway and Finland) the training component of doctoral training has become central. Also an increase in the number of doctoral graduates should be achieved in these countries. In line with these targets ministries have been changing the funding mechanism related to doctoral training, also universities have been assigned more responsibility in providing a high quality in (structural) doctoral training. In these countries doctoral training is to a large extent funded by the institutions, mostly by earmarked funds. These changes also led to change in the work of the research councils that had to reorient their funding schemes for doctoral candidates/young researchers. So far Austria has been using two different but complementary approaches in doctoral training: on the one hand doctoral training is funded by the global budget of the universities, on the other hand additional means (as the FWF DK Programme) are allocated by competitive means. Both funding mechanism have to be regarded as indispensable and contribute to maintain doctoral training in Austria. For the future the implementation of a unit cost funding model has been included in the intergovernmental agreement. This potential development might also affect the FWF DK Programme, therefore a need to reorient the programme might be considered. Until then the FWF DK Programme should be continued under the premise to fund excellent research and the most talented doctoral students...|$|R
