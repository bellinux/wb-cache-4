5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> in several ways. It is smaller and is less heavily built than the greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> {{and has a}} shorter, thinner tail. The plumage is browner than the greater yellow-headed vulture's dark, glossy black plumage. Its legs are lighter in color, and its head is more orange-tinged than the more yellow head of the greater yellow-headed <b>vulture.</b> Its flight is also less steady {{than that of the}} greater yellow-headed <b>vulture.</b> The lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> also prefers to live in savannas, as opposed to the preferred forest habitat of the greater yellow-headed <b>vulture.</b>|$|E
5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> in several ways. It {{is larger than}} the lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture,</b> with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture.</b> Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> prefers to live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture.</b> The greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> is also somewhat larger than the turkey <b>vulture.</b> It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey <b>vulture</b> but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|E

5|$|New World <b>vultures</b> are not {{closely related}} to Old World <b>vultures,</b> but superficially {{resemble}} them because of convergent evolution.

50|$|<b>Vultures</b> are {{scavenging}} birds, feeding {{mostly from}} es of dead animals without apparent ill effects. Bacteria {{in the food}} source, pathogenic to other vertebrates, dominate the <b>vulture's</b> gut flora, and <b>vultures</b> benefit from the bacterial breakdown of carrion tissue. New World <b>vultures</b> have {{a good sense of}} smell, whereas Old World <b>vultures</b> find carcasses exclusively by sight. A particular characteristic of many <b>vultures</b> is a bald head, devoid of feathers.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and beauty, the king <b>vulture</b> is an {{attraction}} at zoos around the world. The king <b>vulture</b> {{is one of}} several bird species with an AZA studbook, which is kept by Shelly Collinsworth of the Fort Worth Zoo.|$|E
5|$|In natural settings, {{the black}} <b>vulture</b> eats mainly carrion. In areas {{populated}} by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps, but also takes eggs and decomposing plant material and can kill or injure newborn or incapacitated mammals. Like other vultures, it {{plays an important}} role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The black <b>vulture</b> locates food either by sight or by following New World vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses. These vultures—the turkey <b>vulture,</b> the lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture,</b> and the greater yellow-headed vulture—forage by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. Their heightened ability to detect odors allows them to search for carrion below the forest canopy. The black <b>vulture</b> is aggressive when feeding, and may chase the slightly larger turkey <b>vulture</b> from carcasses.|$|E
5|$|It soars high while {{searching for}} food, holding its wings {{horizontally}} when gliding. It flaps in short bursts which {{are followed by}} short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are not as long, forming a smaller wing area. In comparison with the turkey <b>vulture,</b> the black <b>vulture</b> flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight. Like all New World vultures, the black <b>vulture</b> often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation {{of the water in}} the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a syrinx, the black <b>vulture,</b> like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The black <b>vulture</b> is , and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the black <b>vulture</b> will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures. The black <b>vulture</b> generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey <b>vulture,</b> which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.|$|E

5|$|Large and {{predominantly}} white, {{the king}} <b>vulture</b> has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail feathers. The {{head and neck}} are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king <b>vulture</b> has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak. This <b>vulture</b> is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World <b>vulture</b> species from a carcass. King vultures {{have been known to}} live for up to 30 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the turkey}} <b>vulture,</b> this <b>vulture</b> {{is often seen}} {{standing}} in a spread-winged stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, Old World vultures, and storks.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} {{including}} treepies, bulbuls, babblers, mynahs and crows were noted. In 2010, {{the first ever}} bird survey was conducted in the Sathyamangalam forests. A total of 230 species of birds were recorded in the survey. In 2010, a small population of critically endangered Indian <b>vulture</b> (Gyps indicus) and three other species of vultures were discovered to be thriving in the Moyar river valley. 20 nests were sighted and the population was estimated to consist up of 40 adults. Last sighted in {{the region in the}} 1970s, the rediscovery of the <b>vulture,</b> a bird rapidly disappearing from India, has been significant. Diclofenac, which caused the decline of <b>vulture</b> population was banned in 2006 and since then, <b>vulture</b> numbers have started to grow back.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vultures</b> in India live in {{communities}} and are generally very dependent on human activities. The Hindu religion, which represents 80% of the country's population, is particularly favorable to <b>vultures.</b> Cows are considered sacred by majority of Hindus so cow meat {{is generally not}} consumed. This results in the cow's corpse being left to be fed on by <b>vultures.</b> Of the estimated 500 million cattle in India, only 4% were destined for consumption by humans as meat. <b>Vultures</b> constituted the natural animal disposal system, processing carcasses and nearly 15,000 <b>vultures</b> have been observed at the carcass depositories in capital New Delhi.|$|R

5|$|The greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> {{feeds on}} carrion and locates {{carcasses}} by sight and by smell, an ability which {{is rare in}} birds. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the king <b>vulture,</b> to open the hides of larger animal carcasses, as its bill is {{not strong enough to}} do this. Like other New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on flat surfaces, such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds its young by regurgitation.|$|E
5|$|The king <b>vulture</b> (Sarcoramphus papa) {{is a large}} bird {{found in}} Central and South America. It {{is a member of}} the New World <b>vulture</b> family Cathartidae. This <b>vulture</b> lives {{predominantly}} in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. It is the only surviving member of the genus Sarcoramphus, although fossil members are known.|$|E

50|$|However, recent genetic {{studies have}} made it clear that neither New World nor Old World <b>vultures</b> are close to falcons, nor are New World <b>vultures</b> close to storks. Both are basal members of the clade Afroaves, with Old World <b>vultures</b> {{comprising}} several groups within the family Accipitridae, also containing eagles, kites, and hawks, while New World <b>vultures</b> in Cathartiformes are a sister group to Accipitriformes (containing the osprey and secretarybird along with Accipitridae).|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{contribution of}} personal and social information to explain individual and collective behavior in different species and contexts {{is an open question}} in animal ecology. In particular, there is a major lack of studies combining theoretical and empirical approaches to test the relative relevance of different hypothesized individual behaviors to predict empirical collective patterns. We used an individual-based model to confront three hypotheses about the information transfer between social scavengers (Griffon <b>Vultures,</b> Gyps fulvus) when searching for carrion: (1) <b>Vultures</b> only use personal information during foraging ("nonsocial" hypothesis) (2) they create long chains of <b>vultures</b> by following both other <b>vultures</b> that are flying towards carcasses and <b>vultures</b> that are following other <b>vultures</b> that are flying towards carcasses ("chains of vultures" hypothesis) and (3) <b>vultures</b> are only attracted by other <b>vultures</b> that are sinking vertically to a carcass ("local enhancement" hypothesis). The chains of <b>vultures</b> hypothesis has been used in existing models, but never been confronted with field data. Testing is important, though, because these hypotheses could have different management implications. The model was parameterized to mimic the behavior and the densities of both Griffon <b>Vultures</b> and carcasses in a 10 000 -km 2 study area in northeastern Spain. We compared the number of <b>vultures</b> attending simulated carcasses with those attending 25 continuously monitored experimental carcasses in the field. Social hypotheses outperformed the nonsocial hypothesis. The chains of <b>vultures</b> hypothesis overestimated the number of <b>vultures</b> feeding on carcasses the local enhancement hypothesis fitted closely to the empirical data. Supported by our results, we discuss mechanistic and adaptive considerations that reveal that local enhancement may be the key social mechanism behind collective foraging in this and likely other avian scavengers and/or social birds. It also highlights the current need for more studies confronting alternative models of key behaviors with empirical patterns in order to understand how collective behavior emerges in animal societiesPeer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|The exact taxonomic {{placement}} of the California condor and the other six species of New World <b>vultures</b> remains unclear. Though similar in appearance and ecological roles to Old World <b>vultures,</b> the New World <b>vultures</b> evolved from a different ancestor in {{a different part of}} the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World <b>vultures</b> are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World <b>vultures</b> or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World <b>vultures</b> from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.|$|R

5|$|Although it locates food by vision, {{the role}} smell has {{in how it}} {{specifically}} finds carrion has been debated. Consensus has been {{that it does not}} detect odours, and instead follows the smaller turkey and greater yellow-headed vultures, which do have a sense of smell, to a carcass, but a 1991 study demonstrated that the king <b>vulture</b> could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using an olfactory sense. The king <b>vulture</b> primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food. Once it has found a carcass, the king <b>vulture</b> displaces the other vultures because of its large size and strong bill. However, when it is at the same kill as the larger Andean condor, the king <b>vulture</b> always defers to it. Using its bill to tear, it makes the initial cut in a fresh carcass. This allows the smaller, weaker-beaked vultures, which can not open the hide of a carcass, access to the carcass after the king <b>vulture</b> has fed. The vulture’s tongue is rasp-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcass’s bones. Generally, it only eats the skin and harder parts of the tissue of its meal. The king <b>vulture</b> has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of the moriche palm when carrion is scarce in Bolívar state, Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose {{paintings}} of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society. Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2. The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led {{to the use of the}} term as a metaphor for a 'burden'. Other English metaphors derive from birds; <b>vulture</b> funds and <b>vulture</b> investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging <b>vulture.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its size}} and gaudy coloration, this <b>vulture</b> is quite {{inconspicuous}} when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American black <b>vulture,</b> it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This <b>vulture</b> uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king <b>vulture</b> lacks a voice box, although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which may surprise and kill an adult <b>vulture</b> at a carcass.|$|E
