Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Gerold Hightower greet Eddard as he arrives. Bran remarks that Ser Arthur Dayne was the best swordsman his father ever saw.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, L'Enfant's <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grand {{national}} capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad {{station on the}} National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core. What {{became known as the}} McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.|$|E

5|$|Disney {{remains the}} central figure {{in the history of}} animation. Through {{technological}} innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Elphaba and Fiyero {{are both}} taken by {{surprise}} by {{the strength of their}} feelings for each other, and promise to be together always ("As Long As You're Mine"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba suddenly has a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house flying through the sky and Nessarose being in pain. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle that his family owns that she can stay in.|$|E
5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} {{during a break}} from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. It {{presents}} a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed {{to such an extent that}} even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E

5|$|Kaldalis is a protoss zealot and a {{close friend}} of Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis takes pride {{in the history of the}} protoss and the Khala, though does not express {{prejudice}} towards the Nerazim, and believes that driving them away was a sin. A scar runs down his left eye. Kaldalis survived the zerg conquest of Aiur during the Great War. Afterwards, he joined the Protoss Protectorate led by Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis was impressed by Artanis' <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> unified protoss society, the Daelaam: incorporating the cultures of Khalai, Nerazim, Tal'Darim and Purifiers.|$|E
5|$|Kusanagi {{temporarily}} rejoins Section 9 and {{confirms that}} Ito Munei, an influential politician, {{was behind the}} assassination of General Ka Rum. She also confirms that Munei and other politicians {{use it as a}} front for a brainwashing facility to create an elite group of pure-blooded Japanese {{to take control of the}} country in the next generation and lead it into Munei's <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new Golden Age. The Solid State decided to eliminate Munei for interfering in its plans, but Munei was ignorant of the origin of the abduction infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the first}} {{settlers}} lived in caves dug {{out of the river}} bank, but the city grew with construction of homes, churches, and wharves. The new landowners did not share Penn's <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-congested city. Most people bought land along the Delaware River instead of spreading westward towards the Schuylkill. The lots they bought were subdivided and resold with smaller streets constructed between them. Before 1704, few people lived west of Fourth Street.|$|E

5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E
5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind {{her on the}} chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E
5|$|Disney's {{plans for}} the futuristic city of EPCOT {{did not come to}} fruition. After Disney's death, his brother Roy {{deferred}} his retirement to take full control of the Disney companies. He changed the focus of the project from a town to an attraction. At the inauguration in 1971, Roy dedicated Walt Disney World to his brother. Walt Disney World expanded with the opening of Epcot Center in 1982; Walt Disney's <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> functional city was replaced by a park more akin to a permanent world's fair. In 2009, the Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney's daughter Diane and her son Walter E. D. Miller, opened in the Presidio of San Francisco. Thousands of artifacts from Disney's life and career are on display, including numerous awards that he received. In 2014, the Disney theme parks around the world hosted approximately 134 million visitors.|$|E

5|$|In 1602 Frederico Spinola, {{younger brother}} of Ambrogio Spinola had {{distinguished}} himself greatly {{as a soldier}} in the Army of Flanders and had succeeded in 1599 going through the English Channel passing the straits of Dover unmolested; this led to a panic called the Invisible armada as it encouraged suspicions that the attempt might be renewed and on a larger scale. Buoyed by this achievement he had indulged Philip III of Spain, the Duke of Lerma and Martín de Padilla in a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> massive galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders. However the council brought him down to a mere eight galleys, provided at Spinola's expense. He was on his way from San Lucar to Lisbon but he was defeated by Sir Richard Leveson at Sezimbra Bay which cost him two galleys.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, Shakespeare became {{associated}} with rising British nationalism, and Boydell tapped {{into the same}} mood that many other entrepreneurs were exploiting. Shakespeare appealed not only to a social elite who prided themselves on their artistic taste, {{but also to the}} emerging middle class who saw in Shakespeare's works a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diversified society. The mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival was probably most responsible for reintroducing the British public to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus few good tragedies were written. Shakespeare's works filled the gap in the repertoire, and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Scarygirl, {{a young girl}} with an eye patch, a sewn-shut mouth and a hook-capped tentacle for one arm. The girl, an orphan, was raised and cared for by Blister, an intelligent, mustached octopus that built the girl a tree house to live in. Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit that lives {{in the bottom of}} the tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves, where she discovers that one of the keepers of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E
