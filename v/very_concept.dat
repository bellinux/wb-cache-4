One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint, suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated.

At times, however, the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> of the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given {{that it has no}} inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{elementary}} work by Cardano, {{the doctrine of}} probabilities dates to the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal (1654). Christiaan Huygens (1657) gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject. Jakob Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi (posthumous, 1713) and Abraham de Moivre's Doctrine of Chances (1718) treated the subject as a branch of mathematics.

25|$|As {{its title}} suggests, Cvetkovich's book is “organized as ‘an archive of feelings,'” and is “an {{exploration}} of cultural texts as repositories of feelings and emotions, which are encoded {{not only in}} the content of the texts themselves but in the practices that surround their production and reception.” According to Cvetkovich, archives of trauma resemble the archives of gay and lesbian cultures. Not only are ephemera, ephemerality, and memory fundamental to both of these archives, but both also challenge the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> of the archive. Cvetkovich's sources – her archive – include oral interviews, performances, fiction, poetry, memoirs, photographs, and films. Theoretically, she engages with feminist, critical race, Marxist, and queer theory.|$|E
25|$|According to Zbigniew Dumienski, the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> {{of human}} {{trafficking}} is murky and misleading. It {{has been argued}} that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it is an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'. Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.|$|E

5000|$|The Mirror of Production (Le Miroir de la production) is a 1973 book by Jean Baudrillard. It is a {{systematic}} critique of Marxism. Baudrillard's thesis is that Karl Marx’s theory of historical materialism is too rooted in assumptions {{and values of}} political economy to {{provide a framework for}} radical action. The fault of Marxism is in prioritizing the <b>very</b> <b>concepts</b> that founded capital, e.g. necessity, value, and labor.|$|R
25|$|Ford {{created a}} massive {{publicity}} machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and advertisements {{about the new}} product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in virtually every city in North America. A {{large part of the}} success of Ford's Model T stems from the innovative strategy which introduced a large network of sales hubs making it easy to purchase the car. As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to explore the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed– several years posted around 100 percent gains on the previous year.|$|E

500|$|The 20th-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger {{criticized the}} ontological {{assumptions}} underpinning such a reductive model, {{and claimed that}} it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms. This is because, according to Heidegger, the nature of our subjective experience and its qualities is impossible to understand in terms of Cartesian [...] "substances" [...] that bear [...] "properties". Another way to put this is that the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> of qualitative experience is incoherent in terms of—or is semantically incommensurable with the concept of—substances that bear properties.|$|E

The Church has experienced success [...] "converting" [...] college students, particularly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has also gained popularity in several American cities, including San Francisco, Little Rock, and Cleveland. A few Church members have voiced concerns and/or amusement about new members who took the Church too seriously, fearing that they acted like serious cult-followers, the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> that the SubGenius parodies. Stang has expressed concern that the Church's doctrines could exacerbate pre-existing psychoses of mentally ill devotees, although he believes that the Church genuinely helps many adherents.|$|E
500|$|Maxim Osipov of ISKCON {{argued in}} The Sydney Morning Herald that [...] "Avatar" [...] is a [...] "downright misnomer" [...] {{for the film}} because [...] "the movie reverses the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> [...] the term 'avatar'—literally, in Sanskrit, 'descent'—is based on. [...] So much for a {{descending}} 'avatar', Jake becomes a refugee among the aborigines." [...] Vern Barnet in Charlotte Observer likewise thought that the title insults traditional Hindu usage of the term since it is a human, not a god, who descends in the film. [...] However, Rishi Bhutada, Houston coordinator of the Hindu American Foundation, stated that while there are certain sacred terms that would offend Hindus if used improperly, 'avatar' {{is not one of}} them. [...] Texas-based filmmaker Ashok Rao added that 'avatar' does not always mean a representative of God on Earth, but simply one being in another form—especially in literature, moviemaking, poetry and other forms of art.|$|E

The more she worked with the poor in her foundation, the more she adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, [...] "Sometimes I have wished my insults were slaps or lashes. I've wanted to hit people in the face to make them see, if only for a day, what I see each day I help the people." [...] Crassweller writes that Evita became fanatical about her work in the foundation and felt on a crusade against the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> and existence of poverty and social ills. [...] "It is not surprising", writes Crassweller, [...] "that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after 1946, they simultaneously veered toward the transcendental." [...] Crassweller compares Evita to Ignatius Loyola, saying she came to be akin to a one-woman Jesuit Order.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the story Tomiko describes Osden's relationship with the planet, saying [...] "He had taken the fear into himself, and, accepting, had transcended it. He had given up his self to the alien, and unreserved surrender, that left no place for evil. He had learned the love of the Other and thereby had been given his whole self." [...] Osden achieves a completely empathetic relationship with the planet, [...] "both literally and figuratively in touch with the forest;" [...] which also grants him temporary goodwill towards humans, as he says [...] "Listen, I will you well" [...] before leaving his colleagues. Le Guin makes another reference to Marvell's poetry at {{the conclusion}} of the story, which refers to the notion of a planetary consciousness. Marvell's poem [...] "The Garden" [...] speaks of [...] "a green thought in a green shade"; Le Guin describes World 4470 as [...] "one big green thought." [...] Le Guin's depiction of the planetary vegetative intelligence is of something that is [...] "whole, undifferentiated and unconscious." [...] Thus, it finds the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> of other beings terrifying, and it is qualitatively different from animal intelligences.|$|E
