40|$|Performance {{assessment}} and large-scale monitoring of terrestrial digital <b>video</b> broadcasting (DVB-T) <b>transmission</b> <b>apparatuses</b> are currently a pressing need {{due to the}} rapid growth of related broadcasting networks in many countries. Power measurements, in particular, play a very important role since RF and IF signal power, RF channel power, RF and IF power spectrum, noise (or unwanted) power, and power efficiency are relevant parameters to be measured as accurately as possible. Although modern spectrum analyzers and high-performance vector signal analyzers exhibit satisfying accuracy and repeatability, their cost, weight, and size make them unsuitable for the purpose. This paper is focused on the design and realization of a digital signal processing-based meter for power measurement in DVB-T systems that is capable of granting good accuracy, satisfying repeatability, reduced measurement time, and cost effectiveness. This paper deals with the digital signal processing algorithm to be implemented in the meter, paying attention to parametric power spectral density (PSD) estimators for their reduced memory requirement and potentially limited computational burden. In particular, a parametric estimation algorithm that is capable of assuring a fast measurement rate is implemented and made operative. The simulation and emulation stages are properly designed to regulate the most relevant parameters of the adopted PSD estimators according to the specific features of the signals involved; a number of experiments on actual DVB-T signals are conducted, the results of which are compared to those provided by competitive measurement solutions...|$|R

Based on the study {{on the characteristics of}} multi-view video coding and the propagating behavior of transmission error due to random frame losses, a recursive mathematical model is derived to estimate the expected channel-induced distortion at both the frame and sequence levels. The model we develop explicitly considers both temporal and inter-view dependencies, induced by motion-compensated and disparity-compensated coding, respectively. The derived model is applicable to all multi-view video encoders using the classi-cal block-based motion-/disparity-compensated prediction frame-work. Both objective and subjective experimental results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of effectively model channel-induced distortion for multi-view video.
