30|$|Website {{screenshot}} {{images were}} compared for both <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> similarity using luminosity histograms. The luminosity histograms for each matched image pair were compared for similarity by calculating the weighted mean {{between both the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> histograms. Next, both the average and maximum similarity values between histograms were empirically evaluated for clustering accuracy. Taking the average similarity score between the <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> histograms performed best during our evaluation. Once the average <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> similarity score was determined, then the pairwise image distance was calculated as 1 - the pairwise image similarity.|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s, most {{vertically}} scrolling games involved driving. The first vertically scrolling {{video game}} was Taito's Speed Race, released in November 1974. Atari's Hi-way was released eleven months later in 1975. Rapidly there were driving games that combined <b>vertical,</b> <b>horizontal,</b> <b>and</b> even diagonal scrolling, making the vertical-only distinction less important. Both Atari's Super Bug (1977) and Fire Truck (1978) feature driving with multidirectional scrolling. Sega's Monaco GP (1979) is a vertical-only scrolling racing game, but in color.|$|E

Candidates are also taught how to quickly and safely install many types of installations such as, climbing ropes, rope ladders, ferries, and death rides. They are also instructed in the evacuation of injured individuals in rocky and difficult terrain.|$|E

This art is known as chowk-poorana or chowkpurana in Punjab and is given shape by the peasant women of the state. In courtyards, this art is drawn on cloth. The art includes drawing tree motifs, flowers, ferns, creepers, plants, peacocks, palanquins, geometric patterns along with <b>vertical,</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>and</b> oblique lines. These arts add to the festive atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|Cylinders {{and shapes}} with {{rotational}} symmetry are most commonly cast by this technique. [...] "Tall" [...] castings (in {{the direction of}} the settling force acting, usually gravity) are always more difficult than short castings. In the centrifugal casting technique the radius of the rotation, along which the centrifugal force acts, replaces the vertical axis. The casting machine may be rotated to place this in any convenient orientation, relative to gravity's <b>vertical.</b> <b>Horizontal</b> <b>and</b> vertical axis machines are both used, simply to place the casting's longest dimension conveniently horizontal.|$|E

It is a version of the Queen style where the wooden strips were applied to the {{exterior}} of the structure in <b>vertical,</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>and</b> on the diagonal to give it a basket-like quality. [...] Other decorative features were also applied to exterior of this house including the decoratively carved front porch that features an openwork tympanum at its gable end, the diagonal stickwork in the front gable end, a beltcourse of vertical strips {{between the first and second}} floor and molded vergeboards.|$|E

In VLSI circuits, wire routing is carried out by wires running only in <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> directions, due to high computational complexity of the task.

50|$|In Normandy and the Loire Valley of France, farm silos {{were often}} {{attached}} to the main living quarters instead of a separate barn. After World War I, Americans romanticized the traditional French farmhouse, creating a style known as French Normandy. Sided with stone, stucco, or brick, these homes may suggest the Tudor style with decorative half timbering (<b>vertical,</b> <b>horizontal,</b> <b>and</b> diagonal strips of wood set in masonry). The French Normandy style is distinguished by a round stone tower topped by a cone-shaped roof. The tower is usually placed near the centre, serving as {{the entrance to the}} home. French Normandy and French provincial details are often combined to create a style simply called French Country or French Rural carved or embossed on mouldings, sconces, and banisters.|$|E
