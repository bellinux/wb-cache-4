50|$|The {{secret ballot}} is a voting method {{in which a}} voter's choices in an {{election}} or a referendum is anonymous, forestalling attempts to influence the <b>voter</b> by <b>intimidation,</b> blackmailing, and potential vote buying. The system is one means of achieving the goal of political privacy.|$|R
5|$|In December 2006, President Bush {{signed into}} law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal {{legislation}} to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor. In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was {{signed into law}} in September 2007. Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the Deceptive Practices and <b>Voter</b> <b>Intimidation</b> Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections, and the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Assemblies and councils {{operated}} {{according to}} established procedures {{overseen by the}} augurs. They could only be convened by magistrates, and citizens only voted on matters proposed by the presiding magistrate. Over the years, laws were passed which mandated a written ballot, attempted to reduce <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation,</b> and established procedures to watch over voting and prevent voter fraud. For elections, {{it was not a}} matter of who received the most votes, but rather who could first be approved by a majority of the voting blocs. All votes had to be completed within a single day and had to be done again if interrupted or abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The New Black Panther Party <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation</b> {{case is a}} {{political}} controversy in the United States concerning an incident {{that occurred during the}} 2008 election. The New Black Panther Party and two of its members, Minister King Samir Shabazz and Jerry Jackson, were charged with <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation</b> for their conduct outside a polling station in Philadelphia.|$|E

50|$|Typically, law {{enforcement}} does not scour social media for violations that occur en masse. Authorities only take violations seriously {{if they are}} associated with <b>voter</b> fraud or <b>intimidation</b> or a vote-buying scheme.|$|R
50|$|Electoral {{fraud is}} illegal {{interference}} {{with the process of}} an election. Acts of fraud affect vote counts to bring about an election result, whether by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Also called voter fraud, the mechanisms involved include illegal <b>voter</b> registration, <b>intimidation</b> at polls, voting computer hacking, and improper vote counting.|$|R
25|$|The {{hiring of}} 10,000 tribesmen by the Karzai {{government}} to secure polling stations in 21 out of 34 provinces, without uniforms and {{using their own}} guns, also raised questions of <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The conduct {{for which}} members of the New Black Panther Party were accused of <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation</b> took place on Election Day in November 2008, at a polling station in a {{predominantly}} African-American, Democratic voting district of Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|During {{regional}} {{elections of}} 11 October 2009 United Russia won {{a majority of}} seats in almost every Russian municipality. Opposition candidates claim they were hindered from campaigning for the elections and some were denied places on the ballot. There are also accusations of widespread ballot stuffing and <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation,</b> as well as statistical analysis results supporting these accusations.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, battles over county seats were settled in {{elections}} that saw instance of <b>voter</b> fraud, <b>intimidation,</b> and heated debates, {{as seen in}} the relocation of several Washington county seats in the late 19th century: Lincoln County from Sprague to Davenport, and Snohomish County from Snohomish to Everett. In Spokane County, an armed mob from Cheney forcibly seized county records from the elected seat of Spokane Falls (now Spokane) in 1881. Spokane became the county seat in an 1886 election.|$|R
5000|$|A {{county seat}} war is an American {{phenomenon}} that occurred {{mainly in the}} Old West as it was being settled, although similar incidents elsewhere, such as in southeastern Ohio, have also been recorded. [...] As new towns sprang up and county lines were drawn, there was intense competition for the status and tax benefits bestowed by becoming a county seat. These [...] "wars" [...] often involved nothing more than lining up at the ballot box, but sometimes partisans for a particular town would resort to <b>voter</b> fraud, <b>intimidation</b> or violence.|$|R

King, used modern {{statistical}} techniques on {{the election}} returns and concludes: [...] "Application of social science methodology to the gubernatorial election of 1876 in South Carolina confirms charges of fraud raised by Republicans {{at the time of}} the election.... was the product of massive <b>voter</b> fraud and <b>intimidation</b> of black voters." ...|$|R
25|$|According to {{analysts and}} {{opposition}} parties Rajapaksa {{was using the}} Sri Lankan military to depress opposition turnout, particularly amongst the Tamils {{in the north and}} east of the country. On 4 January 2015 international election monitors reported that they had received complaints of <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation</b> and that the army had set up 400 roadblocks to prevent Tamils from voting.|$|E
25|$|Influenced by the {{national}} attention received by Timberlake's selfie inside a voting booth shared on Instagram during the 2016 presidential election, which was at the moment an illegal act, Senator Brian Kelsey of Germantown brought up {{a bill that would}} allow taking photos in voting poll stations, with the exceptions of the acts of committing <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation,</b> fraud or selling a vote. It was later approved by the Tennessee Senate.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, Langston was {{urged to}} run for {{a seat in the}} U.S. House of Representatives by fellow Republicans, both black and white. Leaders of the biracial Readjuster Party, which had held {{political}} power in Virginia from 1879 to 1883, did not support his candidacy. Langston ran as a Republican and lost to his Democratic opponent. He contested the results of the election because of <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation</b> and fraud.|$|E
50|$|In Chicago, {{election}} judges {{said they}} had received automated phone calls between October-November 3 with apparently false instructions about voting or required training, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. In Pontiac, Michigan, local Democrats cited reports of <b>voter</b> harassment and <b>intimidation</b> by Republicans over questioning legally-cast ballots with election workers repeatedly having had {{to ask them to}} step aside. A clerk called police for help.|$|R
50|$|An unfair {{election}} {{is a concept}} used by national and international election monitoring groups to identify when the vote of a people for a government is not free and fair. Unfairness in elections encompasses all varieties of electoral fraud, <b>voter</b> suppression or <b>intimidation,</b> unbalanced campaign finance rules, and imbalanced access to the media. Unfair elections violate the right to vote, which is generally recognised as an essential element to a Deliberative democracy and representative democracy.|$|R
2500|$|Wilson {{stayed in}} office and in 1974 was re-elected amid charges of <b>intimidation,</b> <b>voter</b> fraud, and other abuses. [...] The rate of {{violence}} climbed on the reservation as conflict opened between political factions in the following three years; residents accused Wilson's private militia, Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOONs), of much of it. [...] More than 60 opponents of the tribal government died violently during those years, including Pedro Bissonette, director of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO).|$|R
25|$|The {{election}} year of 1919, saw the political winds of fortune blowing {{strongly in the}} direction of the GOP, not only in Maryland but nationally as well. Convinced and initially backed by Kelly, Nice resigned as assistant State's Attorney and cast his hat into the gubernatorial race. However, Harry Nice then made a costly mistake. In speeches during the campaign, Nice promised to clean up the dirty underworld politics of the Democrats and their political bosses and ensure elections were fair and open to everyone. In this time period ballot stuffing, voter fraud and outright <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation</b> were common place, especially in large cities like Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009 Bartle Bull, {{a former}} civil rights lawyer who was {{serving as a}} poll watcher at the polling station where the {{incident}} occurred, submitted an affidavit at the Department of Justice's request supporting the lawsuit, stating that he considered it {{to have been the}} most severe instance of <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation</b> he had ever encountered. When none of the defendants who were charged appeared in court to answer the charges, the career attorneys pursuing the lawsuit assumed that they would win it by default. However the move to pursue a default judgment was overruled by two of their line superiors, Loretta King, who was acting Assistant Attorney General, and Steve Rosenbaum, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, Smith {{requested}} {{a meeting with}} the head of the Justice Department's Voting Rights Section in order to discuss whether political appointees had been involved in the decision to narrow the case, stating that news reports contradicted the Justice Department's earlier claim that political appointees had not been involved, and that earlier congressional inquiries about this had been unsuccessful. Smith and Wolf also requested that the <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation</b> charges which had been previously been dropped be refiled. In January 2010, after several unsuccessful attempts at obtaining the requested information from the department, Wolf sought a resolution of inquiry that would have forced the Justice Department to provide Congress with the details of why it narrowed the case. In a vote along party lines, the resolution was defeated 15-14.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961 the PNM had {{introduced}} the Representation of the People Bill. This Bill {{was designed to}} modernise the electoral system by instituting permanent registration of voters, identification cards, voting machines and revised electoral boundaries. These changes were seen by the DLP {{as an attempt to}} disenfranchise illiterate rural <b>voters</b> through <b>intimidation,</b> to rig the elections through the use of voting machines, to allow Afro-Caribbean immigrants from other islands to vote, and to gerrymander the boundaries to ensure victory by the PNM. Opponents of the PNM saw [...] "proof" [...] of these allegations when A. N. R. Robinson was declared winner of the Tobago seat in 1961 with more votes than there were registered voters, and {{in the fact that the}} PNM was able to win every subsequent election until the 1980 Tobago House of Assembly Elections.|$|R
500|$|A {{plebiscite}} {{was held}} {{to determine whether the}} citizens of Buenos Aires supported Rosas's reelection and resumption of dictatorial powers. During his governorship from 1829 to 1832, Rosas had reduced the election process to a farce. [...] He had installed loyal associates as justices of the peace, powerful officeholders with administrative and judicial functions who were also charged with tax collection, leading militia and presiding over elections. Through the exclusion of <b>voters</b> and <b>intimidation</b> of the opposition, the justices of the peace delivered any result Rosas favored. Half {{of the members of the}} House of Representatives faced reelection each year, and the opposition to Rosas had quickly been eliminated through rigged elections, allowing him to control the legislature. Control over finances had been stripped from the legislature, and its approval of legislation turned into a rubber stamp to preserve a semblance of democracy. The result of the 1833 election was a predictable 99.9 percent [...] "yes" [...] vote.|$|R
25|$|The {{results of}} the 1955 {{election}} {{have been attributed to}} fraud and <b>intimidation.</b> <b>Voters</b> were intimidated by a voting system involving colored pieces of paper that had to be put into a box in full view of Sihanouk's political figures, soldiers and local police. In many cases, voting results were simply falsified as in the case where a district that had been a Viet Minh stronghold for years did not return a single vote for the far left. Writer Philip Short points to a 1957 statement by Sihanouk admitting that thirty six electoral districts had voted Pracheachon or Democrat majority whereas the official results said that they had won none.|$|R
25|$|The votes {{challenged}} by Miller's team {{were put in}} separate boxes, leaving it to the lawsuit {{to decide whether they}} would be counted for Murkowski. On November 11, the Miller campaign alleged it had received reports of <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation</b> and fraud {{and that it would be}} filing a lawsuit in Alaska state court asking for voters rolls for certain precincts to determine whether the precincts had counted more ballots than there were registered voters. Miller told Fox News Channel on November 18 that his campaign may request a recount, investigate the voting machines, and look into whether the absentee ballots for the military were mailed in a timely fashion. The federal judge held the suit could be decided by reference to State law, and directed Miller to file in State court, which he did on November 22, stopping the certification of election results and possibly delaying the seating of a second Senator for Alaska at the beginning of the new term in January.|$|E
500|$|The electoral {{campaign}} {{was marred by}} widespread <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation,</b> perpetrated by Nkomo's ZAPU, Abel Muzorewa's United African National Council (UANC), and Mugabe's ZANU-PF. Commenting on ZANU-PF's activities in eastern Rhodesia, Nkomo complained that [...] "the word intimidation is mild. People are being terrorised. It is terror." [...] Reacting to ZANU-PF's acts of <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation,</b> Mugabe was called before Soames at Government House. Mugabe regarded the meeting as a British attempt to thwart his {{electoral campaign}}. Under {{the terms of the}} negotiation, Soames had the power to disqualify any political party guilty of <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation.</b> Rhodesia's security services, Nkomo, Muzorewa, and some of his own advisers all called on Soames to disqualify ZANU-PF. After deliberation, Soames disagreed, believing that ZANU-PF were sure to win the election and that disqualifying them would wreck any chance of an orderly transition of power.|$|E
500|$|As the {{campaign}} {{drew to a}} close, both Republicans and Democrats warned {{of the possibility that}} electoral fraud and violence would be perpetrated by the other side. Louisville mayor Charles P. Weaver, a Goebel Democrat, added 500 men to the city's police force just before the election, leading to charges that <b>voter</b> <b>intimidation</b> would occur in that city. Bradley countered by ordering the state militia to be ready to quell any disturbances across the state. On election day, the headline of the Courier-Journal proclaimed [...] "Bayonet Rule".|$|E
40|$|This booklet (a {{joint project}} of the Advancement Project and the Lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law) {{provides}} an extensive overview of restrictive voting laws, especially concerning minority voters. Daniels begins with a summary of <b>voter</b> obstructions and <b>intimidation</b> in the 2012 election, and then places that {{within the context of}} the history of voting and race in America. Most recently, the Section 5 protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were effectively removed by the Shelby County v. Holder Supreme Court decision. Daniels then explains what this means practically and legally for minority voters and how organizations like the Lawyers 2 ̆ 7 Committee and the Advancement Project are working to ensure voters are not unfairly deterred...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{denounced the}} {{referendum}} as fake, with many widespread cases of <b>voter</b> fraud and <b>intimidation</b> of groups trying {{to monitor the}} votes. They also pointed {{to the fact that}} votes were counted by those close to the government. Opposition leader Plácido Micó Abogo claimed that the proposal was not even seen the official text of the constitutional changes. He removed poll watchers after threats of violence, including one of a young supporter who alleged he [...] "was threatened with being tortured by a colonel." [...] Despite these reports, the government claimed the vote had passed peacefully. There was also concern that the provision on term limits would not apply retrospectively, allowing Obiang to run again in 2016, which he did.|$|R
5|$|Politically {{the city}} was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, which had developed a strong political machine. The Republicans dominated the post-war elections, and corrupt officials {{made their way into}} the government and continued to control the city through <b>voter</b> fraud and <b>intimidation.</b> The Gas Trust was the hub of the city’s political machine. The trust controlled the gas company supplying lighting to the city. With the board under complete control by Republicans in 1865, they awarded contracts and perks for themselves and their cronies. Some government reform did occur during this time. The police department was reorganized; and volunteer fire companies were eliminated and were replaced by a paid fire department. A compulsory school act passed in 1895, and the Public School Reorganization Act freed the city's education from the political machine. Higher education changed as well. The University of Pennsylvania moved to West Philadelphia and reorganized to its modern form; and Temple University, Drexel University and the Free Library were founded.|$|R
