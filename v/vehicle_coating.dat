[...] The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive is the main policy instrument for the reduction of industrial emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the European Union. It covers a wide range of solvent using activities, e.g. printing, surface cleaning, <b>vehicle</b> <b>coating,</b> dry cleaning and manufacture of footwear and pharmaceutical products. The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive requires installations in which such activities are applied to comply either with the emission limit values set out in the Directive or with the requirements of the so-called reduction scheme. Article 13 of The Paints Directive, approved in 2004, amended the original VOC Solvents Emissions Directive and limits the use of organic solvents in decorative paints and varnishes and in vehicle finishing products. The Paints Directive sets out maximum VOC content limit values for paints and varnishes in certain applications.|$|E

40|$|Magnesium alloys {{have one}} of the highest {{specific}} strengths of all construction metals used. Specifically, magnesium alloy castings are used in the aerospace industry to reduce the weight of aerospace <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Coating</b> systems must be employed to prevent corrosion of these magnesium alloys as they are also the most corrosion prone construction metals. The use of chromium is employed for the conversion coating which forms the foundation of many of these coating systems. In an effort to phase these harmful chromates out of the coating system and continue to use magnesium alloys, an environmentally friendly conversion coating has been developed. This paper explores the best types of methods used to evaluate the thickness and coating coverage of the environmentally friendly conversion coating. Destructive and nondestructive techniques are developed to examine the thickness and surface coverage of this environmentally friendly coating. Specifically an eddy current measurement technique, light, confocal, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy techniques are used to determine the coating thickness of the environmentally friendly coating through destructive evaluation. Three nondestructive evaluation techniques, including polarized light microscopy, infrared spectroscopy (Fourier Transform and Raman) and an infrared proximity sensor are used to determine surface coverage of the environmentally friendly coating...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTopical microbicides are an {{emerging}} HIV/AIDS prevention modality. Microbicide biofunctionality requires {{creation of a}} chemical-physical barrier against HIV transmission. Barrier effectiveness derives from properties of the active compound and its delivery system, but {{little is known about}} how these properties translate into microbicide functionality. We developed a mathematical model simulating biologically relevant transport and HIV-neutralization processes occurring when semen-borne virus interacts with a microbicide delivery <b>vehicle</b> <b>coating</b> epithelium. The model enables analysis of how vehicle-related variables, and anti-HIV compound characteristics, affect microbicide performance. Results suggest HIV neutralization is achievable with postcoital coating thicknesses ∼ 100 μm. Increased microbicide concentration and potency hasten viral neutralization and diminish penetration of infectious virus through the coating layer. Durable vehicle structures that restrict viral diffusion could provide significant protection. Our findings demonstrate the need to pair potent active ingredients with well-engineered formulation vehicles, and highlight the importance of the dosage form in microbicide effectiveness. Microbicide formulations can function not only as drug delivery vehicles, but also as physical barriers to viral penetration. Total viral neutralization with 100 -μm-thin coating layers supports future microbicide use against HIV transmission. This model {{can be used as a}} tool to analyze diverse factors that govern microbicide functionality...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vehicle</b> <b>coating</b> is an {{important}} component of automotive manufacturing. The paint shop constitutes the plurality of initial investment in an automotive assembly plant, consumes the majority of energy used in the plant's operation, and generates significant waste from paint overspray. The coating process also results in the emission of polluting volatile organic compounds (VOCs). New paint technologies based upon powder coatings offer reductions in VOC emissions along with potentially reduced energy usage and the ability to reuse paint overspray. However, quantification of these advantages requires clear understanding of the life cycle costs associated with each paint technology, modeled over the decades-long time horizons within which a paint shop operates. Life cycle cost models go beyond acquisition cost to consider all relevant cost drivers for a given system. This includes obvious candidates such as investment and operating costs, but also may include more subtle factors such as costs associated with variation, disruption, or flexibility, hereafter referred to as hidden costs. (cont.) In this thesis, methods for estimating these costs for a paint shop are explored. First, the development of a life cycle cost modeling tool, capable of quickly forecasting investment and operating costs and testing the sensitivity of life cycle cost to changes in input costs, is discussed. This tool is then used to compare the life cycle cost of three different primer surfacer application technologies. Next, the potential impact of hidden costs on life cycle cost for manufacturing systems are investigated, both through real-world examples and simulations. Finally, this thesis explores the wider implications of a shift to life cycle cost analysis for General Motors, in terms of both internal and external relationships for the Global Paint and Polymers Center at General Motors, and identifies situations in which a focus on life cycle cost can bolster managerial objectives. by Christopher W.

50|$|The {{efficacy}} of weatherstripping can be significantly increased by specialty coatings during manufacture. Coatings for weatherstripping must adhere {{to all of}} these weatherstrip materials. Like other paints and coatings, a large variety of weatherstrip coatings are commonly available, with a large variety of coating performances. Silicone is the most difficult to adhere to, but at least one coating is commercially available. After bonding to the weatherstrip, these coatings provide chemical and ultraviolet resistance, decrease the static coefficient of friction (thereby reducing the force required to open or close doors), and reduce or eliminate noise. In <b>vehicles</b> without <b>coated</b> weatherstripping, the weatherstripping is much more likely to cause the above-mentioned issues along with others such as rust following premature failure of the paint. That some cars have non-coated weatherstripping is surprising, given that the cost of the coating is less than US$1 to US$3 per vehicle, whereas the rubber and steel is tens of dollars; an entire car set of weatherstripping may be worth US$100 to US$300 in the total cost of the vehicle, which includes all labor and costs of the manufacturing equipment.|$|R

To address this need, we synthesized and characterized a biocompatible drug delivery <b>vehicle</b> following surface <b>coating</b> of Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with a polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). The polymeric shell of these engineered nanoparticles was loaded with a potential anti-cancer drug quercetin and their suitability for targeting lung cancer cells via nebulization was evaluated. ResultsAverage particle size of the developed MNPs and PLGA-MNPs as measured by electron microscopy was 9. 6 and 53. 2 nm, whereas their hydrodynamic swelling as determined using dynamic light scattering was 54. 3 nm and 293. 4 nm respectively. Utilizing a series of standardized biological tests incorporating a cell-based automated image acquisition and analysis procedure in combination with real-time impedance sensing, we confirmed that the developed MNP-based nanocarrier system was biocompatible, as no cytotoxicity was observed when up to 100 mug/ml PLGA-MNP {{was applied to the}} cultured human lung epithelial cells. Moreover, the PLGA-MNP preparation was well-tolerated in vivo in mice when applied intranasally as measured by glutathione and IL- 6 secretion assays after 1, 4, or 7 days post-treatment. To imitate aerosol formation for drug delivery to the lungs, we applied quercitin loaded PLGA-MNPs to the human lung carcinoma cell line A 549 following a single round of nebulization. The drug-loaded PLGA-MNPs significantly reduced the number of viable A 549 cells, which was comparable when applied either by nebulization or by direct pipetting. ConclusionWe have developed a magnetic core-shell nanoparticle-based nanocarrier system and evaluated the feasibility of its drug delivery capability via aerosol administration.

40|$|Abstract Background Aerosolized {{therapeutics}} hold {{great potential}} for effective treatment of various diseases including lung cancer. In this context, there is an urgent need to develop novel nanocarriers suitable for drug delivery by nebulization. To address this need, we synthesized and characterized a biocompatible drug delivery <b>vehicle</b> following surface <b>coating</b> of Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with a polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). The polymeric shell of these engineered nanoparticles was loaded with a potential anti-cancer drug quercetin and their suitability for targeting lung cancer cells via nebulization was evaluated. Results Average particle size of the developed MNPs and PLGA-MNPs as measured by electron microscopy was 9. 6 and 53. 2 nm, whereas their hydrodynamic swelling as determined using dynamic light scattering was 54. 3 nm and 293. 4 nm respectively. Utilizing a series of standardized biological tests incorporating a cell-based automated image acquisition and analysis procedure in combination with real-time impedance sensing, we confirmed that the developed MNP-based nanocarrier system was biocompatible, as no cytotoxicity was observed when up to 100 μg/ml PLGA-MNP {{was applied to the}} cultured human lung epithelial cells.

40|$|NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is {{developing}} a new deployable launch system capability to support a small class of launch vehicles for NASA and commercial space companies to test and launch their vehicles. The deployable launch pad concept was first demonstrated {{on a smaller scale}} at KSC in 2012 in support of NASA Johnson Space Center's Morpheus Lander Project. The main objective of the Morpheus Project was to test a prototype planetary lander as a vertical takeoff and landing test-bed for advanced spacecraft technologies using a hazard field that KSC had constructed at the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF). A steel pad for launch or landing was constructed using a modular design that allowed it to be reconfigurable and expandable. A steel flame trench was designed as an optional module that could be easily inserted in place of any modular steel plate component. The concept of a transportable modular launch and landing pad may also be applicable to planetary surfaces where the effects of rocket exhaust plume on surface regolith is problematic for hardware on the surface that may either be damaged by direct impact of high speed dust particles, or impaired by the accumulation of dust (e. g., solar array panels and thermal radiators). During the Morpheus free flight campaign in 2013 - 14, KSC performed two studies related to rocket plume effects. One study compared four different thermal ablatives that were applied to the interior of a steel flame trench that KSC had designed and built. The second study monitored the erosion of a concrete landing pad following each landing of the Morpheus vehicle on the same pad located in the hazard field. All surfaces of a portable flame trench that could be directly exposed to hot gas during launch of the Morpheus <b>vehicle</b> were <b>coated</b> with four types of ablatives. All ablative products had been tested by NASA KSC and/or the manufacturer. The ablative thicknesses were measured periodically following the twelve Morpheus free flight tests. The thermal energy from the Morpheus rocket exhaust plume was only found to be sufficient to cause appreciable ablation of one of the four ablatives that were tested. The rocket exhaust plume did cause spalling of concrete during each descent and landing on a landing pad in the hazard field. The Extended Abstract ASE Earth and Space Conference April, 2016 - Orlando, FL concrete surface was laser scanned following each Morpheus landing, and the total volume of spalled concrete that eroded between the first and final landings of the Morpheus Project's test campaign was estimated. This paper will also describe a new deployable launch system (DLS) capability that is being developed at KSC and was publicly announced in May 2015 (KSC Partnerships, 2015). The DLS is a set of multi-user Ground Support Equipment that will be used to test and launch small class launch vehicles. The system is comprised of four main elements: the Launch Stand, the Flame Deflector, the Pad Apron and the KAMAG transporter. The system elements are designed to be deployed at launch or test sites within the KSC/CCAFS boundaries. The DLS is intended to be used together with the Fluid and Electrical System of the Universal Propellant Servicing Systems and Mobile Power Data and Communications Uni...|$|R
40|$|Five {{studies were}} {{designed}} to characterize {{the effects of a}} non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, on ovarian function in cattle. The general hypothesis was that non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors have potential as a steroid-free option for the control of ovarian function for the purposes of fixed-time artificial insemination and embryo production. The specific objectives were to determine the effect of route and vehicle, type of aromatase inhibitor, and duration of aromatase inhibitor treatment (short vs prolonged) on ovarian follicles in cattle, and to test the efficacy of an aromatase inhibitor-based protocol to synchronize ovulation in cattle. In the first experiment, heifers were treated with letrozole intravenously (n= 10) or intramuscularly (n= 10) or allocated in iv and im control groups (n= 5 /group). During the second experiment, heifers were divided randomly into two groups (n= 15 /group) and an intravaginal device containing 1 g of letrozole or a blank device (control) was inserted. The third experiment was designed with the goal of formulating and testing an intravaginal device that provides biologically active circulating concentrations of an aromatase inhibitor for a minimum of 4 days. The biological significance of the pharmacokinetic differences between the letrozole intravaginal devices resulting from the third study was evaluated during the fourth study. A final study was designed to determine the effect of stage of the estrous cycle on the proportion of animals that ovulated and the synchrony of ovulation of heifers treated with an aromatase inhibitor-based ovulation-synchronization protocol and to determine subsequent pregnancy outcomes. In all the studies, the effects of aromatase inhibitor on ovarian function were assessed by transrectal ultrasound examination of the ovaries, and blood samples were collected for hormone concentration determination. Results demonstrated that route of administration, or more precisely, the nature of iii the vehicle used for the administration of letrozole (intravenous, intramuscular depot, short release intravaginal or prolonged release intravaginal) has an impact on the effects of letrozole on hormonal profiles and ovarian dynamics. The intramuscular route appeared to provide a prolonged release of letrozole from the injection site which had a marked effect on estradiol production, dominant follicle lifespan, and CL form and function. Letrozole treatment during the ovulatory follicle wave by means of a gel-based intravaginal releasing device during the second study resulted in more rapidly growing dominant follicles and larger ovulatory follicles, delayed ovulation (by 24 h) of a single follicle and formation of a CL that secreted higher levels of progesterone. A wax-based vehicle allowed for a steady and continuous delivery of the active compound over the treatment period. During the third study, the addition of a letrozole-containing gel coating increased the rate of initial absorption and hastened the increase on plasma concentrations of the active ingredient, while the letrozole-containing wax-based vehicle prolonged drug-delivery from the intravaginal device. When tested in vivo during the fourth study, we confirmed that letrozole-impregnated intravaginal devices formulated with a wax base plus a gel <b>coat</b> <b>vehicle</b> was most suitable for the application of a letrozole-based protocol for the synchronization of ovulation in cattle, since it effectively delivered elevated concentrations of letrozole, and reduced estradiol production resulting in increased follicular growth and lifespan, without adversely affecting progesterone production. The application of a letrozole-impregnated intravaginal device for 4 days, combined with PGF treatment at device removal and GnRH 24 h post-device removal increased the percentage of ovulations and synchrony of ovulation in cattle, regardless the stage of the estrous cycle at initiation of treatment. As observed in previous studies, the effects observed could be associated with an increase in circulating LH iv concentrations. However, the effects of treatment on gonadotropin concentrations are inconclusive, possibly due to inadequate sampling frequency. The impact of letrozole treatment of oocyte fertility remains unknown. The results of the five experiments support our general hypothesis that non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors have potential as a steroid-free option for the control of ovarian function in cattle. However, further research is needed in order to elucidate the effects of letrozole treatment during the proestrous on oocyte competence and fertility of the resulting ovulations in cattle...|$|R
