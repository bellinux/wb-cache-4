40|$|The {{arrival of}} the aged society, the changes of disease {{structure}} and social conditions stimulate a transition to home nursing care from facilities for nursing care. The {{purpose of this study}} was to clarify the factors related to a self-evaluation scale about <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care. The research design was a cross-sectional mailed survey with a self-administered questionnaire. The sample was 574 <b>visiting</b> <b>nurses</b> in 287 <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care stations in Osaka Prefecture. The response rate was 39. 9 %. In this study, we newly developed measurements for the work-site environment, communication skills, and a self-evaluation scale about <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care. Expert reviews confirmed the face validity of the measurements and reliability analysis (Cronbach's α) confirmed the reliability (internal consistency) for the measurements. In addition, we analyzed the structure of sub-scale in each measurement by using the principal component analysis with Varimax rotation. The dependent variable was the self-evaluation about <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care. The independent variables were basic attribute, job training system, work-site environments, communication skills, and psychological situation (Maslack's Burnout Inventory). As a result of the principal component analysis of the self-evaluation scale about <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care, we identified 5 subscales: support for daily activities, assessments of physical condition, support for continuing home care, medical treatment, and terminal care. Cronbach's α of the self-evaluation scale of <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care was over 0. 8, and it had internal consistency. From the results of the multiple regression analysis, the following were indicated as relation factors: the 5 sub-scales on nursing care and 2 factors of communication skills: listening, acceptance, and empathic attitude, and informed consent. In order to improve the quality of <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care, it is necessary to clarify the peculiar communication skills required in <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> care, and to provide on-the-job training program in communication skills...|$|R

25|$|Countess Sztáray {{noticed a}} small brown stain above the empress's left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not {{recovered}} consciousness, she informed {{the captain of}} her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, {{the wife of the}} hotel director, a <b>visiting</b> <b>nurse,</b> and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands. No matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.|$|E

2500|$|Wald {{founded the}} Henry Street Settlement. The {{organization}} {{attracted the attention}} of prominent Jewish philanthropist Jacob Schiff, who secretly provided Wald with money to more effectively help the [...] "poor Russian Jews" [...] whose care she provided. By 1906 Wald had 27 nurses on staff, and she succeeded in attracting broader financial support from such gentiles as Elizabeth Milbank Anderson. By 1913 the staff had grown to 92 people.

By 1893, she left medical school and started to teach a home class on nursing for poor immigrant families on New York City's Lower East Side at the Hebrew Technical School for Girls. Shortly thereafter, she began to care for sick Lower East Side residents as a <b>visiting</b> <b>nurse.</b> Along with another nurse, Mary Brewster, she moved into a spartan room near her patients, in order {{to care for them}} better.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} Home <b>Visiting</b> <b>Nursing</b> Service Need Assessment Form (HVNS-NAF) to {{standardize}} {{the decision about}} the need for home <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> service. Methods: The sample consisted of older adults who had received coordinated services by care managers. We defined the need for home <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> service by elderly individuals as the decision of the need by a care manager so that the elderly can continue to live independently. Explanatory variables included demographic factors, medical procedure, severity of illness, and caregiver variables. Multiple logistic regression was carried out after univariate analyses to decide the variables to include and the weight of each variable in the HVNS-NAF. We then calculated the sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off value, and defined the score with the highest sensitivityand specificity as the cut-off value. Results: Nineteen items were included in the final HVNS-NAF. When the cut-off value was 2 points, the sensitivity was 77. 0 %, specificity 68. 5 %, and positive predictive value 56. 8 %. Conclusions: HVNS-NAF is the first validated standard based on characteristics of elderly clients who required home <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> service. Using the HVNS-NAF may result in reducing the unmet need for home <b>visiting</b> <b>nursing</b> service and preventing hospitalization. </p...|$|R

2500|$|The {{field of}} health {{advocacy}} also has deeper {{roots in the}} voluntary organization sector of society, where the early health advocates were more typically advocating for a cause, not for an individual. [...] These health advocates preceded hospital-based patient advocates and {{are part of a}} long history of American involvement in social organizations. [...] They were activists in social movements and voluntary associations including civic organizations, women's associations and labor organizations, and in the early disease-specific non-profits like the American Cancer Society (founded as the American Society for the Control of Cancer in 1913) or the March of Dimes (founded as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis in 1938). [...] In {{the early part of the}} 20th century these advocates came to their work through other professional routes, often as social workers, attorneys, public health nurses or doctors. [...] They were the Progressive era [...] "new women" [...] of Hull House and the Children's Bureau, the American Association for Labor Legislation leaders of the movement in 1919 for national health insurance, the nurses who worked with Lillian Wald to advocate for indigent health care through <b>Visiting</b> <b>Nurse</b> Services (1893), or with the Maternity Center Association (1918) to advocate for maternal and infant care for poor immigrants.
