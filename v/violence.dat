40|$|Domestic <b>violences</b> {{are very}} common and {{constitute}} a criminal offence. Women are mainly victims {{but can also}} be perpetrators. Domestic <b>violences</b> have a major health impact on people, families and society.

Management must involve an efficient network taking into account individual, family, community and social factors. In this context, use of regularly updated information from official websites is mandatory...|$|R
