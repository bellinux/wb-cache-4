25|$|The {{principal}} item {{of equipment}} for a cavalryman was the horse {{and one of the}} reasons both North and South initially hesitated in forming mounted units was because of financial considerations; each cavalry regiment cost $300,000 for initial organization with annual upkeep expenses tallying over $100,000. Both cavalries originally required recruits or local communities to provide horses, a policy that lasted briefly in the North, while the South maintained it throughout the war even though Richmond leaders recognized its serious drawbacks. While Confederate troopers bore the monetary cost of keeping themselves mounted, Union cavalrymen rode quartermaster issued animals obtained though public contracts (although officers had to reimburse the cost of their mounts to the government). While open to fraud early in the war, once tightened regulations and stringent inspections were enforced, the contract system yielded an estimated 650,000 horses for Union armies during the war exclusive of an additional 75,000 confiscated in Confederate territory. Union army guidelines for cavalry horse selection mandated animals be at least 15 hands high, weighing minimally 950 pounds and aged between 4 and 10 years old, and be well-broken to bridle and saddle. Animals were to be dark colors and free from defects such as shallow breathing, deformed hooves, spavin or ringbone. Geldings were preferred for cavalry horses with the purchase of mares strictly prohibited outside absolute military emergency and stallions' volatility and aggressiveness made them generally unsuitable for service. In the Confederacy, limited horse numbers did not permit such selectivity in trying to keep their armies horsed. Cavalry horse prices varied throughout the war; in 1861 the maximum government price for cavalry horses was $119. However, relentless military demand caused prices to continually increase and by 1865 prices hovered near $190 per head. In the Confederacy horse prices rapidly spiraled upward due to animal scarcity and inflation costing over $3,000 by war's end. The daily feed ration for Union cavalry horses was ten pounds of hay and fourteen pounds of grain which were ample and fulfilled the animals' nutritional needs if of good quality, however, the vagaries of the army supply system did not always insure prescribed forage amounts were delivered where most needed. On both sides volunteer officers often proved notably lax in promoting strict animal welfare, a shortcoming exacerbated by the absence of a trained and organized veterinary corps which allowed serious maladies like strangles, grease heel, farcy, and glanders to spread among army stock. The U.S. Congress finally created the rank of veterinary sergeant in March 1863, but the meager pay and rank held no inducement for qualified candidates to join the army. Repeated calls to establish a professional military <b>veterinary</b> <b>service</b> failed, and widespread waste, suffering, and destruction among army horses resulted; not until 1916 was an official U.S. army veterinary corps founded.|$|E

30|$|Only a {{very small}} {{percentage}} (4 %) of the camel owners of the present study consult <b>veterinary</b> <b>services.</b> This is low, considering the important input of veterinary care in animal husbandry. Similarly, a previous study in Nigeria reported low patronage of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> with only 21.1 % of camel farmers consulting modern <b>veterinary</b> <b>services,</b> as most respondents prefer traditional methods of treatment (Chafe et al. 2008). However, the low patronage of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> was mainly attributed to lack of available <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> (Chafe et al. 2008). The importance of patronizing veterinary care cannot be over-emphasized as past studies revealed that access to <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> considerably reduced camel calves’ mortality (Simpkin 1985). Access to veterinary care have also been shown to improve sexual maturity, hence reducing age of cow at first calving (Megersa et al. 2008). However, other factors such as inadequate plane of nutrition could also delay sexual maturity (Mukasa-Mugerwa 1981).|$|R
40|$|The {{economics}} of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> delivery among commercial poultry farmers was investigated using primary {{data collected from}} 60 respondents (50 commercial poultry farmers and 10 veterinary officers) {{with the aid of}} structured questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed using a combination of descriptive statistics (i. e. mean, percentage, standard deviation, table) and inferential statistics (i. e. multiple regression model). The results of the study showed that though the <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> delivery was structured into public and private sectors majority (60. 9 %) of the commercial poultry farmers demanded and obtained <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> from the public sector. The estimated cost function of commercial poultry farm in the study area revealed that the cost of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> significantly affected the total cost of poultry output (p = 0. 01). The estimated demand function for <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> indicated that the scale of production and distance to the nearest veterinary office were the significant determinants of the demand for <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> in the study area. The finding of the study further revealed that the propensity to supply <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> was mainly influenced by demand of poultry farmers (0. 8) and effective price {{that they are willing to}} pay (0. 8). It was recommended among others that private individuals should be encouraged by policy to participate in <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> delivery. The issue of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> should be considered important in any development programme in the poultry industry in Delta State, Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{issues in}} the delivery of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> to the poor in Kenya. Utilising a simplified livelihood approach, the study found that livestock most often functioned as a means of gaining social approbation rather than a risk mitigation strategy. In regard to the delivery of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services,</b> three key parameters were evaluated: access, acceptability and affordability. The assessment revealed that access to <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> rather than affordability is the primary constraint. However, few herders and farmers were spending close to the estimated 'ideal' on livestock drugs. Knowledge regarding livestock health was poor, further contributing to the overall low uptake of <b>veterinary</b> goods and <b>services.</b> Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
