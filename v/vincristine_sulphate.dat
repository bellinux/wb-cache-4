Thirty rats were distributed into six groups (n= 5). The treatments were applied {{once a week}} for two weeks. Sample collection was performed in the third week. Treatments during the first week were: G 1 (control) - physiologic solution, G 2 - <b>vincristine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (4 mg/m²), G 3 - physiologic solution, G 4 - physiologic solution, G 5 - <b>vincristine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (4 mg/m²), and G 6 - <b>vincristine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (4 mg/m²). In the second week, they were: G 1 (control) - physiologic solution, G 2 - physiologic solution, G 3 - nandrolone decanoate (1. 8 mg/kg- 1), G 4 - nandrolone decanoate (10 mg/kg- 1), G 5 - nandrolone decanoate (1. 8 mg/kg- 1), and G 6 - nandrolone decanoate (10 mg/kg- 1). Lipid peroxidation increased with the isolated use of vincristine and nandrolone decanoate, and with vincristine associated to the highest dose of the ester as well.

In the present study, {{we have tried to}} find out the anthelmintic activity, total phenolic contents and cytotoxicity of the methanolic extract of the target plant. Methods: Anthelmintic activity was assessed applying five different concentrations of the plant extract and recording the time of paralysis and death. Total phenolic contents were determined using Folin-Ciocaltu method, using Gallic acid as standard; while brine shrimp lethality test (BSLT) method was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the plant extract, where <b>vincristine</b> <b>sulphate</b> and DMSO was used as positive and negative control respectively. Result: The lowest time for paralysis and death of worms, for test sample at highest concentration (50 mg/ml), were found 24 ± 0. 45 and 46. 4 ± 0. 60 min respectively, which gradually increased with the decrease of concentration. On the other hand, albendazole, which was used as standard, caused paralysis and death of worms at 56. 2 ± 0. 20 min and 77. 4 ± 0. 24 min respectively; whereas no mortality of the worms was observed, when distilled water was used as control.

Both types of paracrystal are induced in sea-urchin eggs in the presence of VLB at a time when tubulin subunits would not normally polymerize. Possible mechanisms for tubulin activation and the induction of paracrystal formation are discussed in respect to the available information on the binding sites of the tubulin subunits...|$|E
40|$|The {{petroleum}} ether, chloroform and methanol crude extracts of the {{two different}} plant parts (leaves and bark) of Mirabilis jalapa (Nyctaginaceae) were screened for cytotoxicity by brine shrimp lethality bioassay and the crude methanol extract of the bark was screened for antioxidant activity using the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 picrylhydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay. The petroleum ether extract of the bark showed significant cytotoxic activity with the LC 50 value 8. 12 g/ml compared to <b>vincristine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (LC 50 0. 33 g/ml). On the other hand, the methanol crude extract of the bark showed mild antioxidant activity with the IC 50 value 598. 02 µg/ml compared to ascorbic acid(IC 50 70. 985 g/ml). Above results suggest moderate cytotoxic and antioxidant activity of the extract...|$|E
30|$|Gallic acid, ascorbic acid, tricholoroacetic acid, {{potassium}} ferricyanide, ferric chloride, acetic acid, sodium monobasic phosphate, sodium dibasic phosphate, {{sodium carbonate}} and sodium chloride were purchased from Merck, Germany. DPPH, Folin-Chiocalteu’s reagent {{was obtained from}} Sigma-Aldrich, USA. <b>Vincristine</b> <b>sulphate</b> was collected from Cipla, India, diclofenac sodium from Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Bangladesh, and morphine from popular Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Bangladesh. For HPLC analysis, 11 (eleven) known phenolic compounds, gallic acid (GA), (+)-catechin hydrate (CT), vanillic acid (VA), caffeic acid (CA), (−)-epicatechin (EC), p-coumaric acid (PCA), rutin hydrate (RH), ellagic acid (EA), myricetin (MC), kaempferol (KF) and quercetin (QU) were used and procured from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Solvents used as mobile phase in HPLC were acetonitrile (HPLC grade), methanol (HPLC grade) and acetic acid (HPLC grade) was purchased from Merck (Germany).|$|E
