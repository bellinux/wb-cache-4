5|$|Pankhurst {{was spared}} further {{force-feeding}} attempts after this incident, but {{she continued to}} <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and – when imprisoned – starve herself in protest. During the following two years she was arrested numerous times but was frequently released after several days because of her ill-health. Later, the Asquith government enacted the Cat and Mouse Act, which allowed similar releases for other suffragettes facing ill-health due to hunger strikes. Prison officials recognised the potential public relations disaster that would erupt if the popular WSPU leader were force-fed or allowed to suffer extensively in jail. Still, police officers arrested her during talks and as she marched. She tried to evade police harassment by wearing disguises and eventually the WSPU established a jujutsu-trained female bodyguard squad to physically protect her against the police. She and other escorts were targeted by police, resulting in violent scuffles as officers tried to detain Pankhurst.|$|E
5|$|The director's {{original}} cut of Sholay has {{a different}} ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board {{was concerned about the}} violence, and that viewers may be influenced to <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198minutes long.|$|E
25|$|National {{attention}} came Tennessee's way {{during the}} trial of John T. Scopes, also called the Scopes Trial.

Some local boosters in Dayton, Tennessee concocted a scheme to have Scopes, a high school biology teacher, <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and stand trial as a way of drawing publicity and visitors to the town.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the federal}} {{regulatory}} scheme {{under which the}} AA had been organizing began to collapse. The National Labor Board (NLB), which attempted to enforce Section 7(a) of the NIRA, lacked the powers necessary to enforce the act, and employers had begun to ignore the Board and <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> Senator Robert F. Wagner, co-author of the NIRA, had begun to write new legislation {{in the fall of}} 1933 to more fully lay out the rights of workers in the U.S. and establish a new agency to enforce these rights. Wagner introduced his legislation on March 1, 1934.|$|E
25|$|While at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Cruz {{represented}} Pfizer in {{a lawsuit}} brought {{by a group of}} public hospitals and community health centers who accused the drug manufacturer of overcharging. The Supreme Court eventually threw the case out. Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award. Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was why she had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award. Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case. Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired thirty days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won on a second appeal using the same argument.|$|E
25|$|The {{first law}} of {{thermodynamics}} is so general that its predictions cannot all be directly tested. In many properly conducted experiments {{it has been}} precisely supported, and never violated. Indeed, within its scope of applicability, the law is so reliably established, that, nowadays, rather than experiment being considered as testing the accuracy of the law, it is more practical and realistic to think of the law as testing the accuracy of experiment. An experimental result that seems to <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> may be assumed to be inaccurate or wrongly conceived, for example due to failure to account for an important physical factor. Thus, some may regard it as a principle more abstract than a law.|$|E
40|$|Several {{papers have}} noted {{and sought to}} explain the paradox of minimum wage law compliance.

25|$|Along with Jiangxi, Henan {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{unbalanced}} gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's one-child policy (many parents do not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government. Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1–4 age group; this might be a strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the hukou in order to escape fines.|$|E
25|$|On four {{occasions}} since 1990, the Middletown Times-Herald Record has run lengthy investigative {{articles on}} claims of electoral {{fraud in the}} village. A 1996 article found that Kiryas Joel residents who were students at yeshivas in Brooklyn had on many occasions apparently registered and voted in both the village and Brooklyn; a year later the paper reported that it had happened again. In 2001 absentee ballots were apparently cast by voters who did not normally reside in the village. In some cases, ballots were cast by people who seemed to reside in Antwerp, Belgium, without a set date of expected return and thus {{would not be allowed}} under New York law to vote in any election for state or local office. That article led to a county grand jury investigation in 2001, which concluded that while procedures were not followed and many mistakes were made, {{there was no evidence of}} deliberate intent to <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{assuming}} a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides {{to walk across}} a room, it is generally understood {{that the decision to}} do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. The problem is that if there is something totally nonphysical causing a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no physical event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the physical energy for the firing came from. Such interactions would violate the fundamental laws of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of the conservation of energy. Dualistic interactionism has therefore been argued against in that it violates a general heuristic principle of science: the causal closure of the physical world.|$|E

500|$|The {{publishing}} company sought an injunction {{to prevent the}} ban, and the case came before Judge Hand. In July 1917, he ruled that the journal should not be barred from distribution through the mail. Though The Masses supported those who refused {{to serve in the}} forces, its text did not, in Hand's view, tell readers that they must <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> Hand argued that suspect material should be judged on what he called an [...] "incitement test": only if its language directly urged readers to <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was it seditious—otherwise freedom of speech should be protected. This focus on the words themselves, rather than on their effect, was novel and daring; but Hand's decision was promptly stayed, and later overturned on appeal. He always maintained that his ruling had been correct. Between 1918 and 1919, he attempted to convince Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, a man he greatly admired, of his argument. His efforts at first appeared fruitless, but Holmes' dissenting opinion in Abrams v. United States in November 1919 urged greater protection of political speech. Scholars have credited the critiques of Hand, Ernst Freund, Louis Brandeis, and Zechariah Chafee for the change in Holmes's views. In the long-term, Hand's decision proved a landmark in the history of free speech in the country. In Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the Supreme Court announced a standard for protecting free speech that in effect recognized his Masses opinion as law.|$|E
500|$|In {{an opinion}} issued on 19 February 1929, Magistrate Hyman Bushel {{declined}} {{to take the}} book's literary qualities into account and said The Well was [...] "calculated to deprave and corrupt minds open to its immoral influences". Under New York law, Bushel was not a trier of fact; he could only remand {{the case to the}} New York Court of Special Sessions for judgement. On 19 April, that court issued a three-paragraph decision stating that The Wells theme– a [...] "delicate social problem"– did not <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> unless written {{in such a way as}} to make it obscene.

[...] After detailing {{the combination of the}} Talaxian and Vulcan species, the cellular chromosomal pairing, and the [...] "synaptic coherence of two brains/minds within one skull", Andreadis finds the whole proposition laughable from a scientific standpoint, comparing it to the 1986 film The Fly as an example of bad science.

Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut {{on the back of}} her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists that the show cannot proceed, because Julie is a mulatto woman married to a white man, and local laws prohibit such miscegenation. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has [...] "black blood" [...] in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience.

500|$|The Church of Scientology {{released}} a statement regarding the February 10, 2008 worldwide protests, which was published February 7, 2008 in the St. Petersburg Times.

We will take every step necessary to protect our parishioners and staff as well as members of the community, in coordination with the local authorities." [...] The statement also referred to the actions of members of Project Chanology as [...] "hate crimes" [...] and [...] "religious bigotry", and in a media release said that the group is guided by Communist Manifesto and Mein Kampf; one of the organizers of the protest responded to the latter allegation by stating: [...] "I don't know where they got that from, but I don't think that's true considering that I am a capitalist and a Jew". Pat Harney, spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology in Clearwater, Florida told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "We are dealing with a worldwide threat ... This is not a light matter." [...] In preparation for the February 10, 2008 protests outside Scientology's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, the Church of Scientology spent $4,500 to hire ten off-duty police officers for security. Clearwater Police Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Daly-Watts stated that the off-duty police officers will make sure that protesters do not trespass on Scientology property or <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> but will report to police supervisors and not representatives of the Church of Scientology.|$|E
