5|$|The film {{contains}} around fifty {{shots with}} computer-generated imagery. Alfredson {{wanted to make}} them <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> and almost unnoticeable. The sequence where multiple cats attack Virginia, {{one of the most}} complicated scenes to film, required several weeks of drafting and planning. The crew used a combination of real cats, stuffed cats and computer-generated imagery.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are <b>very</b> <b>subtle,</b> and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E

25|$|In a wider sense, he was {{influential}} in three respects. Firstly his night scenes were highly original. His lighting effects in general were <b>very</b> <b>subtle,</b> and {{very different from}} those of Caravaggio. He often uses as many as five different sources of light, and graduates the light relatively gently, with the less well-lit parts of the composition often containing important parts of it.|$|E
25|$|Guillaume-Francois Rouelle {{brought the}} theory of phlogiston to France, {{and he was a}} very {{influential}} scientist and teacher so it gained quite a strong foothold very quickly. Many of his students became very influential scientists in their own right, Lavoisier included. The French viewed phlogiston as a <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> principle that vanishes in all analysis, yet it is in all bodies. Essentially they followed straight from Stahl's theory.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{is about}} a {{depressed}} independent director who becomes awkward when he asks to film his actresses nude. It features partial nudity and sex scenes, as the director becomes jealous after seeing Kerness and her boyfriend make love during a steamy session in the shower. In summary, [...] "a <b>very</b> direct and <b>subtle,</b> <b>very</b> sad and funny look at nothing {{more or less than}} sexual frustration and aloneness", according to the Ann Arbor Film Festival, who screened it in 2012.|$|R

25|$|Externally, the {{differences}} between the Mark A and Mark B Minicar were <b>very</b> <b>subtle.</b> The rear mudguards were slightly smaller but wider to accommodate the wheel movement whilst the storage area behind the rear seats was also enlarged, increasing the cars overall length slightly and changing its rear profile. Beneath the bodywork, there were improvements to the electrics and to the braking system. The hood was also redesigned to provide more head room inside the car.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Stor Gendibal, a {{prominent}} {{member of the}} Second Foundation, discovers a simple local on the same planet as the Second Foundation {{who has had a}} <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> alteration made to her mind, far more delicate than anything the Second Foundation can do. He concludes that a greater force of Mentalics must be active in the Galaxy. Following the events on Terminus, Gendibal endeavors to follow Trevize, reasoning that by doing so, he may find out who has altered the mind of the native.|$|E
25|$|The dog or cat {{may show}} {{a great variety}} of signs that may be <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> in the early stages. Early signs include lethargy, loss of appetite, {{apparent}} groaning when lifted, altered voice (bark/meow), noisy panting, coughing, drooling of saliva, gagging, regurgitation (dogs) and enlarged pupils (cats). Occasionally a single limb may appear to be weak or lame. A tick attached {{to the side of the}} face may cause loss of blink reflex, corneal ulceration and an ocular discharge. A tick attached near the anus can cause anal incontinence.|$|E

50|$|The {{bonefish}} weighs up to 19 lb {{and measures}} up to 90 cm long. The color of bonefish {{can range from}} very silver sides and slight darker backs to olive green backs that blend to the silver side. Slight shading on the scales often lead to <b>very</b> soft <b>subtle</b> lines that run the flank of the fish from the gills to the tail. The bases of the pectoral fins are sometimes yellow.|$|R
25|$|Perspective remained, for a while, {{the domain}} of Florence. Jan van Eyck, among others, was unable to create a {{consistent}} structure for the converging lines in paintings, as in London's The Arnolfini Portrait, because {{he was unaware of}} the theoretical breakthrough just then occurring in Italy. However he achieved <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> effects by manipulations of scale in his interiors. Gradually, and partly through the movement of academies of the arts, the Italian techniques became part of the training of artists across Europe, and later other parts of the world.|$|E
25|$|Protestants {{reject the}} Roman Catholic Church's {{doctrine}} {{that it is}} the one true church, believing in the invisible church, which consists of all who profess faith in Jesus Christ. Some Protestant denominations are less accepting of other denominations, and the basic orthodoxy of some is questioned by most of the others. Individual denominations also have formed over <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> theological differences. Other denominations are simply regional or ethnic expressions of the same beliefs. Because the five solas are the main tenets of the Protestant faith, non-denominational groups and organizations are also considered Protestant.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, {{any notion of}} lesbian love in a film almost always {{required}} audiences to infer the relationships. The lesbian aesthetic of Queen Christina (1933) with Greta Garbo has been widely noted, even though the film is not about lesbians. Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), {{based on the novel}} by Daphne du Maurier, referred more or less overtly to lesbianism, but the two characters involved were not presented positively: Mrs. Danvers was portrayed as obsessed, neurotic and murderous, while the never-seen Rebecca was described as having been selfish, spiteful and doomed to die. All About Eve (1950) was originally written with the title character as a lesbian but this was <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> in the final version, with the hint and message apparent to alert viewers.|$|E
2500|$|Upon arrival {{back in the}} 20th century, Gently, MacDuff, and Prof. Chronotis find {{humanity}} as {{they expect}} it but with <b>very</b> small, <b>subtle</b> changes. Reg discovers his time machine no longer functions, after having the telephone company repair the phone line to his quarters.

6000|$|Now, {{day by day}} for {{something}} over a month Owen preached the Gospel before the king, his councillors, and hundreds of the head men of the nation. They listened to him attentively, debating the new doctrine point by point; for although they might be savages, these people were <b>very</b> keen-witted and <b>subtle.</b> <b>Very</b> patiently did Owen sow, and at length to his infinite joy he also gathered in his first-fruit. One night {{as he sat in}} his hut labouring as usual at the work of translation, wherein he was assisted by John whom he had taught to read and write, the Prince Nodwengo entered and greeted him.

25|$|Bourdieu's {{ambition}} to unite these sociological traditions, {{which had been}} widely thought to be incompatible, was and remains controversial. The most important concept to grasp is habitus. Crudely put, the habitus is the system of dispositions which individuals have. Sociologists very often look at either social laws (structure) or the individual minds (agency) in which these laws are inscribed. Great sociological arguments have raged between {{those who argue that}} the former should be sociology's principal interest (structuralists) and those who argue the same for the latter (phenomenologists). When Bourdieu instead asks us to consider dispositions, he is making a <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> intervention in sociology. He has found a middle ground where social laws and individual minds meet and is arguing that our proper object of analysis should be this middle ground: dispositions.|$|E
25|$|An athlete {{may choose}} to leave their sport due to many reasons, either due to an injury or due to them {{reaching}} an old age. If an athlete becomes injured, this must be looked deeper into, as an injury can vary between <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> and very dangerous. If the athlete loves their sport, they will sometimes hide {{the severity of the}} injury and just wait till it heals slightly {{in order for them to}} get playing as soon as possible, which could cause catastrophic injuries later on in their career. This is why injuries need to be looked into, because if the injury is too extreme where the athlete can't physically go back to playing their sport, they may get forced to retire in order for them not to damage themselves at a more extreme level, resulting in the athlete experiencing many different feelings, such as alienation, distress or uselessness.|$|E
25|$|The {{reflexive}} {{function of}} complex geometry, juxtaposed multiple perspectives, planar fragmentation suggesting motion and rhythmic play with various symmetry types. Though <b>very</b> <b>subtle,</b> there does manifest itself in Femme à l'Éventail a spatial depth or perspective {{reminiscent of the}} optical illusion of space of the Renaissance; in the way, for example, windows appear of varying dimension depending on distance from the observer. This shows that non-Euclidean geometry does not imply the destruction of classical perspective, or that the breakdown of classical perspective need not be complete. Unlike the flattening of space associated with the Cubist paintings of Picasso and Braque of the same period, Metzinger {{had no intention of}} abolishing depth of field. Of course here perspectival space is only alluded to by changes of scale, not by co-ordinated linear convergence, resulting in a complex space perfectly adapted to a stage-set. This feature is observed not only in Metzinger's Cubist paintings, but also in his Divisionist and proto-Cubist works between 1905 and 1909, as well as in his more figurative works of the 1920s (during the Return to order phase).|$|E
6000|$|How {{is it with}} Shakespeare? did he have no style? I think I {{find the}} proof that he had it, {{and that of the}} <b>very</b> highest and <b>subtlest</b> kind, in the fact that I can nowhere put my finger on it, and say it is here or there.[1] ...|$|R
60|$|Strangely enough, incredulity died down, {{and died}} down <b>very</b> quickly.

50|$|Julio Herrera y Reissig {{was one of}} {{the great}} fin-de-siècle modernistas, indeed one of the <b>very</b> {{greatest}} and <b>subtlest</b> of Latin American poets. Two leading women are Juana de Ibarbourou and Delmira Agustini; indeed, Ibarbourou defined a whole period of Spanish-American sentiment towards the poetic and was immensely popular. Emilio Frugoni and Emilio Oribe were distinguished lyricists.|$|R
25|$|The {{severity}} of symptoms of idic(15) vary greatly between individuals. Individuals with idic(15) usually have delays in language development and motor {{skills such as}} walking or sitting up. Other traits may include low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures (>50%), short stature, and intellectual disability. Distinctive facial features associated with idic(15), where present, are usually <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> but may include epicanthal folds (skin folds at the inner corners of one or both eyes), broad forehead, a flattened nasal bridge, button nose, and a high arched palate (roof of the mouth). Many individuals with idic(15) display features of autism, such as problems with communication and social interactions, obsessional interests (often with interactive mechanisms like wheels, doors or switches), unpredictable sleep cycles (and a reduced need for sleep), and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (e.g., lining up toys, playing with a toy {{in the same manner}} over and over again, hand flapping, rocking back and forth). A high pain threshold is often observed. If speech develops, it is often echolalic but some individuals do grasp some language. With a severely affected person there may be an inability to walk or talk.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Copernicanism [...] the planets {{came to be seen}} as bodies moving freely through a <b>very</b> <b>subtle</b> aethereal medium.
