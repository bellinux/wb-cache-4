The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to sneak up on enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving downwards and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to out-of-reach ledges.

I {{consider the}} general problem, and suggest an alternative formal account. On phenomenological grounds the very existence of a coherent geometry may be doubted.

40|$|Recent {{understanding}} {{as strongly}} believed by studies investigating the interactive or interpersonal meanings of images in such printed texts as textbooks and picturebooks shows that interpersonal relation {{can be established}} not only through verbal sentences as the primarily representational mode of our experiences but can also be represented through visual forms such as photographs and pictures. Further, studies on how meanings are represented through verbal and <b>visual</b> <b>modes</b> have revealed how readers’ experiences and readers’ social roles {{in relation to the}} content of the texts are constructed. The construction of readers’ social roles through the use of images in printed texts has been regarded to be parallel with how interactants’ social position is enacted in direct communication relying on the use of verbal sentences. In Indonesian contexts, however, studies on how verbal and <b>visual</b> <b>modes</b> represent experiences and construct social position of the interactants seem to be underexplored. The present study examined three Indonesian picturebooks using the perspectives of multimodality and reported how the children’s experiences were represented through the verbal and the <b>visual</b> <b>modes</b> used, and how these two semiotic resources represented the social relationship between the characters in the picturebook and the potential readers of the books. The examination of the verbal texts has been focused on the clauses as the building blocks of the texts by identifying the participants, process types, circumstances, and clause types. The examination of the pictures has been focused on such visual elements as who/what are in the picture, what activities taking place, the attributes possessed by the represented participants, and the circumstances. In addition, how the represented participants address the viewers was also examined. The results of the analysis show that ideationally the narrative is mostly centered around the activities done by and to children, which are presented as an offer to the readers. Verbally and visually the represented participants are socially equal to the children readers. The three picturebooks are excellent examples of picturebooks that present a narrative of Indonesian children designed for young readers because of their simple vocabulary, simply-constructed Indonesian grammar employed, and simple yet interesting plot they deal with...|$|R

5000|$|Social {{semiotics}} {{is currently}} extending this general framework beyond its linguistic origins {{to account for}} the growing importance of sound and visual images, and how modes of communication are combined in both traditional and digital media (semiotics of social networking) (see, for example, Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996), thus approaching semiotics of culture (Randviir 2004). Theorists such as Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen have built on Halliday's framework by providing new [...] "grammars" [...] for other semiotic modes. Like language, these grammars are seen as socially formed and changeable sets of available [...] "resources" [...] for making meaning, which are also shaped by the semiotic metafunctions originally identified by Halliday. The visual and aural modes have received particular attention.

2500|$|Thus, every mode has a {{different}} modal resource, which is historically and culturally situated and which breaks it down into its parts, because “each has distinct potentials [...] for meaning.” For example, breaking down writing into its modal resources would be syntactic, grammatical, lexical resources and graphic resources. Graphic resources {{can be broken down}} into font size, type, etc. These resources are not deterministic, however. In Kress’s theory, “mode is meaningful: it is shaped by and carries the ‘deep’ ontological and historical/social orientations of a society and its cultures with it into every sign. Mode names the material resources shaped in often long histories of social endeavor.” Modes shape and are shaped by the systems in which they participate. Modes may aggregate into multimodal ensembles, shaped over time into familiar cultural forms, a good example being film, which combines <b>visual</b> <b>modes,</b> modes of dramatic action and speech, music and other sounds. Multimodal work in this field includes van Leeuwen; Bateman and Schmidt; and Burn and Parker's theory of the kineikonic mode.|$|R
