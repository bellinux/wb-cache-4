500|$|David Starkey {{was born}} on 3 January 1945 in Kendal, Westmorland. [...] He is {{the only child of}} Robert Starkey and Elsie Lyon, Quakers who had married 10 years {{previously}} in Bolton, at a Friends meeting house. His father, the son of a cotton spinner, was a foreman in a washing-machine factory, while his mother followed in her father's footsteps and became a cotton weaver and later a cleaner. Starkey is equivocal about his mother, describing her as both [...] "wonderful", in that she helped develop his ambition, and [...] "monstrous", intellectually frustrated and living through her son. [...] "She was a wonderful but also <b>very</b> <b>frightening</b> parent. Finally, she was a Pygmalion. [...] She wanted a creature, she wanted something she had made." [...] Her dominance contrasted sharply to his father, who was [...] "poetic, reflective, rather solitary...as a father he was weak." [...] Their relationship was [...] "distant", but improved after his mother's death in 1977.|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it <b>very</b> <b>frightening,</b> really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|Even the {{truncated}} {{version was}} met with considerable controversy by UK film critics. Dilys Powell in The Sunday Times complained [...] "...17th century hanging, burning, raping, screaming, and Vincent Price as England's prize torture-overseer. Peculiarly nauseating." [...] The Guardian felt the film was filled with [...] "gratuitous sadism." [...] Margaret Hinxman of The Sunday Telegraph dismissed it as a [...] "sadistic extravaganza." [...] Nonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades. John Russell Taylor in the London Times Saturday Review said the film [...] "...is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything else... There is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject... Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising. He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period." [...] Films and Filming noted, [...] "Witchfinder General has no explicit 'message', but it does {{say something about the}} springs of despair and it says it forcefully. It is a <b>very</b> <b>frightening</b> film... Matthew Hopkins is the best of Price's recent performances. Witchfinder General is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one..." [...] Monthly Film Bulletin observed, [...] "Not since Peeping Tom has a film aroused such an outcry about nastiness and gratuitous violence as this one... the tone of the film is oddly muted, with torture and death in plenty, but viewed matter-of-factly and without stress... Throughout the whole film there is a vivid sense of a time out of joint, which comes as much from the stray groups of soldiers who skirmish against unseen attackers in the woods or hang wearily about by the wayside waiting for battle to commence, as from the bloody crimes committed in the name of religion by Matthew Hopkins." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{contribution}} of mammography {{to the early}} diagnosis of cancer is controversial, and for those found with benign lesions, mammography can create a high psychological and financial cost. [...] Most women participating in mammography screening programs accept the risk of false positive recall, and the majority do not find it very distressing. [...] Many patients find the recall <b>very</b> <b>frightening,</b> and are intensely relieved to discover {{that it was a}} false positive, as about 90% of women do.|$|E
2500|$|Cornell {{struggled}} with depression and had multiple addictions (mostly alcohol and prescription drugs), {{which he was}} able to manage from roughly 1980 until 1997, when Soundgarden broke up and his first marriage was failing. At that point he turned to OxyContin and other substances. Cornell said about that period; [...] "I went through a serious crisis with depression where I didn't eat a whole meal every day. I was just kind of shutting down. I eventually found that the only way out of that was to change virtually everything in my life. That was a <b>very</b> <b>frightening</b> thing to do, but it was worthwhile." [...] He checked into rehab in 2002 and quit drinking and smoking around 2005.|$|E

2500|$|The {{guilt or}} innocence of these two Italians {{is not the issue}} that has excited the opinion of the world. Possibly they were actual murderers, and still more {{possibly}} they knew more than they would admit about the crime.... Europe is not [...] "retrying" [...] Sacco and Vanzetti or anything of the sort. It is saying what it thinks of Judge Thayer. Executing political opponents as political opponents after the fashion of Mussolini and Moscow we can understand, or bandits as bandits; but this business of trying and executing murderers as Reds, or Reds as murderers, seems to be a new and <b>very</b> <b>frightening</b> line for the courts of a State in the most powerful and civilized Union on earth to pursue.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Frightful!' cried Gudrun. 'And isn't it horrible too {{to think}} {{of such a thing}} {{happening}} to one, when one was a child, and having to carry the responsibility of it all through one's life. Imagine it, two boys playing together--then this comes upon them, for no reason whatever--out of the air. Ursula, it's <b>very</b> <b>frightening!</b> Oh, it's one of the things I can't bear.
