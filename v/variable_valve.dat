40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an original continuously <b>variable</b> intake <b>valve</b> lift mechanism {{designed for the}} automotive spark ignition engines. The paper first presents the analytical kinematic synthesis of the <b>variable</b> intake <b>valve</b> lift mechanism, which consists in finding out the required intake cam profile starting from an imposed intake valve lift law. Then, by using the obtained cam profile, a computer-aided kinematic analysis of the <b>variable</b> intake <b>valve</b> lift mechanism is performed using commercial CAD software. The accuracy of the motion conversion performed with CAD software is validated by checking the degree of correlation between the resulted intake valve lift law and the imposed law used when performing the analytical synthesis. The goals of the kinematic analysis are first to find the partial laws of the intake valve lift, corresponding to the engine part loads and second, to find the transfer functions of the elements used to command the mechanism, i. e. the dependency between these elements and the intake valve lift law. The designed <b>variable</b> intake <b>valve</b> lift mechanism is successfully operated on an engine prototype and proved its energetic improvement potential...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a NMPC of a supermarket refrigeration system. This is a hybrid process involving switched nonlinear dynamics and discrete events, on/off manipulated <b>variables</b> (<b>valves</b> and compressors), continuous controlled variables (goods temperatures) and finally, several operation constraints. The hybrid controller {{is based on}} a parameterization of the on/off control signals in terms of time of occurrence of events instead of using directly binary values, in this way, we can re-formulate the optimization problem as a NLP problem. Results of the hybrid controller operation are given. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to assess CSF dynamics of different shunt constructions in patients with adult hydrocephalus syndrome and correlate these findings to clinical outcome, neuroradiology, and the specifications of the shunts provided by the manufacturer. Thirty four patients with idiopathic adult hydrocephalus (normal pressure hydrocephalus) syndrome were included in a prospective, consecutive case series. A differential pressure valve (Cordis Hakim standard system) was used in 28 patients and a <b>variable</b> resistance <b>valve</b> (Cordis Orbis-Sigma) in six. A constant pressure infusion method was used; CSF pressure and conductance were determined before surgery. Three months after shunt placement CSF pressure, the "pressure v flow" curve, and gravity induced flow were measured. There {{was no difference between}} mean preoperative and postoperative resting CSF pressures in patients with Hakim shunts. The opening pressures of the Hakim shunts were higher than the value proposed by the manufacturer. A pronounced gravity effect induced CSF flow and decrease of the CSF pressure. In functioning <b>variable</b> resistance <b>valves,</b> CSF dynamics normalised postoperatively. There was no gravity effect and the characteristics shaped "pressure v flow" curve was sometimes seen. Six patients (three differential pressure <b>valves,</b> three <b>variable</b> resistance <b>valves)</b> had non-functioning shunts. Four of these patients were improved after the operation but improvement was transient in three. In all patients, there was no relation between the width of the ventricles and clinical improvement or CSF pressure. In conclusion, the differential pressure valve system does not behave according to the specifications provided by the manufacturer. A decrease in CSF pressure in patients with this shunt was solely due to the effect of gravity. Eleven percent of the differential pressure valves and 50 % of the <b>variable</b> resistance <b>valves</b> were non-functioning. In the functioning <b>variable</b> resistance <b>valves,</b> the antisiphon system seems to be effective...|$|R

25|$|Pre-cooling {{air before}} {{it enters the}} cylinders, {{injection}} of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry intake and exhaust systems, and <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> timing were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug spark ignition. Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and cylinder block {{had to be made}} of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.|$|E

25|$|The new Corolla was {{introduced}} to the Australian market on 18 May 2007. It is available in both sedan and hatchback models, with more safety features and higher levels of luxury. The new 1.8-litre 2ZR-FE Dual VVT-i - with <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> timing for both intake and exhaust camshafts - will be the only engine available for the Australian model, promising better fuel economy than before, it also regains its 100kW power output. This figure decreased when the old model's 1.8-litre four-cylinder engine dropped to 93kW of power and 161Nm of torque (from 171Nm) in late 2005 to meet the 2006 Euro IV emissions requirements. A new 6-speed manual gearbox is standard, with a 4-speed automatic optional, despite speculation of a 5-speed like the new Honda Civic, a robotized 5-speed optional in the European Auris, or a CVT available in the Japanese model.|$|E
25|$|As Honda {{entered into}} {{automobile}} manufacturing {{in the late}} 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993â€“97 Passport {{which was part of}} a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire {{to be the first to}} try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> timing technology, Honda calls VTEC.|$|E

500|$|Designed {{through early}} 1996, in September 1997 a revised LS 400 was {{introduced}} for the 1998 model year. Changes were a five-speed automatic transmission, increased engine output to , with <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> timing (VVT-i), and an added [...] of torque. Acceleration times and fuel economy were improved as a result. The suspension and steering also received minor tweaks to improve feel and handling. Stylistically, the vehicle sported a new front fascia, side mirrors, and updated wheels; a rear window diversity antenna replaced the conventional power mast. The cabin received upgrades, including a trip computer, HomeLink, retractable rear headrests, reading lamps, and ultraviolet-tinted glass, while the climate control gained a micron filtration feature with a smog sensor.|$|E
500|$|For the 2008 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney, Holden {{announced}} the MY09.5 upgrade involving the standardisation of the [...] "premium" [...] Alloytec V6 across the Commodore range from 1 November 2008, whereas previously {{it had been}} reserved for the SV6 and Calais. Omega and Berlina variants acquired <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> timing, like the High Output engine, but not the [...] "premium" [...] dual exhaust system and the five-speed automatic transmission. These changes result in the base petrol V6 producing [...] less power and [...] less torque than the engine it replaces. However, Omega and Berlina sedans benefit from a twopercent fuel efficiency improvement, or fourpercent for wagons. Additionally, emissions have also been reduced allowing petrol-powered variants to achieve Euro VI certification, a pending emission standard for European introduction in 2014. These changes extend further than the petrol engine as bi-fuel LPG variants benefit from an eightpercent improvement in fuel economy when run on LPG. This reduced fuel consumption does however, come at a costâ€”LPG-equipped models are rated at , [...] less than before.|$|E
500|$|The {{final chapter}} of the third {{generation}} series was the VZ Commodore. Debuting in 2004 with {{a new series of}} V6 engines known as the Alloytec V6, both [...] and [...] versions of the 3.6-litre engine were offered. These were later upgraded to 180 and 195kilowatts (241 and 261hp) respectively in the VE model. When compared to the previous Ecotec engines, the Alloytec benefits from increased power output, responsiveness and fuel efficiency. The new engines were mated to a new five-speed 5L40E automatic transmission on the luxury V6 variants, and a new six-speed Aisin AY6 manual transmission on the six-cylinder SV6 sports variant. However, the long serving four-speed automatic carried on in other variants, albeit with further tweaks in an attempt to address complaints about refinement. A new 6.0-litre Generation 4 V8 engine was added to the range in January 2006 to comply with Euro III emission standards. Compared to the American version, both Active Fuel Management and <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> timing were removed. The Alloytec V6 was also affected by the new standards, which saw the peak output reduced to 172kilowatts (231hp).|$|E

40|$|Here {{we present}} a {{dynamical}} simulation of a hydraulic constant tension [CT] system in SimulationX. The purpose of the simulation is to check the similarity of the simulated system and the real system. The real system is a 10 ton winch with CT function where {{the results from this}} test are compared with the results of the simulated system. We have successfully tested the winch system with CT function. This was done using pressure transmitters and flow sensors placed on the hydraulic motor blocks in combination with a load cell and a winch encoder to measure its behavior. All data from these sensors were logged and saved to later be compared with the simulated system. Our method to simulate the model in SimulationX proved to be a successful approach to achieve a real simulation of the CT system; this is because of the <b>variable</b> throttle <b>valve</b> function in SimulationX. With this valve function we control the system behavior by adding equations to the stroke signal of the <b>variable</b> throttle <b>valve.</b> Our main result of the CT system is of great significance to all users working with hydraulic operated systems and dynamical modeling.
