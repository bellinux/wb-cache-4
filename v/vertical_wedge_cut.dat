The quality of the <b>wedge</b> <b>cuts</b> can directly affect blasting results. A series of model experiments were carried out in the Blasting Laboratory of Henan Polytechnique University, China, in order to improve the quality of <b>wedge</b> <b>cuts</b> and increase roadway development rates in the South Wing rail of Tunliu mine. Three groups of twelve <b>wedge</b> <b>cut</b> model experiments were conducted, which showed that the wedge cutting boreholes angle can affect the depth and volume of blasted zone. It was found that; symmetrical cut pattern was beneficial, and effective stemming of the blasting holes can enhance explosive energy efficiency and ensure effective blasting. Suitable roadway <b>wedge</b> <b>cut</b> blasting parameters were determined through the analysis of test results...|$|R

The <b>vertical</b> <b>wedge</b> may be less acute than the horizontal wedge, but often included a cast or sheet metal cutting edge on wooden plows. Pushing snow horizontally off the track may create an unbalanced horizontal force where asymmetrical snow accumulation is encountered. (such as snow drifting into {{one side of a}} cut) This unbalanced force may derail the plow. The leading edge of the horizontal wedge is typically forward of the <b>vertical</b> <b>wedge</b> so stabilizing downward snow loading precedes horizontal loads.|$|R

Cattaneo-Christov heat flux with external magnetic field, thermophoresis and Brownian movement effect are introduced in the model. Runge-Kutta and Newtonâs methods are employed to solve the altered governing nonlinear equations. The influences of the parameters of concern on the common profiles (velocity, temperature, and concentration) are conversed (in three cases). By viewing the same parameters, skin friction coefficient, heat and mass transfer rates are discussed with the assistance of tables. It is discovered that the momentum and thermal boundary layers are non-uniform for the MHD flow over three geometries (<b>vertical</b> cone, <b>wedge,</b> and a plate). Thermal and solutal Grashof numbers regulate the temperature and concentration fields.

40|$|The {{variations}} in seismic structure beneath southern California {{were determined by}} using a tomographic method of inversion on teleseismic P delays recorded with the Southern California Array. The inversion reveals two prominent features beneath the region. The first is a thin, <b>vertical</b> <b>wedge</b> directly beneath the Transverse Ranges that is 2 - 3 percent faster than the surrounding region. This feature deepens to the east, attaining a maximum depth of about 250 km beneath the San Bernardino Mountains. The second feature is a major zone of low velocity material that is 2 - 4 percent slow under the Salton Trough rift valley, extending {{to a depth of}} about 125 km. Two possible explanations for the spatial association of the Transverse Ranges with the velocity anomaly below are lithospheric subduction or small-scale sublithospheric convection in the region of the Big Bend of the San Andreas Fault.

The coupled nonlinear partial differential equations governing the flow field have been solved numerically using the Keller box method. The skin friction and heat transfer are found to increase with the parameters characterizing the permeability of the medium, buoyancy force, magnetic field and pressure gradient. However the effect of the permeability and magnetic field on the heat transfer is very small. The heat transfer increases with the Prandtl number, but the skin friction decreases. The buoyancy force which assists the forced convection flow causes an overshoot in the velocity profiles.
