The camless driven valve has been common for each of such cases. The analyzed valve {{has been driven by}} magnetoelectrical drive. The special research stand has been elaborated and its scheme has been presented in the article. It has been measured the valve lift and <b>valve</b> <b>acceleration,</b> the impact force, the friction force, temperature values for valve guide and for seat insert, sound level during impacting on the stand. The aim of researches has been to determine the dynamic parameters, the friction force between valve stem and valve guide, the impact force for valve impacting seat insert vs. frequency and valve lift. The analyzed valves have mated with seat inserts and valve guides made of cast iron, in oil absence. The valves have been made of TiAl 6 Zr 4 Sn 2 Mo 2 alloy. The researched friction couples have operated in temperature equal 293 K. The increase of frequency has resulted in small changes for values of lift and in greater changes of acceleration, during valve impact into its seat insert. The greatest values of impact force and acceleration have been for the small, middle and high values of valve lift, either. The ratio of impact force and <b>valve</b> <b>acceleration</b> has changed in thin bands. The friction force has decreased slightly with frequency increase and has decreased with valve lift increase. The sound level has increased with the frequency increase, and has not been dependent upon valve lift...|$|E

40|$|Echocardiographic {{criteria}} of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) in acute pulmonary embolism (PE) differ among published studies. Assessment of RV systolic function remains {{difficult because of}} the RV's complex shape. We aimed to evaluate RV systolic function with TAD in patients (pts) with acute PE. TAD (QLAB, Philips Medical Imaging) {{was based on a}} tissue tracking algorithm that is ultrasound beam angle independent for automated detection of tricuspid annular displacement. MethodsAll adults pts who were diagnosed with PE from december 2008 to march 2009 at Princesse Grace Hospital, Monaco were eligible for this study after exclusion of history of heart failure. We evaluated 22 consecutive pts with PE (12 male, mean age 62, 2 years) which underwent echocardiography, plasma BNP titration during the first day after admission, and a second echocardiography obtained within 48 hours before discharge. ResultsTAD showed significant positive correlation with RV FAC (R 2 = 0, 49; p= 0, 0003) and Sa (R 2 = 0, 43; p= 0, 001). Among pts with PE who presented signs of RVD, TAD value was 12. 5 +/– 5. 4 mm vs 15. 9 +/– 2. 7 mm (p= 0. 05). TAD value was 17 +/– 4. 2 mm when BNP level was less than 80 pg/mL vs 11. 1 +/– 3. 7 (p= 0. 007) among pts who had BNP level > 80 pg/mL. After treatment, follow-up echocardiographic data were obtained from 21 pts (mean: 8. 8 +/- 3. 6 days). Mean pulmonic <b>valve</b> <b>acceleration</b> time, Sa and TAD were significantly improved (p< 0. 05). There was no difference between TAD among pts with echocardiographic RVD at baseline vs pts without RVD (15 +/– 4. 2 vs 16. 4 +/– 3 mm; p= 0. 3). Three pts who deteriorated during short-term observation had substantially lower TAD values than those with uncomplicated courses (6. 5 +/– 1. 2 mm vs 14. 9 +/– 4. 1 mm; p= 0. 006). In conclusionimpaired TAD was associated with decreased RV systolic function in pts with acute PE. To identify the clinical meaning of decreased TAD, larger trials with longer follow-up periods are needed...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{left and}} right ventricular filling and ejection performances by use of Doppler echocardiography in healthy, conscious dogs submitted to dobutamine stress testing. ANIMALS: 10 unsedated, healthy adult Beagles. PROCEDURE: Doppler echocardiography was performed during cardiac stress testing on each dog twice at 24 -hour intervals. Dobutamine was infused in 10 micrograms/kg of body weight/min incremental dosages, from 12. 5 to 42. 5 micrograms/kg/min. Duration of each step was 15 minutes. Doppler measurements were recorded at baseline and at each stage of dobutamine infusion, whereas aortic diameter was measured at baseline and at peak dosage by use of two-dimensional echocardiography. RESULTS: Dobutamine infusion induced {{a significant increase in}} velocity time integrals and in peak flow velocities at the aortic, pulmonic, mitral, and tricuspid <b>valves.</b> <b>Acceleration</b> time-to-deceleration time ratio at the aortic wave also was increased significantly. On the other hand, ejection time, acceleration time, and deceleration time at the aortic and pulmonic valves and peak flow velocity of the E wave-to-peak flow velocity of the A wave ratio at the mitral and tricuspid valves decreased significantly during the test. The acceleration time-to-deceleration time ratio at the pulmonic wave was unchanged. A significant, progressive increase in cardiac index also was observed during dobutamine infusion, with a maximal increase of 104 % from baseline. This was mediated initially by an increase in stroke index and, at higher dosages, by an increase in heart rate. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Doppler echocardiography performed during dobutamine stress testing may be a reliable method of assessing myocardial function in dogs with cardiovascular disease.

Consideration of cylinder pressure gives corrected stresses and also it gives scope for reduction in moving masses in valvetrain.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A micromechanical structure is produced by: (a) structuring an interlayer on a wafer surface to form an opening; (b) bonding the interlayer side of the wafer (2) {{to a second}} wafer (8) such that the opening forms a hermetically sealed cavity (12); and (c) thinning the first wafer (2) from its back face side to form a membrane-like structure (14) above the cavity (12). Preferred Features: The wafers (2, 8) are silicon or silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers and the interlayer consists of oxide, polysilicon, nitride or tetraethyl orthosilicate.
