40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Background and aims: Identifying {{strategies}} to increase children’s <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intake at a population level {{is a key}} strategy in the World Health Organization's Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health. Schools are recommended settings in which population-wide <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> interventions can be delivered. This thesis aimed to: 1. Review, systematic review evidence regarding the effectiveness of school-based <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in increasing children’s consumption of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruit.; 2. Describe school Principals’ attitudes and reported barriers {{to the implementation of}} <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in Australia; the prevalence of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in Australian schools; and the school characteristics and implementation strategies associated with school <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs.; 3. Assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategy intervention in increasing the implementation of a <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> program by a population of primary schools.; 4. Describe schools’ implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs <b>and</b> other healthy eating and physical activity practices across an eight-year period, and to determine if their implementation varies according to the size, geographic or socio-economic location of schools.; 5. Provide recommendations for future research and practice regarding increasing the implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in primary schools. Results: A synthesis of systematic reviews found that school-based <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs could have a modest impact on children’s combined <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intake by approximately + 0. 25 serves per day. A cross-sectional survey of New South Wales school Principals found that only 40 % of schools in 2008 were implementing a <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> program to the recommended level. The thesis then demonstrated in a quasi-experimental study involving 828 schools that a multi-strategy intervention can significantly increase the implementation of a <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> program to the recommended level (intervention vs comparison (OR 2. 36; 95 % CI 1. 60 - 3. 49, p< 0. 001). Finally, using a longitudinal cohort study with 476 New South Wales schools, the thesis found that, over an eight-year period, the implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs by schools increased, as did other healthy eating practices whilst some physical activity practices did not significantly improve. Conclusion: The thesis provides new evidence and methods on how to implement <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in a population of schools. Furthermore it demonstrates a need and opportunity for public health policy makers and practitioners to adopt such {{strategies to}} enhance the implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in primary schools...|$|R
40|$|School-based <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> {{programs}} can increase student consumption of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> have been recommended for adoption by Australian schools since 2005. An {{understanding of the}} prevalence and predictors of and the barriers {{to the adoption of}} school-based <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs is necessary to maximize their adoption by schools and ensure that the health benefits of such programs to children are realized. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine Australian primary school Principals’ attitudes and barriers to the implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> breaks; the prevalence of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> breaks in schools and the implementation strategies used and associated with their recommended adoption (daily in at least 80 % of classes). A random sample of 384 school Principals completed a 20 -min telephone interview. While Principals were highly supportive of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> breaks, only 44 % were implementing these to a recommended level. When controlling for all school characteristics, recommended <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> break adoption was 1. 9 and 2. 2 times greater, respectively, in schools that had parent communication strategies and teachers trained. A substantial opportunity exists to enhance the health of children through the adoption of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> breaks in schools...|$|R
40|$|Increasing <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> {{consumption}} in the New South Wales population is a key public health priority. There is little dispute that high <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> consumption confers significant health benefits. Epidemiological evidence indicates that increasing intakes of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> decreases the risk of major chronic diseases including cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, diverticulitis, cataracts, macular degeneration, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. For optimal health benefits, the importance of consuming a variety of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> is stressed. It is also important that {{there appears to be}} a dose-response relationship between <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> consumption <b>and</b> protection from ill health. Thus, important gains can be made by increasing consumption across all intake levels. It has been estimated, conservatively, that 3 % of the total burden of disease in Australia is attributable to a low intake of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit.</b> Expressed economically, the potential savings to the national health care system of increasing average vegetable consumption by only one serve per day is $ 24. 4 million per year for colorectal, breast, lung, and prostate cancer alone...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> “other” foods, fibre, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C intakes of First Nations {{children and adolescents}} residing in seven communities in northern and southern Ontario, including variations by year and community, and comparisons to current dietary standards and national averages based on age and sex. Also, to implement and {{assess the impact of}} two school nutrition programs (in Kashechewan and Fort Albany, Ontario) on dietary intakes of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> “other” foods, fibre, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C. Also, to evaluate the two school nutrition programs, one a simple food provision program in Kashechewan, Ontario and the other a more comprehensive school nutrition program in Fort Albany, Ontario, in terms of student and teacher impressions and program integrity. For the program in Fort Albany, the impact of the program on nutrition knowledge, self-efficacy, and intentions to eat more <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> will also be assessed. Finally, to {{investigate the}} association between Body Mass Index (BMI) <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> fibre intake in First Nations children and adolescents living on reserve in Ontario. Methods: Dietary intakes were evaluated using 24 -hour dietary recall data collected via the validated Web-Based Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (WEB-Q) between 2003 and 2010 in seven First Nations communities in northern (Attawapiskat, Fort Albany, Kashechewan, Moose Factory, and Peawanuck) and southern (Christian Island and Georgina Island) Ontario. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> “other” foods, fibre, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C intakes were compared to current dietary standards and Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2. 2 (CCHS). Yearly and community differences in intakes were assessed using specific dataset pairs to control for season, year, and community, where conditions were comparable. The association between <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> fibre intake and BMI was investigated using the weight classifications described by Cole and colleagues (2000) and based on selfreported heights and weights. The impact of a simple food provision program in Kashechewan First Nation was examined in terms of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> “other” foods, fibre, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C intakes pre-, oneweek post, and one-year post program using the WEB-Q. Finally, the impact of a comprehensive school <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> education program was evaluated in terms of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> “other” foods, fibre, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C intakes, nutrition knowledge and preferences, and intentions and self-efficacy to eat more <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> pre- <b>and</b> post-program using validated questionnaires. Within each program, parent/guardian, student, and teacher impressions of the program were evaluated via questionnaires and focus groups. iv Results: The majority of participants (n= 443 students from seven communities) had intakes of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> relevant nutrients below current standards, with the exception of vitamin C. Mean intakes of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> fell below Canadian Community Health Survey averages. Mean intakes of “other” foods exceeded <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intakes in all age and sex groups in terms of servings. There was no significant association between <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> or fibre intake and BMI. In certain instances, significant variation in intakes existed between different years and communities. Under ideal conditions (short-term, investigator-run portion of the program), the school food provision program in Kashechewan First Nation produced improvements in <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intakes (n. s.). Long-term intakes did not improve. Teacher and principal impressions of the program were overwhelmingly positive. In the short term, the <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> relevant nutrient, <b>and</b> “other” foods intakes of students in Fort Albany did not significantly change following a comprehensive school nutrition education program, and neither did intentions or self-efficacy to eat more <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit.</b> However, the program resulted in significantly improved nutrition knowledge, as well as significant improvements in the number of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> that participants had been exposed to and liked. The majority of parents, teachers, and students had positive impressions of the program. Conclusions: Overall, the dietary intakes of the study participants were characterized by poor intakes of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> intakes of “other” foods that exceeded <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intakes in all age and sex groups. Rates of overweight and obesity were higher than those reported in the CCHS. With adequate resources and support, school nutrition programs have the potential to improve the <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intakes of children and adolescents living in the communities involved in this research. However, it is probable that the numerous barriers to healthy eating identified in the communities examined blunted the positive effects of the program piloted in this study. Future initiatives should include community-based approaches to improve accessibility of affordable, healthy foods of reasonable quality. In conjunction with school nutrition programs, such programs may have the ability to positively impact the dietary intakes of children and adolescents living on reserve in Ontario...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of {{international}} agrofood supply chains in greening <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> products <b>and</b> production in Vietnam. Mainly through contract-based procurement, the export- oriented <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> supply chain is better structured and organized than the domestic supply chain. Exporters intervene to some degree in <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> farming, to safeguard supply and to improve product quality. Pesticide use is one of exporters’ concerns, although pesticide application remains largely controlled by farmers. Despite some endogenous innovations to improve <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> pesticide practices, farmers and exporters are especially responding {{to the demands of}} importers. Relatively lax import regulations from the main export markets (China and Russia) are the main reason for limited achievements in less-pesticide-dependent <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> production in Vietnam.

40|$|Background: Food fussiness (FF) {{is common}} in early {{childhood}} and {{is often associated with}} the rejection of nutrient-dense foods such as <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit.</b> FF <b>and</b> liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> are likely all heritable phenotypes; the genetic influence underlying FF may explain the observed genetic influence on liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit.</b> Twin analyses make it possible to get a broad-based estimate of the extent of the shared genetic influence that underlies these traits. Objective: We quantified the extent of the shared genetic influence that underlies FF <b>and</b> liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> in early childhood {{with the use of a}} twin design. Design: Data were from the Gemini cohort, which is a populationbased sample of twins born in England and Wales in 2007. Parents of 3 -y-old twins (n = 1330 pairs) completed questionnaire measures of their children's food preferences (liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit)</b> <b>and</b> the FF scale from the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Multivariate quantitative genetic modeling was used to estimate common genetic influences that underlie FF <b>and</b> liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit.</b> Results: Genetic correlations were significant and moderate to large in size between FF and liking for both <b>vegetables</b> (20. 65) <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> (20. 43), which indicated that a substantial proportion of the genes that influence FF also influence liking. Common genes that underlie FF <b>and</b> liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> largely explained the observed phenotypic correlations between them (68 - 70 %). Conclusions: FF <b>and</b> liking for <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> in young children share a large proportion of common genetic factors. The genetic influence on FF may determine why fussy children typically reject <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables...</b>|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effectiveness of a multi-strategy intervention in increasing the population-wide implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> breaks by primary schools and to determine if intervention effectiveness varied by school characteristics. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted in primary schools in the state of New South Wales, Australia. All primary schools in one region of the state (n = 422) received a multi-strategy intervention. A random sample of schools (n = 406) in the remainder of the state served as comparison schools. The multi-strategy intervention to increase <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> breaks involved the development and provision of: program consensus and leadership; staff training; program materials; incentives; follow-up support; and implementation feedback. Comparison schools had access to routine information-based Government support. Data to assess the prevalence of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> breaks were collected by telephone from Principals of the intervention and comparison schools at baseline (2006 – 2007) and 11 to 15 months following the commencement of the intervention (2009 – 2010).
