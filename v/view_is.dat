5|$|Akkadian hypothesis: Both kings Sargon of Akkad and his {{grandson}} Naram-Sin {{claimed to have}} destroyed a town called Ibla, The discoverer of Ebla, Paolo Matthiae, considers Sargon a more likely culprit; his <b>view</b> <b>is</b> supported by Trevor Bryce, but rejected by Michael Astour.|$|E
5|$|Although Herbert {{asserts that}} the many-worlds {{interpretation}} lacks the counterfactual definiteness required to prove Bell's theorem, he contends that the many-worlds <b>view</b> <b>is</b> inherently non-local, by any reasonable conception of locality.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Decomposing {{a system}} into <b>views</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively}} easy. The tricky part <b>is</b> putting the <b>views</b> back together without creating unexpected interference between the views. We argue that basing decomposition on the closed world approach helps in avoiding {{certain kinds of}} surprises when <b>views</b> <b>are</b> composed. The composition mechanism can statically enforce that the behaviors described by different <b>views</b> <b>are</b> compatible. ...|$|R
5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action <b>view</b> <b>is</b> a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar to {{looking over the}} player-character's shoulder, while Sports <b>view</b> <b>is</b> a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be pulled back slightly in the menus.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades {{in our understanding}} of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run. (See also Evolution of sexual reproduction).|$|E
5|$|In 1935 the Harvard medical {{researcher}} Hans Zinsser {{wrote the}} book Rats, Lice and History, alleging that both body and head lice transmit typhus between humans. Despite this, the modern <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that only the body louse can transmit the disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} coelom(s) in deuterostomes and protostomes form by different process, called enterocoely and schizocoely respectively. However, research {{since the early}} 1990s has found significant exceptions. Both types of coelom construction appear among brachiopods, and therefore do not imply that brachiopods are deuterostomes.|$|E

5|$|Today, the eliminativist <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{most closely}} {{associated}} with the philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes (a subclass of intentional states), and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally considered to be an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness. One way to summarize the difference between the Churchlands's views and Dennett's <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that the Churchlands are eliminativists when it comes to propositional attitudes, but reductionists concerning qualia, while Dennett is an anti-reductionist with respect to propositional attitudes, and an eliminativist concerning qualia.|$|E

5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} on living {{in harmony with}} nature in his poetry, Coleridge's <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{different from that of}} Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the need to understand the divine in order to embrace it.|$|E
5000|$|The city of Mounds <b>View</b> <b>was</b> {{located in}} the former Mounds <b>View</b> Township, which <b>was</b> {{organized}} in 1858.

5|$|Although {{the ontological}} {{argument}} {{may have been}} implicit {{in the works of}} Greek philosophers such as Plato and the Neoplatonists, the mainstream <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that the ontological argument was first clearly stated and developed by Anselm of Canterbury. Some scholars argued that the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) developed a special kind of ontological argument before Anselm, but other scholars have doubted this position. Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages {{in the development of the}} argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century criticisms of Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological argument in Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century philosophers.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} <b>view</b> <b>is</b> {{that it is}} not {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{represents}} {{the synthesis of}} masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that Ardhanarishvara {{is a symbol of}} Shiva's all-pervasive nature.|$|E
50|$|Clarke's <b>view</b> <b>was</b> {{opposed by}} many Methodists, notably Richard Watson. Watson {{and his allies}} argued that Clarke's {{position}} jeopardized {{the integrity of the}} doctrine of the Trinity.

50|$|Prior to the European {{colonization}} of The United States, Native American attitudes regarding female sexuality were generally open-minded, particularly for younger, un-married women. However, when Europeans arrived, more rigid <b>views</b> <b>were</b> enforced. These rigid <b>views</b> <b>were</b> especially restrictive for women, predominantly in Puritan colonies.|$|R

5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This <b>view</b> <b>is</b> reinforced by the rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure {{in comparison to the}} immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|Cleansing asanas {{are those}} that when practiced for {{short periods of time}} help the body prevent or correct {{internal}} imbalances and tone inner organs; while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended periods of time. In both, a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi (blood vessels) through the Pranayama stage of yoga. This <b>view</b> <b>is</b> shared by other yoga texts, such as in verse 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana (lotus position) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation.|$|E
