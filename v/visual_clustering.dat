40|$|The {{assessment}} of cluster validity plays {{a very important}} role in cluster analysis. Most commonly used cluster validity methods are based on statistical hypothesis testing or finding the best clustering scheme by computing a number of different cluster validity indices. A number of <b>visual</b> methods of <b>cluster</b> validity have been produced to display directly the validity of clusters by mapping data into two- or three-dimensional space. However, these methods may lose too much information to correctly estimate the results of clustering algorithms. Although the <b>visual</b> <b>cluster</b> validity (VCV) method of Hathaway and Bezdek can successfully solve this problem, it can only be applied for object data, i. e. feature measurements. There are very few validity methods {{that can be used to}} analyze the validity of data where only a similarity or dissimilarity relation exists – relational data. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a relational <b>visual</b> <b>cluster</b> validity (RVCV) method to assess the validity of clustering relational data. This is done by combining the results of the non-Euclidean relational fuzzy c-means (NERFCM) algorithm with a modification of the VCV method to produce a <b>visual</b> representation of <b>cluster</b> validity.

40|$|Information {{visualization}} {{has emerged}} as a very active research field for multivariate and relational data analysis in recent years. It turns complex and abstract data such as demographic data, financial data, social networks, and paper citations into visual representations, and then users can exploit interactive computer graphics techniques and human visual capabilities to gain insight into the data. Parallel coordinates and graphs are two well-established methods in information visualization. However, when data become very large, the effectiveness of both methods is dramatically reduced as tens of thousands of lines can easily overwhelm the display and the resulting visual clutter will obscure any underlying patterns. Thus, clutter reduction for parallel coordinates and graphs is a very important research problem in information visualization. In this thesis, we introduce <b>visual</b> <b>clustering</b> as a new approach for clutter reduction and pattern detection. Compared with traditional clutter reduction methods such as filtering and brushing, <b>visual</b> <b>clustering</b> can enhance and reveal interesting patterns in the data while preserving the context. For parallel coordinates, we present a force-based optimization method to bundle polylines by adjusting their shapes, and a splatting framework to reveal features with animations.

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{approaches}} to image retrieval {{are based on}} the assumption that relevant images are physically near the query image in some feature space. This is the basis of the cluster hypothesis. However, semantically related images are often scattered across several <b>visual</b> <b>clusters.</b> Although traditional Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) technologies may utilize the information contained in multiple queries (gotten in one step or through a feedback process), this is often only a reformulation of the original query. As a result most of these strategies only get the images in some neighborhood of the original query as the retrieval result. This severely restricts the system performance. Relevance feedback techniques are generally used to mitigate this problem. In this paper, we present a novel approach to relevance feedback which can return semantically related images in different <b>visual</b> <b>clusters</b> by merging the result sets of multiple queries. We also provide experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Keywords: content-based image retrieval, multi-channel CBIR, result merging, relevance feedbac...|$|R

40|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>cluster</b> {{analysis}} provides valuable {{tools that}} help analysts to understand large data sets {{in terms of}} representative clusters and relationships thereof. Often, the found clusters are to be understood in context of belonging categorical, numerical or textual metadata which are given for the data elements. While often {{not part of the}} clustering process, such metadata play an important role and need to be considered during the interactive cluster exploration process. Traditionally, linked-views allow to relate (or loosely speaking: correlate) clusters with metadata or other properties of the underlying cluster data. Manually inspecting the distribution of metadata for each cluster in a linked-view approach is tedious, especially for large data sets, where a large search problem arises. Fully interactive search for potentially useful or interesting cluster to metadata relationships may constitute a cumbersome and long process. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel approach for guiding users in discovering interesting relationships between clusters and associated metadata. Its goal is to guide the analyst through the potentially huge search space. We focus in our work on metadata of categorical type, which can be summarized for a cluster in form of a histogram. We start from a given <b>visual</b> <b>cluster</b> representation, and compute certain measures of interestingness defined on the distribution of metadata categories for the clusters. These measures are used to automatically score and rank the clusters for potential interestingness regarding the distribution of categorical metadata. Identified interesting relationships are highlighted in the <b>visual</b> <b>cluster</b> representation for easy inspection by the user. We present a system implementing an encompassing, yet extensible, set of interestingness scores for categorical metadata, which can also be extended to numerical metadata. Appropriate visual representations are provided for showing the visual correlations, as well as the calculated ranking scores.

30|$|For instance, in [8] {{a static}} mapping between phonemes and visemes was proposed, where a phoneme {{recognition}} engine {{is used to}} segment the input speech, and then the recognized phonemes are directly mapped to lip shapes using a viseme codebook. In the study by Beskow et al. [13], {{in the context of}} the SynFace project [14], different rule-based and data-driven articulatory control models were proposed to animate the movements of the talking head. This system takes time-stamped recognized phonetic symbols as input and produces articulatory control parameter trajectories to drive the face model. In [15], word-based and phoneme-based methods were proposed, where for each cluster an HMM model is trained using audio-visual data, and then, the HMM model associated with the recognized phoneme (word) is used to compute facial animation parameters. Kshirsagar and Thalmann [16] proposed a syllable-based approach, where captured facial motions are categorized into syllable motions and the new speech animation is achieved by concatenating syllable motions optimally chosen from the syllable motion database. Gutierrez et al. [5, 17] used a training audio-visual database to generate a lookup table of audio-visual dynamic pairs. Given a new speech signal, they find the examples in the audio-visual lookup table of the k closest audio parameters using the Euclidean distance, then, the visual parameter is computed as the average of the visual parameters associated with the k closest neighbors. In [18] an approach based on Fused HMM is proposed. The visual parameters of the training audio-visual data are classified into several <b>visual</b> <b>clusters</b> by k-means method, and for each cluster two individual HMMs are trained independently using the associated audio and visual parameters, and also a Fused HMM is trained.

Then, the aligned audio HMM states and the <b>visual</b> <b>cluster</b> centers are used to find the best <b>visual</b> <b>cluster</b> for the input audio, and to compose new facial animation parameters.
