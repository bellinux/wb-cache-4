A new <b>ventilation</b> <b>nozzle</b> with aeration {{is adopted}} to improve the process capability of WCP by increasing the impact pressure induced by the bubble collapse {{on the surface of}} components. In this study, in order to investigate the process capability of the WCP with aeration, a standard N-type almen strips of spring steel SAE 1070 was treated by WCP with various process conditions, and the arc height value and the residual stress in the superficial layers were measured by X-ray diffraction method. The optimal fluxes of aeration and the optimal standoff distances were achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Water {{cavitation}} peening (WCP) with aeration is {{a recent}} potential method in the surface enhancement techniques. In this method, a <b>ventilation</b> <b>nozzle</b> is adopted to improve the process capability of WCP by increasing the impact pressure, which is induced by the bubble collapse {{on the surface of}} components in the similar way as conventional shot peening(SP). In this paper, the process capability of water cavitation peening and shot peening is investigated, The residual stresses in the near-surface and surface morphologies of spring steel SAE 1070 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM). After peening treatment, changes in surface morphologies, as well as residual stress with the different peening duration were recorded. The obtained results indicate that the WCP processing had a better surface finish than SP processing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Water {{cavitation}} peening (WCP) with aeration, namely, a new <b>ventilation</b> <b>nozzle</b> with aeration {{is adopted}} {{to improve the}} process capability of WCP by increasing the impact pressure induced by the bubble collapse {{on the surface of}} components. In this study, the influence of water cavitation peening (WCP) treatment on the microstructure of spring steel SAE 1070 was investigated. The microstructural evolution in the near-surface of spring steel SAE 1070 as a function of WCP time was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM). After WCP treatment, changes in the microstructure, as well as residual stress and surface morphologies as functions of WCP time, were recorded using a novel experimental design involving an in-situ observation function. The obtained results indicated that the refinement grains were induced by WCP in the strengthening layer. A stable compressive residual stress layer was found in the near-surface of the investigated spring steel SAE 1070...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley 16 foot Transonic Tunnel and in the static test facility of that tunnel {{to determine the effects}} of divergent flap ventilation of an axisymmetric nozzle on nozzle internal (static) and wind on performance. Tests were conducted at 0 deg angle of attack at static conditions and at Mach numbers from 0. 6 to 1. 2. Ratios of jet total pressure to free stream static pressure were varied from 1. 0 (jet off) to approximately 14. 0 depending on Mach number. The results of this study indicate that divergent flap ventilation generally provided large performance benefits at overexpanded nozzle conditions and performance reductions at underexpanded nozzle conditions when compared to the baseline (unventilated) <b>nozzles.</b> <b>Ventilation</b> also reduced the peak static and wind on performance levels...|$|R
