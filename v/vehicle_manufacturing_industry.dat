Indeed, it is still questionable whether technology adoption results in a superior profitability, especially if such an improvement is achieved through the use of functional ICT applications. In this study, we assume that a better alignment among ICT investments, improvements of the logistics process and the value proposition of the firm can lead towards a superior economic performance. A survey was conducted and 180 usable questionnaires were collected from companies engaged in the electronics and <b>vehicle</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industries.</b> Data were analysed through the structural equation modeling approach. The results show that improvements in speed and dependability, achieved through technology adoption, can lead to a better economic performance if they are embedded into superior after-sales services and/or into an improved product offering...|$|R

The study of the relationship between job stress, unsafe acts and occupational accidents via regression logistic test showed that increasing one percent in unsafe acts have more effect on accidents than increasing one grade in job stress. So, the rate or probability accidents can be predicted in organization by changes in the two mentioned variables. Conclusion: Reducing or eliminating identified effective stress factors and decreasing unsafe acts require the investment and implementation of an occupational stress management program...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{alternative}} motor vehicle fuels has grown tremendously {{over the last}} few years. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the California Clean Air Act are primarily responsible for this resurgence and have spurred both the motor fuels and <b>vehicle</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industries</b> into action. For the first time, all three U. S. auto manufacturers are offering alternative fuel vehicles to the motoring public. At the same time, a small but growing alternative fuels refueling infrastructure is beginning to develop across the country. Although the recent growth {{in alternative}} motor fuels use is impressive, their market niche is still being defined. Environmental regulations, a key driver behind alternative fuel use, is forcing both car makers and the petroleum industry to clean up their products. As a result, alternative fuels no longer have a lock on the clean air market and will have to compete with conventional vehicles in meeting stringent future vehicle emission standards. The development of cleaner burning gasoline powered vehicles has signaled a shift in the marketing of alternative fuels. While they will continue to play a major part in the clean vehicle market, alternative fuels are increasingly recognized as a means to reduce oil imports. This new role is clearly defined in the National Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Act identifies alternative fuels as a key strategy for reducing imports of foreign oil and mandates their use for federal and state fleets, while reserving the right to require private and municipal fleet use as well...|$|R

The sector was chosen for the study because of the government’s selection of the sector to promote subcontracting arrangements between small and medium enterprises and large firms in Kenya. Secondly, the sector was chosen because of the complexity of the motor vehicle industry with one motor vehicle comprising about 10, 000 component parts, all of which would be difficult for one company to manufacture in-house. The research was mainly qualitative but quantitative data was also used. Content analysis approach was used to analyze the qualitative data and descriptive statistics to analyze the quantitative data. Data was collected from two of the three motor vehicle assembles in Kenya, nine out of thirteen franchise holders and 66 of the 72 component parts suppliers who are mainly small and medium enterprises. The results indicate that the level of subcontracting that takes place in the motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industry</b> is minimal. This is motivated mainly by a desire to remain in the good books of the government. The big enterprises are not willing to buy component parts from local suppliers and especially not local SME suppliers mainly due to the inability of the SMEs to supply quality products to schedule, lack of local suppliers for certain parts, the proliferation of makes and models and competition from imported second hand vehicles from Japan and Europe. The proliferation of makes and models also requires frequent technological changes which both assemblers and SMEs owners find difficult to keep up with. The study recommends that the government should reduce the age of imported second hand vehicles to not more than five years, find a way of compelling the franchise holders and assemblers to buy parts locally and put in place appropriate policies regarding the sector. SMEs should also acquire up to date technology and become more competitive...|$|E

Within {{the context of a}} competitive global industry, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industry,</b> production workers and font-line supervisors from a component manufacturing company, Toyota-Boshoku, were interviewed about their work. Workers in a production environment are active and participative and the fieldwork indicates that they learn most effectively from the practical performance of tasks. Clearly, the embodied actions of workers are epistemologically significant because it is the doing of the task that their learning, knowledge and understanding are expressed. Therefore, learning practices that emerge from the performative nature of the work are most likely to present workers with opportunities to display their skills, knowledge and understanding. The whole person is involved in such learning - the cognitive, social, psychomotor and affective domains - and helps to shape knowledge for workers as expressive bodies. Knowledge is constructed in the social and atmosphere of the workplace as workers learn from one another in their everyday work practices. The thesis concludes that there is significant epistemological value in the embodied actions of the workers and in this respect the thinking and the doing are intertwined and interdependent, rather than separate entities.

The product life cycles of the process for each industry are identified and their final green waste disposal methods are investigated. The industries are identified with more lean wastes within their product life cycle process. The major green wastes from their disposal methods have high influence on environment. These wastes have to be reduced or eliminated by practicing a suitable supply chain. In present the companies doesn’t practice any supply chain in their organization. The implement of supply chain could reduce the environmental pressures and wastes of the companies to some extent. The lean wastes identified in the process could be eliminated by practicing suitable lean tools and methods. The final disposal wastes {{are considered to be}} the green wastes. The method of disposal practiced by the SSIs in India shows an evidence of how much they concern towards the environment.
