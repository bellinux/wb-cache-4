40|$|Abstract. Distillation {{column of}} special {{materials}} having high viscosity or containing solid particles, etc in chemical and petrochemical process is studied in this paper. Packed-column {{does not fit}} into this situation and even in a plate column, because of high flow resistance on the plate; it will cause some problems, such as blocking, flooding and shutting down. Here the hydrodynamic performance of flow-guided fixed <b>valve</b> <b>trays</b> (FFVT) is introduced and its hydrodynamic performance has been experimentally studied. With flow-guided holes and trapezoid fixed valves to transfer momentum of the gas bursting forth in a horizontal way to the liquid, the flow on the FFVT is well-proportioned and stable. The hydrodynamic data have been correlated and equations have been obtained for the pressure drop, the entrainment and the gas velocity at weeping point, {{which can be used}} for the design of FFVT...|$|E
40|$|International audienceValve trays column {{design for}} gas {{treatment}} still relies on empirical correlations developed on pilot units. The available correlations lead to large discrepancies {{and thus more}} experimental works are needed. The present hydrodynamic study was carried out on a Plexiglas 1. 26 m per 0. 1905 m absorption column containing four V- 4 Glitsch <b>valve</b> <b>trays.</b> Water/air system was used at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. Liquid rate per weir unit length was varied between 3. 2 × 10 − 3 m 3. (m. s) − 1 and 24. 3 × 10 − 3 m 3. (m. s) − 1 and the kinetic gas factor between 0 and 3. 5 Pa 0. 5. The following hydrodynamic parameters were determined: tray pressure drop, valves pressure drop, clear liquid height, mean emulsion height and liquid mean hold up on the tray. Correlations for clear liquid height, liquid mean hold up and emulsion height are proposed. Emulsion profiles characterisation was possible due to video records post-processing. Four different behaviours are identified for emulsion profiles according to liquid and gas velocities. Significant behaviour changes on the hydrodynamic parameters allowed the identification of three system limits: dumping, weeping and pre-flooding. Correlations are proposed for these limits and an operational diagram is presented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExperimental {{measurements}} of hydrodynamic and interfacial area parameters {{are carried out}} over two rectangular pilot scale <b>valve</b> <b>tray</b> columns. The effect of tray path length on extrapolation between the two columns is studied and phenomenological correlations for hydrodynamic and interfacial area are proposed. Correlations are compared both to literature and to industrial results showing good agreement and a significant improvement for the prediction of industrial conditions. Discrepancies preventing an accurate description of industrial trends are highlighted through comparison between typical emulsion height profiles on both columns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Resilience of a {{material}} is commonly {{understood as the}} ability of the material to absorb energy when deformed elastically and to return it when unloaded. However, in the domain of process systems, a formal definition and quantification of the magnitude of resilience is still elusive. The discussions and data provided in this paper illustrate that quantification of resilience for process systems is feasible and the quantitative model is aligned with fundamental concept of resilience. This paper provides general formulae for quantification of system resilience for many kinds of process systems. Based on the approach presented, it is possible to quantify resilience modulus, elastic modulus, and yield stress for an absorber column system. This work uses fundamentals of thermodynamic availability analysis for achieving this goal. It is found that resilience figure becomes considerably poor for increment of any operating variable from mid operating point vis-a-vis decrement of the same. Likewise {{a material}}, absorber system resilience modulus varies inversely with its modulus of elasticity. Additionally, a new efficiency parameter termed as “Thermodynamic Coefficient of Performance (THCOP) ” has been conceived. Finally, an example is described detailing the procedure of incorporating 50 % over capacity resiliency in the absorber by adding 4 new <b>valve</b> <b>trays...</b>|$|E
40|$|This is {{a report}} on free {{entrainment}} measurements in a small (0. 20 m x 0. 20 in) air-water column. An adjustable weir controlled the liquid height on a test tray. Several sieve and <b>valve</b> <b>trays</b> were studied. The results were interpreted with a two- or three-layer model of the two-phase mixture on the tray. The top or spray layer is gas continuous: in the other layers, the liquid is continuous and contains small babbles. Large bubbles erupt from the liquid-continuous phase, ejecting drops into the top layer. The distribution of the ejection velocities is taken to be Gaussian. The model allows prediction of the entrainment at different heights and for different gas velocities. As a result, a new equation for the maximum allowable vapour velocity can be presented. Two regimes were recognized: a 'low-liquid-height' and a 'high-liquid-height' regime. In the low-liquid-height regime, {{there are only two}} layers. Here the entrainment decreases with increasing liquid height and depends strongly on the type and geometry of the tray deck. At the transition, an intermediate liquid continuous layer develops. In the high-liquid-height regime, there are three layers. Here a further increase in liquid height causes the entrainment to increase. Moreover the entrainment is independent of the type and geometry of the tray deck. The results are compared with measurements from Fractionation Research Inc. on a large tray column. Similar conclusions can be drawn from these measurements, although there are differences owing to the difference in scale of the equipment. The model suggests that potentially large gains in the maximum allowable vapour rate of trays should be possible. A way of optimizing the vapour capacity of existing trays by an appropriate choice of the weir dimensions is presented...|$|E
40|$|The flow-guided sieve-valve tray(FGS-VT) {{with high}} {{efficiency}} {{was designed to}} overcome the shortcoming of low operating flexibility of the flow-guided sieve tray. Its dimensions and geometry, as well as structure characteristics, were presented. The hydrodynamics and mass transfer performance, including dry-plate pressure drop, wet plate-pressure drop, weeping, entrainment and tray efficiency, of two types of FGS-VTs (FGS-VTs with 14 and 8 valves, respectively) and one flow-guided sieve tray were tested in an air-water-oxygen cold model experiment with a 0. 6 m diameter plexiglass column. The results demonstrate that FGS-VT with 14 valves works better than FGS-VT with 8 valves, and {{in comparison with the}} flow-guided sieve tray, the flow-guided sieve-valve <b>tray</b> with 14 <b>valves</b> has higher <b>tray</b> efficiency, bigger operating flexibility, and lower wet-plate pressure drop (when all the valves are opened fully). Additionally, two typical applications to separate the mixture with high viscosity, solid, powder, easy-to-foam or easy self-polymerization components proved the unique advantages of FGS-VT...|$|R
