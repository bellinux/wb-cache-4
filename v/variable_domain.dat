5|$|Some {{parts of}} an {{antibody}} {{have the same}} functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind to antigens (in general, identical) and, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects. This region of the antibody is called the Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region. It is composed of one constant and one <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.|$|E
5|$|The {{chromosomal}} region that encodes an antibody {{is large and}} contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes (IGH@) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes (IGL@ and IGK@) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these domains is called the <b>variable</b> <b>domain,</b> which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes {{with an array of}} genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies {{with a high degree of}} variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{paratope}} {{is shaped}} at the amino terminal {{end of the}} antibody monomer by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> is {{also referred to as}} the FV region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. To be specific, variable loops of β-strands, there each on the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs).|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the role of the}} constant domainson the antigen-binding property of the <b>variable</b> <b>domains,</b> we have carried out a comparative thermodynamic study of the anti-dansyl Fv, Fab* and Fab fragments that possess the identical amino acid sequence of the <b>variable</b> <b>domains.</b> The thermodynamic analyses have shown that binding constants, enthalphy changes and entropy changes are similar for the three antigen-binding fragments, whereas the thermal stability of Fab is much higher than that of Fv and Fab*. We have concluded that (i) the <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> of the three antigen-binding fragments possess identical intrinsic capability for antigen binding and (ii) the two constant domains serve to improve the stability of the <b>variable</b> <b>domains...</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} {{a set of}} oligonucleotide primers to amplify the cDNA of mouse immunoglobulin heavy and light chain <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> by the polymerase chain reaction. The primers incorporate restriction sites that allow the cDNA of the <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> to be force-cloned for sequencing and expression. Here we have applied the technique to clone and sequence the <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> of five hybridoma antibodies and to express a mouse-human chimeric antibody that binds to the human mammary carcinoma line MCF- 7. The technique should also lead to the cloning of antigen-binding specificities directly from immunoglobulin genes...|$|R
5|$|The stem -mab is {{used for}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{as well as for}} their fragments, as long as at least one <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> (the domain that contains the target binding structure) is included. This is the case for antigen binding fragments and single-chain variable fragments, among other artificial proteins. Other antibody parts (such as Fc regions) and antibody mimetics use different naming schemes.|$|E
5|$|Class {{switching}} {{occurs in}} the heavy chain gene locus by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, found in DNA upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity {{of a series of}} enzymes at two selected S-regions. The <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> exon is rejoined through a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε). This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.|$|E
5|$|In mammals {{there are}} two types of {{immunoglobulin}} light chain, which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ). A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one <b>variable</b> <b>domain.</b> The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in other vertebrates like sharks (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Teleostei).|$|E

Antigen-specific single immunoglobulin <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> that bind to native antigens can be isolated and manipulated using yeast intracellular antibody capture technology but converting these to whole monoclonal antibody requires that complementary <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> (VH or VL) bind to the same antigenic site.

5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} <b>variable</b> <b>domain</b> of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E

5|$|Following {{activation}} with antigen, B cells {{begin to}} proliferate rapidly.

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} sexually transmitted pathogens, causing serious health risks worldwide. Based on serological properties of the chlamydial major outer membrane protein, up to 19 serovars of C. trachomatis can be distinguished, having different antigenic properties and clinical manifestations.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of therapeutic recombinant antibodies involves accurate characterization of immunoglobulin variable light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains. However, {{it has been}} reported that the use of subgroup or isotype-specific primers for the amplification of monoclonal antibody (mAb) <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> introduces heterogeneities within the <b>variable</b> <b>domains,</b> or amplifies aberrant productive Ig domains. To address these issues, we have combined the rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR (RACE-PCR) for the full-length VL and VH amplification, with peptide mass fingerprinting of the corresponding Ig chain. Using this strategy, we amplified full-length cDNA chains of SAF 34 and SAF 32, two potential therapeutic mAbs against neurodegenerative diseases directed to the prion protein (PrP). We report an unambiguous correlation between hybridoma cDNA sequences and protein fingerprints of the <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> of each mAb, indicating the discrimination between mutated, pseudo-genes and functional Ig genes. As a proof of principle for this dual strategy of full-length PCR amplification of <b>variable</b> <b>domains</b> and their characterization by MALDI-TOF, we show that the corresponding scFvs recognize the native PrP and retain full capacity to bind to human PrP, as does the parental mAb. This finding addresses the need for reliable light and heavy chain characterization, a key factor for humanization of mouse antibodies and for its use in passive immunotherapy applications...|$|R
