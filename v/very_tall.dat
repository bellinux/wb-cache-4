5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> and very short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull {{was nearly as}} tall as it was long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was <b>very</b> <b>tall,</b> so {{the front of the}} snout was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dating from}} 1195 to about 1400, Lichfield Cathedral has an {{interior}} which presents a harmonious appearance, {{much of which}} is due to its having undergone extensive restoration and refurnishing in the 19th century. The nave is very fine and the Lady Chapel is apsidal with <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> windows, giving a rather French impression. Lichfield {{is the only one of}} the cathedrals to have retained three spires.|$|E

25|$|A Ferris wheel (sometimes {{called a}} big wheel, {{observation}} wheel, or, {{in the case}} of the <b>very</b> <b>tallest</b> examples, giant wheel) is a nonbuilding structure consisting of a rotating upright wheel with multiple passenger-carrying components (commonly referred to as passenger cars, cabins, tubs, capsules, gondolas, or pods) attached to the rim in such a way that as the wheel turns, they are kept upright, usually by gravity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, they are," [...] said John. [...] "If {{you should}} take the <b>very</b> <b>tallest</b> {{mountain}} there is {{in any part of}} the earth and put it down north of Porto Rico, so that the bottom of it shall rest {{on the bottom of the}} sea, the top of that mountain would be sunk clean out of sight, so that ships could sail over it just as safely as they sail in any part of the ocean.|$|R
5|$|Jain texts portray Mahavira as a <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> man, {{with his}} height stated to be seven cubits (10.5 feet) in Aupapatika Sutra. In Jain mythology, {{he was the}} {{shortest}} of the 24 Tirthankaras, with earlier teachers {{believed to have been}} much taller, with the 22nd Tirthankara Aristanemi, who lived for 1,000 years, stated to have been forty cubits tall (60feet).|$|E
5|$|Yorks {{design was}} based on the earlier County classes but was {{intended}} to be smaller and cheaper, although better armoured. She was easily distinguishable from her sister ship, , as the latter had straight masts and funnels, while those of York were angled to the rear. In addition, York also had a <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> bridge designed to clear the aircraft catapult originally planned to be carried on the superfiring ('B') gun turret forward.|$|E
5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E

25|$|I {{have found}} the land good all along, the banks being flooded in some places. The greater part of the banks is covered with cypress trees, which are <b>very</b> fine, <b>tall</b> thick, straight. All the islands, too, are covered with cypresses, oaks, and other trees.|$|R
5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the dense}} areas, {{most of the}} {{concentration}} is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings. Nevertheless, {{there are a number}} of <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> skyscrapers in central London (see Tall buildings in London), including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the European Union.|$|E
5|$|The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a renewable-energy {{power plant}} for {{generating}} electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath {{a very wide}} greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.|$|E

However, he has been haunted by injury for several seasons. Preventing him from making his final breakthrough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Amen," [...] said Gabriel. [...] "So the old gentleman, as I said, {{harnessed}} Johnny {{and put on}} his <b>very</b> best <b>tall</b> hat and {{his very}} best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near Back Lane, I think." ...|$|R
50|$|Climbers use a few {{different}} forms of shelter depending on the situation and conditions. Shelter {{is a very important}} aspect of safety for the climber as the weather in the mountains may be <b>very</b> unpredictable. <b>Tall</b> mountains may require many days of camping on the mountain.|$|R
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 3, King Völsung {{is holding}} a {{marriage}} feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung's hall. At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running {{the length of the}} hall, while {{in the middle of the}} hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it into the trunk of the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Skulls {{of early}} tyrannosauroids were long, low and lightly constructed, {{similar to other}} coelurosaurs, while later forms had taller and more massive skulls. Despite the {{differences}} in form, certain skull features are found in all known tyrannosauroids. The premaxillary bone is <b>very</b> <b>tall,</b> blunting {{the front of the}} snout, a feature which evolved convergently in abelisaurids. The nasal bones are characteristically fused together, arched slightly upwards and often very roughly textured on their upper surface. The premaxillary teeth {{at the front of the}} upper jaw are shaped differently from the rest of the teeth, smaller in size and with a D-shaped cross section. In the lower jaw, a prominent ridge on the surangular bone extends sideways from just below the jaw joint, except in the basal Guanlong.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha," [...] said Percival, [...] "it {{seems to}} me that thou art <b>very</b> foolish--thou <b>tall</b> man--to judge of me by my dress and equipment. For, even though I wear such poor apparel as this, yet I may easily be thy {{superior}} both in birth and station." ...|$|R
50|$|Podocarpus neriifolius is {{a species}} of conifer in the Podocarpaceae family. It grows 10-15m <b>tall,</b> though <b>very</b> {{occasionally}} <b>taller,</b> in tropical and subtropical wet closed forests, between 650m and 1600m altitude. In Cambodia however it grows in a dwarf form some 2-4m tall, at Bokor, some 1000m elevation.|$|R
6000|$|Holding a lamp {{high above}} her head, and peering {{out into the}} gloom as if {{suffering}} from some defect of vision, stood a little woman, not <b>very</b> much <b>taller</b> than Joe, whose wrinkled face told she had passed what is termed the [...] "middle age" [...] of life.|$|R
5|$|The {{new church}} {{is not a}} typical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture; the low aisles and nave arcades and the <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> {{clerestory}} present the opposite balance to that which was usual in perpendicular churches. As this building was {{to serve as a}} monastic church, it was built to a cruciform plan, which had become relatively rare in parish churches of the time. The interior contains fine fan vaulting by Robert and William Vertue, who designed similar vaulting for the Henry VII chapel, at Westminster Abbey. The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80% of the wall space, giving the interior an impression of lightness, and reflecting the different attitudes towards churchmanship shown by the clergy of the time and those of the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> flagpoles.|$|E
5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to go straight to the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.|$|E
50|$|The lowest {{forests in}} which the large Mindoro forest mouse has been found, at some 1,250 m above sea level, are mostly between 14 and 16 m in height, with the <b>very</b> <b>tallest</b> {{reaching}} 20 m. The dominant species of tree are from the genera Leptospermum flavescens, Tristaniopsis and Lithocarpus, from the families Myrtaceae and Fagaceae. These very humid forests have a dense understory vegetation, which consists, amongst other plants, of mosses, tree ferns and species of Pandanus. At higher altitudes (between 1,600 and 1,950 m) the forest is dominated by bamboo, while the only tree species present is Agathis philippinensis. Here, vegetation reaches a height between 7 and 10 m. There are many smaller plants present, such as ferns, orchids and species of Pandanus. The forest floor {{is covered with a}} layer of leaves with a thickness between 6 and 8 cm.|$|R

50|$|Plateau is Ivory Coast's {{business}} center, with <b>very</b> modern, <b>tall</b> buildings. Although {{the governmental}} and administrative capital of Ivory Coast officially transferred to Yamoussoukro in 1983, {{the institutions of}} the republic such as the Presidency and National Assembly are still located in Plateau. It is the main administrative, commercial and financial center of Ivory Coast.|$|R
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> and point toward the rear. The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal vertebrae is longer proportionally. Two sacral vertebrae were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The 12 {{interconnected}} {{buildings were}} each {{named after a}} different World War II RAF aerodrome. The most conspicuous buildings are the <b>very</b> <b>tall</b> Northolt and Kenley towers, and the large ziggurat shaped Tangmere block.|$|E

6000|$|At last, panting and hot, {{she reached}} the sharp top, expecting to find Trevennack at his {{accustomed}} post on the <b>very</b> <b>tallest</b> pinnacle of the craggy little islet. But, to her immense surprise, her father wasn't there. His absence disquieted her. Cleer stood up on the fissured mass of orange-lichened rock that crowned the very summit, dispossessing the gulls who flapped round her as she mounted it; then, shading {{her eyes with her}} hand, she looked down in every direction to see if she could descry that missing figure in some nook of the crag. He was nowhere visible. [...] "Father!" [...] she cried aloud, {{at the top of her}} voice; [...] "father! father! father!" [...] But the only answer to her cry was the sound of the sea on the base, and the loud noise of the gulls, as they screamed and fluttered in angry surprise over their accustomed breeding-grounds.|$|R
