40|$|Modern {{parallel}} file systems achieve {{high performance}} {{using a variety}} of techniques, such as striping files across multiple disks to increase aggregate I/O bandwidth and spreading disks across multiple servers to increase aggregate interconnect bandwidth. To achieve peak performance from such systems, it is typically necessary to utilize multiple concurrent readers/writers from multiple systems to overcome various singlesystem limitations, such as number of processors and network bandwidth. The standard cp and md 5 sum tools of GNU coreutils found on every modern Unix/Linux system, however, utilize a single execution thread on a single CPU core of a single system, and hence cannot take full advantage of the increased performance of clustered file systems. Mcp and msum are drop-in replacements for the standard cp and md 5 sum programs that utilize multiple types of parallelism and other optimizations to achieve maximum copy and checksum performance on clustered file systems. Multi-threading is used to ensure that nodes are kept as busy as possible. Read/write parallelism allows individual operations of a single copy to be overlapped using asynchronous I/O.

40|$|Genetic factors play very {{important}} roles in the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). However, the genetic factors correlating with T 2 DM onset have not as yet been fully clarified. We previously found that copy number losses in the subtelomeric region on chromosome 4 p 16. 3 were detected in early-onset Japanese T 2 DM patients (onset age < 35 years) at a high frequency. Herein, we additionally found two novel copy number losses within the subtelomeric regions on chromosomes 16 q 24. 2 - 3 and 22 q 13. 31 - 33, which have significant associations with early-onset Japanese T 2 DM. The associations were statistically significant by Fisher's exact tests with P values of 5. 19 × 10 (- 3) and 1. 81 × 10 (- 3) and odds ratios of 5. 7 and 4. 4 for 16 q 24. 2 - 3 and 22 q 13. 31 - 33, respectively.

40|$|Hereditary protein S (PS) {{deficiency}} is an autosomal disorder {{caused by}} mutations in the PS gene (PROS 1). Conventional PCR-based mutation detection identifies PROS 1 point mutations in approximately 50 % of the cases. To <b>verify</b> if gross <b>copy</b> number variations (CNVs) are often present in point mutation-negative hereditary PS deficiency we used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) as a detection tool in samples from {{individuals with a}} high probability of having true PS deficiency. To this end, DNA samples from nine PS deficient probands with family members (seven type I and two type III) and nine isolated probands (three type I and six type III), in whom PROS 1 mutations were not found by DNA sequencing, were evaluated. An independent quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to confirm {{the findings of the}} MLPA assay. Family members were also tested when DNA was available. Gross abnormalities of PROS 1 were found in six out of eighteen probands. In three probands complete deletion of the gene was detected. Two probands had a partial deletion involving different parts of the gene (one from exon 4 through 9 and another from exon 9 through 11). One family showed a duplication of part of PROS 1. qPCR analysis was in accordance with these results. In conclusion, this study substantiates that gross gene abnormalities in PROS 1 are relatively common in hereditary PS deficient patients and that MLPA is a useful tool for direct screening of CNVs in PROS 1 point mutation-negative individual...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} era of digital world, {{the amount of}} {{sensitive}} data produced by many organizations is outpacing their storage ability. The management of such huge amount of data is quite expensive due {{to the requirements of}} high storage capacity and qualified personnel. Storage-as-a-Service (SaaS) offered by cloud service providers (CSPs) is a paid facility that enables organizations to outsource their data to be stored on remote servers. Thus, SaaS reduces the maintenance cost and mitigates the burden of large local data storage at the organization's end. For an increased level of scalability, availability and durability, some customers may want their data to be replicated on multiple servers across multiple data centers. The more copies the CSP is asked to store, the more fees the customers are charged. Therefore, customers need to have a strong guarantee that the CSP is storing all data copies that are agreed upon in the service contract, and these copies remain intact. In this thesis we address the problem of creating multiple copies of a data file and <b>verifying</b> those <b>copies</b> stored on untrusted cloud servers. We propose a pairing-based provable multi-copy data possession (PB-PMDP) scheme, which provides an evidence that all outsourced copies are actually stored and remain intact. Moreover, it allows authorized users (i. e., those who have the right to access the owner's file) to seamlessly access the file copies stored by the CSP, and supports public verifiability. We then direct our study to the dynamic behavior of outsourced data, where the data owner is capable of not only archiving and accessing the data copies stored by the CSP, but also updating and scaling (using block operations: modification, insertion, deletion, and append) these copies on the remote servers. We propose a new map-based provable multi-copy dynamic data possession (MB-PMDDP) scheme that verifies the intactness and consistency of outsourced dynamic multiple data copies. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first to verify the integrity of multiple copies of dynamic data over untrusted cloud servers. As a complementary line of research, we consider protecting the CSP from a dishonest owner, who attempts to get illegal compensations by falsely claiming data corruption over cloud servers. We propose a new cloud-based storage scheme that allows the data owner to benefit from the facilities offered by the CSP and enables mutual trust between them. In addition, the proposed scheme ensures that authorized users receive the latest version of the outsourced data, and enables the owner to grant or revoke access to the data stored by cloud servers...|$|R
40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{a complex}} genetic syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, dysmorphism and variable additional physiological traits. Current research progress has begun to decipher the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment, leading to new therapeutic perspectives. Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) has recently {{been found to have}} positive effects on learning and memory capacities of a DS mouse model and is foreseen to treat DS patients. But PTZ is also known to be a convulsant drug at higher dose and DS persons are more prone to epileptic seizures than the general population. This raises concerns over what long-term effects of treatment might be in the DS population. The cause of increased propensity for epilepsy in the DS population and which Hsa 21 gene(s) are implicated remain unknown. Among Hsa 21 candidate genes in epilepsy, CSTB, coding for the cystein protease inhibitor cystatin B, is involved in progressive myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia in both mice and human. Thus we aim to evaluate the effect of an increase in Cstb gene dosage on spontaneous epileptic activity and susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizure. To this end we generated a new mouse model trisomic for Cstb by homologous recombination. We <b>verified</b> that increasing <b>copy</b> number of Cstb from Trisomy (Ts) to Tetrasomy (Tt) was driving overexpression of the gene in the brain, we checked transgenic animals for presence of locomotor activity and electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities characteristic of myoclonic epilepsy and we tested if those animals were prone to PTZ-induced seizure. Overall, the results of the analysis shows that an increase in Cstb does not induce any spontaneous epileptic activity and neither increase or decrease the propensity of Ts and Tt mice to myoclonic seizures suggesting that Ctsb dosage should not interfere with PTZ-treatment...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The TH-MYCN {{transgenic}} neuroblastoma model, with targeted MYCN {{expression to}} the developing neural crest, {{has been used to}} study neuroblastoma development and evaluate novel targeted tumor therapies. METHODS: We followed tumor development in 395 TH-MYCN (129 X 1 /SvJ) mice (125 negative, 206 hemizygous and 64 homozygous mice) by abdominal palpations up to 40 weeks of age. DNA sequencing of MYCN in the original plasmid construct and mouse genomic DNA was done to <b>verify</b> the accuracy. <b>Copy</b> number analysis with Affymetrix® Mouse Diversity Genotyping Arrays was used to characterize acquired genetic aberrations. RESULTS: DNA sequencing confirmed presence of human MYCN cDNA in genomic TH-MYCN DNA corresponding to the original plasmid construct. Tumor incidence and growth correlated significantly to transgene status with event-free survival for hemizygous mice at 50 %, and 0 % for homozygous mice. Hemizygous mice developed tumors at 5. 6 - 19 weeks (median 9. 1) and homozygous mice at 4. 0 - 6. 9 weeks (5. 4). The mean treatment window, time from palpable tumor to sacrifice, for hemizygous and homozygous mice was 15 and 5. 2 days, respectively. Hemizygous mice developing tumors as early as homozygous mice had a longer treatment window. Age at tumor development did not influence treatment window for hemizygous mice, whereas treatment window in homozygous mice decreased significantly with increasing age. Seven out of 10 analysed tumors had a flat DNA profile with neither segmental nor numerical chromosomal aberrations. Only three tumors from hemizygous mice showed acquired genetic features with one or more numerical aberrations. Of these, one event corresponded to gain on the mouse equivalent of human chromosome 17. CONCLUSION: Hemizygous and homozygous TH-MYCN mice have significantly different neuroblastoma incidence, tumor growth characteristics and treatment windows but overlap in age at tumor development making correct early genotyping essential to evaluate therapeutic interventions. Contrasting previous studies, our data show that TH-MYCN tumors have few genetic aberrations...|$|R

This dissertation presents a system design for {{the next step in the}} evolution of spectroradiometers designed by the Atmospheric Remote Sensing Lab. The design draws upon the lessons learned from previous generations of radiometers and from the requirements of ongoing research. The proposed spectroradiometer uses an inexpensive CCD as the detector and takes advantage of modern processors and re-programmable CPLDs. The new design employs an embedded DSP in a novel way; it provides high level control over the CCD detector, receives serial ADC data and communicates with a Host computer. Through the use of one of the serial channels, the DSP identifies when to accumulate charge in the CCD and when to dump it. This controlled sampling allows charge to accumulate from adjacent cells internal to the CCD, improving the SNR in regions of poor spectral transmission. Since the charge accumulate/reset is controlled by the DSP through software, the sequence is programmable using the host computer interface and can be dynamically re-programmed to accommodate changing atmospheric conditions. A re-programmable CPLD isolates the DSP from the detector hardware and provides low level control of the detector assembly. The CPLD accepts high level commands from the DSP and generates the low level clocks and control signals used by the CCD and ADC. This capability permits the CPLD to be re-programmed to accommodate various CCDs and ADCs available today and in the future without altering the Host communication, control or analysis software. The capabilities of the instrument can be altered by downloading new software to the embedded DSP. Provisions have been made to download software or configuration data to the instrument and execute from RAM. Once correct operation of the software has been <b>verified,</b> it can <b>copied</b> to non-voltile memory...|$|R
40|$|Curs 2013 - 2014 {{this final}} project, we show {{the results of}} a strain {{engineering}} strategy for heterologous protein production in the host organism Pichia pastoris. P. pastoris is a yeast with a huge industrial potential due to its set of strong and inducible promoters and its low endogenous protein secretion rate. Moreover, P. pastoris has the capability to secrete a recombinant protein with mostly all post-translational modifications and can be grown to high cell densities compared to other eukaryotic organisms. In a previous project, a similar strain engineering approach was performed using the Cre/loxP technique, which enables the integration of several genes by multiple consecutive DNA transformations. However, using Golden Gate technique, multiple genes can be simultaneously assembled and introduced by just one DNA transformation. The aim of this project was the study of protein secretion improvement using different helper factor gene combinations created by Golden Gate assembly. Based on omics data, we rationally selected 4 endogenous gene candidates related with the secretion pathway to be co-overexpressed. These genes were denominated X, Y, Z and K*, and different combinations of transcription units thereof were assembled on one vector. These combinations were K+X, K+X+Y and X+Z+Y+K. Surprisingly, during transformation not all the constructs were totally integrated into the genome as <b>verified</b> by gene <b>copy</b> number determination. Only strains that integrated the whole construct and that remained stable were used for further characterization. First screening results revealed that all engineered strains increased product titer and yield when compared to the parental strain. This result was statistically significant with a p-value below 10 - 4 for all the strains tested. The best gene combination in terms of product titer was K+X+Y while X+Z+Y+K achieved the best yield. Selected colonies were rescreened and showed a significant improvement with a 2. 3 -fold increased product titer in combination K+X+Y and an almost 2. 9 -fold increased product yield in combination X+Z+Y+K when compared to the parental strain, with a p-value also below 10 - 4. These results are in good agreement with those obtained by Cre/loxP cloning. With this project, we have not only shown the efficacy of Golden Gate assembly for its use in P. pastoris, but also identified some factors to be improved for future applications. Moreover, the four genes that have been successfully tested in two different strain engineering approaches seem to have a considerable industrial potential...|$|R
