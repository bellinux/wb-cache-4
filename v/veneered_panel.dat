This paper is exploring some properties of reconstituted poplar veneer replicating wenge in indirect testing, which meant to evaluate the bending properties of veneered particleboards and in direct testing that envisaged the veneer density and water absorption. The properties of reconstituted poplar replicating wenge were compared with those of poplar and wenge veneer tested in the same conditions. The results show a slightly lower MOE and MOR for the particleboard veneered with reconstituted veneer compared to the classic veneer, in spite of a higher <b>veneered</b> <b>panel</b> density. The reason may be a discontinuous structure of the engineered veneer compared to the traditional veneer. However, the addition of veneer to particleboards has increased their MOE app. 1. 4 - 1. 7 times and doubled their MOR. Smaller standard deviation values of the MOE, MOR and density were recorded for the particleboard veneered with reconstituted poplar replicating wenge compared with the ones veneered with poplar or natural wenge, which may indicate a more homogenous structure for the reconstituted veneer compared with the natural veneers. The reconstituted poplar veneer replicating wenge had higher density than the poplar veneer and it absorbed less water. However, compared with natural wenge, the replica made of poplar had lower performances. Further tests could examine the finishing behaviour of reconstituted veneer and its resistance to scratches and spots...|$|E

40|$|Binderless {{compressed}} <b>veneer</b> <b>panels</b> {{from oil}} palm trunk consisted of 5 layers of oil palm trunk veneers {{were made with}} 3 different thickness, 7 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm. The panels were pressed at temperature of 180 °C with pressure 5 MPa at duration time of 20 minutes. The veneers were pressed without using any synthetic adhesive in the manufacturing process. Mechanical and physical properties such as flexural test, thickness swelling and water absorption, density and compression ratio were observed and evaluated based on Japanese Agricultural Standard 2003 (JAS). The findings showed that binderless compressed <b>veneer</b> <b>panels</b> that undergo pressing process with thickness bar 7 mm showed the highest value of flexural strength compared to other type of panels. Dimensional stability such as thickness swelling and water absorption showed relationship with compression ratio.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Face {{checking}} in decorative maple <b>veneered</b> plywood <b>panels</b> {{is a significant}} problem for hardwood plywood manufacturers, furniture makers, cabinetmakers, and consumers. Efforts made by panel producers and researchers to minimize checking conducted to-­‐date have been limited, and produced contradictory results. In this study the impact of four manufacturing factors believed to contribute to check development in decorative maple <b>veneer</b> <b>panels</b> were determined. The factors investigated were face veneer thickness and preparation, lathe-­‐check orientation, adhesive and core type. An efficient, automated, optical technique based on digital image correlation principles was developed and used to detect and measure checks as they develop. The novel new method for characterizing check severity and development was effective in efficiently measuring checking for {{a substantial number of}} samples. The results of the factor screening analysis reveal intricate four way interactions between factor levels contribute to check development, and that some combinations are likely to exhibit much more checking than others...|$|R
