5000|$|The cottontail rabbit, Sylvilagus, is {{expanding}} into the volcano rabbit’s niche, {{but there is}} “no evidence that rabbits' habitat selection {{is a response to}} competitive exclusion." [...] The <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> has been severely pressured by human intrusion into its habitat. Anthropogenic disturbance enables other rabbit species to flourish in grasslands, increasing competition with the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Seasonal changes {{also affect}} the diet of the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> greatly. The grasses it {{normally}} consumes are abundant during wet seasons. During the dry season, the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> feasts on shrubs and small trees, {{as well as}} other woody plants. During the winter plants, these woody plants make up most of their diet, as well as the primary building material for their nests.|$|E

50|$|<b>Volcano</b> <b>rabbits</b> {{have been}} bred in captivity, {{but there is}} {{evidence}} that the species loses a significant amount of genetic diversity when it reproduces in such conditions. A comparative study done on wild and captive <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbits</b> found that the latter lost a substantial amount of DNA loci, and some specimens lost 88% of their genetic variability. There was, however, one locus whose variability was higher than that of the wild population.|$|R
50|$|After {{outbreaks}} of RHD in 2000, 2001, and 2005 in domesticated rabbits, the United States has eradicated RHD from its rabbit populations. The native species, cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus), black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) and <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbits</b> (Romerolagus diazzi) {{seem not to}} be susceptible to the virus.|$|R
50|$|The <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit’s</b> adult weight {{goes up to}} 500 g. It has short, dense fur {{that ranges}} in color from brown to black. The rabbit is a gnawing animal that is {{distinguished}} from rodents by its two pairs specialized of upper incisors that are designed for gnawing. Their body size and hindlimb development demonstrates how they need extra cover for evasion from predators. Their speediness and their hind limb development relative to their body size correlate to their necessity for evasion action. They are relatively slow and vulnerable in open habitats; therefore they take comfort in high, covered areas. They also have difficulty breeding in small enclosures. <b>Volcano</b> <b>rabbits</b> have a very narrow gestational period: In one study, all females gave birth between 39 and 41 days after coitus. They create runways similar to those made by microtine rodents to navigate their habitat. The burrows consist of dense grass clumps, with a length of 5 m and depth of 40 cm. Their small size relates to their selective dietary habits. As of 1987, they were used in one piece of scientific research.|$|R

50|$|Declines in the R. diazi {{population}} {{have been}} occurring due {{a number of}} changes in vegetation, climate, and, thus, elevation. The <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> is extremely vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change and other anthropogenic intrusions because of its extremely limited range and specialized diet. Patches of vegetation that R. diazi uses for survival are becoming fragmented, isolated and smaller, rendering the environment more open and therefore less suitable for its survival. Because the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> inhabits the area surrounding Mexico City, Mexico's most populous region, it has suffered a very high rate of habitat destruction.|$|E
50|$|The IUCN/SSC Lagomorph Specialist Group {{has created}} an action plan for this rabbit that focuses upon the need to manage the burning and {{overgrazing}} of its Zacatón habitats and to enforce laws prohibiting its hunting, capture, and sale. Studies about the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit's</b> geographical range, role in its habitat, population dynamics, and evolutionary history have been recommended. In addition, habitat restoration {{and the establishment of}} Zacatón corridors to link core areas of habitat are needed.|$|R
50|$|The park's fauna {{consists}} of many mammals like: bats, shrew, opossum, <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit,</b> squirrel, least weasel, skunk, coyote, and bobcat. There are three common snake {{species in the}} park: milk snake, rattlesnake, and plain-bellied water snake.|$|E
50|$|The <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> (Romerolagus diazi), {{also known}} as {{teporingo}} or zacatuche, is a small rabbit that resides {{in the mountains of}} Mexico. It is the world's second smallest rabbit, second only to the pygmy rabbit. It has small rounded ears, short legs, and short, thick fur and weighs approximately 390-600 g (0.86-1.3 lb). It has a life span of 7 to 9 years. The <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> lives in groups of 2 to 5 animals in burrows (underground nests) and runways among grass tussocks. The burrows can be as long as 5 m and as deep as 40 cm. There are usually 2 to 3 young per litter, born in the burrows.|$|E
50|$|Threats to R. diazi, or the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit,</b> include logging, {{harvesting}} of grasses, livestock grazing, habitat destruction, urban expansion, highway {{construction and}} forest fires. These threats {{have resulted in}} a loss of 15-20% of the volcano rabbit’s habitat during the last three generations. They have also resulted in ecological displacement and genetic isolation of R. diazi. Hunting is another threat to the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit,</b> despite the fact that R. diazi is listed under Appendix 1 of CITES and it is illegal to hunt R. diazi under Mexican law. However, many are unaware that R. diazi is protected and officials do not adequately enforce its protection. Hunting, livestock grazing, and fires can even harm R. diazi within national parks that are protected such as Izta-Popo and Zoquiapan National Parks.In terms of conservation efforts, various captive breeding programs have been established with relative success, but infant mortality in captivity is high. Actions toward conservation should be focused on the enforcement of laws which forbid hunting and trading of the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Furthermore, efforts must be put toward habitat management, specifically the control of forest fires and livestock overgrazing of grasses. Lastly, it would be beneficial to enact education programs regarding R. diazi and the various threats that face it. The public should also be educated about the volcano rabbit’s protected status, as many are unaware that it is illegal to hunt R. diazi.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{many species}} of rabbits (and similar to pikas), the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> emits very high-pitched sounds instead of thumping its {{feet on the ground}} to warn other rabbits of danger. It is crepuscular and is highly active during twilight, dawn and all times in between. Populations have been {{estimated}} to have approximately 150-200 colonies with a total population of 1,200 individuals over their entire range.|$|E
50|$|The <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> feeds {{primarily}} on grasses such as Festuca amplissima, Muhlenbergia macroura, Stipa ichu, and Eryngium rosei. The rabbits also use these plants as cover {{to hide from}} predators. M. macroura {{was found to be}} in 89% of pellets of the volcano rabbits, suggesting that this is the base of their diet, but it does not actually provide the necessary energy and protein needs of the rabbits. Supplementing their diet with 15 other forms of plant life, volcano rabbits can get their required nutrition. Other plant species that also are responsible for supporting the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> are the Muhlenbergia quadidentata, the Pinus hartwegii, F. tolucensis, P. hartwegeii. Volcano rabbits also consume leaves, foliage, and flowers indiscriminately under poor conditions, as habitat loss has eliminated much of their food sources. In fact, protein acquisition is the primary limiting factor {{on the size of the}} populations of each of the four volcanoes on which the species is located. Studies show that many individuals of the population suffer from serious weight loss and starvation.|$|E
50|$|Volcano rabbits are an {{endangered}} species endemic to Mexico. Specifically, the rabbit is native to four volcanoes just south of Mexico City, the largest of which is called El Pelado. The range of the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> has been fragmented into 16 individual patches by human disturbance. Vegetation within the patches include Nearctic and Neotropical varieties. Elevation of these patches is between 2900 and 3660 meters above sea level. The soil consists mostly of Andosol and Lithosol. The local climate is temperate, subhumid, and has a mean annual temperature of 11 °C. Annual rainfall averages at about 1000 millimeters. In the patches that are the most heavily populated with volcano rabbits, the plants Festuca tolucensus and Pinus hartwegii are most abundant. Volcano rabbits show strong preferences for habitat types that are categorized as pine forests, open pine woodland, and mixed alder pine forest. Human activity in the area has had a great impact upon the preferred habitat of the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Humans have fragmented the rabbits' habitat by constructing highways, farming, burning, and allowing grazing. Ecological fragmentation has been caused by environmental discontinuity.|$|E

50|$|Numerous studies {{conducted}} during the 1980s and 1990s agreed that the habitat of the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> was shrinking due {{to a combination of}} natural and anthropogenic causes. There is evidence that its range has shrunk significantly during the last 18,000 years due to a 5-6 °C increase in the prevailing temperature, and its distribution is now divided into 16 patches. The fragmentation of the volcano rabbit's distribution has resulted from a long-term warming trend that has driven it to progressively higher altitudes and the relatively recent construction of highways that dissect its habitat.|$|E
50|$|Volcano rabbits are {{commonly}} found at higher altitudes. Almost 71% of volcano rabbits {{are found in}} pine forests, alder forests, and grasslands. R. Diazi is a gnawing animal that is distinguished from rodents by its two pairs of specialized upper incisors that are designed for gnawing. Volcano rabbits are more abundant near tall, dense herbs and thick vegetation, and are adversely affected by anthropogenic environmental disturbances like logging and burning. A study {{on the effects of}} climate change upon <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> metapopulations concluded that fluctuations in climate most affected rabbits on the edge of their habitable range. The volcano rabbit's range encompasses a maximum of 280 km2 of grasslands in elevated areas in the Trans-Mexican Neovolcanic Belt.|$|E
40|$|Distribution and {{population}} {{size of the}} <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> or zacatuche (Romerolagus diazi) were investigated at El Pelado volcano, {{one of the four}} remaining core distribution areas left in Mexico. Latrines or fecal pellets were counted at 342 randomly selected sampling sites between 1986 and 1989. Rabbits also were censused directly from horseback along 29 line transects in October 1988. There was a significant correlation between the mean number of latrines and mean number of rabbits sighted within each of four categories of abundance. Spatial distribution was mapped based on these categories of abundance. Mean size of populations of <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> was estimated at 6, 488 individuals (range of 2, 478 - 12, 120). The lower value (2, 478) should be used for conservation efforts. Most volcano rabbits occurred at 3, 150 - 3, 400 m elev., mainly in the upper and middle southern slopes...|$|E
40|$|A new unique anoplocephaline cestode having spinose {{tegument}} was described. Anoplocephaloides romerolagi sp. n. {{was found}} in the bile duct of a <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit,</b> Romerolagus diazi, from Mexico.

40|$|The <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> Romerolagus diazi is an Endangered species {{endemic to}} Mexico, {{with a range}} of < 400 km 2. We {{investigated}} threats from destruction, fragmentation and degradation of habitat, hunting, and cattle grazing intensity in relation to the distribution and abundance of the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> on the Iztaccihuatl volcano. Faecal pellet counts were taken as a proxy for rabbit abundance in 1, 718 random 0. 2 m 2 quadrats at 859 sampling points along 25 transects, covering an area of c. 100 km 2 at altitudes of 3, 400 – 4, 000 m. Presence of the species was significantly associated with absence of closed forest, absence of long grass types (not bunchgrass), shallow inclines, absence of cattle grazing, lower altitude, low hunting pressure (measured by proximity to ranger station), absence of bare ground and, contrary to previous findings, increased frequency of fire. The species was significantly more abundant in habitats with a greater percentage cover of zacaton (bunchgrass) and short grass types. It was significantly less abundant in areas with more hunting (measured by proximity to ranger station) and cattle grazing. Key conservation priorities are therefore the protection of the subalpine zacaton bunchgrass-dominated habitat type, strict enforcement of hunting laws and the removal of livestock from relevant national park boundary areas. However, the results suggest that frequent fires have a significant positive effect on the occurrence of the <b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit</b> as a result of habitat improvement and this is often a consequence of anthropogenic management of land for cattle grazing.

40|$|We link {{spatially}} explicit {{climate change}} predictions to a dynamic metapopulation model. Predictions of species' responses to climate change, incorporating metapopulation dynamics and elements of dispersal, {{allow us to}} explore the range margin dynamics for two lagomorphs of conservation concern. Although the lagomorphs have very different distribution patterns, shifts {{at the edge of}} the range were more pronounced than shifts in the overall metapopulation. For Romerolagus diazi (<b>volcano</b> <b>rabbit),</b> the lower elevation range limit shifted upslope by approximately 700  m. This reduced the area occupied by the metapopulation, as the mountain peak currently lacks suitable vegetation. For Lepus timidus (European mountain hare), we modelled the British metapopulation. Increasing the dispersive estimate caused the metapopulation to shift faster on the northern range margin (leading edge). By contrast, it caused the metapopulation to respond to climate change slower, rather than faster, on the southern range margin (trailing edge). The differential responses of the leading and trailing range margins and the relative sensitivity of range limits to climate change compared with that of the metapopulation centroid have important implications for where conservation monitoring should be targeted. Our study demonstrates the importance and possibility of moving from simple bioclimatic envelope models to second-generation models that incorporate both dynamic climate change and metapopulation dynamics.
