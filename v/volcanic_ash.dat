If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash,</b> pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk.

5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> fall are possible, as {{exposure}} to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis.

The A group had high contents of Rb and low contents of Sr. On the contrary the C group had low contents of Rb and high contents of Sr. The B group was intermediate between the A and the C groups. Therefore，it was clear that these three groups were distributed with a reverse correlationship between the Rb and the Sr contents. The analytical results showed that the upper Towada a stratum corresponded to the A group，and the lower Towada a，Towada b，ChBseri，Nambu and Ninokura strata also to the Cgroup．Further，the Ninokura <b>volcanic</b> <b>ashes</b> could be discriminated from the other strata of the C group by the Si，Fe，K and Rb indicators． By means of these results，it was clear that we had obtained a clue to know simply the ages of many sites with the <b>volcanic</b> <b>ashes</b> in Aomori Prefbcture...|$|R

5|$|The crystalline-solid {{structure}} of the salts act more as an insulator than a conductor. However, once the salts are dissolved into a solution by a source of moisture (e.g., fog, mist, light rain, etc.), the ash may become corrosive and electrically conductive. A recent study {{has shown that the}} electrical conductivity of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> increases with (1) increasing moisture content, (2) increasing soluble salt content, and (3) increasing compaction (bulk density). The ability of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> to conduct electric current has significant implications for electric power supply systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} {{individual}} particles varies with different eruptions.

Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations.

5|$|<b>Volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> {{consists}} of fragments of pulverized rock, minerals and volcanic glass, created during volcanic eruptions and measuring less than 2mm (0.079inches) in diameter. The term <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> is also often loosely {{used to refer}} to all explosive eruption products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2mm. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.|$|E
