They killed or wounded 3,000 enemy combatants, captured 12,000 prisoners, 149 guns and <b>vast</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> ammunition and transport. Motor ambulances of the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions helped transport the wounded in the Tulkarm area, before rejoining their divisions on the Esdraelon Plain, on 22 September.|$|E

Remnants of the Eighth Army which had escaped were captured the next day by Desert Mounted Corps at Jenin, in the Esdrealon Plain to the north of the Judean Hills. On 19 and 20 September the XXI Corps suffered total of 3,378 casualties of whom 446 were killed. They had captured 12,000 prisoners, 149 guns and <b>vast</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> ammunition and transport. With the exception of the Asia Corps, the whole Eighth Army had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1660s, a {{building}} program was initiated {{to expand the}} fleet and replace old capital ships. A new flagship was needed to replace the old Kronan from 1632. The felling of <b>vast</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> timber that were required for the new admiral's ship had already begun {{in the winter of}} 1664–65. Swedish historian Kurt Lundgren has estimated that 7–10 hectares (17–25 acres) of hundred-year-old oak forest was required for the hull and several tall, stout pines for the masts and bowsprit.|$|E

5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{extends from}} parts of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire in the west, to Blaenau Gwent and Torfaen in the east, and the rather smaller North Wales Coalfield {{underlies}} parts of Flintshire and Denbighshire. <b>Vast</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> coal were mined in Wales during the Industrial Revolution and the earlier {{part of the}} twentieth century, after which coal stocks dwindled and the remaining pits became uneconomical as foreign coal became available at low prices. The last deep pit in Wales closed in 2008.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of March 25, the North Vietnamese had secured all major points {{surrounding}} Huế, and South Vietnamese units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, the North Vietnamese claimed to have captured large numbers of South Vietnamese prisoners and military hardware. In all, a total of 58,722 South Vietnamese soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 South Vietnamese government officials and employees, who reported to the North Vietnamese military authorities. The South Vietnamese military in Huế also surrendered <b>vast</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> weaponry, which included 140 tanks and armoured vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Constructing a warship of {{the size}} of the Mary Rose was a major undertaking, {{requiring}} <b>vast</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> high-quality material. In the case of building a state-of-the-art warship, these materials were primarily oak. The total amount of timber needed for the construction can only be roughly calculated since only about one third of the ship still exists. One estimate for the number of trees is around 600 mostly large oaks, representing about 16 hectares (40 acres) of woodland. The huge trees that had been common in Europe and the British Isles in previous centuries were by the 16th century quite rare, which meant that timbers were brought in from all over southern England. The largest timbers used in the construction were of roughly the same size as those used in the roofs of the largest cathedrals in the high Middle Ages. An unworked hull plank would have weighed over 300kg (660lb), and one of the main deck beams would have weighed close to three-quarters of a tonne.|$|E

5|$|Many comets and asteroids {{collided}} with Earth {{in its early}} stages. Many scientists think that comets bombarding the young Earth about 4 billion years ago brought the <b>vast</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> water that now fill the Earth's oceans, {{or at least a}} significant portion of it. Others have cast doubt on this idea. The detection of organic molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in significant quantities in comets has led to speculation that comets or meteorites may have brought the precursors of life—or even life itself—to Earth. In 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces, such as comets, had the potential to create the amino acids that make up proteins through shock synthesis. In 2015, scientists found significant amounts of molecular oxygen in the outgassings of comet 67P, suggesting that the molecule may occur more often than had been thought, and thus less an indicator of life as has been supposed.|$|E
5|$|Other Spanish ports {{were also}} {{blockaded}} {{with the intention}} of limiting Spanish trade and movement and intercepting treasure convoys from the colonies of New Spain and South America. <b>Vast</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> gold, silver and valuable trade goods crossed the Atlantic in regular armed frigate convoys. To intercept and seize these shipments the Royal Navy dispatched their own frigates to patrol the Spanish coast. To encourage their sailors, the Royal Navy distributed prize money to the value of the ships and material captured and the seizure of a Spanish treasure fleet could yield spectacular amounts of money: particularly large sums had been captured during previous wars in 1656, 1744 and 1762, but during {{the first three years of}} conflict between Great Britain and Spain only one treasure convoy had been intercepted, near Cádiz at the Action of 26 April 1797, and on that occasion the treasure was smuggled ashore before the convoy was seized.|$|E
5|$|The {{struggle}} for Huế and Da Nang had cost South Vietnam its entire army corps, namely the {{units of the}} ARVN 1st Brigade, I Corps Tactical Zone. According to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam's official history, apart from the 16,000 soldiers and civilians who managed to escape, over 120,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed, wounded or captured {{after the fall of}} Huế and Da Nang. In their attempt to abandon the territories of I Corps, the South Vietnamese military left behind <b>vast</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> U.S.-supplied military hardware. The North Vietnamese claimed to have captured 129 aircraft of different models, 179 tanks and armoured vehicles, 327 artillery pieces, 184 transport vehicles and 47 naval crafts. More than 10,000 tons of bombs, ammunition, grenades, food supplies, combat rations, and other materials were also captured. Total North Vietnamese and Viet Cong casualties are largely unknown.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the best}} {{preserved}} phases of Temple 16 is the Rosalila, built over the remains of five previous versions of the temple. Archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia discovered the almost intact shrine while tunneling underneath {{the final version of}} the temple. Rosalila is notable for its excellent state of preservation, including the entire building from the base platform up to the roof comb, including its highly elaborate painted stucco decoration. Rosalila features K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' placed at the centre of a mythological tableau, combining the founder of the dynasty with the sky deity Itzamna in avian form. The mythological imagery also includes anthropomorphic mountains, skeletons and crocodiles. Vents in the exterior were designed so smoke from incense being burned inside the shrine would interact with the stucco sculpture of the exterior. The temple had a hieroglyphic stone step with a dedicatory inscription. The stone step is less well preserved than the rest of the building, but a date in AD571 has been deciphered. Due to the deforestation of the Copán valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration — <b>vast</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> firewood could no longer be spared to reduce limestone to plaster. A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has been built at the Copán site museum.|$|E
