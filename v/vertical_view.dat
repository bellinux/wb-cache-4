40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} {{investigated}} how restriction of the <b>vertical</b> <b>viewing</b> angle influences obstacle-crossing behavior. Twelve participants stepped over obstacles of different dimensions while wearing visual-field-restricting goggles. Using full-body motion capture, several kinematic measures were extracted and analyzed. Results indicate that both a 40 ° and 90 ° <b>vertical</b> <b>viewing</b> angle yielded increased step length and toe clearance {{as compared to}} an unrestricted view (i. e., 135 °), whereas speed remained unaltered. A further decrease (to 25 °) caused participants to slow down {{in addition to a}} further increase of step length and toe clearance. These results are discussed in terms of a change in priorities, from conservation of energy and time to safety. Copyright © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|The {{tendency}} of the display market is towards displays with higher resolutions. Therefore, patterned retarder-based stereoscopic displays require smaller front glass thickness to maintain good <b>vertical</b> <b>viewing</b> angle and limited crosstalk. To properly design these stereoscopic displays and quantify these requirements, we developed a simulation platform to predict radiance, polarization profile, and crosstalk over viewing angles and over wavelengths. Tunable parameters such as {{the distance between the}} pixels and the patterned retarder, and the optical properties of the patterned retarder are included. The simulation platform has been validated by comparing outcomes of simulations with measurements. We predict crosstalk accounting for both the human eye field of view and the diameter of the pupil. We found that to obtain a <b>vertical</b> <b>viewing</b> angle of at least ±[*] 30 ^∘ and crosstalk of at most 0. 11 for a display with a pixel pitch beyond 0. 27 [*]mm, the display should include black absorbers, and the thickness of the front glass should be at most 0. 5 [*]mm. For higher resolution displays (pixel pitch no more than 0. 21 [*]mm), a front glass thickness at most 0. 15 [*]mm is required to produce a <b>vertical</b> <b>viewing</b> angle beyond ±[*] 14 ^∘ and a minimum viewing distance of 0. 3 [*]m...|$|R

40|$|The three {{electrode}} {{direct current}} plasma (DCP), {{has been investigated}} {{for the analysis of}} samples introduced using aqueous solution nebulisation, hydride generation and slurry atomisation. For aqueous solutions, simplex optimisation with signal to background ratio as the criterion of merit, <b>vertical</b> <b>viewing</b> position was found to be most critical. A continuous-flow hydride generator was interfaced to the DCP via a modified sample introduction chimney. Optimisation indicated that total sample introduction gas flow rates were essentially similar to those for conventional nebulisation and that <b>vertical</b> <b>viewing</b> position was again critical. Generation conditions for lead hydride were also simplex optimised. Acid, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen peroxide concentration were all found to be critical. Detection limits for hydride generation were: As 4 ng cmˉ³, Se 4 ng cmˉ³, Pb 10 ng cmˉ³. Arsenic and selenium were accurately determined in various reference materials. The determination of Mg in aqueous slurries of kaolin was optimised using the Mg(II) 279. 079 nm line and conventional sample introduction. <b>Vertical</b> <b>viewing</b> position was again critical with the optimum on the boundary of the analytical zone and over the plasma core. A reduction of emission intensity at high slurry concentrations (> 12 %), was observed.

50|$|These {{vertical}} {{conflicts are}} critical in leading to autonomy and advanced personality growth. If {{the person is}} to achieve higher levels, the shift to multilevelness must occur. If a person {{does not have the}} developmental potential to move into a multilevel view, then he or she will fall back from the crises of Level II to reintegrate at Level I. In the shift to multilevelness, the horizontal (unilevel), stimulus-response model of life is replaced by a vertical and hierarchical analysis. This <b>vertical</b> <b>view</b> becomes anchored by one's emerging individual value structure, and all events are seen in relation to personal ideals. These personal value ideals become the personality ideal: how the person wants to live his or her life. As events in life are seen in relation to this multilevel, <b>vertical</b> <b>view,</b> it becomes impossible to support positions that favor the lower course when higher goals can be identified (or imagined).|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{questions}} regarding the functional architecture of the mind have been divided into two different theories {{of the nature of}} the faculties. The first can be characterized as a horizontal view because it refers to mental processes as if they are interactions between faculties such as memory, imagination, judgement, and perception, which are not domain specific (e. g., a judgement remains a judgement whether it refers to a perceptual experience or to the conceptualization/comprehension process). The second can be characterized as a <b>vertical</b> <b>view</b> because it claims that the mental faculties are differentiated on the basis of domain specificity, are genetically determined, are associated with distinct neurological structures, and are computationally autonomous.|$|E
