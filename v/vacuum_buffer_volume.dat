40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, an {{operation}} {{research on the}} performances of Tomakomai CCS project {{has been carried out}} for investigating the permeability uncertainty and the failures on CO 2 operation and transportation. Firstly, economical effects of estimation error in aquifer permeability were investigated by using a reservoir block modeling based on numerical simulation results on CO 2 injection rate. Secondary, economic loss resulted from failure of CO 2 injection was evaluated by assuming periodical injection halts. It is clear that CO 2 buffers, such as sphere gas tanks, should be installed to store CO 2 on the CCS process which can temporarily store CO 2 after it is captured when a trouble on transportation or injection processes occurs. Without a buffer, releasing the captured CO 2 to the atmosphere due to system failure or trouble in injection will add to capture costs, or will result in carbon tax or opportunity loss on CCS. The larger size of CO 2 <b>buffer</b> <b>volume</b> can potentially withstand against long-term trouble, however the larger <b>buffer</b> <b>volume</b> needs larger cost for initial construction and maintenance.

In this study, CCS systemperformance has been investigated by numerical simulations for estimation error in permeability distribution of the layer, and economic evaluations on troubles assumed to make terminate CO 2 injection. The CO 2 buffer, such assphere gas tanks, should be installed to store CO 2 onthe process after its capture.

However, selecting the subset of reference-image samples that need to be warped to generate the new view is a very difficult task. We present a sample-selection method that uses the <b>vacuum</b> <b>buffer</b> algorithm.

The <b>vacuum</b> <b>buffer</b> is essentially a generalized z-buffer and it measures what sub-volumes of the current viewfrustum have been determined. Another important difference is that our method uses the current view, which allows it {{to reduce the number of}} chosen samples more than other methods that offer a sample-selection solution to be used for several desired camera views. The tradeoff for using the current view is having to solve the sample selection at each frame. By exploiting the coherence in the reference images, groups of nearby samples become the actual primitive, which massively reduces the total cost. Since our method does not build an intermediate scene representation, it avoids the undesirable additional resampling and is also better suited for use in conjunction with IBRW hardware...|$|R

Cryocoolers are used for various {{applications}} like, cooling of infra red detectors, cryo surgical knife, cryogen recondenser etc. In this thesis the design development and testing of Twin Pulse Tube Cryocooler (TPTC) are discussed. TPTC consists of two pulse tubes driven by dual piston head linear compressor. This dual piston linear compressor is operated using single linear motor. Using this configuration, cooling power is doubled with reduced cost of compressor. The design, fabrication and testing of Linear Moving Magnet Synchronous Motor (LMMSM) based dual piston head linear compressor are carried out indigenously. Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis is used for estimating eddy current loss and flux distribution pattern in various mover configurations of the linear motor. The developed fabrication and assembly procedure of linear motor are discussed in detail. The mover of linear motor is supported by using a pair of cross armed C – type flexures. These flexures are designed using FEM and are fabricated indigenously. The flexure pairs are tested for 108 cycles with ± 3 mm stroke length of linear motor before assembling compressor. Linear motor is usually required to be operated at different frequencies. Thus, a variable frequency and variable voltage Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) based power supply is designed using analog circuits like Op-Amps. This cost effective power supply is capable of delivering 27 A at 100 V with frequency range of 25 Hz to 80 Hz continuously.
