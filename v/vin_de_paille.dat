The next-largest {{concentration}} is found in the Languedoc, where it was first planted around the town of Limoux and up to 30% can be blended with Mauzac in the sparkling Blanquette de Limoux. Every year since 1991, Chardonnay production is celebrated in Limoux during the Toques et Clochers festival. By 2000, [...] more than [...] were planted, with many being used for wines under the Vin de Pays d'Oc. These wines were unique in that they were some of the first examples of Chardonnay to be varietally labeled as [...] "Chardonnay". Other French wine regions with Chardonnay plantings include Alsace, Ardèche, Jura, Savoie, and the Loire Valley. In Jura, it is used to create <b>vin</b> <b>de</b> <b>paille</b> dessert wines. Here, the grape is known as Melon d'Arbois or Gamay blanc and is sometimes blended with Savagnin. It is most widely found in Arbois, Côtes du Jura, and L'Étoile AOCs. In the Loire, up to 20% of Chardonnay can be included in the Chenin blanc-based wines of Anjou blanc and more producers are using the grape to soften some of the edges of Chenin blanc. It can also be used in the sparkling wines of Saumur and some Muscadet producers have begun experimenting with oak-aged Chardonnay.|$|E

50|$|Throughout history, the {{vineyard}} and the Steinwein produced {{here have been}} noted in various texts and literary work. The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in particular, described the wine {{as one of his}} favorites and wrote many lines praising its quality. In the 1840s {{the vineyard}} was visited by French wine writer André Jullien who described the sweet Steinwein from Würzburger Stein as being very potent and liable to cause violent headaches if too much was consumed. Jullien went on to describe that the strength and sweetness of the wines from Würzburger weren't necessarily the result of late harvest picking but rather from the post-harvest practice of drying the grapes out on mats prior to fermentation—making them essentially <b>vins</b> <b>de</b> <b>paille</b> or straw wines.|$|R

50|$|Savagnin or Savagnin blanc (not to be {{confused}} with Sauvignon blanc) is a variety of white wine grape with green-skinned berries. It is mostly grown in the Jura region of France, where it is made into Savagnin wine or the famous vin jaune and <b>vin</b> <b>de</b> <b>paille.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jura, a small {{region in}} the {{mountains}} close to Switzerland where some unique wine styles, notably Vin Jaune and <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> <b>Paille,</b> are produced. The region covers six appellations and is related to Burgundy through its extensive use of the Burgundian grapes Chardonnay and Pinot noir, though other varieties are used. It also shares cool climate with Burgundy.|$|E
50|$|There are six {{regional}} <b>Vins</b> <b>de</b> Pays, which cover {{large areas}} of France. The most voluminous contributor to this category of wines is <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> Pays d'Oc, from the Languedoc-Roussillon area in Mediterranean France. The second largest volume of <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> Pays wines is produced as <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> Pays de la Loire, a designation that applies to wines from the whole Loire Valley. The others are: <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> Pays du Comté Tolosan (south-west), <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> Pays de Méditerranée (south-east, Provence and Corsica) and <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> Pays des Comtés Rhodaniens (Rhone valley). Two further regional <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> Pays designations, <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> Pays de l'Atlantique (Bordeaux and Charentes (Cognac)) and <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> Pays Vignobles de France (all of wine-making France) were approved by French authorities in 2007, but (together with <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> Pays de Gaules for the Beaujolais region) remain disputed and as of July 2009, they remained unpublished in the Official Journal of the European Union due to actions taken by other French wine producers.

5000|$|Barboursville Vineyards in Virginia {{produces}} a straw {{wine in the}} Italian passito style, based on Moscato Ottonel and Vidal grapes. Potomac Point Winery, also in Virginia, {{produces a}} straw wine based on the Petit Manseng grape.

50|$|Grapes are {{harvested}} ripe {{in the first}} two weeks of October, by carefully choosing bunches having fruits not too close to each other, to let the air flow. Grapes are allowed to dry, traditionally on straw mats. This process is called appassimento or rasinate (to dry and shrivel) in Italian. This concentrates the remaining sugars and flavours and is similar to the production of French <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> <b>Paille.</b> The pomace left over from pressing off the Amarone is used in the production of Ripasso Valpolicellas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> <b>Paille</b> is the French for 'straw wine', {{made only}} in the ripest vintages. Perhaps the best known example {{is made in the}} Cotes du Jura (Arbois and {{sometimes}} L'Etoile) from a blend of Chardonnay, Savagnin and the red grape Poulsard. Vins de paille are also made from Marsanne in Hermitage, and from Riesling in Alsace. In Corrèze, it is called Vin Paillé. Traditionally the grapes are placed indoors on straw mats for up to three months, and the final wine has 10-20% residual sugar, with flavours of peaches and apricots. It is an excellent accompaniment to foie gras.|$|E

5000|$|The winery's {{range of}} Rhône wines are grouped into four quality levels. The two basic levels are {{referred}} to as [...] "Découverte" [...] and [...] "Tradition", the intermediate level [...] "Prestige", and the top level [...] "Fac&Spera". Wines at the Fac&Spera level are produced from the appellations Côte-Rôtie, Hermitage, Crozes-Hermitage, Saint-Joseph, Cornas, and Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Chapoutier is something of a champion of the white wines from those northern Rhône appellations more known for red wines, and produces many ambitious white wines from such appellations. Of the fifteen wines in the [...] "Fac&Spera" [...] range, ten are red and five white, including one sweet white wine, a Hermitage <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> <b>Paille.</b>|$|E
50|$|Frédéric Lornet {{has been}} working with this palette and other grape types to make classic {{versions}} of French wine using Pinot noir and Chardonnay grapes. One of the rarest wines made at Abbaye de la Boutière is called vin jaune (Yellow Wine), which is made from the Savagnin grape (also known locally as Naturé). Abbaye de la Boutière also makes two sparkling wines: Cremant du Jura and Crémant du Jura Rosé. It also makes pure Savagnin wine and a Ploussard named L’Abbaye after the ancient Cistercian abbey where they are made. Moreover, Lornet makes a wine from the rare Trousseau grape he calls Trousseau des Dames, a unique <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> <b>Paille</b> and some Macvin.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 1994, he {{received}} numerous awards for his wines. Kracher was {{the recipient of}} several prizes from various sources for best Austrian wine or vinery of the year, Sweet wine maker {{of the year and}} such, including [...] "Winemaker of the Year" [...] by the London-based Wine Journal six times. He was also active in California where Alois Kracher and fellow Austrian Manfred Krankl (who runs the Sine Qua Non winery) produced sweet wines under the label Mr. K. So far, he was the only Austrian winemaker to have received a straight 100-point score by Robert M. Parker's The Wine Advocate, although that score was awarded to a Mr. K wine, the 2004 Mr. K The Strawman, a <b>Vin</b> <b>de</b> <b>Paille</b> from Semillon. With Boston-based Spanish importer Jorge Ordóñez, Kracher created a winery in Málaga, Spain, making dry and sweet muscat wines from old hillside vineyards.|$|E
