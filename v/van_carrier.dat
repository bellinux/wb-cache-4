50|$|The intra-city public {{transport}} system is essentially road based with 500 private minibuses, 550 tempos(to reduce pollution now replaced by Maruti <b>van</b> as contract <b>carrier),</b> more than 100 Metro Taxi (Flat fare Rs.11.95 per KM) and 10,000 auto rickshaws. The city felt {{a lack of}} public mass transport system for long time.|$|R
50|$|The B1000 was a {{remarkable}} van at the time; the unusually high loading capacity, two-stroke engine, front wheel drive and semi trailing arms suspension differed from the more traditionally constructed vans in the West. Being the only commercially available van in East Germany, the factory offered many body styles; a flatbed, a panel <b>van,</b> a people <b>carrier,</b> a box <b>van</b> and an ambulance were all available.|$|R
6000|$|He {{gave away}} the tree to a by-stander, {{as soon as}} he could find one who would accept the {{cumbersome}} gift, and the twain moved on towards the inn at which he had put up. Marty made as if to step forward for the pleasure of being recognized by Miss Melbury; but abruptly checking herself, she glided behind a <b>carrier's</b> <b>van,</b> saying, dryly, [...] "No; I baint wanted there," [...] and critically regarded Winterborne's companion.|$|R
50|$|As the {{trailing}} {{ship in the}} escort <b>carrier</b> <b>van,</b> Kalinin Bay came under intense enemy fire. Though partially protected by chemical smoke, by a timely rain squall, and by valiant counterattacks of screening destroyers and destroyer escorts, she took the first of 15 direct hits at 0750. Fired from an enemy battleship, the large caliber shell (14 inch or 16 inch) struck the starboard side of the hangar deck just abaft the forward elevator.|$|R
5000|$|Pixy + SSC {{concept was}} {{introduced}} at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The Pixy is an enclosed three-wheel, single-seat personal transport pod, {{similar to the}} Toyota i-unit, and i-REAL, but dissimilar in that two Pixies can dock inside the SSC (aka Suzuki Sharing Coach) for highway driving. Electric power is generated by a hydrogen fuel cell and solar panels to drive the SSC <b>carrier</b> <b>van,</b> and to recharge the Pixy at the same time.|$|R
6000|$|At first {{not a soul}} {{appeared}} {{who could}} enlighten him as he desired, or seemed likely to appear that night. But presently a slight noise of laboring wheels and the steady dig of a horse's shoe-tips became audible; and there loomed in the notch {{of the hill and}} plantation that the road formed here at the summit a <b>carrier's</b> <b>van</b> drawn by a single horse. When it got nearer, he said, with some relief to himself, [...] "'Tis Mrs. Dollery's--this will help me." ...|$|R
60|$|It is a Saturday {{afternoon}} {{of blue and}} yellow autumn time, and the scene is the High Street of a well-known market-town. A large <b>carrier's</b> <b>van</b> stands in the quadrangular fore-court of the White Hart Inn, upon the sides of its spacious tilt being painted, in weather-beaten letters: 'Burthen, Carrier to Longpuddle.' These vans, so numerous hereabout, are a respectable, if somewhat lumbering, class of conveyance, much resorted to by decent travellers not overstocked with money, the better among them roughly corresponding to the old French diligences.|$|R

As the trailing ship in the escort <b>carrier</b> <b>van,</b> Kalinin Bay came under intense enemy fire. Though partially protected by smoke, a timely rain squall, and counterattacks by the screening destroyers and destroyer escorts, she took the first of fifteen direct hits at 0750. Fired from an enemy battleship, the large caliber shell (14 in or 16 in) struck the starboard side of the hangar deck just aft of the forward elevator.|$|R
60|$|She {{went through}} Stourcastle without pausing and onward to a {{junction}} of highways, {{where she could}} await a <b>carrier's</b> <b>van</b> that ran to the south-west; for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of country had never yet struck across it. While waiting, however, there came along a farmer in his spring cart, driving approximately in the direction that she wished to pursue. Though he was a stranger to her she accepted his offer of a seat beside him, ignoring that its motive was a mere tribute to her countenance. He was going to Weatherbury, and by accompanying him thither she could walk {{the remainder of the}} distance instead of travelling in the van by way of Casterbridge.|$|R
60|$|Three {{hours and}} a half of {{straining}} up hills and jogging down brought them to St. Launce's, the market town and railway station nearest to Endelstow, and the place from which Stephen Smith had journeyed over the downs on the, to him, memorable winter evening {{at the beginning of the}} same year. The <b>carrier's</b> <b>van</b> was so timed as to meet a starting up-train, which Stephen entered. Two or three hours' railway travel through vertical cuttings in metamorphic rock, through oak copses rich and green, stretching over slopes and down delightful valleys, glens, and ravines, sparkling with water like many-rilled Ida, and he plunged amid the hundred and fifty thousand people composing the town of Plymouth.|$|R
40|$|Van Buchem {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive disease characterized by overgrowth of the skeleton. In {{a group of}} Dutch patients the disease {{is thought to be}} due to a 52 -kb deletion that results in decreased expression of the SOST gene. To further characterize the disease, the morphology of the metacarpals of six adult subjects and two juveniles with Van Buchem disease were measured on hand x-rays along with nine normal adults and nine adult carriers of the disease. Serum bone formation markers, alkaline phosphatase, type I procollagen peptide, and osteocalcin, and the urinary bone resorption marker, cross-linked N-telopeptide, were determined. Van Buchem patients had increased metacarpal outer diameter, inner diameter, cortical thickness, and bone mineral density. Calculated bone volume and derived polar moment of inertia were markedly elevated (elevations of 158 ± 33 % and 497 ± 95 %, respectively) consistent with increased bone strength. Serum procollagen peptide and osteocalcin were significantly higher in Van Buchem patients. Urinary cross-linked N-telopeptide was significantly elevated in Van Buchem patients. None of these changes was found in <b>Van</b> Buchem <b>carriers.</b> These observations indicate that decreased expression of the SOST gene can lead to increased bone formation and to stronger bones...|$|R
30|$|All {{the cases}} we {{describe}} have a later onset UCC bladder phenotype. It {{is unclear whether}} the other cancers in family B are related or more likely are sporadic occurrences. Urothelial cancers are estimated to occur in up to 18 % of MSH 2 gene <b>carriers</b> (<b>van</b> der Post et al. 2010; Skeldon et al. 2013), although these are predominantly upper tract TCC rather than bladder although bladder cancers have been reported rarely and with male predominance. Neither of our families had abnormal mismatch repair proteins on immunohistochemistry. Somatic mutations {{have been identified in}} bladder cancers with around 50 – 60 % of cases showing mutations in FGFR 3 (Balbás-Martínez et al. 2013). Other genes including STAG 2 on the X-chromosome (Solomon et al. 2013) have been recognised, but no germline mutations as yet identified in a pure bladder cancer phenotype.|$|R
5000|$|After conversion, Chiyoda was {{assigned}} to the 3rd Fleet and departed Yokosuka for Saipan, Guam and Palau, Balikpapan and Davao on 1 March as part of emergency reinforcements following the fall of Kwajalein to the US, returning to Kure on 10 April. On 11 May, she departed for Tawitawi with Air Group 653 as part of Operation A-Go, for the defense of the Mariana Islands. She was accompanied by the carriers Chitose, , , , [...] and by the battleship [...] During the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 June, she was part of the <b>Van</b> Force with <b>carriers</b> Chitose, Zuihō, battleships , Musashi, , [...] and cruisers , , [...] and [...] She was hit by a bomb on 20 June on her aft flight deck, which killed 20 crewmen, wounded 30 more and destroyed two aircraft. She was withdrawn for repairs on 22 June. She remained at Kure through the end of July.|$|R
40|$|Today, a {{large share}} of cost, congestion, and {{emission}} in cities is attributed to light goods vehicles like <b>carrier</b> <b>vans</b> distributing to the last mile. The aim of many policy agendas is to reach cleaner cities with less disturbance from the distribution vehicles. Several suggestions have been put forward and tested in research and practice, such as access restrictions, multimodal transport, and use of cleaner vehicles. In this paper, we develop a case for a more sustainable freight distribution within cities using an ex ante case study. The idea of the mobile depot is built on the iteration between historical transitions within cities and contemporary developments in urban freight distribution, and then analyzed ex ante both quantitatively in calculations and qualitatively in two stakeholder workshops. The idea is integrated and multimodal, based on a mobile depot (e. g., a bus, truck, barge, or tram) that circles the city and connects to low emission last mile delivery options such as LEVs (Light Electrical Vehicles) or cargo bikes. We found that such a system can be environmentally and socially better for the city context, while maintaining economic viability above a certain utilization rate of the mobile depot for the transport operators...|$|R
60|$|In {{addition}} to these fixed obstacles which spoke so cheerfully of individual unrestraint as to boundaries, movables occupied the path and roadway to a perplexing extent. First the <b>vans</b> of the <b>carriers</b> {{in and out of}} Casterbridge, who hailed from Mellstock, Weatherbury, The Hintocks, Sherton-Abbas, Kingsbere, Overcombe, and many other towns and villages round. Their owners were numerous enough to be regarded as a tribe, and had almost distinctiveness enough to be regarded as a race. Their vans had just arrived, and were drawn up {{on each side of the}} street in close file, so as to form at places a wall between the pavement and the roadway. Moreover every shop pitched out half its contents upon trestles and boxes on the kerb, extending the display each week a little further and further into the roadway, despite the expostulations of the two feeble old constables, until there remained but a tortuous defile for carriages down the centre of the street, which afforded fine opportunities for skill with the reins. Over the pavement on the sunny side of the way hung shopblinds so constructed as to give the passenger's hat a smart buffet off his head, as from the unseen hands of Cranstoun's Goblin Page, celebrated in romantic lore.|$|R
