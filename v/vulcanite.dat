All previous observations of the glottis and larynx (including those of García, Hack and Macewen) had been performed under indirect vision (using mirrors) until 23 April 1895, when Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Germany first described direct visualization of the vocal cords. Kirstein performed the first direct laryngoscopy in Berlin, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope.

40|$|This comment {{consists}} essentially {{of three}} well defined partes: the is first physical geography, the second hydrogeology {{and the last}} is hydrogeochemistry. The AA., after a preliminary and organic geological investigation which permitted {{the preparation of the}} map (Fig. 3) in which the various geolithologic units are corelated, then made a particular study of the principal geomorphologic structures present in the entire basin. The multiple presence of such structure is justified in the geological difference of the formations present. Among the typical structures of the basic <b>vulcanites</b> was the evidence of cushion lava, block lava and tabularcolumn lava; among the typical acid <b>vulcanites</b> are the stratoid lava and the cave like structures. Also the evidence were the pointed tabular structures, the concave tabular structures and the dip-shop, tabular structures present in the series of lava flows, and of porous stone deposits and sea deposits in alternate stratus. The part relative to the hydrogeology was preceded by an examination of the climatology and the hydrometry of the basinc. Five meteorological rain measuring stations and two thermometeorological rain measuring stations were used for this study and the following information were gathered: - the maximum precipitations were concentrated in the late autumn period, in winter and in the early spring; the maximum aridity was during the summer months; there is a great irregularity in the intensity of the precipitations; within the area of the basin proportional differences of values of precipitation due to altitudes do not exist. The hydrometric characteristics of the basin have been brought to light using the information of hydrometric data given by the station at Reinamare. From an hydrological point of view, by suddividing the general area into thre larges complexes based on their permeability, the most important hydrogeological series and water structures of the basin have been located.

40|$|The {{origin of}} authigenic {{minerals}} {{on the ocean}} floor has been extensively discussed in the past with emphasis on two major processes; precipitation from solutions originating from submarine eruptions, and slow precipitation from sea water of dissolved elements, originating from weathering of continental rocks. It is concluded that in several marine authigenic mineral systems these processes overlap. A diagnostic principle is suggested, permitting a qualitative or semiquantitative discrimination between marine authigenic minerals crystallized from dissolved species, which have spent a long time in solution on the one hand, and the same minerals generated from solutions, near their source on the other. Extensive data are available for the manganese and iron oxide minerals forming manganese nodules. It is indicated {{on the basis of their}} composition and structure that many of the nodules found in the vicinity of the continents are made up essentially of manganese derived from continental weathering. In contrast to this group, all of the nodules found in the Pacific area of submarine vulcanism display the criteria for rapid precipitation near the source of solution. The distribution of barium minerals over the deep ocean floor is discussed. The same diagnostic principle is suggested for application to these solids, in order to discriminate between baryte and harmotome crystallized near the source of barium- rich, acidic <b>vulcanites,</b> and the same minerals formed from continental solution with passage through the biosphere. In the case of the authigenic aluminosilicates it is found that many of the framework elements (Si and particularly Al) have low passage time through solution, and the major fraction of these elements is consequently removed from solution in the vicinity of the eruptive source materials. Extensive modification of the crystal structures, however, takes place over long periods of time, adding particularly cations from sea water, and probably to some extent silica from siliceous fossils, which on their decay {{on the ocean floor}} appear to contribute to the silicate framework of growing zeolites. The marked fractionation of the rare earth ions between coexisting phases is pointed out, with discussion of the potential use of this phenomenon to indicate the processes of formation. The use of the hafnium/zirconium ratio as a tracer for the igneous source type is suggested, and the application of ideally imperfect tracers to establish the varying relative importance of volcanic versus halmeic source of marine minerals is discussed in general...|$|R
40|$|The medieval castle of Serravalle, {{located at}} the top of the hill of the same name (81 m. above sea level), near the mouth of the Temo River, is one of the best-known medieval fortifications in Sardinia. The {{construction}} of the oldest part of the castle (according to F. Fara), is attributed to the Marchesi Malaspina di Villafranca, on their arrival in Sardinia, and is dated to the beginning of the 12 th century (1112 - 1121). Recent studies, however, tend to shift both the arrival of the Malaspinas and the birth of the castle to the following century. They founded the new town of Bosa, moving the original nucleus called Bosa vetus two kilometres downhill; thus the late medieval village of Sa Costa (which makes up the historical centre of present-day Bosa) began to develop; it still exerts considerable historical fascination. The Serravalle castle complex was built in various stages; the construction of the earliest fortificatisons was followed by the erectiojn of four corner towers about 10 m tall, linked by a thick wall. The raising of the pentagonal tower located in the western corner of the boundary wall goes back to about 1330. The tower, which probably consisted of two storeys with wooden beams, now missing, and one stone one with a longitudinal arch, was built using pyroclastic rocks belonging to the Oligo-Miocenic volcanic cycle occurring in Sardinia between 33 and 11 million years ago. The pyroclastic rocks in the tower, with a composition varying from dacite to rhyolite (classification according to De La Roche, 1980), are extremely heterogeneous due to the different ways in which they were deposited and the varying occurrence of pumice, stone and phenocrystals. They display a porphyritic structure (with a porphyritic index of between 10 and 20) with phenocrystals of opaque (ilmenite, magnetite and/or titanomagnetite), plagioclase, ± biotite, and rare hornblend and quartz. Available data indicate that the pyroclastites utilised in the construction of the pentagonal tower have characteristics similar to the <b>vulcanites</b> outcropping in the surrounding area. On the basis of their physical properties (porosity, apparent and actual density, imbibition and saturation coefficients, etc.) and petro-volcanological characteristics, it was possibile to subdivide the volcanic rocks of the tower into two main groups: a) lava-like ignimbrites, with a medium to high degree of welding, with average values of open porosity and apparent density of 22. 5 ± 5. 9 % and 1. 99 ± 0. 15 g/cm 3, respectively; b) pyroclastites in prevalently cineritic facies, with a generally low degree of welding, with average values of open porosity and apparent density of 36. 3 ± 2. 6 % and 1. 50 ± 0. 07 g/cm 3, respectively. Degradation processes are distributed differently on the façades of the tower; they are mainly concentrated on those exposed to winds coming from the sea (north-west and west), and above all on weakly-welded pyroclastites. In the latter, the presence of cripto- and fano-efflorescence is highlighted, as well as the presence of various macroscopic forms of alteration: pitting, exfoliation, flaking, alveolation, differential degradation. In welded pyroclastites, processes of chromatic alteration and superficial exfoliation are prevalently present...|$|R
40|$|Post {{consumer}} tyres {{continue to}} present the community with challenges for their safe and sustainable disposal. They also present an opportunity to divert a significant waste stream in to a valuable resource. This thesis looks into one possible method to recycle post consumer tyres and high density polyethylene won from curb side collection of milk packaging. The study investigates {{the use of a}} bromomethyl phenol resin as the basis of a compatibilization chemistry enabling a bond to be formed between the ground tyre rubber particle and the polyethylene matrix. It builds upon the seminal work of Coran & Patel in developing thermoplastic <b>vulcanites</b> and the more recent work of Liu and colleagues. Unlike previous investigators, this work employed a single process to both compound the composite component materials and to form the end product. This single process was carried out using an injection moulding machine that was modified by the addition of a number of automated hoppers that delivered the composite component materials and compatibilization chemistry to the moulder&# 146;s screw. Through this system of reactive injection moulding it was demonstrated that both the composite material and product could be formed in a single process. Investigation of the mechanical properties of ground tyre rubber and polyethylene composites using tensile testing techniques was undertaken. The results of tensile testing indicated that the particle matrix bond was formed only when dicumyl peroxide was included in the compatibilization chemistry. This was established from the observation of dense arrays of fibrils joining the rubber particles to the HDPE matrix in samples that had been tested to ultimate failure. The particle matrix bond was not formed when dicumyl peroxide was not present. An investigation was undertaken using X-ray photo spectrometry to examine the bonding chemistry. This revealed the presence of the carbon oxygen carbon sequence at the particle surface when dicumyl peroxide was a component of the compatibilization chemistry. The presence of this sequence of atoms is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the Chroman Ring structure to be present in the bond. The presence of this structure would give rise to a more tenacious bonding between particle and matrix than would normally be achieved through either carbon carbon or carbon sulphur cross linking mechanisms. The identification of the Chroman Ring structure in ground tyre rubber and polyolefin composites has not previously been reported in the literature. The contribution made by the particle matrix bond to the overall performance of the composite was investigated using non linear explicit finite element analysis. Two models for the composite were developed, a simplified single particle model which was used to verify the interaction between particle and matrix and also to provide a development environment for a model of the particle matrix bond. Subsequently, a more complex multi particle model was developed which was of higher fidelity to the formed composites. Through the use of these models it has been deduced that the bond achieved between particle and matrix had a strength of approximately 1 MPa and that, for the properties of the particle and the matrix materials, the bond was likely to fail significantly before the composite attained peak loading conditions.

40|$|Viene presentata una sintesi dei dati ottenuti durante la realizzazione dei fogli geologici alla scala 1 : 50. 000 riguardanti alcune aree costiere del Lazio. La possibilità di porre a confronto l’evoluzione di settori che presentano problematiche simili ma con situazioni locali specifiche ha permesso di evidenziare, a partire da circa 850 ka, una storia comune per la costa del Lazio settentrionale e {{centrale}}, diversa da quella che ha invece interessato nello stesso intervallo di tempo la costa del Lazio meridionale. La ricostruzione degli eventi a scala regionale ha permesso di distinguere gli effetti di una tettonica regionale (soprattutto di sollevamento isostatico lungo la costa del Lazio settentrionale e centrale e di subsidenza per quello meridionale) {{rispetto a}} movimenti locali che potrebbero essere essenzialmente legati alle fasi vulcaniche che hanno contemporaneamente interessato il margine tirrenico del Lazio. Vengono inoltre evidenziate alcune problematiche che riguardano l’organizzazione cartografica nazionale ed in particolare la denominazione dei sintemi a scala regionale e la necessità di introdurre una nomenclatura in grado di associare nel suo interno più sintemi non distinguibili sul terreno. We present {{a synthesis of}} the data collected during the field work devoted to {{the realization of the}} geological map at the 1 : 50. 000 of Italy, concerning some coastal areas of Latium. The possibility to compare the evolution of areas envolved in the same geodinamic contest but having different local structural framework, has allowed us to evidence a common history, starting from 850 ka, for the coast of northern and central Latium, {{different from that of the}} southern coast. The effect of local estensional tectonic related to the volcanism which interested central Italy in that period was distinguished. The units have been organized in Unconformity Bounded Stratigraphic Units (UBSU) on the base of the hierarchy order of the basal surfaces delimithing them. Synthemes have been limited by surfaces recognized at regional scale caused by oscillation of the sea level. Each surface has been dated on the base of the geochronological data and /or the faunistic content of the above sediments and then it has been correlated to an isotopic stage. The vulcanic units have been organized following the indication of Fisher and Schmincke (1984), by introducing the Eruption units. “An eruption unit is a deposit defined as a thickness of volcanic material deposited from an eruptive pulse, an eruptive phase or an eruption…it is a conceptual entity that relates volcanic activity and a rock stratigraphic unit”. This method allows to consider all the unconformities recognizable in volcanic areas which cannot be extended at regional scale but are important to reconstruct the main phases of the volcano evolution. It allows even to consider the volcanic evolution in its regional contest. The volcanic deposits originated by the reworking of the primary units have been distinguished in syn-eruption and inter-eruption units (Smith, 1991; De Rita et alii, 2002 b; Giordano et alii, 2002 a). The geological and structural evolution of the island of Ponza, Zannone and Palmarola in the Pontine Archipelago, 30 km south east from the central coast of Latium, has been reconstructed. These three islands are the remnants of a submarine dome complex developed from the Upper Pliocene to almost 1. 1 Ma. Three main ryolithic domes have been recognized in Ponza, developed along NE-trending lineaments and showing different hyaloclastic facies reflecting the different geological contest in which they developed. The norhernmost Piana d’Incenso dome shows a prevailing hyaloclastic facies made of clast supported breccias and by flow banded lavas produced by its intrusive mode of emplacement, as a cryptodome. Similar facies characterize the Zannone dome in the Zannone island, where the intrusive nature is demonstrated by the structural relationship between the flow-banded lavas and the sedimentary units: these are tilted and deformed along low angle normal faults at the contact with the <b>vulcanites.</b> We have interpreted that the domes emplaced as cryptodome, because they were intruded almost at the center of a structural high of the sedimentary substratum made of the Mesozoic- Cenozoic brittle rocks. The other domes of Ponza and Palmarola show different hyaloclastic facies, mainly made of thick hyaloclastites showing different degree of brecciation reflecting the different degree of magma-water interaction. We suggest that the extrusive mode of emplacement of these domes is because their emplacement was along regional extensional faults controlling the structural evolution of the continental platform on which the volcanic dome complex developed. In the southern part of Ponza a subaerial trachytic dome developed almost 1. 1 Ma, after that the rhyolitic volcanism ended. The geological gap between the rhyolitic and the trachytic phases of volcanism, is evidenced by a high relief erosive surface. On the three island, in the range between 80 and 110 m a. s. l., marine terraces are present. These terraces have been correlated on the base of their similar morphology and because the above sediments are lithologically similar. They have to be formed after the end of the volcanism in the three islands. The uplifting of the surface occurred probably during a contemporaneous relative low standing of the sea level. We suggest to relate this event with the uplifting of the central coast of Latium, that occurred between 0. 9 and 0. 8 Ma, during the isotopic stage 22, when the alkali-potasssic volcanism started. The difference of the altitude at which the surface presently lies, is probably due to the effect of local extensional tectonic. Along the northern and the central coast of Latium, we have recognized three orders of terraces which coincide in the altitude and the age. In the northern coast the presence of a small basin infilled by volcaniclastic sediments, was helpful in correlating stratigraphic succession of the Vulsini, Sabatini and Vico volcanic districts to the coastal area successions. Here, the UBSU have been organized in 5 Synthemes whose basal surfaces were produced during low standing of the sea level. On the base of geochronological data and /or the faunistic content of the above sediments, the last three synthems have been ascribed to the 9, 7 and 5 isotopic stages respectively (De Rita et alii 2002 b). In the central coast of Italy, in the area of Roma city, the UBSU have been organized in 7 synthemes (Giordano et alii 2003), the last three of which have the same altitude and age of those recognized along the northern coast. Along the southern coast no terraces can be recognized. It has been then possible to establish that the coast of central Italy was subjected to a regional uplift evaluated in the order of 0, 2 mm/y, whereas the southern coast was subjected to a continuous subsidence active from Pliocene. Local extensional tectonic related to the volcanism has been recognized in the roman area. Some problems related to the organization of the national cartography are evidenced. They concern the nomenclature of synthem at regional scale and the opportunity to introduce a specific hierarchy to indicate an association of synthemes. In fact, in some cases it has not been possible to recognize all the discontinuities related to sea level oscillations, precluding the possibility to distinguish single synthemes that have been unified together. They do not represent a supersynthem because unconformities of major hierachic order were not recognize...|$|R
