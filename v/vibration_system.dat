Even a drummer playing entirely acoustic drums may use a monitor speaker to hear her drums, especially if she is playing in a loud rock or metal band, where there is substantial onstage volume from huge, powerful guitar stacks. Since the drum kit uses the deep bass drum, drummers are often given a large speaker cabinet with a 15" [...] subwoofer to help them monitor their bass drum sound (along with a full-range monitor speaker to hear {{the rest of their}} kit).

40|$|Objectives] Studying the {{influence}} of the system parameters of a quasi-zero stiffness isolator on vibration isolation performance can provide a key direction for the application of quasi-zero stiffness isolation in <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>systems.</b> [Methods] Based on a double layer <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>system</b> consisting of linear isolation and quasi-zero stiffness isolation, as well as an equivalent linear <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>system</b> with two degrees of freedom, dynamic models are separately established. Moreover, the average method is applied to derive the power transfer rate under the condition of two harmonic force excitation systems. It is proven that the double layer <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>system</b> has better <b>vibration</b> isolation performance than the equivalent linear <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>system</b> with two degrees of freedom, and a method for enhancing the vibration isolation effect of the double layer <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>system</b> is proposed. [Results] The results show that the power transfer rate of the double layer <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>system</b> is greater than 1 in the second order resonance frequency, which means that it has the effect of vibration isolation in the vicinity of resonance frequencies of the second order, which overcomes the shortcomings of the freedom linear <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>system</b> with two degrees of freedom.
