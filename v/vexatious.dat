5|$|The {{doctrine}} of standing prevents applicants from burdening {{the court with}} frivolous or <b>vexatious</b> claims. This minimizes disruption in the administrative process. When an administrative decision by a public authority is challenged, implementation of {{the decision by the}} authority may be delayed. Therefore, the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging the decision. Furthermore, since the courts' resources are limited, restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial resources are appropriately allocated.|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has criticized}} {{government}} programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining {{that it provides}} lawyers and <b>vexatious</b> litigators the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are {{necessary in order to}} provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits.|$|E

25|$|Legal abuse {{refers to}} abuses {{associated}} with both {{civil and criminal}} legal action.

25|$|Land {{sales were}} a {{continuing}} <b>vexatious</b> issue. The settlers {{were eager to}} buy land and some Māori were willing to sell, but under {{the provisions of the}} Treaty of Waitangi, land sales required the Government as an intermediary, and were thus extremely slow. FitzRoy changed the rules to allow settlers to purchase Māori land directly, subject to a duty of ten shillings per acre. But land sales proved slower than expected.|$|E
25|$|Since his incarceration, Bittaker {{has filed}} more than 40 {{frivolous}} lawsuits over issues as trivial as his being served a broken cookie and crushed sandwiches by the prison cafeteria, which he cited {{as an example}} of his being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.

25|$|The conquests {{destroyed}} little: {{what they}} did suppress were imperial rivalries and sectarian bloodletting among the newly subjected population. The Muslims tolerated Christianity, but they disestablished it; henceforward Christian life and liturgy, its endowments, politics and theology, would be a private and not a public affair. By an exquisite irony, Islam reduced the status of Christians to that which the Christians had earlier thrust upon the Jews, with one difference. The reduction in Christian status was merely judicial; it was unaccompanied by either systematic persecution or a blood lust, and generally, though not elsewhere and at all times, unmarred by <b>vexatious</b> behavior.|$|E
25|$|CIJA {{has been}} {{actively}} involved in the public debate surrounding the balance between protecting free speech and preventing the spread of hate speech. In 2012, in response to concerns toward Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (hate speech on the internet), CIJA proposed two options to achieve a reasonable balance. The first entailed reforming the existing act, including through measures to increase evidentiary standards, allow for early rejection of inadmissible Section 13 complaints, and discourage frivolous claims (including the assigning of costs to those who launch <b>vexatious</b> complaints). The second option would repeal Section 13 altogether, and assign responsibility for online hate speech exclusively to a more responsive criminal justice system.|$|E
25|$|In 1401, the English case Beaulieu v Finglam imposed strict {{liability}} for the escape of fire; additionally, {{strict liability}} was imposed {{for the release}} of cattle. Negligently handling fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources. Liability for common carrier, which arose around 1400, was also emphasized in the medieval period. Unintentional injuries were relatively infrequent in the medieval period. As transportation improved and carriages became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, collisions and carelessness became more prominent in court records. In general, scholars of England such as William Blackstone took a hostile view to litigation, and rules against champerty and maintenance and <b>vexatious</b> litigation existed. The restriction on assignment of a cause of action is a related rule based on public policy.|$|E
25|$|Awesa was {{appointed}} Minister for Works and Implementation after the 2012 election, losing the transport portfolio. In October 2012, his re-election was challenged in the National Court by opponent Pila Niningi. After the court dismissed Awesa's attempt {{to have the}} case thrown out as <b>vexatious,</b> it then shifted the trial from Mendi to Mount Hagen due to threats from his supporters. However, in January 2013, Niningu's challenge was dismissed {{on the grounds of}} incompetency, with leave to appeal being denied in April 2014. In his ministerial role, Awesa was faced with addressing a K1 billion backlog in road maintenance, widespread criticism over delays and misappropriated funds for repairing poor-quality roads in Lae, a number of key road projects, including a major bypass in Hela Province, issues of land compensation, and ongoing problems surrounding landslide damage on and blockades of the Highlands Highway by disgruntled protestors.|$|E
25|$|Between 1629 and 1643 the European {{situation}} presented infinite possibilities {{to politicians}} {{with a taste}} for adventure. However, Christian was incapable of a consistent diplomatic policy. He would neither conciliate Sweden, henceforth his most dangerous enemy, nor guard himself against her by a definite system of counter-alliances. Christian contacted the Roman Catholic part of the Thirty Years' War, and offered to broker a deal with Sweden. However, his mediating was highly skewed in favour of the Holy Roman Emperor, and was a transparent attempt of minimising the influence Swedish influence in the Baltics. His Scandinavian policy was so irritating and <b>vexatious</b> that Swedish statesmen advocated for a war with Denmark, to keep Christian from interfering in the peace negotiations with the Holy Roman Emperor, and in May 1643, Christian faced another war against Sweden. The increased Sound Dues had alienated the Dutch, who turned to support Sweden.|$|E
25|$|The {{returning}} to the Siemens Arena game, which started the 2015–16 Eurocup season, ended with a <b>vexatious</b> 87–91 defeat to Beşiktaş J.K. The team then crushed Szolnoki Olaj KK 65–89. After a loss to BC Žalgiris 70–79, the problems began. After shocking losses to BC Avtodor Saratov 81–97 and BC Zenit Saint Petersburg 65–70 {{at home in the}} EuroCup, the team was even booed of the court. Rytas also lost to PAOK B.C. 76–81, and rumors started off about conflicts between coach Nicola and the team. Due to the hopeless shape of the team, Marcelo Nicola was fired, with rumors that he will be replaced by Tomas Pačėsas. Under current coach Aurimas Jasilionis, however, the team played the best match in the season - a thrilling 103–92 win over Beşiktaş J.K in Istanbul. A few days later, despite improved play, Rytas lost 68–82 to BC Žalgiris in the Siemens Arena. The poor form of the team was quickly recalled when Rytas lost another Eurocup home game, this time to the Szolnoki Olaj KK 98–99. Another disastrous performance happened in Saratov - Rytas lost to BC Avtodor Saratov 92–109, with only minimal hope for qualification for the Last-32 stage in the Eurocup. After the loss, coach Jasilionis was replaced by longtime assistant coach Arvydas Gronskis. After another loss, this time to BC Zenit Saint Petersburg 84–92, Rytas lost all hope to qualify to the LAST-32 stage. In the final game, Rytas lost to P.A.O.K. BC 81–88 at home, finishing with a 2–8 record. After the Eurocup fiasco, coach Gronskis was sent to the reserve team Perlas Vilnius again, and Tomas Pačėsas became the new head coach of the team. The team, under a firm arm of Pačėsas, finished the year with a three straight victories. On 31 December 2015, Nicolás Laprovíttola left the team. On 10 January, Julius Jucikas was traded to Dzūkija Alytus for Adam Łapeta. On 17 January, Rytas achieved the season's first victory versus Žalgiris 78–72. On 19–21 February, Rytas competed in the newly formed Karaliaus Mindaugo taurė tournament. After defeating Lietkabelis Panevėžys in the quarter-final 88–82, Neptūnas Klaipėda in the semi-final 79–97 and Žalgiris Kaunas in the final 57–67, the team won their first trophy following a five seasons drought. Antanas Kavaliauskas was named MVP. On March 29, Rytas signed a three-years contract with the Euroleague Basketball Company and will compete in its organized tournaments.|$|E

Vagrants, [...] "originals," [...] eccentrics, and homeless wanderers who did little harm but were <b>vexatious</b> to the society they lived in were, and sometimes still are, confined to psychiatric hospitals or deprived of their legal rights. Some critics of psychiatry consider the practice as a political use of psychiatry and regard psychiatry as promoting timeserving.|$|E

500|$|He {{noted that}} Lord Hoffmann in Hall v Simons (2001) {{had said that}} a witness owed no duty of care in respect of his evidence, only a duty to tell the truth, but he {{considered}} that to be incorrect, since it failed to distinguish between witnesses of fact and experts. The expert would have {{a contract with the}} client in which he agreed to perform the duties that he owed to the court, and so there was no conflict between the two duties. In this respect, expert witnesses were more like advocates, who owed duties to client and court, than to witnesses of fact. He noted that barristers had long been immune from negligence claims until the decision of the House of Lords in Hall v Simons. Removing their immunity, he said, had not led to any diminution in advocates performing their duty to the court, and it would be [...] "mere conjecture" [...] to assume that this would be any different for expert witnesses. Neither had <b>vexatious</b> claims been a problem for barristers – in any event, the present case was not <b>vexatious</b> and there were other hurdles, both procedural and financial, in the way of an unsuccessful litigant making unmeritorious claims against an expert. As there was no justification for continuing to hold that expert witnesses were [...] "immune from suit in relation to the evidence they give in court or for the views they express in anticipation of court proceedings", he concluded that the immunity for claims for breach of duty (but not defamation) should be abolished.|$|E
500|$|Such <b>vexatious</b> {{complaints}} were repeated, by both Eyschen and Victor Thorn, when a railway worker {{was arrested in}} January 1915 for allegedly working for French military intelligence, and subsequently tried and sentenced in Trier. [...] As Minister for Justice, Thorn was incensed that the Luxembourgish legal system had been treated with such disdain. [...] Such objections were not received well by the German authorities. [...] Although they tired of Eyschen's stubborn ways, he remained a useful tool to unite the various Luxembourgish political factions. On 23 June 1915 a letter {{was sent to the}} Luxembourg government stating that the Germans considered Luxembourg to be a theatre of war and that the population, therefore, was subject to military law.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to England, he asked for and {{received}} a hearing concerning the colonial petition against his rule. [...] The Privy Council in February 1770 considered the petition, and after deliberation dismissed all of the charges as [...] "groundless, <b>vexatious,</b> and scandalous." [...] Despite this vindication, Bernard resigned as governor in 1771. [...] He was confirmed in the ownership of Mount Desert Island, a recognition he had been seeking since it was awarded to him in 1761. [...] Although he had been promised a baronetcy and a pension of £1,000 for his service, he learned after his return that the pension {{had been reduced to}} £500 (the baronetcy, of Nettleham, was awarded at crown expense). [...] His appeals on the matter were at first rejected, but when Lord North became Prime Minister in 1770, the pension was raised, but shortly after replaced by an appointment as commissioner on the Board of Revenue for Ireland, which paid the same amount.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 5th century Britain had been Roman {{for over three}} hundred and fifty years. The most {{troublesome}} enemies of Roman Britain were the Picts of central and northern Scotland, and the Gaels known as Scoti, who were raiders from Ireland. Also <b>vexatious</b> were the Saxons, the name Roman writers gave to the peoples {{who lived in the}} northern part of what is now Germany and the southern part of the Jutland peninsula. Saxon raids on the southern and eastern shores of England had been sufficiently alarming by the late 3rd century for the Romans to build the Saxon Shore forts, and subsequently to establish the role of the Count of the Saxon Shore to command the defence against these incursions. Roman control of Britain finally ended in the early part of the 5th century; the date usually given as marking the end of Roman Britain is 410, when the Emperor Honorius sent letters to the British, urging them to look to their own defence. [...] Britain had been repeatedly stripped of troops to support usurpers' claims to the Roman empire, and after 410 the Roman armies never returned.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the New Law Journal, Chris Pamplin {{called the}} {{decision}} [...] "unprincipled" [...] {{and argued that}} the decision [...] "threatens the very foundation of witness immunity", based on an out-of-date view of the expert witness as a [...] "hired gun". [...] Pamplin's view was that the majority had [...] "ignored the fundamental difference" [...] between experts and advocates, saying that advocates {{had no choice but}} to continue in the legal system whereas experts could continue their ordinary work without needing to carry on as an expert witness. [...] Therefore, experts would be more likely to abandon such work than advocates, making them more vulnerable to <b>vexatious</b> litigation. [...] However, he said it would make [...] "little immediate difference" [...] for many experts, since [...] "conscientious professionals" [...] would have little worry about being found negligent and would have insurance in case they were. The ruling would also help develop a [...] "professional class of expert", making it less likely that people would contribute expertise occasionally, and although a professional expert witness would have a better knowledge of their role and duties, this would be at the expense of [...] "freshness and challenge to dogma".|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court, by a {{majority}} of five to two, decided that expert witnesses were not immune in the law of England and Wales from claims in tort or contract for matters connected with their participation in legal proceedings. This reversed a line of authority dating back 400 years. The case considered the narrow issue, namely whether preparation of a joint statement by experts was immune from suit, and the wider public policy issue of whether litigants should be able to sue experts that they had instructed for breach of duty. There was discussion about whether removing the immunity would have a [...] "chilling effect" [...] on the willingness of experts to participate in court proceedings, although judges {{on both sides of the}} decision agreed that there was no empirical evidence on the point. [...] Lord Phillips, a member of the majority, compared the situation of expert witnesses with that of advocates, on the basis that both owed duties to clients and to the court. [...] Advocates' immunity from claims in negligence had been removed in 2001 in Hall v Simons. [...] The change, he said, had not led to an increase in <b>vexatious</b> claims or a reduction in the performance of duties owed by advocates to the court. [...] Lord Hope, in the minority, said that experts and advocates had different functions and so disagreed with the comparison. He also pointed out that English law would now be different from Scots law on this issue.|$|E

A Firman of February 22, 1834 abolished the <b>vexatious</b> charges which public functionaries, when traversing the provinces, had long been accustomed to take from the inhabitants. By the same edict all collection of money, except for the two regular half-yearly periods, was denounced as abuses. [...] "No one is ignorant," [...] said Sultan Mahmud II in this document, [...] "that I am bound to afford support to all my subjects against <b>vexatious</b> proceedings; to endeavour unceasingly to lighten, instead of increasing their burdens, and to ensure peace and tranquility.

2500|$|The Court {{also found}} that policy {{considerations}} supported its interpretation. [...] Omitting holder claims from SLUSA's coveragethe very form of <b>vexatious</b> litigation targeted in Blue Chip Stampswould be contrary to its purpose of preventing state law claims from frustrating {{the ends of the}} PSLRA. [...] As holder claims were typically based on the same facts as purchaser-seller actions, if they were not preempted, wasteful litigation based on identical facts could proceed in parallel proceedings in federal and state courts. [...] The existence of explicit exemptions in the statute (none applicable in this case) also discouraged the Court from itself finding further exemptions through implication. [...] Finally, prior to the post-PSLRA exodus of securities claims to state courts, state law securities fraud claims were rare; the presumption against preemption that a [...] "historically entrenched state-law remedy" [...] enjoys was not present here.|$|E

The Court justified the need for special damage in cases involving public rights to prevent frivolous or <b>vexatious</b> actions. Otherwise, courts will be swamped by an array of actions raised by [...] "mere busybodies and social gadflies, {{to the detriment of}} good public administration" [...] where the burden of bearing costs may not be a sufficient deterrence.|$|E
