5|$|Diệm's {{government}} formulated procedural regulations ostensibly {{designed to}} ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for and to prevent election fraud.

The prime minister tallied 605,025 <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that {{only half of the}} registered voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of the <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale ballot stuffing.|$|E
