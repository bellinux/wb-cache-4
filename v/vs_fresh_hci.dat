40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} the damages caused by slow cooling human metaphase II (MII) oocytes comparing the ultrastructure, inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), and apoptotic status of fresh and cryopreserved oocytes. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: University biology research unit and private IVF unit. PATIENT(S) : Fresh and cryopreserved supernumerary MII oocytes donated from women undergoing IVF cycles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Ultrastructure {{was assessed by}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM), mitochondrial function {{by means of the}} fluorescent DeltaPsim reporter JC- 1, and apoptotic status through fluorescent labeling with the pan-caspase inhibitor fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (FITC) -VAD FMK, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling. RESULT(S) : Compared to fresh oocytes, frozen/thawed (F/T) oocytes showed reduced cortical granule densities (F/T 3. 35 +/- 1. 94 / 10 microm <b>vs.</b> <b>fresh</b> 10. 30 +/- 3. 9 / 10 microm), swelling of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (F/T 0. 084 +/- 0. 03 microm(2) <b>vs.</b> <b>fresh</b> 0. 040 +/- 0. 02 microm(2)), decreased electron density of the mitochondrial matrix and damage to the mitochondrial membranes, low DeltaPsim of pericortical mitochondria, but no signs of apoptosis. CONCLUSION(S) : Slow cooling is associated with cortical granule exocytosis, swelling of smooth endoplasmic reticulum vesicles, and mitochondrial damage, but does not induce early or late apoptotic events.

40|$|Abstract Background Primary human tissues are an {{invaluable}} widely used tool for discovery of gene expression patterns which characterize disease states. Tissue processing methods remain unstandardized, leading to unanswered concerns {{of how to}} best store collected tissues and maintain reproducibility between laboratories. We subdivided uterine myometrial tissue specimens and stored split aliquots using the most common tissue processing methods (fresh, frozen, RNALater) before comparing quantitative RNA expression profiles on the Affymetrix U 133 human expression array. Split samples and inclusion of duplicates within each processing group allowed us to undertake a formal genome-wide analysis comparing the magnitude of result variation contributed by sample source (different patients), processing protocol (<b>fresh</b> <b>vs.</b> frozen vs. 24 or 72 hours RNALater), and random background (duplicates). The dataset was randomly permuted to define a baseline pattern of ANOVA test statistic values against which the observed results could be interpreted. Results 14, 639 of 22, 283 genes were expressed {{in at least one}} sample. Patient subjects provided the greatest sources of variation in the mixed model ANOVA, with replicates and processing method the least. The magnitude of variation conferred by processing method (24 hours RNALater vs 72 hours RNALater <b>vs.</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>vs</b> frozen) was similar to the variability seen within replicates. Subset analysis of the test statistic according to gene functional class showed that the frequency of "outlier" ANOVA results within each functional class is overall no greater than expected by chance. Conclusions Ambient storage of tissues for 24 or 72 hours in RNALater did not contribute any systematic shift in quantitative RNA expression results relative to the alternatives of fresh or frozen tissue. This nontoxic preservative enables decentralized tissue collection for expression array analysis without a requirement for specialized equipment. </p...|$|R

Thus, the presence of luminescence in biogenic particles is not a reliable indicator of diagenetic alteration as some authors have suggested. In addition, CL can reveal variations in the mineralogy of shell material (e. g. regenerated calcitic v. primary aragonitic) and can highlight growth-related structures. Manganese (Mn 2 +) {{is the most likely}} activator of this luminescence, and its content in the shells of benthic organisms seems to be linked to growth rate, ontogeny, open sea conditions, bathymetry and salinity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{evaluates the}} economic effects of generic advertising for dairy products in a multi-market setting {{that allows for}} horizontal demand and supply linkages across dairy product markets. I develop an equilibrium displacement model that explicitly permits substitutability and complementarity across retail demand for dairy products, as well as horizontal supply linkages through the common use of the raw commodity, milk, in alternative dairy products. Comparative statics from the model show that returns to generic promotion and optimal advertising expenditure depend on these cross-market effects. Numerical simulation of the model shows that ignoring the cross-market effects of advertising leads to inaccurate measurement of the returns to advertising. This is a key result, given that the extant literature on dairy advertising focuses only on the vertical market relationships, without considering cross-market effects. Extensions of the model disaggregate milk into its underlying components, and also consider potential market power by marketing firms. The concepts and models developed in this dissertation are applicable to the economics of promotion in industries where a single commodity is allocated to multiple downstream markets. Examples include the allocation of a farm commodity in alternative processed markets, processed <b>vs.</b> <b>fresh</b> markets, or foreign vs. domestic markets. The dissertation also has implications for further empirical research on generic advertising. ...|$|R
40|$|Injection of CBA mice the either mitogen-stimulated (LPS or con A) CBA {{lymphocytes}} {{which had}} been cultured for 3 days {{in the presence of}} foetal calf serum (FCS) led to the production of antisera which reacted strongly with virtually all types of mammalian cells, including human, whether normal or malignant, provided they had been cultured in FCS-containing media. Reactivity was detected by sensitive immunological assays such as complement-dependent cytoxocity using rabbit complement (but not using guinea-pig complement), or EA-rosette inhibition of Fc receptor-bearing cells. The antisera did not react with fresh normal lymphoid cells or ascites tumour cells; however, these same cell populations became fully susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of the antisera after as little as 4 h incubation at 37 degrees in the presence of FCS. Cells incubated without FCS or with FCS at 0 degrees were not affected. The antisera reacted with FCS to form a single band on Ouchterlony double-diffusion plates. On immunoelectrophoresis the reactive antigen appeared to migrate in the alpha-globulin region of serum proteins. These observations suggest that FCS may be a source of potentially serious misinterpretations in immunological studies of cell-associated antigens using antisera produced by the injection of cells grown in FCS-containing cultures.

40|$|AbstractAs {{the only}} type of {{instrument}} capable of determining artifact geochemistry {{in a wide variety}} of settings, portable X-Ray Fluorescence (PXRF) may be frequently utilized as probably the best option for collecting data when removal of objects in part or in whole is unfeasible. However, using PXRF in circumstances where sample selection and preparation diverge from standards developed for lab-based instrumentation requires assessing the impact of new and potentially limiting factors to establish the validity of the method in these new contexts. Here we examine the effects of surface contamination and chemical weathering on the ability to assess provenance of igneous building stones used in the Cuzco region of Peru. Surface contamination was assessed through comparing low-impact cleaning methods on diorite and andesite blocks, and weathering was examined by comparing weathered <b>vs.</b> <b>fresh</b> surfaces of samples from two andesite quarries. In general, the lightest elements were most impacted by contamination and weathering while measurements of many of the heavier elements commonly used in provenance studies were relatively unaffected. Concentrations of Pb and Zn were problematic in the urban context of Cuzco because of pollution. Ability to determine provenance of building stones within those limitations (i. e., the validity of this application of PXRF) was demonstrated in a preliminary study by comparing measurements from uncleaned, exposed building stones in the region to fresh quarry samples...|$|R

RNA {{in situ hybridization}} (RNA ISH) {{may be used to}} confirm IHC and may potentially replace it if suitable antibodies are not available or are insufficiently selective to discriminate closely related protein isoforms. We validated RNA ISH as specificity control for IHC and as a potential alternative method for selecting patients for treatment with MET inhibitors. MET, the HGF receptor, is encoded by the MET proto-oncogene that may be activated by mutation or amplification. MET expression and activity were tested in a panel of control cell lines. MET could be detected in formalin fixed paraffin, embedded (FFPE) samples by IHC and RNA ISH, and this was confirmed by sandwich immunoassays of fresh frozen samples. Gastric cancer cell lines with high MET expression and phosphorylation of tyrosine- 1349 respond to the MET inhibitor, BAY- 853474. High expression and phosphorylation of MET is a predictive biomarker for response to MET inhibitors. We then analyzed MET expression and activity in a matched set of FFPE <b>vs.</b> <b>fresh</b> frozen tumor samples consisting of 20 cases of gastric cancer.

40|$|The Northern kelp crab (Pugettia producta) and {{the graceful}} kelp crab (Pugettia gracilis) are common primary {{consumers}} in bull kelp beds near the San Juan Islands (Salish Sea, NE Pacific). In this system, urchins (often {{considered the most}} voracious herbivores exerting top-down control on kelp beds) tend to remain sedentary {{because of the high}} availability of detrital macroalgae, but the extent to which kelp crabs consume kelp (and other food options) is largely unknown. I conducted four types of laboratory feeding experiments to evaluate kelp crab feeding patterns: (1) feeding electivity between bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) and seven species of co-occurring local macroalgae; (2) feeding electivity on aged <b>vs.</b> <b>fresh</b> bull kelp; (3) feeding preference between N. luetkeana and small snails (Lacuna sp.); and (4) scaling of feeding rate with body size in P. producta and P. gracilis. In choice experiments, P. producta consumed greater mass of N. luetkeana than of other macroalgal species offered and elected to eat fresh bull kelp over aged. However, P. producta also consumed snails (Lacuna sp.), indicating more generalized feeding than previously suspected. Feeding rates for P. producta exceeded the expected 3 ∕ 4 scaling rule of metabolic rates, indicating that larger P. producta may have a disproportionately large impact on bull kelp. A subtidal field experiment, designed to assess the influence of consumers on juvenile bull kelp net tissue gain, found that only fully enclosed (protected) bull kelp increased in wet mass and blade length. Herbivory by kelp crabs, among other consumers, is likely to play a previously unrecognized role in mediating the growth and survival of this annual kelp species within the Salish Sea...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} alkali {{promoters}} on selectivity of CO-H- 2 reactions was studied for potassium-promoted MoS 2 employing different potassium salts and pretreatment conditions (oxidized <b>vs.</b> <b>fresh</b> samples). Promoters assisted either chain growth of hydrocarbon products or alcohol formation. A good correlation was observed between pK(a) of the conjugate acid of each promoter and its space-time yield of alcohol formation. Alcohol selective promoters such as K 2 CO 3, KOH and K 2 S readily removed their counter anions under {{the reaction conditions}} {{to form a new}} potassium complex and spread themselves uniformly over MoS 2. This complex appears to serve as an active site which adsorbs carbon monoxide molecularly and, at the same time, cover the majority of the MoS 2 surface which is responsible for dissociative carbon monoxide adsorption and hydrogenation. Promoters for chain growth such as K 2 SO 4 and KCl maintained their initial chemical states throughout the reactions and showed highly nonuniform lateral distributions. Thus, the promoters have a limited coverage over MoS 2, yet modify the electronic state Of MoS 2 which interacts directly with carbon monoxide. Exposure of K 2 CO 3 - or KOH-promoted MoS 2 to atmosphere for an extended period oxidized the catalyst and caused segregation of potassium into the bulk Of MoS 2. Thus, the MoSt Of MoS 2 surface is now exposed, yet modified by potassium located in the subsurface region Of MoS 2. These modified catalysts promoted hydrocarbon chain growth without forming alcohols.

Design: Observational comparison of the clinical outcome in fresh and frozen thawed cycles. Setting: Public and private IVF centers. Patient(s) : Infertile couples undergoing IVF treatment. Intervention(s) : Use of a maximum three oocytes in fresh cycles, as established by local law, and cryopreservation and later use of surplus oocytes. Likewise fresh cycles, maximum three thawed oocytes were used per cycle. All thawed oocytes were microinjected. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Embryologic and clinical parameters of fresh and thawed cycles. Result(s) : Two thousand forty-six patients underwent 2, 209 oocyte retrievals involving oocyte cryopreservation. Overall, the survival rate of thawed oocytes was 55. 8 %. In 940 thaw cycles, the mean numbers of inseminated oocytes and fertilization rates were significantly decreased <b>vs.</b> <b>fresh</b> cycles outcomes (2. 6 ± 0. 7 vs. 2. 9 ± 0. 2 and 72. 5 % vs. 78. 3 %, respectively), as were the rates of implantation (10. 1 % vs. 15. 4 %), pregnancy rates per transfer (17. 0 % vs. 27. 9 %), and pregnancy rates per cycle (13. 7 % vs. 26. 2 %). Differences in clinical outcome were found among centers. A pregnancy rate per thawing cycle above 14 % was achieved by most clinics. Fifty-seven retrievals involving oocyte cryopreservation achieved a pregnancy after fresh embryo replacement. Implantation and pregnancy rates per embryo transfer and per thawing cycles were 17. 5 %, 28. 6 %, and 24. 6 %, respectively. Conclusion(s) : Under the conditions tested, the clinical outcome of oocyte slow-cooling cryopreservation is reduced compared with fresh cycles. Nevertheless, in cases of inapplicability of embryo cryopreservation, oocyte cryopreservation should be offered to patients with surplus oocytes.

40|$|The {{effects of}} circuit-level stress on both {{inverter}} operation and MOSFET characteristics have been investigated. Individual MOSFETs, with gate oxide thickness of 3. 2 nm and active dimensions of 25 µm × 25 µm, are connected in an inverter configuration off-wafer via a low-leakage switch matrix. Inverters are stressed with a ramped voltage stress (RVS) of various magnitudes to induce {{different degrees of}} gate oxide degradation. In addition, voltage transfer curves (VTCs) of degraded inverters are simulated using a new circuit model. At the transistor level, both the PMOSFET and the NMOSFET show increased gate leakage current up to eight orders of magnitude, severely reduced on-currents and transconductances (gm), and large threshold voltage (Vt) shifts of 100 mV or more. Different trends in inverter performance are observed following positive and negative stress. However, regardless of the stress polarity, circuit-level stress results in inverter performance degradation, such as reduced output swing, switching point shifts, and increased rise/fall times. After the largest positive RVS, the output voltage swing has decreased from 1. 8 <b>V</b> <b>fresh,</b> to 1. 54 V post-stress. Much larger changes in the inverter voltage (V-t) time domain performance are observed. The minimum output low voltage {{is similar to that}} of the VTC, but the rise time increased significantly enough that the output voltage is only pulled up to 660 mV (VDD = 1. 8 V) before it switches low. In terms of circuit reliability, it may be possible for subsequent circuit stages to compensate for a few degraded devices, but increased rise/fall and delay times may cause timing issues in high-speed circuits. Furthermore, increased gate or off-stage leakage currents can potentially load previous circuit stages or result in increased power consumption...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical models do not {{explicitly}} represent {{the influence of}} soil microbial diversity on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics despite recent evidence of relationships between them. The objective {{of the present study}} was to statistically investigate relationships between bacterial and fungal diversity indexes (richness, evenness, Shannon index, inverse Simpson index) and decomposition of different pools of soil organic carbon by measuring dynamics of CO 2 emissions under controlled conditions. To this end, 20 soils from two different land uses (cropland and grassland) were incubated with or without incorporation of 13 C-labelled wheat-straw residue. 13 C-labelling allowed us to study residue mineralisation, basal respiration and the priming effect independently. An innovative data-mining approach was applied, based on generalized additive models and a predictive criterion. Results showed that microbial diversity indexes can be good covariates to integrate in SOC dynamics models, depending on the C source and the processes considered (native soil organic carbon <b>vs.</b> <b>fresh</b> wheat residue). Specifically, microbial diversity indexes were good candidates to help explain mineralisation of native soil organic carbon, while priming effect processes seemed to be explained much more by microbial composition, and no microbial diversity indexes were found associated with residue mineralisation. Investigation of relationships between diversity and mineralisation showed that higher diversity, as measured by the microbial diversity indexes, seemed to be related to decreased CO 2 emissions in the control soil. We suggest that this relationship can be explained by an increase in carbon yield assimilation as microbial diversity increases. Thus, the parameter for carbon yield assimilation in mathematical models could be calculated as a function of microbial diversity indexes. Nonetheless, given limitations of the methods used, these observations should be considered with caution and confirmed with more experimental studies. Overall, along with other studies on relationships between microbial community composition and SOM dynamics, this study suggests that overall measures of microbial diversity may constitute relevant ways to include microbial diversity in models of SOM dynamics...|$|R
