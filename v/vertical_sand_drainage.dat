Unfortunately, the installation of <b>vertical</b> <b>sand</b> drains have become less economically viable due to the high costs and limited availability of good quality sand. Particle size distribution analyses done on samples of waste copper slag obtained from the Colombo dockyard revealed that its gradation was similar to that of sand, which meant that waste copper slag could potentially be used {{as a substitute}} for sand, provided that it did not adversely affect the hydraulic conductivity of the resulting mixture. In this study, constant head permeability tests were done on "sand-copper slag" mixes of varying proportions and it was shown that up to 50 % copper slag by weight could be added to sand without an appreciable loss in permeability. The performance of sand piles is dependent on strength and settlement characteristics of the sand. Hence, consolidation tests and direct shear tests were also carried out on the "sand-copper slag" mixes to explore how the mechanical properties of sand were affected by the copper slag...|$|R

40|$|There {{remains a}} need for an efficient, low-cost, portable, passive sand trap, which can provide {{estimates}} of <b>vertical</b> <b>sand</b> flux over topography and within vegetation and which self-orients into the wind. We present a design for a stacked vertical trap that has been modelled (computational fluid dynamics, CFD) and evaluated {{in the field and}} in the wind tunnel. The ‘swinging’ trap orients to within 10 ° of the flow in the wind tunnel at 8  m s− 1, and more rapidly in the field, where natural variability in wind direction accelerates orientation. The CFD analysis indicates flow is steered into the trap during incident wind flow. The trap has a low profile and there is only a small decrease in mass flow rate for multiple traps, poles and rows of poles. The efficiency of the trap was evaluated against an isokinetic sampler and found to be greater than 95 %. The centre pole is a key element of the design, minimally decreasing trap efficiency. Finally, field comparisons with the trap of Sherman et al. (2014) yielded comparable estimates of <b>vertical</b> <b>sand</b> flux.

In current scenario only 40 - 50 % fly ash are used and rest of the fly ash is disposed of and restored in ash pond with dyke to reduce the land wastage. The failure rate of ash dykes are much {{higher than that of}} dams because seepage analysis is not taken into account while design of the former. So, construction of safe ash dyke becomes a top priority for engineers as its occasional failure creates havoc in safety of surrounding people. It causes economic losses as well as environmental and water pollution which is dangerous for both human and aquatic life. There is no well-defined design procedure and codal provision for design and maintenance of fly ash dam in India. This project describes about the design of ash dyke in various stages constructed in various methods with the help of finite element package PLAXIS considering various parameters representing varied environmental conditions.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of nearshore waves and currents are the dominant forcing to cross-shore sand transport on sandy beaches. In the nearshore surf zone, suspended sediment transport attributes {{a significant amount}} of the total transport. The distribution of suspended sand concentration depends on the complex interactions between waves and currents. A good understanding of the time-averaged vertical suspended sediment concentration profile is important in sediment transport calculations. In this study, the influence of hydrodynamics and bedforms on <b>vertical</b> suspended <b>sand</b> concentrations profiles under field conditions is analyzed. Measurements of time-averaged vertical suspended sediment concentration profiles with associated hydrodynamics and bedforms were made in the surf zone near Egmond aan Zee in October 2013. The vertical suspended sediment concentration profiles were measured with 7 optical backscatter sensors placed on top of each other. The bedform configuration was measured using a 3 D ripple scanner. Conflicting to models from literature, results show that the shape of the <b>vertical</b> suspended <b>sand</b> concentration in the surfzone was independent on neither hydrodynamics nor bedform type. All <b>vertical</b> suspended <b>sand</b> concentration profiles, reference concentrations and eddy diffusivities showed similar values for all types of bedforms and hydrodynamic conditions. This may be caused due to the time lag effects in bedform development. Under calm weather conditions, when environmental conditions were not dynamic enough, bedforms can not adjust instantaneously with the hydrodynamic changes. This provides higher sediment concentrations than expected. This tidal asymmetry may have major effects for modelling suspended sand transport in the surf zone...|$|R

40|$|The {{unsaturated}} hydraulic characterisation of nonwoven geotextiles {{presented in}} this paper shows that they only require suctions between 0. 8 kPa and 1. 2 kPa to induce a rapid drop, of several orders of magnitude, in hydraulic conductivity. This implies that the inclusion of geotextiles in unsaturated earthen systems, for drainage or separation/filtration purposes, can potentially impede the flow of water and lead to a redistribution of the water content profile in the system. This latter aspect is the focus of this study. Geosynthetic drainage layers in contact with unsaturated soils were investigated using soil-geosynthetic columns where clay was in contact with a <b>sand</b> <b>drainage</b> material as well as with a drainage geocomposite layer (a geonet sandwiched between nonwoven geotextiles). The unsaturated drainage layers were found to impede downward flow of moisture consistent with the formation of a capillary break at the drainage layer-clay interface. Accumulation of moisture associated with an increase in moisture storage in the clay was observed, which progressed with depth until breakthrough of flow occurred into the drainage layer. Despite having significantly lower thickness than the sand capillary break, the geocomposite capillary break exhibited similar performance to the capillary break. ...|$|R

To understand the pore-water pressure, effective stress changes and deformation mechanism of soft soil subjected to underwater vacuum preloading, theoretical analysis, centrifuge modelling and numerical modelling were carried out. Analytical solutions of average degree of radial consolidation of soft clay subjected to vacuum preloading were developed. Well resistance, smear effect, vacuum loss, large lateral deformation and variation of soil stiffness and permeability are considered. Centrifuge tests of clay {{with a single}} <b>vertical</b> <b>sand</b> drain and a <b>vertical</b> <b>sand</b> drain group at a spacing of 8 D (D is drain diameter) were carried out. Subsurface displacement was measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV) and photogrammetry. Coupled axis-symmetric and coupled three-dimensional finite-element analyses were carried out to model consolidation behaviour of soft clay subjected to underwater vacuum preloading with a vertical drain group. Numerical experiments were carried out to investigate the behaviour of soft clay subjected to underwater vacuum preloading, on-land vacuum preloading and underwater surcharge preloading under idealized boundary conditions. Both measured and computed rates of consolidation with a vertical drain group were greater than those with a single vertical drain. Measured surface settlement near a vertical drain was 80 % of that away from the vertical drain. Measured maximum inward lateral displacement between vertical drains in centrifuge tests was about 5 % surface settlement. At the centre of a vertical drain group, final lateral earth pressure coefficient {{at the end of}} underwater and on-land vacuum preloading is greater than lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest, while that in underwater surcharge preloading is less than lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest. Computed inward lateral displacement {{at the edge of a}} treated zone is about 27 % of surface settlement by underwater and on-land vacuum preloading. The magnitude of computed lateral displacement by underwater or on-land vacuum preloading is 16 % of that by underwater surcharge preloading.

Two layer soil models simulated a compacted clayey layer over a sandy layer, underlying a landfill. Three layer soil models simulated an unsaturated secondary leachate collection system in a landfill with overlying and underlying saturated compacted silty liners. The effect of the hydarulic trap in minimizing diffusive downward chloride movement was investigated in both models. The agreement between the experimental results and theoretical predictions suggests that existing solute transport theory can adequately predict chloride migration through two saturated layers of clay over sand and also three layer soil systems consisting of two saturated silt layers with an unsaturated <b>sand</b> <b>drainage</b> layer in between. The comparison of the downward and upward advective-diffusive transport in two and three layer soil models, having two different Darcy velocities and soil density, showed that the upward flow (hydraulic trap) could reduce the concentrations in the underlying receptor reservoirs in both models.

The seismic mechanism of geogrid reinforced soil retaining walls with liquefiable backfill soils {{has not been}} clear during earthquakes. A strain multiple mechanism model can describe the generation and development of pore water pressures in saturated sand under cyclic loadings and undrained conditions. It can also describe the rotation of principal stress axes to simulate cyclic behaviors of anisotropic consolidated sand. The multiple mechanism model is applied to investigate seismic performances of geogrid reinforced soil retaining walls with liquefied backfill sand. In order to study the reinforced effect of geogrid for seismic stability of retaining walls, three retaining wall models are constructed, which are respectively an unreinforced soil retaining wall with saturated backfill sand, a geogrid reinforced soil retaining wall with saturated backfill sand and a geogrid reinforced soil retaining wall with dry backfill sand. Seismic horizontal deformations, seismic settlements, excess pore water pressures and strains of geogrids are compared in detail.

The sand column, saturated at its lower portion and initially in the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, is drained at its bottom at constant head. The results show that significant vacuum can be generated in the vadose zone of the column with a finer layer on the top. The vacuum increases quickly in the earlier stage of the drainage, reaches a maximum, and gradually becomes zero. Because {{of the effect of}} the vacuum in the vadose zone, water is held in and the cumulative outflow from the column with the finer layer is much smaller than without the layer during most of the drainage process.
