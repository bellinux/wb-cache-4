50|$|Cork oaks {{commonly}} {{live more}} than 200 years. <b>Virgin</b> <b>cork</b> (or 'male' cork) {{is the first}} cork cut from generally 25-year-old trees. Another 9 to 12 years {{is required for the}} second harvest, and a tree can be harvested about twelve times in its lifetime. Cork harvesting is done entirely without machinery, being dependent solely on human labor. Usually five people are required to harvest the tree's bark, using a small axe. The process requires training due to the skill required to harvest bark without harming the tree. The European cork industry produces 300,000 tonnes of cork a year, with a value of â‚¬1.5 billion and employing 30,000 people. Wine corks represent 15% of cork usage by weight but 66% of revenues.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study aims to (1) {{evaluate}} {{the environmental impacts}} associated with {{the three types of}} raw cork produced in Portuguese cork oak woodlands (in Alentejo region) considering two alternative practices for stand establishment (plantation and natural regeneration), (2) compare the environmental impacts of raw cork production in Portuguese cork oak woodlands and in Catalonian cork oak forests, and (3) assess the influence of different allocation criteria for partitioning the environmental impacts between the different types of raw cork produced. : A cradle-to-gate approach was adopted starting with stand establishment up to cork storage in a field yard. The system boundaries include all management operations undertaken during the following stages: stand establishment, stand tending, cork stripping, and field recovery. The allocation of the environmental impacts to reproduction, second, and <b>virgin</b> <b>cork</b> was based on mass and market price criteria. An alternative allocation approach was simulated by allocating environmental impacts also to the wood produced in the cork oak stands. The impact assessment was performed using the characterization factors recommended by the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD). and discussion: In Portugal, cork produced from naturally regenerated stands has a better environmental performance than cork produced from planted stands, but the differences are smaller than 10...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{significant}} {{forestry activities}} {{have taken place}} in Sardinia thanks to EU Regulation 2080 / 92 funds. Some 80 % of the afforestated surface has been planted with holm oak and cork oak. The latter also characterizes 89 % of the reforestation area. Given the funding source, plantations have been established on farmlands. Growth performances of these recent cork oak stands have been quantitatively evaluated and compared with the performances of two experimental plots. In Gallura (north-east of Sardinia), that is the traditional cork production area and still is economically the most important cork district of the island, these new cork oak plantations have an average size of 28 ha. They have been established on lands that, before plantation, were either pastures (30 %) or arable lands (70 %). Plantation failures are limited to 8. 8 % of the total (in term of mass) and seem independent of environmental factors or plantations species composition (conifers have been frequently used as secondary species). Average growth of the stem, measured above cork at collar height, is in the range 4 to 8 mm/year with a mean value of 5. 5 mm/year. No correlation appears with either environmental conditions or species composition of the plantations. In the first experimental plot, soil management practices (natural vegetation removal vs its cutting and mulching) does not differentiate young plants growth trends. In the control subplots (no removal) stem collar diameter is 20 % smaller. Localized manual hoeing around trunk base increased the diameters by 13 % but reduced cork thickness by 21 %. The second experimental plot allows comparisons among 27 Mediterranean proveniences of cork oak. The trial exhibits reduced genetic influence: diameters and heights growth are significantly different only among extreme groups. In conclusion, reduced growth performances of the plantations established in farmlands is due, to some extent, to the limitations inherent with private land management (constrained to costs minimization) and, on the other hand, to the generally very limited thickness of Gallura soils. Demand for good quality commercial cork is steadily raising. To sustain the request, in the short term, it would be necessary to extend financial support for plantations care, from 5 to 10 years, or even up to the first stripping (<b>virgin</b> <b>cork)</b> ...|$|E
