From there <b>Valerian</b> is skeptical and Cecilia asks him {{to embark on a}} journey to see Saint Urban, who would [...] "purge" [...] <b>Valerian</b> of sin and let him see the Angel. <b>Valerian</b> then found Urban who purged him of sin and when <b>Valerian</b> {{returned}} he saw Cecilia with an angel. This angel gave <b>Valerian</b> a single wish, of which <b>Valerian</b> answered to give his brother, Tiburce, the same gift he was given, of the truth of Christ. Tiberuce appeared and then accepted the word of Christ. <b>Valerian</b> Then took Tiburce to Urban, who had been condemned to die by the state, and Christened Tiberuce.|$|R
25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} <b>valerian</b> is that <b>valerian</b> root and leaves are a cat {{attractant}} similar to, and as safe as, catnip. <b>Valerian</b> contains the cat attractant actinidine. Cat attractants might mimic {{the odor of}} cat urine, which is caused by 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol. Anecdotal reports claim that <b>valerian</b> is also attractive to rats—so much so {{that it had been}} used to bait traps. Stories describe the Pied Piper of Hamelin using both his pipes and <b>valerian</b> to attract rats. Research also shows that <b>valerian</b> root is the strongest chemoattractant of slime molds such as Physarum polycephalum.|$|R

In Valerian's tower a swirling vortex opens up. <b>Valerian</b> is about to sacrifice Boy, when Kepler and Willow arrive. Kepler reveals that Boy is Valerian's son and that Boy was made that night 15 years ago, when <b>Valerian</b> bet on his life. <b>Valerian,</b> shocked, willingly walks into the vortex, and the demon claims him. Boy questions Kepler about his real father, and Kepler says that <b>Valerian</b> is not really Boy's father, that he just said that to save Boy. The book ends with Boy and Willow returning to the City with Kepler.|$|R
50|$|Aboard the Bucephalus, <b>Valerian</b> and Horner watch a {{newsfeed}} {{showing the}} fallout from Davis' actions. The newsfeed shows that public opinion {{has gone back to}} <b>Valerian,</b> and Davis' death has been widely accepted as necessary force.

50|$|<b>Valérians</b> astroship is on {{a bizarre}} {{asteroid}} with strange cones the only interruption to the oddly smooth ground. Inside the ship, Valérian lies unconscious. Another astroship lands beside <b>Valérians</b> and Laureline emerges. She rushes into <b>Valérians</b> ship and forces him {{to drink the}} antidote she has brought. Valérian had been exploring the asteroid when he was stung by a jellyfish-like creature. He managed to radio back enough information to Galaxity {{for them to make}} an antidote which Laureline delivered. Laureline wants to leave but Valérian wants to complete his exploration of the asteroid. he climbs {{up to the top of}} one of the cones ton find the asteroid is in fact a hollow shell. Some more jellyfish rise out of the cone and drag Valérian inside. He is absorbed a large cellular structure resembling a giant bacteria and deposited at the centre of the asteroid which is alive - it introduces itself as Tsirillitis and tells Valérian that he has been disturbing its biological functions. Valérian will be crushed and his remains used to nourish Tsirillitis. Meanwhile, Laureline follows <b>Valérians</b> path and, although she does her best to resist, soon winds up like Valérian on the way to the crusher to feed Tsirillitis. Suddenly Laureline has an idea - she tells Valérian to throw the last of the antidote into the crusher. Tsirillitis reacts violently to the drug and spews Valérian and Laureline back out onto the surface who get back in their ships and leave. Back at Galaxity, Valérian recounts the tale but Laureline is concerned that they have killed an innocent lifeform. Valérian tells her not to worry - Tsirillitis is fine, but he wont be eating any more Terrans in a hurry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Valérians</b> {{sleep is}} {{frequently}} wracked by nightmares - {{images of the}} flood that engulfed the Earth in 1986 and of Galaxity disappearing into space-time. Looking in on the chief Valérian and Laureline are disturbed to see him apparently mesmerized {{by one of the}} Hypsis devices. Meeting with Albert and Merryweather, they consider the ships that are known to be in the Arctic. Albert has narrowed the possibilities down to two cargo ships, a whaler and a schooner.|$|E
5000|$|Odo awakens in the Infirmary. Being {{ignorant of}} Odo's physiology, Dr. Bashir {{is unable to}} find {{anything}} wrong with him, but hints at potential trouble between Kira and Sisko. When pressed for more information, he vaguely says it is [...] "too early to commit oneself either way." [...] By now, Kira has found evidence of foul play among the <b>Valerians,</b> and informs Sisko of her intention to confiscate their cargo: he forbids her from doing so. Meanwhile, Lt. Dax and Chief O'Brien take a runabout to find the Klingons' mission recorder.|$|E
5000|$|Kepler is Valerian's {{friend from}} their {{time at the}} [...] "Academy". He pretends to be working to save <b>Valerian</b> but {{ultimately}} realises that <b>Valerian</b> must die. He and <b>Valerian</b> fought {{a long time ago}} over a woman named Helena, and Kepler has held a grudge against <b>Valerian</b> since. He is described as a small, thin man with a few gold teeth.|$|R
50|$|Elsewhere, one of {{the waiters}} in the casino has found the Tüm Tüm and {{returned}} it to <b>Valérian</b> and Albert who have returned to Inverloch Castle in Scotland to ponder their next move. Examining its eye, <b>Valérian</b> finds it has succeeded in recording an image of their quarry. <b>Valérian</b> is shocked to realise he recognises their adversary - it is Jal, {{an agent of the}} Spatio-Temporal Service just like <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline. <b>Valérian</b> is puzzled that Jal hasn't disappeared along with Galaxity {{and the rest of the}} future Earth. At this point the Tchoung tracer arrives. Analysing its database, they discover Jal's location in China. Parting company with Albert, <b>Valérian</b> takes the astroship to China, to Jal's hideout. <b>Valérian</b> confronts Jal, who is amazed when he recognises <b>Valérian.</b> Jal reveals that he is attempting to cause the nuclear cataclysm that <b>Valérian</b> prevented in The Rage of Hypsis so that Galaxity can be restored to the timeline. He explains that the peculiar properties of the Neferfalen nebula where he was exploring protected him from being wiped out along with the rest of Galaxity but at the cost of the woman he had loved. In order to get her back, Jal is attempting to change history back onto its old course. As the standoff continues, Jal's powers become weaker and weaker until eventually he is overcome by <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, on Zomuk, Laureline has resumed {{contact with}} <b>Valérian.</b> The most {{beautiful}} sanctuary on Zomuk has been plundered of its contents. Gaining {{entry to the}} sanctuary, Laureline finds its main chamber empty except for representations of the four elemental forces on the walls - exactly what Chatelard spoke of. Suddenly, the link between <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline is broken by an interruption from Albert. Angry at being cut off, <b>Valérian</b> snaps at Albert and storms out of the house. <b>Valérian</b> mopes angrily {{through the streets of}} Paris when a sports car, driven by the young woman who was watching him and Albert at Chatelard's house, pulls up. She asks <b>Valérian</b> if he'd like to go dancing with him. <b>Valérian</b> gets in the car and they drive off.|$|R
50|$|Boy was <b>Valerians</b> helper. Willow is {{an orphan}} who served a theatre's singer, also {{the one who}} {{declared}} Willow with 'perfect pitch.' She {{used to work in}} a gentleman's club, before she ran away, as a servant who carried their cloaks. She is described as small and having mousy brown hair. A few flashbacks reveal Willow used to live with her parents. She explains to Boy while they are imprisoned that her aunt sent her to the orphanage. She is quick-witted and often asks people too many questions. She and Boy develop a romance in The Dark Flight Down. The love that Boy and Willow share is significant throughout the books {{because of the fact that}} it helps Boy, who has known only violence and hardship, to regain his spirit.|$|E
50|$|Galaxity plan {{to erect}} a {{communications}} relay on the planet Lanning. Unfortunately, the natives, although friendly, are very primitive and may be disturbed {{by the presence of}} such a large mechanism on their land. Valérian is sent to try to familiarise them with Galaxitys high technology in the hope that they will then accept the relay. Arriving at Lanning, the natives hold a feast in <b>Valérians</b> honour. After the feast, Valérian offers to show them some of Galaxitys technology. He demonstrates a dream projector. The natives are unimpressed and ask Valérian to think of someone he likes. Suddenly, Valérian has a very vivid dream about Laureline far superior to anything the projector can offer. Realizing that the projector wont impress them, he demonstrates his all-terrain vehicle. The native chief complains about the bumpy ride but Valérian responds that its a faster way of getting around. Suddenly, from a standing start, the rest of the natives overtake the vehicle on foot, barely breaking a sweat. Exasperated, Valérian tries another tack and straps on a jet pack, flying into the air. However, the Lannings have another trick up their sleeve - they can fly! To add insult to injury, <b>Valérians</b> jet pack breaks down and he has to be rescued by the Lannings. The Lannings are finding this very amusing and ask Valérian to show them another machine. He demonstrates a personal shield - the chief puts one on and Valérian throws rocks at him showing that they bounce off the shield. Then one of the other natives steps forward and bursts the shield just by flicking it with his finger. Valérian then gives up and returns to the camp dejected. The natives ask whats wrong and he explains that he was to demonstrate his technology so they would accept the communications relay. He shows them a model of the relay and the Lannings are so impressed with how pretty it looks they immediately agree that it can be built on their land. Valérian returns to Galaxity and tries not to laugh when his superiors congratulate him on showing the Lannings the triumph of Galaxitys technology.|$|E
50|$|Valérian is on {{a mission}} to explore the planet Uxgloa. Landing, Valérian quickly realises that he has {{inadvertently}} landed {{in the middle of a}} battlefield. He is amazed to notice that all of the men in each army are identical to each other. Retreating back to his astroship, he is struck on the head by a stone and falls unconscious through the entrance. The leader of one of the armies, named Urs, follows him and he in turn is followed by the leader of the other army, Kline. They fight and Urs manages to kill Kline. Valérian comes round and is horrified to discover that his astroship has been wrecked beyond repair by the fight. He is stranded on Uxgloa. Urs offers to help Valérian. As they pass the field of battle, Valérian notices that the only bodies are those of Urs men. Urs tells him that the soldiers are just illusions and pressing a button on a device he is wearing, all of his men disappear. Arriving at Urs fortress, he explains that he was born in an automatic incubator and his purpose is to fight the other lords of Uxgloa. Valérian asks Urs if his race ever travelled to the stars. Urs tells him that it is said that in the Northern Desert there exists remains of what were called “Star Gates”. He then shows Valérian where his armies come from - a huge machine in the bowels of the fortress that creates images of whoever steps inside - sometimes older, sometime younger. But there is a price - for each image that is killed on the battlefield, the original must sleep for one day. Valérian steps into the machine and two images of him are produced - one of him as a boy and one as an old man. The three <b>Valérians</b> leave Urs and make for the Northern Desert. After many days of searching they at last find the Star Gate, a vast celestial sphere lying in a black lake. The older Valérian reveals that the letters inscribed on the device resemble those seen on Earth in Tibet. Eventually, Valérian finds a representation of the solar system on the sphere and the younger Valérian finds out how to activate the mechanism. Valérian disappears into the Star Gate leaving the older and younger <b>Valérians</b> to live out the remainder of their lives on Uxgloa. Valérian lands back on Earth in a lake and heads off in search of civilisation, wondering how hes going to be able to explain what happened to Galaxity.|$|E

50|$|In Bermuda, 40% of the {{structures}} were damaged and two homes destroyed, but otherwise damage was light in the harbor. While weather forecasters knew of the storm's approach on Bermuda, it covered the thousand miles from the Bahamas to Bermuda so rapidly it apparently struck with few warning signs aside from heavy swells. On October 21, with {{the eye of the}} storm still 700 mi from Bermuda, weather forecasts from the United States called for the hurricane to strike the island on the following morning with gale force. The Arabis-class sloop , based at the HMD Bermuda, was returning from providing hurricane relief in the Bahamas and was overtaken by the storm shortly before she could make harbour. Unable to enter through Bermuda's reefline, she fought the storm for more than five hours before she was sunk with the loss of 85 men. The British merchant ship Eastway was also sunk near Bermuda. Although the <b>Valerians</b> commanding officer, Commander Usher, reported that there was no sign of a major storm at 08:00, when his ship was in sight of Bermuda, and when the British Army meteorologists at Prospect Camp measured the wind at 28 mph, by 10:00, the winds had reached 95 mph. When the centre of the storm passed over Bermuda at noon, the winds dropped to 8 mph, then increased to 114 mph, whereupon the Army took down its anemometer to protect it. The Royal Naval Dockyard was being hammered and never took its anemometer down. It measured 138 mph at 13:00 UTC (about the same time the Valerian went down), before the wind destroyed it.|$|E
50|$|Valérian is {{dispatched}} by Galaxity on reconnaissance to {{the planet}} Flammil which {{is surrounded by a}} dense asteroid belt. Making his may through the belt, <b>Valérians</b> astroship becomes entangled in vegetation. While working outside the ship trying to free it he spots a female humanoid figure. Pursuing her, she flees but runs into trouble and ends up dangling on a creeper. Valérian rescues her and she takes him to her village. The village is populated by female huntresses like the one Valérian chased. Valérian asks for help freeing his ship and two of them lead him to a path through the asteroids. Following the path, he comes to an asteroid populated by old men chained to the tops of pillars of rock. Communicating telepathically, they tell Valérian that they are atoning for the sins of Falmmil and that huntresses bring them food and protect them. They tell Valérian that he will find help if he goes to the three moons. Continuing along the pathways through the asteroids he comes to the three moons which have been bolted together with metal struts. The population are poor and malnourished and tend thinly cultivated fields. Reaching a building on one of the moons, Valérian meets with the elders. They explain that Flammil itself is no longer habitable having been sterilised with radioactivity following a war. The survivors are struggling to exist in the asteroid belt trying to preserve their history and culture. Valérian is sympathetic and tells him that Earth had to overcome a similar situation once (a reference to the catastrophe of 1986 seen in The City of Shifting Waters). He offers Earths assistance in return for help in releasing his astroship. Later, his astroship freed, he organises a decontamination expedition from Earth to visit Flammil.|$|E
50|$|Valérian is {{returning}} from a mission in the Arcturus system when his astroship malfunctions and comes to a dead stop. Spacewalking outside the ship {{in an attempt to}} make repairs, he finds an Arcturian floating outside in space. The Arcturian tells him his ship is caught in a magnetic trap and is falling towards a nearby asteroid. He tells Valérian to bring his magnetic field generator with him when next they meet and then he falls away towards the asteroid. Sure enough, as the Arcturian told him, <b>Valérians</b> ship crashes on the asteroid in a graveyard of spaceships. Going in search of the cause of his problems, he comes upon what looks like a labyrinth. Exploring, he finds a cage containing two bird-men from Deneb. They tell him that they have been captured by the Great Collector and are part of his menagerie. Searching for the Arcturians, he meets more captive aliens and finally finds the Arcturian who now looks old and wizened. The Arcturian tells Valérian that what he saw outside his ship was just a projection of his mind. He {{goes on to say that}} he believes he can reverse the magnetic field that draws spaceships to the planet and keeps the cages locked using the magnetic field generator Valérian has brought although the process will kill him. Reluctantly, Valérian connects the Arcturian to the device and his body lights up. The magnetic field is deactivated and the specimens flee their cages. They are pursued by the Great Collector - a giant spider-like creature - who manages to kill some of his prey but most manage to get to their ships and blast-off. Valérian, at last, manages to get to his ship as well from which he broadcasts a message warning all from approaching the asteroid and the Great Collector.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{molecular}} {{investigations have}} greatly improved {{our understanding of}} the phylogenetic relationships of the Valeriana clade. Our investigation of the fruits and seeds of the Valeriana clade provides morphological support for these findings. In particular, seed anatomy, calyx morphology, the presence of sterile locules, and fruit polymorphism provide support for the major lineages in the Valeriana clade (i. e., Valerianaceae). Fruit and seed morphology and anatomy of all genera but Nardostachys were investigated. Our results indicate that an important shift in seed anatomy took place at the origin of the core <b>valerians</b> (i. e., Valerianeae), including the loss of endosperm and a shift in seed coat anatomy. Furthermore, our data suggest that the evolution toward polymorphic fruits occurred at least twice, once at the origin of the clade holding Fedia and Valerianella and a second time at the inception of Plectritis. Our sampling indicates that the loss of sterile locules in mature achenes took place along the branch leading to Centranthus, Plectritis, and Valeriana.
