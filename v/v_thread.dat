5000|$|To obtain proper rolling {{action of}} the balls, as in a {{standard}} ball bearing, it is necessary that, when loaded in one direction, the ball makes contact at one point with the nut, and one point with the screw. In practice, most ball screws {{are designed to be}} lightly preloaded, so that there is at least a slight load on the ball at four points, two in contact with the nut and two in contact with the screw. This is accomplished by using a thread profile that has a slightly larger radius than the ball, the difference in radii being kept small (e.g. a simple <b>V</b> <b>thread</b> with flat faces is unsuitable) so that elastic deformation around the point of contact allows a small, but non-zero contact area to be obtained, like any other rolling element bearing. To this end, the threads are usually machined as a [...] "gothic arch" [...] profile. If a simple semicircular thread profile were used, contact would only be at two points, on the outer and inner edges, which would not resist axial loading.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Knee or tibiotalocalcaneal {{arthrodesis}} is a salvage procedure, {{often with}} unacceptable rates of nonunion. Basic science of fracture healing suggests that compression across a fusion site may decrease nonunion. A novel ratcheting arthrodesis nail {{designed to improve}} dynamic compression is mechanically tested in comparison to existing nails. Methods A novel ratcheting nail was designed and mechanically tested in comparison to a solid nail and a threaded nail using sawbones models (Pacific Research Laboratories, Inc.). Intramedullary nails (IM) were implanted with a load cell (Futek LTH 500) between fusion surfaces. Constructs were then placed into a servo-hydraulic test frame (Model 858 Mini-bionix, MTS Systems) for application of 3 mm and 6 mm dynamic axial displacement (n = 3 /group). Load to failure was also measured. Results Mean percent of initial load after 3 -mm and 6 -mm displacement was 190. 4 % and 186. 0 % for the solid nail, 80. 7 % and 63. 0 % for the threaded nail, and 286. 4 % and 829. 0 % for the ratcheting nail, respectively. Stress-shielding (as percentage of maximum load per test) after 3 -mm and 6 -mm displacement averaged 34. 8 % and 28. 7 % (solid nail), 40. 3 % and 40. 9 % (threaded nail), and 18. 5 % and 11. 5 % (ratcheting nail), respectively. In the 6 -mm trials, statistically significant increase in initial load and decrease in stress-shielding for the ratcheting vs. solid nail (p = 0. 029, p = 0. 001) and <b>vs.</b> <b>threaded</b> nail (p = 0. 012, p = 0. 002) was observed.

This study investigates {{the effects of}} OMI design characteristics on the mechanical properties in artificial bone. Material and Methods: Twelve self-drilling OMIs (2 small, 6 medium, 4 large) from 8 manufacturers were tested for their primary stability in simulated medium-high cancellous bone and the risk to fracture in high-density methacrylate blocks. For the assessments of the maximum insertion torque (IT) and torsional fracture (TF) 5 of each OMI were used and for the pull-out strength (POS) 10. The OMIs were inserted with a torque screwdriver (12 sec/ 360 °) until the bottom at 8 mm depth was reached. OMI designs were analyzed with a scan electron microscope (SEM). Results: SEM images revealed a great variation in product refinement. In the whole sample, a cylindrical OMI shape was associated with higher POS (p< 0. 001) but lower IT (p= 0. 002) values. The outer and inner OMI diameters were design characteristics well correlated with POS, IT and TF values (ranging from 0. 601 to 0. 961). Greater thread depth was related to greater POS values (r= 0. 628), although OMIs with similar POS values may have different IT values. Thread depth and pitch had some impact on POS. TF depended mainly on the OMI inner (r= 0. 961) and outer diameters (r= 0. 892). A thread depth to outer diameter ratio close to 40 % increased TF risk. Conclusion: Although at the same insertion depth the OMI outer and inner diameters {{are the most important}} factors for primary stability, other OMI design characteristics (cylindrical <b>vs.</b> conical, <b>thread</b> design) may significantly affect primary stability and torsional fracture.

The mechanism for observing and comparing these paradigms was a randomized controlled trial of two groups of participants who completed identical tasks in one of the two paradigms.

I examined programming accuracy and comprehension rates among participants in three different common shared memory problem areas introduced by concurrent programming. The results were measured using a token accuracy map algorithm which matches the token strings of a participants answer compared to a correct solution. The overall results show that for two relatively straightforward tasks using shared processes and memory, both paradigms were reasonably well understood, with a possible small learning advantage in favor of CSP in two of the tasks.

40|$|The order {{according}} to which the different tasks are carried out within a Time Warp platform has {{a direct impact on}} performance, given that event processing is speculative, thus being subject to the possibility of being rolled-back. It is typically recognized that not-yet-executed events having lower timestamps should be given higher CPU-schedule priority, since this contributes to keep low the amount of rollbacks. However, common Time Warp platforms usually execute events as atomic actions. Hence control is bounced back to the underlying simulation platform only {{at the end of the}} current event processing routine. In other words, CPU-scheduling of events resembles classical batch-multitasking scheduling, which is recognized not to promptly react to variations of the priority of pending tasks (e. g. associated with the injection of new events in the system). In this article we present the design and implementation of a time-sharing Time Warp platform, to be run on multi-core machines, where the platform-level software is allowed to take back control on a periodical basis (with fine grain period), and to possibly preempt any ongoing event processing activity in favor of dispatching (along the same thread) any other event that is revealed to have higher priority. Our proposal is based on an ad-hoc kernel module for Linux, which implements a fine grain timer-interrupt mechanism with lightweight management, which is fully integrated with the modern top/bottom-half timer-interrupt Linux architecture, and which does not induce any bias in terms of relative CPU-usage planning across Time Warp <b>vs</b> non-Time Warp <b>threads</b> running on the machine.

Suitable design and materials, their reaction with the surrounding hard tissues and interfacial biomechanical properties are still considered to be the primary criteria which need to be addressed systematically. In the present study, a thorough and systemic approach was made to identify a suitable implant, considering the above criteria after both in vitro and in vivo animal trials. Materials and Methods: Titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 <b>V)</b> implants, with <b>thread</b> and without thread models, were implanted to the mid-metaphysial portion of the tibia of the right hind leg of three white Australian Chinchilla rabbit species and their effects and response to the surrounding bone were investigated. Parameters studied included hematological and biochemical features (serum alkaline phosphatase and calcium), both preoperatively and postoperatively, consecutively for 7 days and after 1 - 3 months. The interfacial integrity and compositional variation along the interface were studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) and histopathology from 1 to 3 months consecutively. Finally, biomechanical properties were studied with the help of push-out test. Results: Bone remineralization started through the process of electro-physiological ionic exchanges, which helps in formation of osteoblastic cells in the area of bony injury. The SEM-EDAX results confirmed the initial stability for the Ti (with thread) implant, but the regeneration of new bone formation was faster in the case of Ti (Without thread) implant, and hence could be used for faster healing. These have also been substantiated through push-out and histopathlogical tests. Conclusion: From the physico-chemical and biomechanical observations, it was found that that smooth type implants were well accepted in the physiological condition although chances of elemental leaching from the surface were also observed. Increase of the surface roughness can help into the formation of physico-chemical bondage with the surrounding hard tissues...|$|R

In Combe v Combe 1951 2 KB 215, CA a husband promised to make maintenance payments to his separated wife but failed to do so. The wife brought an action to enforce the promise invoking promissory estoppel. The court held that promissory estoppel does not create a cause of action and as such the requirement of consideration in formation of contract is still relevant. Promissory estoppel is a rule of evidence that prevents the promisor from denying the truth of statement which the promisee had relied. Denning LJ said: [...] "The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them". However, this requirement seemed changed in light of the decisions in Evenden v Guildford City AFC 1975 QB 917, here the courts held [...] "that promissory estoppel can be a cause of action."Early cases indicated that there had to be a clear and unequivocal undertaking. However this was overruled by Secretary of State for Employment <b>v</b> Globe Elastic <b>Thread</b> Co Ltd 1980 AC 506. The promise or representation must be “precise” and “unambiguous” although it does not mean that such promise or representation must be expressly made. The concept of ‘waiver’ has been recognised by both the common law and equity as a means by which certain rights can be suspended, but then revived by appropriate notice. In Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co. (1877) 2 App. 439 HL, It can be seen that this case did not involve a [...] "promise" [...] as such, but merely an [...] "understanding". It had been suggested that Hughes could be restricted to [...] "relief against forfeiture" [...] cases, but this was specifically rejected in the later cases.

40|$|General {{calibration}} of the Vitaprint extruder Introduction Being tansferrable, the Vitaprint extruder {{is capable}} of printing structures, sliced by various free and open software, such as Slic 3 r or Cura. To allow this, however, certain settings need to be adjusted. Table of Contents Basic extrusion calculation Extrusion adjustment by drawing Introduction Materials Procedure Basic extrusion calculation The first approximation of extrusion settings can be calculated theoretically, based on some simple assumptions. Due to its mechanical, piston driven nature, extrusion can be precisely controlled by motorized displacement of the piston (rotation <b>vs</b> <b>thread,</b> both of which is specified) and depends on {{the difference between the}} inner diameters of the syringe r s and the nozzle r n. If we assume non-elastic behavior and laminar flow, the displaced volume in the syringe should equal the extruded volume through the nozzle. If the printed stroke takes the cross-sectional shape of the nozzle, the length of the printed path can be calculated as follows: Where E equals the extrusion value (= displacement of the piston) and l path the length of the printed filament. This is useful for determining the amount of extrusion for custom designed geometries. When using slicing software Cura, the calculation differs somewhat, as certain parameters are calculated differently. We have determined an experimental nozzle width and correction factor for the use of a 5 ml syringe with a G 21 needle (inner diameter 0. 4 mm). The calculation {{can be found in the}} accompanied xls file titled "vitaprint_cura_filament_calc". Extrusion adjustment by drawing Introduction Certain simplifications in the calculation cause small, yet significant discrepancies between the theoretical and real system. Therefore additional tuning is required. To do this, we developed a simple "pen and paper" protocol, to evaluate the characteristics of the printed path. It can be used to adjust extrusion, feedrate, layer height and material polymerization time upon deposition. Materials Basic Vitaprint set-up 5 ml syringe (optional with luer lock) blunt-end needle (e. g. G 21 with 0. 4 mm inner diameter) printing material (e. g. gelatin-alginate composite, see Vitaprint_methods) with colored dye (e. g. Pelikan 4001 blue ink) sheet of thick white paper adhesive tape Procedure A syringe containing the desired material with added coloring is mounted on the extruder. Step 1 - Rough calibration of material extrusion, where E determines the position change of the piston in mm. RUN " 01 _calE 1. gcode" EVALUATE created sample (Is it a full line? Is the line thickness even across the length? optional - use stereomicroscope/magnifying glass) MODIFY " 01 _calE 1. gcode" and repeat CHOOSE the best value for E and 4 values for F and modify " 02 _calE-F. gcode" Step 2 - Fine calibration F for optimum E+F properties RUN " 02 _calE-F. gcode" REPEAT "STEP 2 ", choose optimum value for F Choose best values for E + F and modify " 03 _cal_tdry. gcode" Step 3 - Determining material polymerization time and rough layer height. RUN " 03 _cal_tdry. gcode" EVALUATE created mesh to evaluate line drying time. The line is well dry when the needle doesn't make a smear while crossing it. Use table to calculate polymerization time. A time unit is calculated from: [1 min (60 s) for 1 mm of covered way]. The double line represents the extrusion step (phase 1), the single line represents the scratching step (phase 2). The numbers show the distance in mm from extrusion to scratch.

RUN " 04 _cal_h. gcode" Backlash calibration PART 1 - Latency Determination Introduction When extruding materials with medium to high viscosity it can be observed that when the plunger movement is terminated the material still keeps flowing out of the syringe for some time. This happens due to mechanically elastic components in the system (air bubbles inside the material, syringe seal, plunger deformation under higher forces etc.). The removal of this phenomenon is not very feasible therefore we can compensate it with backlash. Thereby, the plunger not only stops when it's told to but instead it moves slightly backwards such that it pulls some of the material back into the syringe. The idea is to pull enough material back in that the outflow is stopped as soon as possible and yet, care must be taken not to pull the plunger so far back that the air comes into the syringe through the needle. Figure 1 : showing the displacement step and the observed outflow as a function of time. System latency is shown in red. Table of Contents Equipment Data Acquisition Data Processing Important Notes and Tips Equipment weighing scale with a serial output to PC a PC equipped with: software for RS 232 terminal reading. If it came with the weighing scale, use the original software. If not, several appropriate are available online like Termite, PuTTy etc. (download Termite here) CNC machine and control Python 3 environment (Spyder or similar) to run the g-code generator (download here) A glass beaker sunflower oil Data Acquisition 1. Connect the serial output of the weighing scale to the computer USB port and get the communication working run the serial read software check the data sheet of the weighing scale for baud rate, data bits, parity etc.) make sure all the settings in the software match the values in the data sheet. If they do, the values on the computer terminal monitor should match the one you can read on the weighing scale screen if the software enables it, select the option for the data be written into a. txt file 2. Generate the testing protocol g-code Download the VITAPRINT_latency_test_protocol. py file from GitHub and open it in the preferred Python environment read the instructions in the heading of the file to familiarise yourself with the parameters you can manipulate Run the programme. Now, a file named '[TODAYSDATE-your_specified_filename]. gcode' should be generated in your working directory. Open this file in your CNC control software and see if it is working 3. Prepare the apparatus Fill the glass beaker with sunflower oil place it onto the weighing scale and press "Tare" Mount your extruder over the vessel mount the syringe, filled with material with needle attached onto the extruder (G 21 needle used in our case) extrude some material so that it starts flowing out and wait for the outflow to stop 4. Start recording the mass 5. Run the g-code in your CNC controller Figure 2 : The apparatus for latency measurement Data Processing How does it work? It is important to understand the workflow of the data processing. The raw data may contain some high frequency noise usually originating from the building vibration (people walking, door closing etc.). The raw data are therefore first low-pass filtered. Then they are blocked up in cycles (each cycles contains a dataset of mass values associated to one displacement step). Then, an exponential fit of a form f = aexp(-bx) + cexp(-dx) is fitted to each dataset. At the end, a 95 % point is found in every dataset and taken as the system latency. you can see the output signal after every stage in the Appendix below, for easier visualisation. Procedure Download the file for data processing (VITAPRINT_latency_data_processing. py) Copy the. txt file with your acquired data into the same folder as the data processing file. Open the VITAPRINT_latency_data_processing. py file in your Python environment and read the head of the file. Follow the instructions in the code header Run the code the Latency values should appear in your python command prompt as the programme output Important Notes and Tips In our setup this method proved to be repeatable and robust. However, depending on the hardware it may not be so. It is advisable to repeat this procedure several times to investigate whether you can rely on it.
