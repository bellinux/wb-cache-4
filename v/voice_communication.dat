5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from <b>voice</b> <b>communication,</b> it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out <b>voice</b> <b>communication.</b> The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E

5|$|Popular {{modes of}} {{operation}} include <b>voice</b> <b>communication</b> using amplitude modulation (AM), and Morse code using continuous wave (CW) radiotelegraphy. Among enthusiasts, there is considerable interest in owning, restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment, much of it more than 40 years old. Some undertake to construct their own gear, known in ham slang as homebrewing, using vintage parts and designs. A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests, events, and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of the hobby.|$|E

40|$|In {{the seventh}} version of their Standards of Care, WPATH recognizes that, as {{each person is}} unique, so is the person's gender identity.

When outer expression is congruent with an inner sense of self, transgender people may find increased comfort, confidence, and improved function in everyday life. Transgender <b>voice</b> and <b>communication</b> {{is a relatively new}} area of practice within speech-language pathology/therapy and this document is intended to support clinicians and researchers working in this field. It begins with a review of the evidence-based literature in transgender <b>voice</b> and <b>communication.</b> The paper then discusses these clinical topics: trans-specific voice-and-communication assessment, voice feminization protocols and voice feminizing surgeries. There is also a section on speech and voice masculinization—an area that has received little previous attention.
