40|$|Accelerated {{hypertension}} is {{a convenient}} model {{for studying the}} pathomechanism of hypertensive <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions.</b> It has not been settled, however, whether such lesions are really equivalent to those developing slowly {{in the course of}} experimental hypertensive vascular disease. In the present study, early <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> of accelerated hypertension have been compared with those of hypertensive vascular disease by using two complementary techniques: small-molecule plasma-protein label (Ferrlecit) and a macromolecular tracer protein (horse ferritin). Two kinds of <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> have been distinguished. Non-destructive <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> exhibit necrotic smooth-muscle cells with intracellular deposition of Ferrlecit-labelled plasma proteins and intact basement-membrane barrier to the macromolecular tracer. Destructive <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions,</b> in turn, are characterized by the breakdown of the basement-membrane barrier to the macromolecular tracer. Incipient destructive lesions are identified as dissecting microaneurysms initiated by small ruptures of the basement membrane framework. Both non-destructive <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> and incipient destructive <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> end in confluent medial destruction that precedes the formation of fibrinoid necrosis. The localization and morphology of <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> is identical both in hypertensive vascular disease and in accelerated hypertension. Circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that non-destructive <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> are caused by arterial contraction. Nevertheless, the possibility that non-destructive lesions are but abortive forms of destructive ones cannot be excluded...|$|R

Design: Secondary 12 -month follow-up analysis of an observational survey focusing on the prevalence of subcortical <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> in a population of elderly patients discharged from rehabilitation hospitals. Setting: A rehabilitation and aged care unit. Participants: Consecutively admitted elderly patients (N= 214) with gait disorder. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: On admission, all patients underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment including sociodemographics, cognitive and depressive symptoms, nutritional status, physical health, and functional status. Subcortical <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> were assessed on computed tomography films with a validated rating scale. All patients received a standardized rehabilitative program. Twelve months after discharge, all patients were interviewed by telephone, mainly focusing on the occurrence of falls during the follow-up period. Potential predictors of falls were assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Univariate predictors of falls were age, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination, Barthel Index on admission, and subcortical <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions.</b> In multivariate analyses, subcortical <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> were the only significant predictor of risk of falling; patients with moderate and severe subcortical <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> scores had {{a greater risk of}} falling (odds ratio [OR]= 3. 0; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 3 - 7. 1; P=. 012; OR= 3. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 6 - 9. 2; P=. 002, respectively) than those with no subcortical <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions.</b> Conclusions: Subcortical <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> are associated with falls at 12 months in elderly patients with gait disorder discharged from a rehabilitative ward.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of vascular and Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions, their interaction {{in the development of}} cognitive impairment and the very existence of mixed dementia induced by the potentiation of both mechanisms remain controversial. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether the patients with infarcts and lacunes have fewer plaques and tangles than those without <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions,</b> for similar severity of clinical dementia. We performed a prospective clinicopathological study in elderly patients of a long-stay care unit. The severity of clinical dementia was assessed by psychometry performed according to standardized methods less than 6 months before death. A volumetric study of cerebral <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> was performed at post-mortem study of the brain. The density of neuritic plaques (SP), Amyloid beta focal deposits (Abeta FD), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the temporal and frontal isocortex was quantified. According to DSM III criteria, 28 of the 33 patients for whom autopsies were performed had dementia. Twenty-four of the included patients had degenerative or <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions,</b> or both. The volume of infarcts and lacunes was significantly correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment. The density of SP, Abeta FD and NFT in the temporal and frontal isocortex was significantly lower when <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> were present. For similar clinical severity of dementia, there were fewer AD lesions in patients with <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> than in those without <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction <b>Vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> (Hemangioma or <b>vascular</b> malformation) in {{the head}} and neck region are quite common and need {{therapeutic}} intervention if they become symptomatic or cosmetically unacceptable. Different therapeutic modalities including cryotherapy, corticosteroids, laser therapy, sclerotherapy, surgery and/or embolization are available. Advances in laser surgery as well as sclerotherapy techniques have improved our ability to treat extensive lesions. Surgical excision sometimes becomes very difficult due to massive per-operative bleeding and proximity to major neurovascular structures. In this study we have tried to find a simpler, easily available, safe and cost-effective therapy to treat these <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions.</b> Materials and Method         A pilot case study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Kolkata for a period of one year. Polidocanol was selected as the sclerosing agent for treatment of head and neck <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> for its safety and its local anesthetic effect. 3 % Polidocanol was injected in 20 lesions. Result 20 patients with head and neck <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> treated with polidocanol sclerotherapy were followed up for 12 months. The study included 20 patients (12 female and 8 male) with mean age 20. 3 years (range 6 - 62 years). Of these 20 patients 14 had 90 % to 100 % result and in 6 patients we obtained only mild improvement. Discussion Sclerotherapy is now becoming the first choice of treatment in head and neck <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions.</b> Polidocanol is a mixture of 5 % ethyl alcohol and 95 % hydroxypolyethoxydodecane, the detergent action of which induces a rapid overhydration of endothelial cells, leading to vascular injury and regression of <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions.</b> As the same time it is a local anesthetic, so treatment is painless.

5000|$|In children, {{distinguishing}} between a primary malignant liver tumor (hepatoblastoma) and a benign primary hepatic lesion (hemangioendothelioma) is crucial. The absence of urinary catecholamines supports {{the diagnosis of}} hemangioendothelioma. In patients with hemangioendotheliomas, elevations in α1-fetoprotein levels are milder than those found in patients with hepatoblastomas. Infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma is strongly suggested {{by the presence of}} a <b>vascular</b> <b>lesion</b> on imaging studies. A complex, heterogeneous mass is often seen on ultrasonograms; a complex tumor that lacks central enhancement can be see on CT scans; and the vascular nature of the lesion along with dilation of the aorta proximal to the origin of the celiac artery and a decrease in the diameter distally, indicating significant shunting, is seen on angiograms. Because most hemangioendotheliomas in infants sponanteously involute and regress within the first 12 to 18 months of life, asymptomatic lesions are generally managed conservatively. Infants who have severe anemia and/or thrombocytopenia can be given blood products; for those who have cardiac failure, diuretics and digoxin are often given. To stop further growth and to speed regression of lesions in infants with more significant clinical sequelae, treatment with corticosteroids or interferon-α-2a is administered. To slow the growth of tumors that are rapidly enlarging, chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been used. Surgical resection, partial hepatectomy, and embolization of afferent vessels should be considered for severe cases.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients {{without a}} subarachnoid {{haemorrhage}} (SAH) on brain CT scan (CT-negative), but a lumbar puncture (LP) -proven SAH, are a challenging patient category. The optimal diagnostic approach {{is still a}} matter of debate. Also, there is little knowledge on the probability of finding an underlying <b>vascular</b> <b>lesion.</b> DESIGN: In this observational study, a consecutive cohort of 94 patients with CT-negative, LP-positive SAH was prospectively collected between 1998 and 2013. The yield of diagnostic modalities as well as patient outcome was studied. In addition, risk factors {{for the presence of}} a <b>vascular</b> <b>lesion</b> were analysed. RESULTS: In 40 patients (43 %), an intracranial vascular abnormality was detected: 37 aneurysms and three arterial dissections. Female gender was significantly associated with detection of a <b>vascular</b> <b>lesion.</b> Time between ictus and diagnosis of SAH was not associated with the presence of vascular pathology. Overall, 99 % of patients had a modified Rankin Score of 0 - 2 after a median follow-up of 72  months. The yield of additional digital subtraction angiography in patients with a negative CT angiography was zero. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the chance of finding a <b>vascular</b> <b>lesion</b> in a patient with CT-negative, LP-positive SAH was 43 %, underlining the need for an adequate diagnostic workup. In general, the patient outcome was favourable.

40|$|In the liver, imaging {{can show}} lesions of large and {{medium-sized}} vessels, perfusion disorders related to <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions,</b> and parenchymal lesions including infarcts, regenerative nodules, and focal nodular hyperplasia. In the gastrointestinal tract, <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> often result in bowel ischemia. Imaging {{can be used}} to show the <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions</b> and bowel wall abnormalities, including mural thickening, lack of perfusion, and pneumatosis. Doppler sonography, multislice helical computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and angiography are useful to demonstrate <b>vascular</b> <b>lesions.</b> Doppler sonography offers high spatial and temporal resolution. Information about blood flow and velocity can be obtained. However, the visualization of retroperitoneal vessels is often limited because of intestinal gas.
