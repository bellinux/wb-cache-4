In order to reach this purpose, an exhaustive list of literature on culture and cultural values in advertisements are consulted. Using guidelines from previous research and literatures on content analysis, advertising appeals and netnography, qualitative analyses {{of the contents of}} four animated advertising videos from India and consumer comments on the same are conducted. Based on the researcher’s observations and interpretations, the study reveals that advertisements in both media reflect cultural values, but in surprisingly different ways. TV advertisements reflect new and modern values in India, whereas the supposedly radical <b>viral</b> <b>advertisements</b> tend to stick to traditional culture...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates which factors predict whether {{consumers}} will pass on viral advertising communications {{to their friends}} on a social network site. A conceptual framework consisting of three attitudinal and three social predictors of forwarding online content was tested using three real-life advertising campaigns that were spread simultaneously through the Dutch social network site Hyves. Results show that viral advertising pass-on behavior was significantly predicted by {{a positive attitude toward}} the brand, the advertisement, and toward viral advertising in general. For two of the three advertisements participants were more likely to forward the advertisement when the advertisement was received from a friend rather than a company. The present study is the first to investigate the predictors of actual pass-on behavior of <b>viral</b> <b>advertisements</b> {{in the context of a}} social network site, thereby significantly contributing to existing knowledge on the drivers of viral advertising success...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{offers an}} {{introduction}} to theory on viral advertising from literature in sociology and communication, exploring the contradictory status of the viral advertisement as a media form. The three principal differentiating characteristics of the viral video compared with other forms of advertising are its aesthetic, its ambiguous authorship, and its distribution logic. The chapter examines each of these characteristics in relation to copyright law, identifying aspects of viral media which are in tension with existing intellectual property law. It closes by suggesting that legal scholars should pay greater attention {{to the status of}} viral advertisement in debates about the ‘future of copyright’ in the digital age. <b>Viral</b> <b>advertisements</b> represent a problematic configuration of commercial interests and the interests of online communities. The development of this relationship has depended on the willingness of copyright owners to tolerate uses of the work beyond their control...|$|E
40|$|Simulation {{has become}} an {{important}} method that is widely used in studying the propagation behaviors {{during the process of}} viral advertisement diffusion. With the increased computing and memory resources required for large-scale network processing, General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) have been used in high performance computing platforms to accelerate simulation performance. In this paper, we show optimized simulation strategies of viral advertisement diffusion on a Multi-GPU system. Using our proposed simulation strategies, we examine the spread of <b>viral</b> <b>advertisements</b> over a realistic social network with different tolerance thresholds. We also investigate the effect of different initial nodes selection policies in maximizing the performance of advertisement diffusion. According to our simulation studies of viral advertisement diffusion, we can observe that the number of initial selected nodes is important to the diffusion behaviors. However, we also note that the initial selection policy plays a limited role in the final result of viral advertisement diffusion. Finally, we discuss improved viral advertising strategies that use mass marketing first to increase the willingness of accepting a product and apply viral marketing to facilitate the maximization of advertisement diffusion. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Sharing {{motivations of}} <b>viral</b> <b>advertisements</b> by {{consumers}} and {{the impacts of}} these advertisements on the perceptions for brand will be questioned in this study. Three fundamental questions are answered in the study. These are advertisement watching and sharing motivations of individuals, criteria of liking viral advertisement {{and the impact of}} individual attitudes for viral advertisement on brand perception respectively. This study will be carried out via a viral advertisement which was practiced in Turkey. The data will be collected by survey method and the sample of the study consists of individuals who experienced the practice of sample advertisement. Data will be collected by online survey method and will be analyzed by using SPSS statistical package program. Recently traditional advertisement mind have been changing. New advertising approaches which have significant impacts on consumers have been argued. Viral advertising is a modernist advertisement mind which offers significant advantages to brands apart from traditional advertising channels such as television, radio and magazines. Viral advertising also known as Electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) consists of free spread of convincing messages sent by brands among interpersonal communication. When compared to the traditional advertising, a more provocative thematic approach is argued. The foundation of this approach is to create advertisements that are worth sharing with others by consumers. When that fact is taken into consideration, {{in a manner of speaking}} it can also be stated that viral advertising is media engineering. The content worth sharing makes people being a volunteer spokesman of a brand and strengthens the emotional bonds among brand and consumer. Especially for some sectors in countries which are having traditional advertising channel limitations, viral advertising creates vital advantages.

40|$|Social {{networks}} are gaining an increasing popularity on the Internet, {{with tens of}} millions of registered users and an amount of exchanged contents accounting for a large fraction of the Internet traffic. Due to this popularity, social {{networks are}} becoming a critical media for business and marketing, as testified by <b>viral</b> <b>advertisement</b> campaigns based on such networks. To exploit the potential of social networks, it is necessary to classify the users in order to identify the most relevant ones. For example, in the context of marketing on social networks, it is necessary to identify which users should be involved in an advertisement campaign. However, the complexity of social networks, where each user is described by a large number of attributes, transforms the problem of identifying relevant users in a needle in a haystack problem. Starting from a set of user attributes that may be redundant or do not provide significant information for our analysis, we need to extract a limited number of meaningful characteristics {{that can be used to}} identify relevant users. We propose a quantitative methodology based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze attributes and extract characteristics of social network users from the initial attribute set. The proposed methodology can be applied to identify relevant users in social network for different types of analysis. As an application, we present two case studies that show how the proposed methodology can be used to identify relevant users for marketing on the popular YouTube network. Specifically, we identify which users may play a key role in the content dissemination and how users may be affected by different dissemination strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the following advertisement problem in online social networks (OSNs). Given a fixed advertisement investment, e. g., a number of free samples that can be given away to {{a small number of}} users, a company needs to determine the probability that users in the OSN will eventually purchase the product. In this paper, we model OSNs as scale-free graphs (either with or without high clustering coefficient). We employ various influence mechanisms that govern the influence spreading in such large scale OSNs and use the local mean field (LMF) technique to analyze these online social networks wherein states of nodes can be changed by various influence mechanisms. We extend our model for advertising with multiple rating levels. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate our models which can provide insight on designing efficient advertising strategies in online social networks.
