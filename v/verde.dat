At their debut, the country sent three athletes to the games, all in athletics. The most number of Cape <b>Verde</b> athletes participating in a summer games, is three in 1996, 2004 and 2012. No Cape <b>Verde</b> athlete has ever progressed {{out of the first}} round. Two athletes from Cape <b>Verde</b> were selected to compete in the 2008 games; Nelson Cruz in the men's marathon and Wania Monteiro in the women's all-round gymnastics.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{after the}} start of the Great Depression, the price of copper fell to 14cents a pound. In response, United <b>Verde</b> began {{reducing}} its work force; UVX operated at a loss, and the third big mine, <b>Verde</b> Central, closed completely. The price of copper fell further in 1932 to 5 cents a pound, leading to layoffs, temporary shut-downs, and wage reductions in the <b>Verde</b> District. In 1935, the Clark family sold United <b>Verde</b> to Phelps Dodge, and in 1938 UVX went out of business.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Fran {{was one of}} {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclones in the history of Cape <b>Verde.</b> The sixth named storm and eleventh tropical cyclone of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season, Fran developed from a tropical wave near Cape <b>Verde</b> on September15. It began as a tropical depression and gradually strengthened while tracking westward, remaining south of the Cape <b>Verde</b> archipelago. Late on September16, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fran, shortly before brushing Cape <b>Verde,</b> and then moving further out to sea. The storm approached hurricane status on September17 and September18, though it eventually weakened. Beginning on September19, Fran encountered strong wind shear, which contributed to further weakening. By September20, Fran dissipated well east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

5|$|On September 21, a {{tropical}} wave – a trough of relatively low atmospheric pressure – began moving slowly westward {{from the west}} coast of Africa, passing near the Cape <b>Verde</b> islands on September 23. Though the wave was disorganized, a low-level circulation developed on September 24 a few hundred miles to the southwest of Cape <b>Verde.</b> Steady organization ensued, including the development of convection into curved bands around the system. Though it lacked a well-defined center, the system organized enough to be classified Tropical Depression Sixteen on September 25 while located about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of the Cape <b>Verde</b> Islands.|$|E
5|$|The Glamis road {{opened in}} August 1958, {{and the road}} from Glamis to Palo <b>Verde</b> was under {{construction}} at that time; {{the part of the}} road that was already open was dedicated in October. In 1959, the rest of the current routing of SR78 between Brawley and Palo <b>Verde</b> was added to the state highway system as SR195 and Legislative Route 146. The state legislature added the portion of SR78 from SR115 to the Riverside County line in the 1964 state highway renumbering, also naming the road the Ben Hulse Highway. In March 1964, the Ben Hulse Highway leading to Palo <b>Verde</b> was dedicated, and state senator Hulse's efforts to have the road built were recognized. Following this, in 1965, the newly constructed section was signed as CRS78. The section from Palo <b>Verde</b> to Blythe shows up as part of SR78 on maps as early as 1965, and the section from southwest of Midway Well to Palo <b>Verde</b> is shown as part of SR78 as early as 1966.|$|E

5|$|The early Archaic {{people living}} near Mesa <b>Verde</b> {{utilized}} the atlatl and harvested {{a wider variety}} of plants and animals than the Paleo-Indians had, while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. They inhabited the outlying areas of the Mesa <b>Verde</b> region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rockshelters and rock art, and left evidence of animal processing and chert knapping. Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa <b>Verde,</b> whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled with spring rains, provided relatively plentiful amounts of water.|$|E

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of Cape <b>Verde</b> on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of Cape <b>Verde.</b>|$|E

5|$|Angus McKinnon and Morris A. Ruffner {{filed the}} first copper mining claims at this {{location}} in 1876. In 1880, Frederick A. Tritle, {{the governor of}} the Arizona Territory, and Frederick F. Thomas, a mining engineer from San Francisco, bought these claims from the original owners. In 1883, with the aid of eastern financiers including James A. MacDonald and Eugene Jerome of New York City, they created the United <b>Verde</b> Copper Company. The small adjacent mining camp on Cleopatra Hill was named Jerome in honor of Eugene Jerome, who became the company secretary. United <b>Verde</b> built a small smelter at Jerome and constructed wagon roads from it to Prescott, the <b>Verde</b> Valley, and the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad depot at Ash Fork. However, transport by wagon was expensive, and in late 1884 after the price of copper had fallen by 50percent, the company ceased all operations at the site.|$|E

5|$|As Josephine {{passed to}} the south of the Cape <b>Verde</b> islands on September2, outer rain bands {{produced}} minor rainfall, totaling around 0.55inches (14mm). There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa <b>Verde</b> pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa <b>Verde</b> pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E
