25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways insects can be fossilized and preserved including compressions and impressions, concretions, mineral replication, charcoalified (fusainized) remains, and their trace remains. Compressions and Impressions are the most extensive types of insect fossils, occurring in rocks from the Carboniferous to Recent. Impressions are like a cast or mold of a fossil insect, showing its form and even some relief, like pleating in the wings, but usually little or no color from the cuticle. Compressions preserve remains of the cuticle, so color distinguishes structure. In exceptional situations, microscopic features such as microtrichia on sclerites and wing membranes are even visible, but preservation of this scale also requires a matrix of exceptionally fine grain, such as in micritic muds and <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuffs.</b> Because arthropod sclerites are held together by membranes, which readily decompose, many fossil arthropods are known only by isolated sclerites. Far more desirable are complete fossils. Concretions are stones with a fossil at the core whose chemical composition {{differs from that of}} the surrounding matrix, usually formed as a result of mineral precipitation from decaying organisms. The most significant deposit consists of various localities of the Late Carboniferous Francis Creek Shale of the Carbondale Formation at Mazon Creek, Illinois, which are composed of shales and coal seams yielding oblong concretions. Within most concretions is a mold of an animal and sometimes a plant that is usually marine in origin.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how Jordanian <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> aggregates affect {{the characteristics of}} cement mortar. Five mortar mixes were prepared by replacing normal aggregate (standard sand) with <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> aggregate in ratios of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 % (M 1 to M 5, respectively). Compressive strength, flexural strength, and unit weight were tested at mortar ages of 3, 7, 28, and 56 days. The results revealed improved compressive and flexural strength, which were maximal for the M 3 sample. Unit weight decreased as the ratio of <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> increased. Based on these results, adding Jordanian <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> in the appropriate ratio will improve these mortar characteristics...|$|R

500|$|More than 80 soil types {{support a}} wide variety of flora within the monument. These soils stem from past and present {{geologic}} activity as well as ongoing additions of organic matter from life forms on or near the surface. Adapted to particular soil types and surface conditions, these plant communities range from riparian vegetation near the river to greasewood and saltgrass on the alluvial fans to plants such as hedgehog cactus in rocky outcrops at high elevation. Important to many of these communities is a black cryptobiotic crust that resists erosion, stores water, and fixes nitrogen used by the plants. The crust is composed of algae, lichens, mosses, fungi, and bacteria. Other areas of the monument have little or no flora. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>tuffs</b> and claystones that lack essential nutrients support few microorganisms and plants. Likewise, hard rock surfaces and steep slopes from which soils wash or blow away tend to remain bare.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, the {{production}} of floor tile with addition of tuff into the standard masse was aimed. Chemical, mineralogical, particle size distribution and thermal analysis were performed on Afyon region tuffs. Samples were produced by adding 11, 18, 20, 24 % <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> by weight into the standard floor tile masse which were composed of clay, pegmatite, feldspar, and kaolin. In the 5 various mixing series test specimen were produced by dry pressing method. Samples were fired at 1213 °C and were kept for 40 minutes which is standard sample fire temperature. Water absorption, viscosity, apparent density, firing shrinkage and compressive strength tests were performed on the fired specimen and compared with specifications and evaluated. As a result, addition of <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> into the standard masse by adding 10 - 20 % {{can be used for}} {{the production}} of tile floor. Alkaline properties were observed on the <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff.</b> Water absorption and viscosity values of tuff were affected in very little amount. It is determined that usage of <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuff</b> is possible with decreasing amount of clay, kaolin and pegmatite...|$|R
50|$|The Volcanic Eifel or Vulkan Eifel (Vulkaneifel) is {{a region}} in the Eifel Mountains in Germany, that is defined {{to a large extent}} by its {{volcanic}} geological history. Characteristic of this volcanic field are its typical explosion crater lakes or maars, and numerous other signs of volcanic activity such as <b>volcanic</b> <b>tuffs,</b> lava streams and volcanic craters like the Laacher See.
