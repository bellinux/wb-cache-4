50|$|Charles Darwin's The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> {{through the}} Action of Worms {{is an example}} of a very early work on ichnology, {{describing}} bioturbation and, in particular, the burrowing of earthworms.|$|R
60|$|There {{is little}} variety {{in the soil}} {{throughout}} Sikkim, and, as far as vegetation is concerned, it may be divided into <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> and stiff clay--each, as they usually occur, remarkably characteristic in composition of such soils. Bog-earth is very rare, nor did I find peat at any elevation.|$|R
60|$|I {{set out on}} a riding excursion, for {{the purpose}} of geologising the basal parts of the Andes, which alone {{at this time of the}} year are not shut up by the winter snow. Our first day's ride was northward along the sea-coast. After dark we reached the Hacienda of Quintero, the estate which {{formerly}} belonged to Lord Cochrane. My object in coming here was to see the great beds of shells which stand some yards above the level of the sea, and are burnt for lime. The proofs of the elevation of this whole line of coast are unequivocal: at the height of a few hundred feet old-looking shells are numerous, and I found some at 1300 feet. These shells either lie loose on the surface, or are embedded in a reddish-black <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould.</b> I was much surprised to find under the microscope that this <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> is really marine mud, full of minute particles of organic bodies.|$|R
60|$|The civilized nations--Greece, Rome, England--have been {{sustained}} by the primitive forests which anciently rotted where they stand. They survive {{as long as the}} soil is not exhausted. Alas for human culture! little is to be expected of a nation, when the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> is exhausted, and it is compelled to make manure of the bones of its fathers. There the poet sustains himself merely by his own superfluous fat, and the philosopher comes down on his marrow-bones.|$|R
60|$|Crossing the Little Rungeet river, we camped on {{the base}} of Tonglo. The night was calm and clear, with faint cirrus, but no dew. A {{thermometer}} sunk two feet in rich <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> stood at 78 degrees two hours after it was lowered, and the same on the following morning. This probably indicates the mean temperature of the month at that spot, where, however, the dark colour of the exposed loose soil must raise the temperature considerably.|$|R
6000|$|The {{amount of}} fine earth {{brought to the}} surface under the form of castings, and {{afterwards}} transported by the winds accompanied by rain, or that which flows and rolls down an inclined surface, no doubt is small {{in the course of}} a few scores of years; for otherwise all the inequalities in our pasture fields would be smoothed within a much shorter period than appears to be the case. [...] But the amount which is thus transported in the course of thousands of years cannot fail to be considerable and deserves attention. E. de Beaumont looks at the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> which everywhere covers the land as a fixed line, from which the amount of denudation may be measured. {79} He ignores the continued formation of fresh mould by the disintegration of the underlying rocks and fragments of rock; and it is curious to find how much more philosophical were the views maintained long ago, by Playfair, who, in 1802, wrote, [...] "In the permanence of a coat of <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> on the surface of the earth, we have a demonstrative proof of the continued destruction of the rocks." [...] {80} ...|$|R
500|$|His evolution-related {{experiments}} and investigations led to books on Orchids, Insectivorous Plants, The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom, {{different forms of}} flowers on plants of the same species, and The Power of Movement in Plants. His botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including Grant Allen and H. G. Wells, and [...] in the late C19 and early C20. In his last book he returned to The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms.|$|R
60|$|I {{have now}} (May 1, 1881) {{sent to the}} {{printers}} the MS. of a little book on 'The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould,</b> through the Action of Worms.' This is a subject of but small importance; and I know not whether it will interest any readers (Between November 1881 and February 1884, 8500 copies have been sold.), but it has interested me. It is {{the completion of a}} short paper read before the Geological Society more than forty years ago, and has revived old geological thoughts.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Darwin was {{interested}} in worms and [...] "how far they acted consciously, and how much mental power they displayed." [...] In The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, Darwin described complex behaviors by worms when plugging their burrows. He suggested that worms appear to [...] "have the power of acquiring some notion, however rude, of {{the shape of an}} object and of their burrows" [...] and if so, [...] "they deserve to be called intelligent; for they then act in nearly the same manner as would a man under similar circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|The indescribable {{innocence and}} {{beneficence}} of Nature--of sun and wind and rain, of summer and winter--such health, such cheer, they afford forever! and such sympathy have they ever with our race, that all Nature would be affected, and the sun's brightness fade, and the winds would sigh humanely, {{and the clouds}} rain tears, and the woods shed their leaves and put on mourning in midsummer, if any man should ever for a just cause grieve. Shall I not have intelligence with the earth? Am I not partly leaves and <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> myself? ...|$|R
50|$|Bioturbation's {{importance}} for soil processes and geomorphology was ﬁrst realised by Charles Darwin, who devoted his last scientiﬁc {{book to the}} subject (The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, 1881). Modern research has provided further insight into the evolutionary and ecological role of bioturbation. In modern ecological theory, bioturbation is recognised as an archetypal example of 'ecosystem engineering', modifying geochemical gradients, redistributing food resources, viruses, bacteria, resting stages and eggs. From an evolutionary perspective, recent investigations provide evidence that bioturbation had {{a key role in}} the evolution of metazoan life at the end of the Precambrian Era.|$|R
50|$|The Power of Movement in Plants {{is a book}} by Charles Darwin on {{phototropism}} {{and other}} types of movement in plants. This book continues his work in producing evidence for his theory of natural selection. As it was one of his last books, followed only by the publication of The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, he was assisted by his son Francis in conducting the necessary experiments and preparing the manuscript. The Power of Movement in Plants was published 6 November 1880, and 1500 copies were quickly sold by publisher John Murray.|$|R
5000|$|Before Easter he {{sent off}} his {{manuscript}} for The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, and {{found he had}} no [...] "heart or strength... to begin any investigation lasting for years". [...] "Never happy except when at work", {{he was at a}} loose end until he remembered his autobiography. On 22 April 1881, exactly 30 years after Annie's burial, he re-read the passages about her and Emma's letter of that time, and added a note under his daguerreotype of Annie, [...] "When I am dead, know that many times, I have kissed & cryed over this." [...] sic.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the year}} 1869, Mr. Fish {5} {{rejected}} my conclusions {{with respect to}} the part which worms have played in the formation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> merely on account of their assumed incapacity to do so much work. He remarks that [...] "considering their weakness and their size, the work they are represented to have accomplished is stupendous." [...] Here we have an instance of that inability to sum up the effects of a continually recurrent cause, which has often retarded the progress of science, as formerly in the case of geology, and more recently in that of the principle of evolution.|$|R
6000|$|... § 2. The long drought {{which took}} place in the autumn of the year 1854, sealing every source of waters except these {{perpetual}} ones, left the torrent of which I am speaking, and such others, in a state peculiarly favorable to observance of their least action on the mountains from which they descend. They were entirely limited to their own ice fountains, and the quantity of powdered rock which they brought down was, of course, at its minimum, being nearly unmingled with any earth derived from the dissolution of softer soil, or <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> by rains.|$|R
60|$|In {{the summers}} {{there is one}} visitor, however, to that valley, of which the Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like, and yet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground, with long grasses growing through it and <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> {{overrunning}} it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses for a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.|$|R
60|$|It was in 1881 that Darwin {{published}} his last volume, 'The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms.' In this singularly fascinating and interesting monograph {{he took in}} hand one of the lowliest and humblest of living forms, the common earthworm, and by an exhaustive study of its habits and manners strove {{to show how the}} entire existence of vegetable mould--the ordinary covering of fertile soil upon the face of the earth--is due to the long but unobtrusive action of these little-noticed and ever-active architects. By the acids which they evolve, they appear to aid largely in the disintegration of the stone beneath the surface; by their constant practice of eating fallen leaves, which they drag down with them into their subterranean burrows, they produce the fine castings of soft earth, so familiar to everybody, and thus reinstate the coating of humus above the bare rock as often as it is washed away again in the course of ordinary denudation by the rain and the torrents. It is true that subsequent investigation has shown the possibility of <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> existing under certain conditions without the intervention of worms to any marked extent; but, as a whole, {{there can be little doubt}} that over most parts of the world the presence of soil, and therefore of the vegetable growth rooted in it, is entirely due to the unsuspected yet ceaseless activity of these humble creatures.|$|R
50|$|The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> {{through the}} Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits (sometimes {{shortened}} to Worms) is an 1881 book by Charles Darwin on earthworms. It {{was his last}} scientific book, and was published {{shortly before his death}} (see Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms). Exploring earthworm behaviour and ecology, it continued the theme common throughout his work that gradual changes {{over long periods of time}} can lead to large and sometimes surprising consequences. It was the first significant work on soil bioturbation, although that term was not used by Darwin (it first appeared in the soil and geomorphic literature one hundred years later).|$|R
60|$|He reposed {{himself for}} some time on {{the trunk of a}} fallen hemlock, {{listening}} to the boding cry of the tree-toad, and delving with his walking-staff into a mound of black mould at his feet. As he turned up the soil unconsciously, his staff struck against something hard. He raked it out of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> and lo! a cloven skull with an Indian tomahawk buried deep in it, lay before him. The rust on the weapon showed the time that had elapsed since this death blow had been given. It was a dreary memento of the fierce struggle that had taken place in this last foothold of the Indian warriors.|$|R
60|$|If earth were {{swallowed}} {{only when}} worms deepened their burrows or made new ones, castings would be thrown up only occasionally; {{but in many}} places fresh castings may be seen every morning, {{and the amount of}} earth ejected from the same burrow on successive days is large. Yet worms do not burrow to a great depth, except when the weather is very dry or intensely cold. On my lawn the black <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> or humus is only about 5 inches in thickness, and overlies light-coloured or reddish clayey soil: now when castings are thrown up in the greatest profusion, only a small proportion are light coloured, and it is incredible that the worms should daily make fresh burrows in every direction in the thin superficial layer of dark-coloured mould, unless they obtained nutriment of some kind from it. I have observed a strictly analogous case in a field near my house where bright red clay lay close beneath the surface. Again on one part of the Downs near Winchester the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> overlying the chalk was found to be only from 3 to 4 inches in thickness; and the many castings here ejected were as black as ink and did not effervesce with acids; so that the worms must have confined themselves to this thin superficial layer of mould, of which large quantities were daily swallowed. In another place at no great distance the castings were white; and why the worms should have burrowed into the chalk in some places and not in others, I am unable to conjecture.|$|R
5000|$|These {{writings}} {{contributed to}} Darwin's pursuit {{of evidence that}} would support his theory of natural selection. There were only two more books to follow: The Power of Movement in Plants (1880) and The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms (1881). He conducted {{a wide range of}} experiments and observations and the results of these form the framework of the book. He was assisted in this work by his son, Francis Darwin who also wrote a preface for the second edition which was published two years after his father's death in 1882. The book was dedicated to his longtime friend and colleague, Harvard botany professor Asa Gray [...] "as a small tribute of respect and affection".|$|R
5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer.

While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms.|$|R

60|$|Here {{and thus}} Anne {{remained}} concealed. The crunch of the steward's spade, as it {{cut into the}} soft <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> was plainly perceptible to her ears when the periodic cessations between the creaks of the engine concurred with a lull in the breeze, which otherwise brought the subdued roar of the cascade from the further side of the bank that screened it. A large hole--some four or five feet deep--had been excavated by Manston in about twenty minutes. Into this he immediately placed the sack, and then began filling in the earth, and treading it down. Lastly he carefully raked the whole mass of dead and dry leaves {{into the middle of}} the pit, burying the ground with them as they had buried it before.|$|R
60|$|At Stonehenge, some of {{the outer}} Druidical stones are now prostrate, having fallen at a remote but unknown period; and these have become buried to a {{moderate}} depth in the ground. They are surrounded by sloping borders of turf, on which recent castings were seen. Close {{to one of these}} fallen stones, which was 17 ft long, 6 ft. broad, and 28.5 inches thick, a hole was dug; and here the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> was at least 9.5 inches in thickness. At this depth a flint was found, and a little higher up {{on one side of the}} hole a fragment of glass. The base of the stone lay about 9.5 inches beneath the level of the surrounding ground, and its upper surface 19 inches above the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{character}} of the soil is favourable to agriculture. It is composed of a black <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> of a foot to two feet in depth, overlaying a hard yellow clay. The surface earth is very fine, pulverised, and sandy, quite black, and, no doubt, of good quality; when sharpened with sheep-feeding it produces heavy crops. The fallen trees, which are very numerous, shew that the substratum of clay is too hard to produce anything. The roots of the pine never penetrate it. In some places the spontaneous vegetation testifies to {{the richness of the}} soil--such as wild pease or vetches, and wild clover, which I--have seen reach up to my horse's belly--and a most luxuriant growth of underwood, brambles, fern, etcetera.|$|R
