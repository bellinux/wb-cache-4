5|$|The film clips are a motif used {{to enhance}} {{the theme of the}} desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are {{released}} over the internet and gain a cult following, {{in the same way that}} the lonelygirl15 <b>videoblog</b> gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a single frame is like the world compressed into a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Blogging {{has brought}} about new ways of writing diaries and from a {{linguistic}} perspective, the language used in blogs is [...] "in its most 'naked' form", published {{for the world to}} see without undergoing the formal editing process. This is what makes blogs stand out because almost all other forms of printed language have gone through some form of editing and standardization. David Crystal stated that blogs were [...] "the beginning of a new stage {{in the evolution of the}} written language". Blogs have become so popular that they have expanded beyond written blogs, with the emergence of photoblog, <b>videoblog,</b> audioblog and moblog. These developments in interactive blogging have created new linguistic conventions and styles, with more expected to arise in the future.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The use of user-generated {{digital video}} posted on blogs, {{also known as}} <b>videoblogs,</b> is {{increasing}} {{with the advent of}} new hardware and software that allows people of various backgrounds and occupations to create their own professional videos. This is a new medium used often by students in secondary and higher education as evident in online sites such as YouTube and MySpace for personal reasons and presently by some instructors who use such video to instruct. Yet, the use of <b>videoblogs</b> is new overall to the educational community and little research is available on its use and effectiveness in the classroom and in an online environment. This paper will examine how <b>videoblogging</b> is used in educational institutions across grade levels, standard practices of educational <b>videoblogs,</b> how <b>videoblogging</b> ensures communication and interactivity within as well as outside of the classroom, how <b>videoblogging</b> influences students from diverse backgrounds in regards to multiculturalism, social class, and differentiated learning styles, and the sensitive issues educator...|$|R

40|$|<b>Videoblogging</b> {{is a form}} of {{cultural}} production that emerged in the early 2000 s {{as a result of the}} increasing availability of cheap digital recording equipment, new videoediting software, video website hosting and innovative distribution networks across the internet. This thesis explores the close entanglement of culture and technology in this early and under-examined area of media production – most notably in the self-definition and development of a specific community around video practices and technologies between 2004 - 2009. These videobloggers’ digital works are presented as an original case study of material digital culture on the internet, which also produced a distinctive aesthetic style. The thesis traces the discourses and technological infrastructures that were developed both within and around the community of videobloggers and that created the important pre-conditions for the video artefacts they produced. Through an ethnographically-informed cultural history of the practices and technologies of <b>videoblogging,</b> this thesis engages with the way in which new forms {{of cultural}} and technical hybrids have emerged in an increasingly digital age. The ethnographic research is informed by histories of film and video, which contribute to the theoretical understanding and contextualisation of <b>videoblogging</b> – as an early digital community – which has been somewhat neglected in favour of research on mainstream online video websites, such as YouTube. The thesis also contributes to scholarly understanding of contemporary digital video practices, and explores how the history of earlier amateur and semi-professional film and video has been influential on the practices, technologies and aesthetic styles of the videobloggers. It is also shown how their aesthetic has been drawn on and amplified in network culture, mainstream media, and contemporary media and cultural production. Through a critical mapping of the socio-technical structures of <b>videoblogging,</b> the thesis argues that the trajectories of future media and cultural production draws heavily from the practices and aesthetics of these early hybrid networked cultural-technical communities...|$|R
