5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon <b>vapors</b> and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the <b>vapors</b> can be ignited. At {{the same time it}} decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the <b>vapors</b> can be ignited. When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|E
5|$|An oil tanker's {{inert gas}} system {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parts of its design. Fuel oil itself is very difficult to ignite, but its hydrocarbon <b>vapors</b> are explosive when mixed with air in certain concentrations. The purpose of the system is to create an atmosphere inside tanks in which the hydrocarbon oil <b>vapors</b> cannot burn.|$|E
5|$|Loading an {{oil tanker}} {{consists}} primarily of pumping cargo into the ship's tanks. As oil enters the tank, the <b>vapors</b> inside the tank must be somehow expelled. Depending on local regulations, the <b>vapors</b> can be expelled {{into the atmosphere}} or discharged back to the pumping station {{by way of a}} vapor recovery line. It is also common for the ship to move water ballast during the loading of cargo to maintain proper trim.|$|E
40|$|A <b>vapor</b> sample {{detection}} method where the <b>vapor</b> sample contains <b>vapor</b> and ambient air and surrounding natural background particles. The <b>vapor</b> sample {{detection method}} includes {{the steps of}} generating a supply of aerosol that have a particular effective median particle size, mixing the aerosol with the <b>vapor</b> sample forming aerosol and adsorbed <b>vapor</b> suspended in an air stream, impacting the suspended aerosol and adsorbed <b>vapor</b> upon a reflecting element, alternatively directing infrared light to the impacted aerosol and adsorbed <b>vapor,</b> detecting and analyzing the alternatively directed infrared light in essentially real time using a spectrometer and a microcomputer and identifying the <b>vapor</b> sample...|$|R
50|$|Put in <b>vapor</b> {{pressure}} terms, {{a liquid}} boils at the temperature when its <b>vapor</b> pressure equals the surrounding pressure. For the solvent, {{the presence of}} the solute decreases its <b>vapor</b> pressure by dilution. A non-volatile solute has a <b>vapor</b> pressure of zero, so the <b>vapor</b> pressure of the solution is less than the <b>vapor</b> pressure of the solvent. Thus, a higher temperature is needed for the <b>vapor</b> pressure to reach the surrounding pressure, and the boiling point is elevated.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>vapor</b> {{source is}} a liquid or solid {{the process is}} called {{physical}} <b>vapor</b> deposition (PVD). When the source is a chemical <b>vapor</b> precursor, the process is called chemical <b>vapor</b> deposition (CVD). The latter has several variants: low-pressure chemical <b>vapor</b> deposition (LPCVD), Plasma-enhanced chemical <b>vapor</b> deposition (PECVD), and plasma-assisted CVD (PACVD). Often a combination of PVD and CVD processes {{are used in the}} same or connected processing chambers.|$|R
5|$|Other {{potentially}} damaging materials include non-archival quality cardboard, card, paper, {{cotton and}} cork, {{all of which}} give off acidic <b>vapors</b> over time. PVC and polyurethane plastics are also a problem, as they degrade and give off acidic <b>vapors</b> with time. High humidity of the air is a significant contributing factor, as is lack of ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) sulfide, Bk2S3, is {{prepared}} by either treating berkelium oxide {{with a mixture}} of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide <b>vapors</b> at 1130°C, or by directly reacting metallic berkelium with elemental sulfur. These procedures yield brownish-black crystals.|$|E
5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium. Note that non-metallic <b>vapors</b> such as neon may be used. As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, {{it is conceivable that}} such a medium could be used in the ALFs of today. This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic <b>vapors</b> in this capacity.|$|E
50|$|For a {{condensed}} phase (liquid or solid) in equilibrium {{with its}} <b>vapor</b> phase, the chemical potential {{is equal to}} that of the <b>vapor,</b> and therefore the fugacity is equal to the fugacity of the <b>vapor.</b> This fugacity is approximately equal to the <b>vapor</b> pressure when the <b>vapor</b> pressure is not too high.|$|R
50|$|The Reid <b>vapor</b> {{pressure}} (RVP) differs {{slightly from}} the true <b>vapor</b> pressure (TVP) of a liquid due to small sample vaporization {{and the presence of}} water <b>vapor</b> and air in the confined space of the test equipment. That is, the RVP is the absolute <b>vapor</b> pressure and the TVP is the partial <b>vapor</b> pressure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vapor</b> Trail: Hyper Offense Formation, {{known in}} Japan as Kuhga - Operation Code <b>Vapor</b> Trail (空牙 - Operation Code <b>Vapor</b> Trail) and usually simply {{referred}} to as <b>Vapor</b> Trail, is a 1989 shoot 'em up arcade game developed and published by Data East. <b>Vapor</b> Trail was followed by Wolf Fang and Skull Fang Kuhga Gaiden.|$|R
5|$|The effect {{explains}} supersaturation of <b>vapors.</b> In {{the absence}} of nucleation sites, tiny droplets must form before they can evolve into larger droplets. This requires a vapor pressure many times the vapor pressure at the phase transition point.|$|E
5|$|Actinium trichloride is {{obtained}} by reacting actinium hydroxide or oxalate with carbon tetrachloride <b>vapors</b> at temperatures above 960°C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium oxychloride {{can be prepared}} by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with ammonium hydroxide at 1000°C. However, {{in contrast to the}} oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in hydrochloric acid with ammonia.|$|E
5|$|An atomic {{line filter}} (ALF) is an {{advanced}} optical band-pass filter {{used in the}} physical sciences for filtering electromagnetic radiation with precision, accuracy, and minimal signal strength loss. Atomic line filters work via the absorption or resonance lines of atomic <b>vapors</b> and so may also be designated an atomic resonance filter (ARF).|$|E
50|$|If the {{pressure}} is greater than <b>vapor</b> pressure, then the fluid is liquid, otherwise <b>vapor.</b> This means density of liquid water is considered as the density of fluid if {{the pressure}} is greater than <b>vapor</b> pressure and the density of water <b>vapor</b> is considered when pressure is less than <b>vapor</b> pressure of water at the ambient temperature.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vapor</b> {{pressure}} here {{differs from}} the meteorological definition of <b>vapor</b> pressure, which describes the partial pressure {{of water in the}} atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. <b>Vapor</b> pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the <b>vapor</b> pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) <b>vapor</b> pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Hybrid physical-chemical <b>vapor</b> {{deposition}} (HPCVD) is a thin-film deposition technique, {{that combines}} physical <b>vapor</b> deposition (PVD) with chemical <b>vapor</b> deposition (CVD).|$|R
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil <b>vapors</b> can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Mixing monosodium {{phosphate}} (NaH2PO4) {{with a solution}} of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO4·0.5H2O), and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide <b>vapors</b> at 1400°C {{for a few minutes}} results in a black actinium sulfide Ac2S3. It may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000°C.|$|E
5|$|On October 30, 1970, {{less than}} two months after introduction, 26,000 Pintos were {{recalled}} to address a possible problem with the accelerator sticking on once engaged at more than halfway. On March 29, 1971, Ford recalled 220,000 Pintos, all Pintos manufactured prior to March 19, 1971, to address a possible problem with fuel <b>vapors</b> in the engine air filter igniting by a backfire through the carburetor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vapor</b> {{pressure}} or equilibrium <b>vapor</b> pressure {{is defined as}} the pressure exerted by a <b>vapor</b> in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases (solid or liquid) at a given temperature in a closed system. The equilibrium <b>vapor</b> pressure is an indication of a liquid's evaporation rate. It relates to the tendency of particles to escape from the liquid (or a solid). A substance with a high <b>vapor</b> pressure at normal temperatures {{is often referred to as}} volatile. The pressure exhibited by <b>vapor</b> present above a liquid surface is known as <b>vapor</b> pressure. As the temperature of a liquid increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also increases. As the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, the number of molecules transitioning into a <b>vapor</b> also increases, thereby increasing the <b>vapor</b> pressure.|$|R
3000|$|... 0, wavelength, {{and optical}} {{properties}} of <b>vapor</b> (pressure and temperature of <b>vapor)</b> can open new options for optical detection {{of the moment}} of <b>vapor</b> shell formation and investigation of the initial stage of its dynamics with small thickness of <b>vapor</b> shell.|$|R
50|$|Since {{compression}} of the <b>vapor</b> increases both {{the pressure and}} temperature of the <b>vapor,</b> {{it is possible to}} use the latent heat rejected during condensation to generate additional <b>vapor.</b> The effect of compressing water <b>vapor</b> can be done by two methods.|$|R
5|$|The NFPA 704 {{standard}} rates {{compressed oxygen}} gas as nonhazardous to health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated liquid oxygen (LOX) {{is given a}} health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed <b>vapors,</b> and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings {{are the same as}} the compressed gas form.|$|E
5|$|The {{media of}} these devices were {{crystals}} with transition metal ion impurities, absorbing low-energy light and re-emitting it in the visible range. By the 1970s, atomic <b>vapors</b> were used in atomic vapor quantum counters for detection of infrared electromagnetic radiation, as they {{were found to be}} superior to the metallic salts and crystals that had been used.|$|E
5|$|Titanium of {{very high}} purity was made in small {{quantities}} when Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer discovered the iodide, or crystal bar, process in 1925, by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed <b>vapors</b> over a hot filament to pure metal.|$|E
40|$|A {{temperature}} controllable {{heat pipe}} switching device is reported. It includes separate evaporating and condensing chambers interconnected by separate <b>vapor</b> flow and liquid return conduits. The <b>vapor</b> flow conduit can be opened or {{closed to the}} flow of <b>vapor,</b> whereas the liquid return conduit blocks <b>vapor</b> flow at all times. When the <b>vapor</b> flow path is open, the device has high thermal conductivity, and when the <b>vapor</b> flow path is blocked the device has low thermal conductivity...|$|R
50|$|The Knudsen cell is used {{to measure}} the <b>vapor</b> {{pressures}} of a solid with very low <b>vapor</b> pressure. Such a solid forms a <b>vapor</b> at low pressure by sublimation. The <b>vapor</b> slowly effuses through the pinhole, and the loss of mass is proportional to the <b>vapor</b> pressure and can be used to determine this pressure. The heat of sublimation can also be determined by measuring the <b>vapor</b> pressure as a function of temperature, using the Clausius-Clapeyron relation.|$|R
50|$|Moisture <b>vapor</b> {{transmission}} rate (MVTR), also water <b>vapor</b> {{transmission rate}} (WVTR), {{is a measure}} of the passage of water <b>vapor</b> through a substance.|$|R
5|$|Actinium trifluoride can be {{produced}} either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride <b>vapors</b> at 700°C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000°C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800°C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off <b>vapors</b> that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|Due to the stuffy {{atmosphere}} and <b>vapors</b> {{in the dark}} and cramped hold, Pym becomes increasingly comatose and delirious over the days. He can't communicate with Augustus, and the promised supplies fail to arrive, so Pym runs out of water. In the course of his ordeal, he discovers a letter written in blood attached to his dog Tiger, warning Pym to remain hidden, as his life depends on it.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vapor</b> {{recovery}} {{units are}} also becoming {{commonly used in}} {{the oil and gas}} industry as a means of recovering natural gas <b>vapor</b> and making it a usable and profitable product. Specifically a newer form of <b>vapor</b> recovery technology, Ejector <b>Vapor</b> Recovery Units create a closed loop system which not only recovers valuable <b>vapor,</b> but also reduces methane and VOC emissions.|$|R
40|$|Many {{architects and}} {{engineers}} re-quire {{the use of}} a <b>vapor</b> barrier under concrete slabs. Even though {{the use of a}} <b>vapor</b> barrier might be com-mon, the specified location of the va-por barrier varies. Some specifiers re-quire a sand layer or a crushed base over the <b>vapor</b> barrier. Others insist that the <b>vapor</b> barrier be placed direct-ly under the slab. Specifiers must care-fully consider the effect of the location of the <b>vapor</b> barrier on the perfor-mance of the concrete slab. Why use <b>vapor</b> barriers? <b>Vapor</b> barriers are traditionally specified to minimize moisture in-flow through concrete that’s in con-tact with water or water <b>vapor</b> from a high water table. <b>Vapor</b> barriers are used to protect floor coverings or electronic equipment that might be damaged from moisture moving up-ward through the concrete slab.
