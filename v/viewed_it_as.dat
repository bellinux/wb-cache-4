Jackson <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a moral issue where the Mayor did not appropriately condemn immoral activity, which in her eyes encourages similar behavior.

5|$|The {{album was}} not {{promoted}} well, no radio singles were issued, {{and it did}} not chart. Despite no commercial and sales success, Soul Food Taqueria was mostly well received by music critics, who commended its diverse style, production quality, and <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a progression for Guerrero from his 2000 album A Little Bit of Somethin.|$|E

5|$|The film premiered on June 19, 1998, in the United States, and {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from critics.

A sequel, entitled , was released ten years later.|$|E
5|$|Coltrane for Lovers {{was issued}} 33 years after Coltrane's death and nearly 40 {{years after the}} {{original}} recording dates. The album peaked at number 5 on the Top Jazz Albums chart and received generally positive reviews from most music critics, despite some criticism from writers who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a cash-in compilation from the release's label. The album was later compiled, along with other For Lovers titles, onto the box set The Complete Verve for Lovers Collection.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a period}} of {{personal}} and legal troubles with drug addiction, Gil Scott-Heron recorded and released his first album of original material in sixteen years, I'm New Here (2010), {{with the assistance of}} XL Recordings-label head Richard Russell. Produced by Russell, the album served as a departure from Scott-Heron's earlier work, both musically and thematically, eschewing its soul, jazz, and funk styles and social commentary for more personal, reflective lyrics with ruminations on love, loss, and identity, set to contemporary electronic music. It was well received by fans and music critics, who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a comeback for Scott-Heron.|$|E

5|$|Here I Stand {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{a sign of}} growth and maturity from Usher, although others were unimpressed by the change in style from his 2004 album Confessions. It debuted atop the Billboard 200, and sold 433,000 copies in the US in its first week of release, and has since sold 1.3million copies in that country. The album also reached {{number one on the}} Canadian Albums Chart, UK Albums Chart and Australian Albums Chart, and has sold five million units worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E
5|$|Louise {{inspired}} {{the establishment of}} a conservative women's organization known as Königin-Luise-Bund, often shortened to Luisenbund ("Queen Louise League") in which her person achieved an almost cult-like status. The group's main purpose was to promote patriotic feelings among German women, and it emphasized the family and German morality. The Königin-Luise-Bund was active {{during the time of the}} Weimar Republic and the first years of the Third Reich. Despite having actively supported the National Socialist movement since its early stages all through their accession to power in 1933, the Queen Louise League was nonetheless disbanded by the Nazis in 1934, as they <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a hostile organization.|$|E

It was met with {{widespread}} acclaim from critics, some of whom <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Nas' best record since his 1994 debut album Illmatic. A second volume of previously unreleased songs was planned before Nas had signed with Def Jam Recordings in 2006, but the project was delayed and eventually abandoned because of issues with his record label.|$|E
5|$|The Great Silences soundtrack was {{composed}} by Ennio Morricone, Corbucci's frequent musical collaborator since Navajo Joe, and conducted by Bruno Nicolai. A melancholic, emotive score, Morricone personally <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> his best Spaghetti Western soundtrack {{aside from his}} compositions for Sergio Leone. The soundtrack was released on CD, also containing five tracks from Morricone's score for That Splendid November, in 1995, 2005 and 2014. A limited edition LP (consisting of 500 copies) was released by Dagored in April 2016.|$|E

Each had mixed feelings about whether {{there would be a}} series commission after the poor reception of the pilot; Ripley did not stop thinking about it, in contrast to Bathurst, who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> just another failed pilot he had done.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the 2014 live-action film was generally negative among Japanese and Western film critics, especially following the film’s showing at LA EigaFest. Areas frequently targeted for criticism were Ryuhei Kitamura's direction, the film’s supporting characters, screenplay, cinematography and editing (especially in the action scenes), costume design and soundtrack. The film was also criticized for having most of the its dialogue performed in English (resulting in poor delivery and intonation of numerous lines by its Asian cast members), and for overall squandering its potential as an adaptation of Monkey Punch’s manga. Shun Oguri, Tetsuji Tamayama, Gō Ayano, Meisa Kuroki and Tadanobu Asano were, however, frequently seen as well-cast in their respective roles. Audience opinions were mixed, with some viewing the film as “an enjoyable time to be had to the whole family”, while others <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> part of a “terrible live-action adaptation trend {{that has been going}} on through the years”.|$|E
5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{was among}} several authors {{who wrote about}} Florida {{following}} the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something {{that may have been}} allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a fitting Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of India has {{hundreds}} of languages. During the British Raj, English was the official language. When the Indian Independence Movement gained {{momentum in the}} early part of the 20th century, efforts were undertaken to make Hindustani as a common language to unite various linguistic groups against the British Government. As early as 1918, Mahatma Gandhi established the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha (Institution for the Propagation of Hindi in South India). In 1925, the Indian National Congress switched to Hindustani from English for conducting its proceedings. Both Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were supporters of Hindustani and Congress wanted to propagate the learning of Hindustani in non-Hindi speaking Provinces of India. The idea of making Hindustani or Hindi the common language, was not acceptable to Periyar, who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an attempt to make Tamils subordinate to North Indians.|$|E
5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event. Fans {{interact}} with the film {{in a similar fashion}} to The Rocky Horror Picture Show; audience members dress up as their favorite characters, throw plastic spoons in reference to an unexplained framed photo of a spoon on a table in Johnny's living room, toss footballs to each other from short distances, and yell insulting comments {{about the quality of the}} film as well as lines from the film itself. Wiseau has claimed that it was his intent for audiences to find humor in the film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a poorly-made drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} and evolutionary origins of Calostoma were {{a matter of}} considerable historical debate. Based on various morphological features, 19th-century mycologists <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a relative of, variously, Scleroderma, Clathrus, Geastrum, or Tulostoma. The advent of molecular phylogenetics in the late 20th century confirmed that the Gasteromycetales order was polyphyletic because gasteroid fungi do not form a single clade. Efforts to use nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequencing to resolve the proper taxonomic placement of these fungi revealed that Calostoma cinnabarinum was not closely related to true puffballs, stinkhorns, most earthstars, or gasteroid agarics such as Tulostoma or Podaxis, but instead belonged within the Boletales. Further research organized a group of mostly gasteroid fungi, including Calostoma, into the newly named suborder Sclerodermatineae. This analysis confirmed that C.cinnabarinum and C.ravenelii are distinct species, and identified their closest relatives outside the genus as Gyroporus, Astraeus, and Scleroderma. A subsequent multigene (nuc-ssu, nuc-lsu, 5.8S, atp6, and mt-lsu) study redrew the Sclerodermatineae cladogram slightly, making Pisolithus the closest relatives of Calostoma.|$|E
