SAE J300 has established eleven viscosity grades, of which six are considered Winter-grades and given a W designation. The 11 viscosity grades are 0W, 5W, 10W, 15W, 20W, 25W, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60.

50|$|CMC {{is used in}} food {{under the}} E number E466 as a <b>viscosity</b> <b>modifier</b> or thickener, and to {{stabilize}} emulsions in various products including ice cream. It is also a constituent of many non-food products, such as toothpaste, laxatives, diet pills, water-based paints, detergents, textile sizing, and various paper products. It is used primarily because it has high viscosity, is nontoxic, and is {{generally considered to be}} hypoallergenic as the major source fiber is either softwood pulp or cotton linter. CMC is used extensively in gluten free and reduced fat food products. In laundry detergents, it is used as a soil suspension polymer designed to deposit onto cotton and other cellulosic fabrics, creating a negatively charged barrier to soils in the wash solution. CMC is used as a lubricant in artificial tears.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Coupling {{agents are}} used in wood plastic {{composites}} to improve interfacial adhesion between natural fibers and polymers. However, improvement in interfacial adhesion leads to increased melt viscosity, thereby affecting the processing rate. To overcome this limitation, viscosity modifiers are added. Since interface modifiers and viscosity modifiers are chemically active substances, {{there is a high}} possibility of interactions between them. To investigate this point, the effect of interactions between viscosity modifiers and an interface modifier on melt flow viscosity and mechanical properties of the composite were analyzed. The results showed that the acrylated maleated polyethylene based interface modifier interacts synergistically with the partially halogenated <b>viscosity</b> <b>modifier,</b> whereas its interaction is antagonistic with the carboxylic acid amide based <b>viscosity</b> <b>modifier.</b> KEY WORDS: wood plastic composites, interface modifiers, viscosity modifiers...|$|E

The effects of a <b>viscosity</b> <b>modifier</b> (ethylene glycol) and a polymeric additive (linear polyacrylamide) on the electrophoretic mobility of linear sugar oligomers with alpha 1 – 4 linked glucose units (maltooligosaccharides) were studied in CE using the {{activation energy}} concept. The electrophoretic separations of 8 -aminopyrene- 1, 3, 6 -trisulfonate-labeledmaltooligosaccharides were monitored by LIF detection in the temperature range of 20 – 50 °C, using either 0 – 60 % ethylene glycol (<b>viscosity</b> <b>modifier)</b> or 0 – 3 % linear polyacrylamide (polymeric additive) containing BGEs. Activation energy curves were constructed based {{on the slopes of}} the Arrhenius plots. With the use of linear polyacrylamide additive, solute size-dependent activation energy variations were found for the maltooligosaccharides with polymerization degrees below and above maltoheptaose (DP 7), probably due to molecular conformation changes and possible matrix interaction effects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{new class}} of osteoconductive and osteoinductive {{combination}} biomaterials composed of calcium phosphate cement (CPC), demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and a water-soluble <b>viscosity</b> <b>modifier</b> were prepared and characterized in-vitro and in-vivo. In previous studies, a range of combinations formulations were tested in order to compare their performance characteristic. In-vitro characterization {{results show that the}} mechanical strength is decreased when the amount of DBM increases. However, DBM does not affect the CPC’s ability to set hard and convert to nanocrystalline apatitic calcium phosphate, which shares the chemical structure of natural bone as seen in x-ray diffraction. It is known that the DBM alone is osteoinductive. In-vivo osteoinductivity testing of the formulations in an intramuscular, athymic rat model demonstrated that the combination material is also osteoinductive.

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{for increasing the}} service life of concrete structures is evaluated {{in a series of}} mortar specimens. The {{new approach}} consists of employing nanoscale viscosity modifiers to increase the viscosity of the concrete pore solution and concurrently and proportionally decrease the diffusion rates of deleterious ions such as chlorides and sulfates. In part I of this series, viscosities of bulk solutions of the admixtures in water and electrical conductivities of admixture solutions also containing potassium chloride were examined to verify the viability of this new technology. In the current paper, these studies are extended to quantifying the performance of one of these admixtures in mortars by measuring the penetration depth of chloride ions in cylindrical specimens exposed to a 1 mol/L chloride ion solution for up to one year. While significant reductions in the one-year penetration depth are produced when the <b>viscosity</b> <b>modifier</b> is utilized via conventional addition to the mixing water, the best performance is achieved when a solution of the <b>viscosity</b> <b>modifier</b> is utilized to pre-wet fine lightweight aggregates that are then added to the mortar mixture.

30|$|In {{high-temperature}} drilling conditions (120 and 225  °C in some cases), the oil-based {{drilling fluids}} are favored because of better thermal stability and being less affected by contaminants {{which results in}} faster drilling. Oil-based drilling fluids are composed of oil as the continuous phase and water as the dispersed phase in conjunction with emulsifiers, <b>viscosity</b> <b>modifiers,</b> weighting materials, and wetting agents. Organophilic clays and barite are common <b>viscosity</b> <b>modifiers</b> and weighting material, respectively. In deep drilling, due to high temperatures, polymeric surfactants degrade and phase separation occur; therefore, an emulsifier tolerant of high temperatures is needed (Coussot et al. 2004; Shah et al. 2010; Agarwal et al. 2013). Also, the current trend in the drilling fluid development is {{to come up with}} novel environmentally friendly drilling fluids that will rival oil-based drilling fluids in terms of low toxicity level, performance, efficiency, and cost (Hossain and Al-Majed 2015). Therefore, nanosilica, nanographene, and other nano-based materials have been proposed for use as alternative drilling fluid additives. Nanomaterials in drilling fluid systems are expected to reduce the total solids and/or chemical content of such drilling fluid systems and hence to reduce the overall cost of drilling fluid system development (Hossain and Al-Majed 2015).|$|R
