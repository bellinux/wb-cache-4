5|$|Fortuyn's {{political}} heritage scattered {{among various}} politicians, {{many of which}} were not successful. These include Marco Pastors, leader of the One NL, and Hilbrand Nawijn, leader of the Party for the Netherlandsâ€”none of which managed to win a seat in the 2006 election. More importantly however, the party had been squeezed out by the tougher line on immigration issues by mainstream politicians such as Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita <b>Verdonk,</b> who largely adopted Fortuyn's policies. By the end of the decade, former LPF supporters had mostly moved to support Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV).|$|E
25|$|In parliament, Hirsi Ali had {{supported}} the way <b>Verdonk</b> handled the Pasic case, although privately {{she felt that}} Pasic should {{have been allowed to}} stay. On the night before the debate, she phoned <b>Verdonk</b> to tell her that she had lied when she applied for asylum in the Netherlands, just as Pasic had. She said that <b>Verdonk</b> responded that if she had been minister at that time, she would have had Hirsi Ali deported.|$|E
25|$|On June 27, 2006 <b>Verdonk</b> {{informed}} parliament of {{her decision}} to allow MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali to keep her Dutch passport. According to <b>Verdonk,</b> Hirsi Ali had presented her with new convincing evidence related to her use of her grandfather's surname, and the false date of birth was insufficient grounds to cancel her passport. The next day, during a parliamentary debate took place, minister <b>Verdonk</b> and prime-minister Jan Peter Balkenende were questioned about the decision. At {{the end of the}} first period of the debate, the prime minister said that Hirsi Ali had to sign a letter accepting responsibility for her false statements in order to retain her citizenship. Otherwise, the solution would not be acceptable for minister <b>Verdonk.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Verdonk's</b> {{attitudes toward}} {{immigrants}} were {{again in the}} spotlight after her treatment of the crisis around the naturalisation of Dutch MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali caused the cabinet to fall.|$|R
25|$|<b>Verdonk's</b> {{expulsion}} {{policies were}} criticised in the TV series, 26,000 gezichten (26,000 faces), {{in which the}} personal lives {{of many of these}} people were shown, in hopes that public opinion would change when viewers saw that these 26,000 were mostly ordinary, friendly people.|$|R
25|$|According to {{opinion polls}} {{published}} on December 6, 2009, <b>Verdonk's</b> movement, Trots op NL, would win one {{seat in the}} Dutch parliament. In the 2010 elections Trots won no seat. She resigned from politics in 2011. The party has combined with another party on the right.|$|R
25|$|During her {{tenure as}} Minister for Immigration, <b>Verdonk</b> had {{specifically}} cited {{the rejection of}} those 26,000 persons {{as an example of}} her toughening of the immigration laws (see Policy below). The motion was passed with a 75-74 majority, the VVD, Prime Minister Balkenende's CDA, and the right-wing PVV and SGP parties dissenting. Both <b>Verdonk,</b> although now considered a 'caretaker', and Prime Minister Balkenende criticized the motion. There was speculation that <b>Verdonk</b> resigned for this reason. On December 3, after several meetings, the cabinet decided not to honor the motion, because an amnesty would be impossible to implement. It agreed to postpone expulsion of asylum seekers until after a special parliamentary session to be held on December 12.|$|E
25|$|Van Beek, a MP for the VVD, {{said after}} the debate {{that it would be}} almost unthinkable that if <b>Verdonk</b> resigned, the cabinet would stay intact, as one the {{coalition}} partners of the cabinet had lost its confidence in the minister. D66, feeling dissatisfied that minister <b>Verdonk</b> did not resign following the debate, withdrew its support for the cabinet. This resulted in the cabinet's fall on June 29.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006, <b>Verdonk</b> {{was elected}} 'worst politician' by her {{colleague}} members of parliament, {{in a poll}} by the current affairs television program Een Vandaag; qualified her as an 'elephant in a china cabinet' (a Dutch expression similar to the English idiom 'a bull in a china shop'), ruthless and incompetent. In a similar poll, Een Vandaag viewers ranked <b>Verdonk</b> in second place on both the 'best politician' and 'worst politician' lists.|$|E
50|$|The Second Balkenende cabinet fell prematurely on June 30, 2006 {{after the}} D66 bailed out over {{objections}} to Rita <b>Verdonk's</b> {{handling of the}} Ayaan Hirsi Ali citizenship controversy. After the 2006 Dutch general elections two {{key players in the}} 2003 formation Balkenende and Bos face of for another round in the 2006-2007 Dutch cabinet formation.|$|R
50|$|Forza! {{tried to}} {{cooperate}} with Rita <b>Verdonk's</b> Trots op Nederland but {{the differences between the}} two could not be resolved. In the Dutch municipal elections of 2010, Forza! only participated in two municipalities: Haarlemmermeer and Haarlem. In Haarlem the party won no seats, but in Haarlemmermeer won 3 seats in the town council. Forza! chairman Paul Meijer became the house leader.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{observes the}} figures of speech used in customer dissatisfaction expression. The data were taken from "Metropolis Watch" of March 01 st- March 31 st, 2007 issues of "Jawa Pos" newspaper. In "Metropolis Watch", the writers of "Metropolis Watch" deliver their dissatisfaction by using figures of speech. Therefore, the researcher wanted to reveal the types of figures of speech {{that are used in}} customer dissatisfaction expression and the types that are mostly used. The analysis follows Perrine?s and <b>Verdonk?s</b> theories. After analyzing the data, the researcher found out that there were seven types of figures of speech which were used in customer dissatisfaction expression. They were metonymy, personification, synecdoche, metaphor, hyperbole, and simile. The most-often-used figures of speech are metonymy, personification, and synecdoche. The findings show that the most-often-used figures of speech are the ones which are not well-known as figures of speech like metaphor and simile...|$|R
25|$|Following an {{additional}} debate, during which Prime Minister Balkenende said that <b>Verdonk</b> had the full {{support of the}} cabinet, a motion of no confidence was accepted by the same coalition of left-wing parties. Before the vote took place, Mark Rutte declared that should <b>Verdonk</b> resign, all VVD ministers would join her. The cabinet was in a 10-hour meeting on December 13 before deciding that all ministers would stay on and that Hirsch Ballin would take over Verdonk's responsibility for immigration. In exchange, <b>Verdonk</b> added Hirsch Ballin's justice department responsibilities over youth care, prevention and probation to her portfolio. Hirsch Ballin could execute the December 12 motion started by the PvdA, and postpone the expulsions of asylum seekers based on humanitarian grounds, such as the responsibility for under-age children, until a new cabinet was formed.|$|E
25|$|From November 2006 until September 2007, <b>Verdonk</b> {{served as}} member of {{parliament}} for the VVD in the opposition benches as the education specialist.|$|E
25|$|On May 31, 2006, <b>Verdonk</b> lost to Mark Rutte in the 2006 VVD {{leadership}} election, gaining 46% of the vote, {{less than}} the majority required.|$|E
25|$|The next Dutch general {{election}} was originally scheduled for 15 May 2007 as the parliament {{was to be}} dissolved on 2 April 2007. However, {{it was announced that}} elections would be held on 22 November 2006, as Prime Minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, offered the resignation of the cabinet on 30 June 2006 after one of the coalition partners, D66, withdrew their support from the cabinet the day before over Rita <b>Verdonk's</b> treatment of the Ayaan Hirsi Ali case. A new cabinet continued for five months as a care taker cabinet until the elections. The opposition had pressed for speedy elections because they were on a winning streak. The late date for the elections probably worked to the advantage of the CDA because in those five months the economy improved and in the past the biggest coalition partner had always come out as the biggest party if the economy blooms. A major issue in the campaigns was whether this improving economy was because of or in spite of the right-wing government.|$|R
25|$|The {{focus was}} on the policy of Rita <b>Verdonk,</b> {{minister}} of immigration and integration, who had reduced the influx of immigrants and implemented mandatory integration courses for migrants.|$|E
25|$|In {{a session}} in {{parliament}} {{on the issue}} of Hirsi Ali's citizenship, <b>Verdonk</b> said that she {{had no choice but to}} revoke her passport, as it had been issued under a false name and false date of birth. Some members of parliament suggested that Verdonk's stern actions were a result of her political ambitions in the 2006 VVD leadership elections. The result of the debate was that <b>Verdonk</b> promised to have another look at the case and see if it was possible for Hirsi Ali keep her citizenship.|$|E
25|$|<b>Verdonk</b> {{strictly}} {{applied the}} Alien Integration Act of 1998 (Wet Inburgering Nieuwkomers), which {{was introduced by}} Job Cohen, the social democratic State Secretary for Justice in the Cabinet Kok II.|$|E
25|$|On February 22, 2007 <b>Verdonk</b> stood down as {{minister}} {{when the}} fourth cabinet Balkenende was installed. Her portfolios were {{taken over by}} Ella Vogelaar (integration) and Nebahat Albayrak (immigration).|$|E
25|$|The next day, <b>Verdonk</b> {{said that}} she still needed some more time to think over her {{decision}} again, but Rutte declined this, and she was formally expelled from the parliamentary faction of the VVD on 14 September 2007. In October 2007, the VVD party board gave her the option of either giving up her parliamentary seat, or face exclusion procedures from the party. <b>Verdonk</b> announced that she would leave the party but stay in Parliament. After further consideration, she announced {{the creation of a}} new political movement, Proud of the Netherlands (Trots op NL), which she launched in April 2008.|$|E
25|$|Between 1999 and 2003 she was Senior Manager / Director of the {{consulting}} firm KPMG (as of 2002, Atos KPMG Consulting). In 2002 she {{became a member of}} the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) to become more active in politics. In a 2006 article, some of Verdonk's friends and colleagues from her Nijmegen days expressed surprise at Verdonk's radical switch in political orientation after graduating in 1983. Some observed that <b>Verdonk</b> had never held outspoken left-wing ideals and criticized communist regimes; others hypothesized that it was part of a growing-up phase; a former treasurer of the BWO suspected that <b>Verdonk</b> had been a police informer all those years.|$|E
25|$|In this {{election}} {{the number two}} candidate on the VVD list, Immigration Minister Rita <b>Verdonk</b> received {{a greater number of}} preference votes (620,555) than the party's lijsttrekker Mark Rutte (553,200). This was attributed to her greater national profile.|$|E
25|$|Right-wing {{politicians}} gained {{power after}} Fortuyn's death, such as former Minister for Integration & Immigration Rita <b>Verdonk</b> and the prominent critic of Islam, Member of the House of Representatives Geert Wilders. These politicians often {{focused on the}} debate over cultural assimilation and integration.|$|E
25|$|Dutch {{nationality}} law is {{an object}} of enduring dispute, dissension and debate, since the electoral campaign of Pim Fortuyn turned immigration into a hot issue in Dutch politics. Since the assassination of Pim Fortuyn, anti-immigration politicians like Geert Wilders and Rita <b>Verdonk</b> have opposed dual citizenship.|$|E
25|$|On 30 November 2006, the new {{parliament}} was sworn in, including {{several members of}} the then demissionary cabinet. Because of the election results, this House of Representatives had a majority of parties that opposed the course of the third cabinet Balkenende on important issues. One important election issue was an amnesty for a specific group of asylum seekers. This group originally consisted of 26.000 and later 38.000 people who had been in an administrative immigration process since 2001, and many of their children were raised exclusively in the Netherlands. The Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita <b>Verdonk</b> was looking into each of these dossiers to assess their future: either expulsion or permanent residence. On 1 December, the new House of Representatives adopted a motion to suspend all expulsions of asylum seekers from this group until a final decision on a general amnesty was made. Balkenende reacted annoyed as he stated that this ad hoc left-wing coalition (including PvdA and SP) was not a good basis for negotiations for a stable government. On 5 December, the cabinet declared not to execute this motion for three reasons: first, it claimed that a parliament which deals with a care taker cabinet cannot demand that cabinet to implement new policies; second, it argued that a general amnesty would attract more asylum seeker; third, it raised several questions on what specific groups of asylum seekers should be amnestied and what the legal consequences would be for other groups not included in the amnesty. Minister <b>Verdonk</b> did announce that the expulsion would be suspended until the next parliamentary debate. A majority in the House of Representatives now proposed to stop the expulsion of asylum seekers until formation talks for a new government were finished, and to allow the formation talks to solve this issue. Again, the cabinet refused to execute this motion. On 13 December, the House of Representatives decided to respond to this unwillingness by a motion of no confidence specifically oriented at Minister <b>Verdonk.</b> The leader of the VVD, Mark Rutte announced that if Minister <b>Verdonk</b> would be forced to leave the cabinet all VVD ministers would leave: leaving only seven CDA ministers in the cabinet. On 14 December, the cabinet held a meeting on how to respond to this motion: the cabinet found a solution in a portfolio reshuffle between <b>Verdonk</b> and Ernst Hirsch Balin, the Minister of Justice, who became responsible for immigration, while <b>Verdonk</b> became responsible for youth criminality. Hirsh Balin could then partially execute the House of Representatives motion calling for a temporary halt to expulsions, while the VVD could voice its opposition to this decision, breaking the principle that cabinets speak with one voice.|$|E
25|$|Although she {{publicly}} {{supported the}} policy of VVD minister Rita <b>Verdonk</b> to limit immigration, privately she was not supportive, as she explained in a June 2006 interview for Opzij. This was given after she resigned from Parliament and shortly after she {{had moved to the}} United States of America.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 2007 NRC Handelsblad {{profiled}} <b>Verdonk</b> (caption: The Netherlands at my feet), {{observing that}} her election-campaign team was not resolved. It {{said that she}} was still determined to grab the VVD leadership, possibly right after the March provincial 2007 elections, in the event that her opponent Rutte again performed poorly.|$|E
25|$|In October 2005 it was {{discovered}} that civil servants of the Immigration & Naturalisation Services had informed the Congolese embassy and authorities that several of the people sent back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo had applied for asylum in the Netherlands. The Congo had long been struggling with civil war. This information is considered confidential and should not have been disclosed to the Congolese authorities. <b>Verdonk</b> at first denied any wrongdoing, but later admitted that she had lied. In several cases, the Congolese embassy had been informed that several returnees had applied for asylum in the Netherlands. According to members of the opposition, this information could put returnees (in this case to Congo) at risk of torture or other oppression, but no party or organization provided documentation for the claim. <b>Verdonk</b> maintains that no other sensitive information was given to the Congolese authorities, in accordance with the findings of a special committee (Commissie Havermans).|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} period of the debate, a vote of no {{confidence}} was proposed by the Green Party GroenLinks. It {{was supported by the}} Balkenende cabinet coalition partner, Democrats 66 (D66). The vote did not meet the required majority as it was opposed by the right-wing populist LPF. Because a coalition partner supported the motiona unique situation in Dutch politicsthe Balkenende cabinet had to decide if this had consequences for Rita <b>Verdonk</b> as minister, and the second Balkenende cabinet.|$|E
25|$|On 30 June 2006 D66, the {{smallest}} coalition party, withdrew {{its support of}} the government over the way immigration minister Rita <b>Verdonk</b> had handled the crisis around the naturalization of Dutch MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Balkenende resigned {{for the second time}} as Prime Minister, announced early elections and presented his third government a week later. This rump cabinet, formed of a minority coalition of CDA and VVD, stayed in office until the elections of 22 November 2006.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, {{the cabinet}} fell after D66 voted {{in favour of}} a motion of no {{confidence}} against the Minister of Immigration and Integration, Rita <b>Verdonk,</b> who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a VVD MP. A caretaker cabinet was formed by CDA and VVD, and general elections were held on 22 November 2006. In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the Socialist Party made the largest gains. The formation of a new cabinet took three months, resulting in a coalition of CDA, PvdA, and ChristianUnion.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, <b>Verdonk</b> {{considered}} returning homosexual {{asylum seekers}} to Iran because she understood {{they were no}} longer being prosecuted. The general public conception was that acts of homosexuality were still punishable by death. She noted that homosexuality in itself was not punishable by death sentence in Iran. In response to parliamentary criticism, the Minister announced on March 4 that all asylum cases involving homosexual Iranians would be assessed on an individual basis. Her proposed policy initially earned her selection for the Human Rights Watch Hall of Shame.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating in}} 1983, <b>Verdonk</b> became a trainee at the Department of Correction at the Ministry of Justice. In 1984, she was {{promoted}} to Assistant-Director at the Scheveningen Detention Centre. In 1988, she {{became a member of}} the board of the Prison 'De Schie' in Rotterdam. In 1992, she switched to the Ministry of Justice's department of Youth and Hospital Orders Institutions, where she reached the position of Vice-Director. In 1996, she was appointed as Director of the Department of State Security of the Ministry of Interior Affairs.|$|E
25|$|After the Dutch general {{election}} of 2006, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy lost seats. It became the leading Opposition party against the Cabinet Balkenende IV. <b>Verdonk</b> was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives, but after continuing disagreement with Party leader Mark Rutte, she {{was expelled from}} the parliamentary faction of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy on September 13, 2007. One month later she cancelled her membership, after a reconciliation attempt failed and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy party board initiated a procedure of exclusion.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, a cell-complex for denied {{refugees}} at Amsterdam Airport {{burned down}} after a fire had been started {{by one of}} the refugees. Eleven refugees died. Surviving refugees reported that they had to wait more than 45 minutes before being released from their cells. A man suspected of connections with terrorist organizations had escaped in the disruption. Before the fire's investigation was completed, <b>Verdonk</b> stated that prison workers adequately handled the circumstances. Subsequently, in September 2006, she granted temporary stay permits to many of the survivors of the Schiphol airport detention center fire, overriding the regular court hearing procedures.|$|E
