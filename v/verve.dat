5|$|Coltrane for Lovers is a posthumous {{compilation}} album by American {{jazz musician}} John Coltrane, released on January 23, 2001, by Impulse! Records. Its tracks were recorded during December 1961 to April 1963 at engineer Rudy Van Gelder's recording studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The {{first in the}} <b>Verve</b> for Lovers series by <b>Verve</b> Records, the album contains eleven of Coltrane's romantic ballads recorded during his early years with Impulse! Records. The songs feature Coltrane's classic quartet and collaborations with vocalist Johnny Hartman and pianist Duke Ellington.|$|E
5|$|Soon after recording, Dolph sent an acetate disc of the {{recordings}} to Columbia {{in an attempt}} to interest them in distributing the album, but they declined, as did Atlantic Records and Elektra Records—according to Morrison, Atlantic objected to the references to drugs in Reed's songs while Elektra disliked Cale's viola. Eventually, the MGM Records-owned <b>Verve</b> Records accepted {{the recordings}} with the help of <b>Verve</b> staff producer Tom Wilson, who had recently moved from a job at Columbia.|$|E

5|$|The Velvet Underground & Nico is {{the debut}} album by American rock band the Velvet Underground, {{released}} in March 1967 by <b>Verve</b> Records.

40|$|The Miltogramminae of the Neotropical Region are low {{in species}} diversity, with no endemic genera (Pape 1996). However, {{the actual number of}} Neotropical species in this {{subfamily}} is expected to be higher according to the few comprehensive taxonomic revisions (e. g., Pape 1987 a, 1989). The genus Macronychia Rondani contains about 20 species in the world, of which four occur in the Neotropical Region: M. aurifrons Hall, M. auromaculata (Townsend), M. lopesi <b>Verves</b> and M. ornata (Townsend) (<b>Verves</b> & Richet 2009). Recently, Macronychia was divided into three subgenera, according to the morphology of male and female genitalia: in males of Macronychia s. str., the apical parts of the cerci are broad in dorsal view and close together, the epiphallus is elongate, the basiphallus is long and curved and the postgonite is s-shaped, whereas in females the ovipositor is modified to form an elongate, spine-like piercer; males of Moschusa Robineau-Desvoidy possess distinctly separate cercal prongs, an elongate epiphallus and the postgonite is hook-shaped, and females have a short and nonpiercing ovipositor; in males of Thomaspapeia <b>Verves</b> & Khrokalo (a subgenus with a single species in the Oriental Region), the cerci are very broad and apically truncated, the epiphallus is not developed and the postgonite is slightly s-shaped (<b>Verves</b> 1983; <b>Verves</b> & Khrokalo 2006). Species of Macronychia are either kleptoparasites, with larvae usually developing in stem and stalk nests of sphecid and eumenid wasps, rarely in terrestrial nests of sphecids, bumblebees, and solitary bees (<b>Verves</b> & Khrokalo 2006), o...|$|R

American Pharoah was the 3–5 morning line favorite in an eight-horse field that included Tale of <b>Verve,</b> as well as five rivals from the Kentucky Derby who had skipped the Preakness, and one horse, Madefromlucky, who had not run either of the previous Triple Crown races, but, like Tonalist the year prior, had instead won the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park. American Pharoah had previously defeated every horse entered, but he was also the only horse to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown and had run four races in the preceding eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew {{with the}} concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a {{movement}} began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were not really part of the Britpop scene, included The <b>Verve</b> and Radiohead. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead - although having achieved moderate recognition with The Bends in 1995 - achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).|$|E

5|$|Industrial Zen is {{a studio}} album {{recorded}} by English jazz musician John McLaughlin in 2006. It {{was released on}} 22 May 2006 by <b>Verve</b> Records as a compact disc.

He collaborated with various musicians for the project, such as vocalist Shankar Mahadevan, saxophonist Bill Evans, and tabla player Zakir Hussain. A jazz fusion and electric jazz album, Industrial Zen features the use of several instruments, including drums, keyboards, the electric bass, and the tabla.

Think Tank was yet another UK number one and managed Blur's highest US position of number 56. It was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards.

5|$|In a long {{article in}} Le Figaro in July 1856, Offenbach traced {{the history of}} comic opera. He {{declared}} that the first work worthy to be called opéra-comique was Philidor's 1759 Blaise le savetier, and he described the gradual divergence of Italian and French notions of comic opera, with <b>verve,</b> imagination and gaiety from Italian composers, and cleverness, common sense, good taste and wit from the French composers. He concluded that comic opera had become too grand and inflated. His disquisition was a preliminary to the announcement of an open competition for aspiring composers. A jury of French composers and playwrights including Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, Charles Gounod and Eugène Scribe considered 78 entries; the five short-listed entrants were all asked to set a libretto, Le docteur miracle, written by Ludovic Halévy and Léon Battu. The joint winners were Georges Bizet and Charles Lecocq. Bizet became, and remained, a devoted friend of Offenbach. Lecocq and Offenbach took a dislike to one another, and their subsequent rivalry was not altogether friendly.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s the Elephant 6 collective, {{including}} {{acts like}} The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and of Montreal, produced eclectic psychedelic rock and folk. Other alternative acts to pursue psychedelia from the 1990s included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols, Kula Shaker and Super Furry Animals. Stoner rock also emerged, combining elements of psychedelic rock, blues-rock and doom metal. Typically using a slow-to-mid tempo and featuring low-tuned guitars in a bass-heavy sound, with melodic vocals, and 'retro' production, it was pioneered by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. In the UK the Madchester scene influenced the early sound of 1990s Britpop bands like Blur. The <b>Verve</b> mixed on 1960s psychedelia with the shoegazing aesthetic. Oasis also drew on 1960s psychedelic pop and rock. In the immediate post-Britpop era Kula Shaker incorporated swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-'60s psychedelia with Indian mysticism and spirituality. In {{the new millennium}} neo-psychedelia was continued by bands directly emulating {{the sounds of the}} 60s such as The Black Angels, Tame Impala, Pond, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and The Essex Green, while bands like Animal Collective and The Bright Light Social Hour applied an experimental approach that combined genres from the 1960s and the present.M.
