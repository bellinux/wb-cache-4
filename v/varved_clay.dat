A detailed model is developed of the groundwater dynamics in landslides in <b>varved</b> <b>clays</b> in the Trièves area in the French Alps. The <b>varved</b> <b>clays</b> consist of a sequence of alternating silt and clay layers, covered by a colluvium layer and cut through by fissures. The hydraulic conductivity of the clay layers is negligible compared to the silt layers. It is conceptualized that fissures form a hydraulic connection between the colluvium and the <b>varved</b> <b>clays.</b> Groundwater recharge flows through the colluvium into the fissures where water is exchanged horizontally between the fissure and the silt layers of the <b>varved</b> <b>clays.</b> Groundwater flow in the colluvium is simulated with the Boussinesq equation while flow in the silt layers of the <b>varved</b> <b>clays</b> is simulated with the Richards' equation. Longitudinal outflow from the fissure is simulated with a linear-reservoir model. Scattered data of relatively short monitoring periods is available for several landslides in the region. A good similarity between observed and simulated heads is obtained, especially when considering the lack of important physical parameters such as the fissure width and the distance between the monitoring point and the fissure. A simulation for the period 1959 – 2004 showed some correlation between peaks in the simulated heads and the recorded occurrence of landslides while the bottom of the <b>varved</b> <b>clays</b> remained saturated during the entire simulation period.

Pressuremeter tests, dilatometer tests and static probes were made. The tests were performed on the study site in Piskorzec near Iłów. In this region, ice-dammed clays are present almost from the land surface reaching the thickness of about 11 m. This site is the westernmost experimental site of clays of the “Warsaw Ice-Dammed Lake” among those presented in the literature. Research and their analysis showed differences in deformability due to the test procedure in connection with the structure of <b>varved</b> <b>clays.</b> Pressuremeter test, even though it is the most time consuming and challenging among the tests performed, allows the most complete characteristics of deformability of <b>varved</b> <b>clays</b> to be obtained. Vertical profile of clays being studied appears to be fairly homogeneous in terms of mechanical properties. Nevertheless, some parts of the profile clearly differ from the average values. This indicates the rate of post sedimentary changes varied in different parts of research profile. The data obtained are consistent with the values for ice-dammed clays from Radzymin and Sochaczew areas. Comparison of the engineering properties of <b>varved</b> <b>clays</b> to other experimental sites points to their similar geological history. It confirms that the experimental sites belong to one ice-dammed lake covering the areas of the Warsaw Basin...|$|R

40|$|After {{retreat from}} the Angermünder ice margin, the Weichselian inland ice sheet fell apart into {{different}} independently acting glaciers in the eastern Uckermark. In {{the area of the}} Ucker lakes three ice margins are known, from south to north: the Zichow-Golm intermediate margin, the Gerswalde margin and the Ucker margin. This paper postulates two more ice margins: a Welse North Ice Margin and a Welse South Ice Margin. The Welse South Ice Margin is a ridge in the area south of the Welse stream and can be followed over the villages Zehnebeck - Wendemark - Passow - Herrenhof - Berkholz. The Welse South Ice Margin is seen as a possible simultaneous continuation of the Zichow-Golm ice margin. Unique drainage paths and sandur at the Zichow-Golm margin and the Welse South Ice Margin could not be found. On the other hand, the meltwater of these ice margins formed so-called ‘Bändertone’ (thinly laminated <b>clays</b> or <b>varved</b> <b>clays)</b> in the area south of Günterberg - Biesenbrow.

These deposits are made up of till, <b>varved</b> <b>clay,</b> sand, gravel and pebbles that are of glacial, marine and lacustrine origin. Some of the Quaternary deposits are valuable as they constitute aquifers or, {{as in the case of}} gravels and sands, are used as construction materials. The Quaternary deposits are the fill of valleys that are now buried. The buried valleys of Tallin are carved into older rock likely by ancient rivers to be later modified by glaciers. While the valley fill is made up of Quaternary sediments the valley themselves originated from erosion that took place before the Quaternary. The substrate into which the buried valleys were carved is made up of hard sedimentary rock of Ediacaran, Cambrian and Ordovician age. Only the upper layer of Ordovician rocks protrudes from the cover of younger deposits croping out in the Baltic Klint at the coast and at a few places inland. The Ordovician rocks are made up of from top to bottom of a thick layer of limestone and marlstone, then a first layer of argillite followed by first layer of sandstone and siltstone and then another layer of argillite also followed by sandstone and siltstone. In other places of the city hard sedimentary rock is only to be found beneath Quaternary sediments at depths reaching as much as 120 meters below sea level. Underlying the sedimentary rock are the rocks of the Fennoscandian Craton including gneisses and other metamorphic rocks with volcanic rock protoliths and rapakivi granites. The mentioned rocks are much older than the rest (Paleoproterozoic age) and do not crop out anywhere in Estonia.|$|E

Main purpose of the examinations is an investigation of internal structure of layered soil – <b>varved</b> <b>clay</b> – in relation to its strength anisotropy and evaluation of the suitability {{of the use of}} two different techniques to assess the soil structure. Investigated material have been taken from area near city of Bełchatów in central Poland.

The chronologies are based on pollen stratigraphical correlations, radiocarbon dating and, {{for two of the}} sites, on a clay-varve chronology. The stratigraphies were correlated to the GRIP event stratigraphy and their ages are expressed in calendar years BP. The pollen records compare well to the established Late Weichselian pollen stratigraphy for southern Sweden, and reflect the vegetation development from the deglaciation to the transition to the Holocene. The annual time-resolution of the <b>varved</b> <b>clays</b> has made it possible to calculate pollen accumulation rates based on actual sedimentation rates. The delayed onset of sedimentation in Torreberga implies that dead ice was present for at least 2000 years after the regional deglaciation of the area. Although the <b>clay</b> <b>varve</b> chronologies could not be absolutely dated through connections to the Swedish Time Scale, they have been assigned approximate calendar-year ages based on the pollen stratigraphies and their correlation to the GRIP event stratigraphy. These correlations made it possible to assign calendar year ages for the deglaciation of Blekinge and south-western Småland, and to discuss the deglaciation chronology for southern Sweden with enhanced accuracy. Farslycke and the northern end of Lake Bolmen were deglaciated at c. 14, 350 and at c. 14, 400 calendar (GRIP) years BP, respectively.

The <b>varved</b> <b>clay</b> complex is locally interrupted by a massive silty-clay unit, interpreted as an ice-drift material during the stagnation of the glacier margin at the Pandivere–Neva line.

Over the past 20 – 30 years, researches on magnetic anisotropy gained widespread use and were extended to examine the fabric in a variety of sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks (e. g., see reviews by Jackson, 1991; Jackson and Tauxe, 1991; Rochette et al., 1992; Tarling and Hrouda, 1993; Borradaile and Henry, 1997; Borradaile, 2001; Borradaile and Jackson, 2004; Tauxe, 2005; Lanza and Meloni, 2006; Hrouda, 2007). Presently, the study of the magnetic anisotropy of rocks {{is still one of the}} most promising research issues in the field of rock magnetism...|$|R
40|$|Slow-moving {{landslides}} show complex {{mechanical and}} fluid interactions. They show among others non linear intrinsic viscosity of the shear zone, undrained loading effects and {{the generation of}} excess pore water pressure. The parameterization of hydrological and geomechanical factors by field and laboratory tests to describe the movement pattern of these landslides is difficult. It {{is a challenge to}} simulate accurately the de- and acceleration of these landslides and particularly, to forecast catastrophic surges. In this paper the relation between groundwater fluctuation and landslide velocity for two deep-seated landslides of the Trièves Plateau (the Monestier-du-Percy landslide and the Saint-Guillaume landslide) is analysed. Inclinometer measurements, showing the displacement in depth after 1 – 2 months periods, showed on both landslides shear band deformation within 1 m. At the Monestier-du-Percy landslide, depending on the position, the shear band depths vary between 25. 0 m and 10. 0 m. At the Saint-Guillaume landslide, the inclinometers detected several slip surfaces inside the clays, at respectively 37. 0 m, 34. 5 m, and 14. 0 m depth. Two simple geomechanical models are developed to describe these displacements in depth in relation to measured groundwater fluctuations. Calibration of the models using the friction angle delivered no constant values for different measuring periods. It appeared that calibrated (apparent) friction values increase with increasing groundwater levels. The paper discusses the possibility of the generation of negative excess pore water pressures as a feed back mechanism, which may explain the complex displacement pattern of these landslides developed in <b>varved</b> <b>clays...</b>|$|R
