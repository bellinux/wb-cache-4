40|$|We {{describe}} ELROS, an embedded {{language for}} programming distributed applications using remote operations (ISO 9072 - 1 and 9072 - 2). The motivation {{for this work}} {{is the development of}} both large scale scien - tific distributed applications as well as ISO application protocol implementations. We compare our work with other systems, such as ISODE and DAS, that support remote operations programming and point out certain advantages of ELROS. Finally, we suggest ways in which the current implementation of ELROS can be improved. 1. INTRODUCTION Given the ubiquity of networking in modern computing, it is somewhat surprising that there are few distributed applications in production. By distributed application we do not mean networking applications that require constant human involvement, {{such as the use of}} file transfer facilities (e. g., FTAM, FTP), <b>virtual</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>services</b> (e. g., VT, TELNET), or electronic mail (e. g., X. 400, SMTP). Rather, we mean a set of cooperating, communicating processes [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The V {{system was}} used for {{graphical}} user interface research. The <b>Virtual</b> Graphics <b>Terminal</b> <b>Service</b> (VGTS) provided a modular windowing system for both local and remote applications. The little-known W Window System got its name because it was first hosted on the V operating system, and the better-known X Window System in turn got its name because its first version was based partly on W. V also spawned another pure microkernel effort at Apple Computer known as Vanguard, which added a number of improvements to the basic system. Vanguard later disappeared in a reorganization. The Tektronix VM700 television measurement instrument was developed in a networked V environment in the late 1980s and ran a lightly {{modified version of the}} V operating system; this device was manufactured and sold for many years.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} discloses {{a method}} for pre-authentication and pre-configuration, and a system thereof. The system for pre-authentication and pre-configuration comprises a current access point and a candidate access point located in different subnets, and also comprises a first <b>virtual</b> <b>terminal</b> located in the current access point and a second <b>virtual</b> <b>terminal</b> located in the candidate access point, the first <b>virtual</b> <b>terminal</b> and the second <b>virtual</b> <b>terminal</b> communicating through an User Datagram Protocol (UDP) channel. The system also comprises a candidate access point which belongs to a different domain with the current access point, a third <b>virtual</b> <b>terminal</b> located in the candidate access point, a first virtual server in a same domain with the current access point and a third virtual server in the same domain with the candidate access point, the first <b>virtual</b> <b>terminal,</b> the first <b>virtual</b> server, the third <b>virtual</b> <b>terminal</b> and the third virtual server {{communicate with each other}} through the UDP channel. Through using <b>virtual</b> <b>terminals</b> and/or <b>virtual</b> server to send information related to the pre-authentication and the pre-configuration in the UDP layer, the method enables switches among different subnets in the same domain, and even among different domains. 本发明公开了一种预认证和预配置方法及其系统。用于预认证和预配置的系统包括位于不同子网的当前接入点和候选接入点，还包括位于当前接入点的第一虚拟终端和位于候选接入点的第二虚拟终端；第一虚拟终端和第二虚拟终端间通过UDP通道进行通信。该系统还包括与当前接入点属于不同网域的候选接入点，以及位于候选接入点的第三虚拟终端、与当前接入点同一网域的第一虚拟服务器以及与候选接入点同一网域的第三虚拟服务器；第一虚拟终端、第一虚拟服务器、第三虚拟终端和第三虚拟服务器间通过UDP通道进行通信。本发明通过使用虚拟终端和/或虚拟服务器在UDP层发送与预认证和预配置相关的信息，能够快速在同一网域的不同子网间甚至不同网域间进行切换。Department of ComputingInventor name used in this publication: 肖鑫Inventor name used in this publication: 曹建农Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種預認證和預配置方法及其系統Chin...|$|R
40|$|ISO 11783 是一种全新的农业森林机械总线标准,虚拟终端(VirtualTerminal) 是它的一个重要组成部分。为了使国产农机向数字化、信息化方向发展,使人们能利用网络中的终端去访问网络中各种农具的相关信息,和农具之间进行交互,ISO 11783 标准的虚拟终端部分(ISO 11783 - 6) 提供了这种可能性,虚拟终端能够利用低层提供的信息,实现面向终端的通信服务。因此,本文设计并实现了符合ISO 11783 标准的虚拟终端协议的虚拟终端原型,并通过试验结果表明所实现的虚拟终端完全具备了协议里所规定的虚拟终端的所有功能,这将为今后国产农机的数字化、信息化提供一条切实可行的途径。ISO 11783 is {{a brand-new}} {{agricultural}} and forest mechanical bus standard, and <b>Virtual</b> <b>Terminal</b> {{is one of}} its important constituent. In order to make the home-made agriculture machines develop to the direction of digitization and informatization and enable people to use the terminal to visit the related information of each kind of agriculture implement in the network and interact with the agriculture implement, <b>Virtual</b> <b>Terminal</b> protocol in the ISO 11783 standard (ISO 11783 - 6) has provided this possibility. <b>Virtual</b> <b>Terminal</b> can utilize the information of the lower layers to realize terminal-oriented communication service. This paper designs and realizes the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Terminal</b> prototype that conforms to the ISO 11783 <b>virtual</b> <b>Terminal</b> protocol, and the test result shows that the designed <b>Virtual</b> <b>Terminal</b> achieves the basic function specified in the protocol, which provides a feasible approach for the digitization and informatization of the home-made agriculture machines...|$|R

On each <b>virtual</b> <b>terminal,</b> a getty process is run, which in turn runs /bin/login to authenticate a user. After authentication, a command shell will be run. <b>Virtual</b> <b>terminals,</b> like the console, are supported at the Linux kernel level.|$|R

40|$|Automation in {{maritime}} container terminals is gaining momentum as the advantages {{in terms of}} total life cycle costs have become apparent in western countries. However, expertise and experience in the design, development and operation of automated terminals is still limited. Many stakeholders or actors {{are involved in the}} design process and the entire process is supported by a substantial amount of documents created by different actors. These actors cover a wide range of perspectives, use specific information carriers and terminology, and have their own interests while having sometimes little understanding of the interests of others. A common framework of understanding is lacking which makes the communication within the design process problematic, and could result in suboptimal designs. Currently tools like simulation and animation are used to support communication in the design process. These tools are costly to use, have long throughput times to develop and often do not have an accurate realistic representation of the design. We propose to use a 3 D visualization environment to present the design of automated <b>terminals.</b> This <b>virtual</b> environment, called the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Terminal,</b> {{can be used as a}} common framework for understanding and as a communication medium. The <b>Virtual</b> <b>Terminal</b> should overcome the disadvantages of the tools that are currently used. By automating the generation of 3 D environments of container terminals based on CAD drawings and by using this virtual environment as a framework to structure existing knowledge, the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Terminal</b> can support decision makers throughout the decision making process. To evaluate the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Terminal</b> a case study is presented on the design process of a state-of-the-art automated container terminal...|$|R
