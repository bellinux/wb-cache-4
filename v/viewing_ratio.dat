Method of research from this thesis is using the method of hypothesis testing, which aims {{to determine whether there}} are differences between the financial performances of a pure Islamic bank and hybrid Islamic banks around the world. This research was conducted in 2011. The data used in this study is secondary data. The secondary data used were obtained from published financial reports of pure Islamic banks and hybrid Islamic banks published financial reports around the world as well as other sources that can support the research. The data collected were analyzed using analysis hypothesis which conducted by non-parametric statistics testing, Two Independent Sample Test: Mann-Whitney U, because the data of this research are not normally distributed.

However, these metal components are usually non-black body with unknown and varied surface emissivities, plus the in-line processing environment also effects the measurement of infrared imager. Hereby, accurately measuring metal processing temperature with infrared imager becomes a challenge. In this paper, the temperature measurement formula of infrared imager is analyzed first, and next the experimental devices designed by the authors is introduced, then several influences on the temperature measurement, such as low temperature and high temperature backgrounds with high emissivity, object area / <b>viewing</b> field <b>ratio,</b> and the shooting angel, are experimentally investigated with a thermal infrared imager. The results indicate that a low temperature background with high emissivity and a small object area / <b>viewing</b> field <b>ratio,</b> {{as well as a}} shooting direction perpendicular to the measured surface, can improve the measurement accuracy.
