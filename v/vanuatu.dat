5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Ivy (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 05F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 13P) was a {{tropical}} cyclone that affected about 25% {{of the population}} of <b>Vanuatu</b> in February 2004. It was first classified as {{a tropical}} disturbance on February21 between <b>Vanuatu</b> and Fiji. The system tracked northwestward, gradually organizing and intensifying. After attaining tropical storm status on February23, Ivy strengthened more quickly as it turned southwestward toward <b>Vanuatu.</b> It attained peak winds of 165km/h (105mph) while moving over <b>Vanuatu,</b> making it an intense Category4 cyclone on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. By the time it passed through <b>Vanuatu,</b> Ivy had turned southeastward, and it gradually weakened while accelerating. After becoming extratropical on February28, it passed just east of New Zealand and eventually dissipated on March2.|$|E

5|$|After passing {{slowly through}} <b>Vanuatu,</b> Ivy began {{accelerating}} {{to the southeast}} and its eye passed {{very close to the}} capital city of Port Vila, after moving over the island of Epi. As the cyclone moved away from the island group, it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. In addition, the combination of cooler water temperatures, greater wind shear, less outflow, and land interaction with <b>Vanuatu</b> caused gradual weakening. Late on February 27, Ivy entered the area of warning responsibility of the Wellington Regional Specialized Meteorological Center. The convection rapidly diminished and left the circulation exposed, and Ivy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on February 28. It remained strong and maintained a well-defined circulation as it passed just east of East Cape, New Zealand. Continuing southeastward, the extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline on February 29, and Ivy dissipated about 1800km (1100mi) southeast of New Zealand on March 2.|$|E

5|$|The local Red Cross {{offices in}} Port Vila and Luganville {{prepared}} general relief supplies before the storm's arrival, including tents, tool kits, and first aid units.

Additionally, the evacuees were allowed to return to their homes, and communications between the various islands were restored. The Red Cross distributed various relief supplies to the affected citizens, including candles, matches, water, and blankets. By about two weeks after the storm, about 30,000household relief packages were distributed. The <b>Vanuatu</b> government allocated VT25million (2004VUV, $236,000 2004USD) for the affected citizens.
