The game features the EX gauge introduced in Street Fighter III, which builds as the player lands attacks and can be used to either power up special moves or perform super combos known as Critical Arts, although the Focus Attacks from the previous game have been removed. New to this game is the [...] "V-Gauge", which builds as the player receives attacks and adds three new techniques: V-Skills, V-Reversals, and V-Triggers. V-Skills are special attacks unique to each fighter; for example, Ryu can parry an attack while M. Bison can reflect projectiles, some of which build <b>V-Gauge</b> when successfully performed. V-Reversals allow players to use a section of the <b>V-Gauge</b> to perform a counter move whilst being attacked. Finally, V-Triggers use the entire <b>V-Gauge</b> to allow the player to perform a unique ability, such as a temporary damage boost for Ryu's energy balls or added hits to Chun-Li's attacks. Additionally, the Stun Meter, which has been present since Street Fighter III, is made visible under the health bars in this game. The Stun Meter increases when receiving consecutive attacks and will cause the player to become stunned if filled; thus, it encourages players to play offensively when the opponent's Meter is close to full. The game also features an interactive arena, showcasing special animations when a player is defeated {{at the edge of the}} arena.|$|E
40|$|Let A be {{a central}} simple algebra with {{involution}} sigma of first or second kind. Let v be a valuation on the sigma-fixed part F of Z(A). A sigma-special <b>v-gauge</b> g on A {{is a kind of}} value function on A extending v on F, such that g(sigma(x) x) = 2 g(x) for all x in A. It is shown (under certain restrictions if the residue characteristic is 2) that if v is Henselian, then there is a sigma-special <b>v-gauge</b> g if and only if sigma is anisotropic, and g is unique. If v is not Henselian, it is shown that there is a sigma-special <b>v-gauge</b> g if and only if sigma remains anisotropic after scalar extension from F to the Henselization of F re v; when this occurs, g is the unique sigma-invariant <b>v-gauge</b> on A.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{substantiate}} the applying of the Tikhonov-Samarski vector decomposition theorem (TS-theorem) to vector fields in classical electrodynamics. We {{show that the}} standard Helmholtz vector decomposition theorem does not always apply to some vector fields in classical electrodynamics. Using the TS-theorem, {{within the framework of}} the so called <b>v-gauge,</b> we show that two kinds of magnetic vector potentials exist: one of them (solenoidal) can act exclusively with the velocity of light c and another one (irrotational) with an arbitrary velocity v, however, we prove that the unique possible value of the "arbitrary" v is exclusively the velocity of light c. I. e. we show that the so called <b>v-gauge</b> has neither mathematical nor physical meaning...|$|E
40|$|The main {{purposes}} of this paper are (i) to illustrate explicitly {{by a number of}} examples the gauge functions chi(x, t) whose spatial and temporal derivatives transform one set of electromagnetic potentials into another equivalent set; and (ii) to show that, whatever propagation or non-propagation characteristics are exhibited by the potentials in a particular gauge, the electric and magnetic fields are always the same and display the experimentally verified properties of causality and propagation at the speed of light. The example of the transformation from the Lorenz gauge (retarded solutions for both scalar and vector potential) to the Coulomb gauge (instantaneous, action-at-a-distance, scalar potential) is treated in detail. A new and transparent expression is obtained for the vector potential in the Coulomb gauge, with a finite nonlocality in time replacing the expected spatial nonlocality of the transverse current. A new class of gauges (<b>v-gauge)</b> is described in which the scalar potential propagates at an arbitrary speed v relative to the speed of light. The Lorenz and Coulomb gauges are special cases of the <b>v-gauge.</b> The last examples of gauges and explicit gauge transformation functions are the Hamiltonian or temporal gauge, the nonrelativistic Poincare or multipolar gauge, and the relativistic Fock-Schwinger gauge...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{substantiate}} the applying of the Helmholtz vector decomposition theorem (H-theorem) to vector fields in classical electrodynamics. Using the H-theorem, {{within the framework}} of the two-parameter Lorentz-like gauge (so called <b>v-gauge),</b> we show that two kinds of magnetic vector potentials exist: one of them (solenoidal) can act exclusively with the velocity of light c and the other one (irrotational) with an arbitrary finite velocity $v$ (including a velocity more than c. We show also that the irrotational component of the electric field has a physical meaning and can propagate exclusively instantaneously.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove {{relationships}} between two generalizations of commutative valuation theory for noncommutative central simple algebras: (1) Dubrovin valuation rings; and (2) the value functions called gauges introduced by Tignol and Wadsworth in [TW 1] and [TW 2]. We show that if v is a valuation {{on a field}} F with associated valuation ring V and v is defectless in a central simple F-algebra A, and C is a subring of A, then the following are equivalent: (a) C is the gauge ring of some minimal <b>v-gauge</b> on A, i. e., a gauge with the minimal number of simple components of C/J(C); (b) C is integral over V with C = B_ 1 ∩ [...] . ∩ B_xi where each B_i is a Dubrovin valuation ring of A with center V, and the B_i satisfy Graeter's Intersection Property. Along the way we prove the existence of minimal gauges whenever possible and we show how gauges on simple algebras are built from gauges on central simple algebras. Comment: 51 page...|$|E
40|$|Purpose:  Rigid gas {{permeable}} (GP) {{contact lenses}} {{may provide the}} safest option for lens wear, but prescribing rates are in decline. This study investigated the effect of practitioner attitudes on GP lens prescribing. Methods:  A questionnaire was developed using a focus group and a pilot study. Questions addressed clinical time spent fitting GP lenses, specialist equipment requirements and perceived safety and comfort. With ethical approval, the questionnaire was sent to 1000 randomly selected UK registered eye care practitioners (ECPs). Results:  In general, ECPs enjoy the challenge of fitting GPs, although fitting takes longer than soft lens fitting. There is a difference in attitude between longer qualified and more recently qualified ECPs. Longer qualified ECPs more frequently reported enjoyment of the fitting challenges, recommended GP lenses to patients and {{were less likely to}} believe that GP lenses were becoming obsolete. ECPs are in strong agreement on the ocular health advantages of fitting GPs. They do not feel specialist equipment is generally needed, although some reported a topographer to be advantageous. The large majority of ECPs {{do not have access to}} the specialist equipment they perceive to be normally associated with GP fitting (radiuscope, <b>V-gauge).</b> They believe that initial fitting discomfort of GP fitting is a major drawback to their fitting, and while they feel this greatly improves with adaptation, they do not feel it reaches soft lens wear comfort.

40|$|A new {{conjecture}} {{is proposed}} {{that there are}} two sorts of matter called s-matter and v-matter which are symmetric and whose gravitational masses are opposite to each other, although both masses are positive. Therefore, there are two sorts of symmetry breaking called V-breaking and S-breaking. In the S-breaking, s-particles get their masses and form s-galaxies etc., while v-fermions and <b>v-gauge</b> bosons are still massless and form v-SU(5) singlets. There is no interaction among the v-SU(5) color-single states except gravitation so that they distribute loosely in space, cannot be observed and cause space to expand with an acceleration. When temperature increases to the critical temperature because space contracts, masses of all particles are zero so that s-particles and v-particles transform from one to another and the gravitational mass density becomes negative. Consequently, space stop to contract and inflation must occur. After reheating, space first expands with a deceleration and then expands with an acceleration up to now. There is no space-time singularity. There are the critical temperature, the highest temperature and the least scale in the universe. A formula describing distance-redshift is obtained. A huge void is not empty, and is equivalent to a huge concave lens. The densities of hydrogen in the huge voids must be much less than that predicted by the conventional theory. The gravitation between two galaxies with distance long enough will be less than that predicted by the conventional theory. A black hole with its mass and density big enough will transform into a white hole. Primordial nucleosynthesis and CMB are explained. It is possible that the universe is composed of infinite cosmic islands. The problem of energy conservation is discussed. Comment: 90 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
