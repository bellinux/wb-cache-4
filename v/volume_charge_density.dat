40|$|Student {{learning}} in upper-division physics courses {{is a growing}} area {{of research in the}} field of Physics Education. Developing effective new curricular materials and pedagogical techniques to improve student {{learning in}} upper-division courses requires knowledge of both what material students struggle with and what curricular approaches help to overcome these struggles. To facilitate the course transformation process for one specific content area [...] upper-division electrostatics [...] this thesis presents two new methodological tools: (1) an analytical framework designed to investigate students 2 ̆ 7 struggles with the advanced physics content and mathematically sophisticated tools/techniques required at the junior and senior level, and (2) a new multiple-response conceptual assessment designed to measure student learning and assess the effectiveness of different curricular approaches. We first describe the development and theoretical grounding of a new analytical framework designed to characterize how students use mathematical tools and techniques during physics problem solving. We apply this framework to investigate student difficulties with three specific mathematical tools used in upper-division electrostatics: multivariable integration in the context of Coulomb 2 ̆ 7 s law, the Dirac delta function in the context of expressing <b>volume</b> <b>charge</b> <b>densities,</b> and separation of variables as a technique to solve Laplace 2 ̆ 7 s equation. We find a number of common themes in students 2 ̆ 7 difficulties around these mathematical tools including: recognizing when a particular mathematical tool is appropriate for a given physics problem, mapping between the specific physical context and the formal mathematical structures, and reflecting spontaneously on the solution to a physics problem to gain physical insight or ensure consistency with expected results. We then describe the development of a novel, multiple-response version of an existing conceptual assessment in upper-division electrostatics courses. The goal of this new version is to provide an easily-graded electrostatics assessment that can potentially be implemented to investigate student learning on a large scale. We show that student performance on the new multiple-response version exhibits a significant degree of consistency with performance on the free-response version, and that it continues to provide significant insight into student reasoning and student difficulties. Moreover, we demonstrate that the new assessment is both valid and reliable using data from upper-division physics students at multiple institutions. Overall, the work described in this thesis represents a significant contribution to the methodological tools available to researchers and instructors interested in improving student learning at the upper-division level...|$|R
40|$|Quaternized {{carboxymethyl}} chitosan (QCMC) was intercalated {{into the}} interlayer of rectorite (REC) to prepare QCMC/REC nanocomposite. XRD and TEM {{results revealed that}} REC was well dispersed in the polymer matrix and obtained the largest interlayer distance when the mass ratio of QCMC to REC was 2 : 1. FTIR, NMR and zeta-potential analyses showed that the intercalation of QCMC did not destroy the structure of REC layer, but there were hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions between QCMC and REC. Quaternized chitosan (HTCC) /REC nanocomposite was prepared and studied in parallel. The comparative analysis of the two biopolymer/clay nanocomposites indicated that the free <b>volume</b> and positive <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> of biopolymers were important factors that affected the intercalation of biopolymer into clay. At last, thermal analysis indicated that QCMC/REC nanocomposites had obviously higher thermal stability in comparison with QCMC. This study shows that the combination with clay materials is a functional way to expand the possible application of QCMC as drug controlled-release carriers, antimicrobial agent and pulp-cap.

30|$|The {{electron}} emission from the NCF cathode is suppressed by the <b>volume</b> <b>charge,</b> which is accumulated above the cathode surface. The <b>volume</b> <b>charge</b> manifests {{itself as a}} saturation-like dependence of the emitted charge on the laser pulse energy when the applied voltage is below 100  V. However if the applied voltage is above 100  V, the emitted charge is nearly linear function of the pulse energy. The dynamics of the {{electron emission}} under femtosecond excitation involves complicated charge redistribution. In particular, repulsion from the cloud of already emitted electrons results in the partial reabsorption of the emitted electrons by the NCF [12]. One can observe from Fig.  3 that by varying the applied voltage and the laser pulse energy one can control the emitted charge from 0.03 nC (it corresponds to the emission <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> of 0.24 nC/cm 2) up to 1.6 nC (13 nC/cm 2).|$|R
40|$|Working {{parameters}} {{are very important}} {{to understand the nature of}} electrospinning. Each of these parameters can affect the fibers morphologies and by proper control of these parameters one can fabricate electrospun fibers with desired morphologies and diameters. Jet charge density is known as one of the important parameters affecting the fiber diameter. To investigate the effect of the applied voltage on jet charge density, one must investigate its effects on the jet electric current and flow rate. There are some difficulties in measuring the jet flow rate. In this work, one method is used to calculate the electrospinning jet flow rate. For exemplification, by using a polyethylene oxide (PEO) solution in water, effects of applied voltage and feed rate on jet charge density is investigated. The jet flow rate is calculated applying different voltages, at different constant feed rates. The jet flow rate is independent of the feed rate and dependent on the applied the voltage. By defining an equation for dependence of jet flow rate on current, a relation between jet <b>volume</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> and jet current can be defined. By measuring the electrospun fiber diameter, surface charge density of the jet can also be estimated. On increasing the voltage, the jet <b>volume</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> decreases whereas the jet surface charge density remains unchanged...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of ions confined within spherical dielectric cavities are examined by a splitting field-theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Three types of cavities are considered: one possessing a uniform surface charge density, {{one with a}} uniform <b>volume</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density,</b> and one containing mobile ions. In all cases, mobile counterions are present within the dielectric sphere. The splitting theory is based on dividing the electrostatic interaction into long- and short-wavelength contributions and applying different approximations on the two contributions. The splitting theory works well for the case where the dielectric constant of the confining sphere is equal to or {{less than that of}} the medium external to the sphere. Nevertheless, by extending the theory with a virial expansion, the predictions are improved. However, when the dielectric constant of the confining sphere is greater than that of the medium outside the sphere, the splitting theory performs poorly, only qualitatively agreeing with the simulation data. In this case, the strong-coupling expansion does not seem to work well, and a modified mean-field theory where the counterions interact directly with only their own image charge gives improved predictions. The splitting theory works best for the system with a uniform surface charge density and worst for the system with a uniform <b>volume</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density.</b> Increasing the number of ions within the sphere, at a fixed radius, tends to increase the ion density near the surface of the sphere and leads to a depletion region in the sphere interior; however, varying the ion number does not lead to any qualitative changes in the performance of the splitting theory...|$|E

40|$|A novel energy {{minimization}} {{formulation of}} electrostatics that allows computation of the electrostatic energy and forces to any desired accuracy {{in a system}} with arbitrary dielectric properties is presented. An integral equation for the scalar <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> is derived from an energy functional of the polarization vector field.

Arbitrary accuracy is achieved by solving the integral equation for the <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> via a series expansion {{in terms of the}} equation's kernel, which depends only on the geometry of the dielectrics. The streamlined formalism operates with <b>volume</b> <b>charge</b> distributions only, not resorting to introducing surface charges by hand.
