This text resumes the main basic principles affecting {{the composition of the}} fish body. Contrary to normal thinking, nutritional factors have a limited influence over the final composition of fish. Besides this, new alternatives on fish feed formulations are arising due to the present global situation of its raw materials, such as fish oil and fishmeal.

In a serial slaughter experiment with Friesian steers, the carcases of animals grown on a grass silage/barley diet had more fat and less meat than those grown on a concentrates/chopped straw diet even though both diets were similar in energy content and supported similar levels of performance. There was an inter-action between the effects of diet and slaughter weight. At low carcase weights there was no effect of diet on composition but with increasing carcase weight, the diet effect emerged. A restriction of 20 per cent in feed intake reduced performance, efficiency and carcase fat content.

The 2 day meeting consisted of 19 presentations centred {{on the theme}} that modern beef and lamb products must meet the expectations of consumers who purchase red meat to cook it as a meal solution. The focus was based around the Meat Standards Australia (MSA) grading platform which is designed as a sensory or eating quality grading system for underpinning a cooked meal performance that is matched to the occasion and requires no specialist knowledge by the consumer. This workshop unanimously supported the need for evidence based systems to underpin eating quality for lamb and beef {{in order to keep}} consumers purchasing products that are higher in price than the white meat competitors. Registrations were received from 80 people covering 17 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Ireland, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States of America) creating a dynamic workshop atmosphere. In order to drive and focus the recommendations which were discussed {{at the end of the}} workshop, it was agreed to establish a working group of current collaborating countries that would be open with respect to new partners.

40|$|Abstract – The {{effect of}} caponisation on fat {{composition}} by parts (wing, breast, thigh, and drumstick) and tissues (skin, subcutaneous adipose tissue, intermuscular adipose tissue and muscle) was exam-ined {{in the present}} study and fatty acid profiles of abdominal fat and edible meat by parts and tissue components were determined. The sample was made up of twenty-eight castrated and twenty male Penedesenca Negra chicks reared under free-range conditions and slaughtered at 28 wk of age; the birds were castrated at four or eight weeks. Caponisation significantly increased (P < 0. 01) the chem-ical fat content in all parts (16. 31 % to 37. 98 % in breast; 21. 98 % to 34. 13 % in wing; 21. 09 % to 49. 57 % in thigh; 14. 33 % to 24. 82 % in drumstick) and led to minor modifications in fat characteristics, par-ticularly in the thigh and the drumstick, where the unsaturated vs. saturated fatty acid ratio increased from 1. 31 to 1. 76 (P < 0. 01) and from 1. 48 to 2. 07 (P < 0. 01), respectively. Delaying the age of castration from 4 to 8 weeks increased this ratio by 0. 35 in the edible meat. Even though the profile of the abdominal fat is less saturated in capons, all changes occurring on fat quality after caponisation indicate that increased fatness after castration does not imply worse fat nutritional properties. chicken / capon / edible meat / fatty acids Résumé – Comparaison de la composition lipidique <b>de</b> la <b>viande,</b> <b>des</b> tissus adipeux et de...|$|R

40|$|De nombreux essais réalisés chez l’homme et de {{multiples}} expérimentations animales ont montré que les acides gras poly-insaturés ω- 3 sont impliqués dans {{la mise en place}} et le maintien de divers organes (le cerveau en premier lieu), et qu’ils pourraient participer à la prévention de différentes pathologies (notamment les maladies cardiovasculaires ischémiques) et affections psychiatriques, dermatologiques ou rhumatologiques. Or, l’alimentation occidentale est déficiente en acides gras oméga- 3. L’enjeu alimentaire est donc d’identifier les aliments qui en sont naturellement riches (voir Tableaux I et II), mais aussi de préciser l’impact réel de formulations enrichies en acides gras oméga- 3 (ALA, EPA, DHA), utilisées dans les élevages, sur la valeur nutritionnelle des produits dérivés. Une synthèse des essais publiés montre que, en nourrissant {{par exemple}} les animaux avec des extraits de graines de lin ou de colza, la teneur en ALA est, dans les meilleures conditions, multipliée par environ 20 à 40 dans les oeufs, 10 dans le poulet, 6 dans la <b>viande</b> <b>de</b> porc et 2 dans celle de boeuf. En nourrissant les animaux avec des extraits de poissons ou d’algues sous forme d’huiles, la quantité de DHA est multipliée par environ 20 dans le poisson (saumon), 7 dans le poulet, 3 à 6 dans les oeufs et 2 dans la <b>viande</b> <b>de</b> boeuf. Le surcoût pour les consommateurs reste très faible par rapport au gain considérable en valeur nutritionnelle. As shown by {{huge amount of}} assays in human as well as in animal models, ω- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids play important role in the development and maintenance of different organs, primarily the brain, and could be useful in the prevention of different pathologies, mainly the cardiovascular diseases, and, as proposed recently, some psychiatric, dermatological or rheumatological disorders. For ALA, the major and cheapest source for human is rapeseed oil (canola oil), and walnut « noix de Grenoble » oil). The actual goal is first to identify which foods are naturally rich in ω- 3 fatty acids, and, second, to determine the true impact of the formulations (enriched in ω- 3 fatty acids) in chows used on farms and breeding centres on the nutritional value of the products and thus their effect on the health of consumers, thanks to quantities of either ALA, or EPA or DHA or both. This concern fish (in proportion of their lipid content, mainly mackerel, salmon, sardine and herring), eggs (wildly naturally rich in ω- 3 fatty acids, both ALA and DHA, or from laying hen fed ALA from linseed or rapeseed), meat from birds, mammals (from the highest concentration : rabbit, then pig and monogastrics, then polygastrics such as beef, mutton and goat)  ; in butter, milk, dairy products, cheese (all naturally poor in ω- 3 fatty acids) … Indeed, the nature of fatty acids of reserve triglycerides (found in more or less large amounts depending on the anatomical localisation, that is to say the butcher’s cuts) can vary mainly {{as a function of the}} food received by the animal. EPA and DHA are mainly present in animal’s products. The impact (qualitative and quantitative) of alterations in the lipid composition of animal foods on the nutritional value of derived products (in terms of EPA and DHA content) eaten by humans are more important in single-stomach animals than multi-stomach animals (due to their hydrogenating intestinal bacteria). The intestinal physiology of birds results in the relatively good preservation of their dietary ω- 3 fatty acids. The enrichment in eggs is proportional to the amount of ω- 3 fatty acids in the hen’s diet and can be extremely important. Including ALA in fish feeds is effective only if they are, like carp, vegetarians, as they have the enzymes required to transform ALA into EPA and DHA ; in contrast, it is probably less effective for carnivorous fish (75  % of the fish used for human), which have little of these enzymes : their feed must contain marine animals, mainly fish or fish oil. Analysis of the published results shows that, under the best conditions, feeding animals with extracts of linseed and rapeseed grains, for example, increases the level of ALA acid by 20 to 40 -fold in eggs (according to the low or high level of ALA in commercial eggs), 10 -fold in chicken, 6 -fold in pork and less than 2 -fold in beef. By feeding animals with fish extracts or algae (oils), the level of DHA is increased by 20 -fold in fish, 7 -fold in chicken, 3 to 6 -fold in eggs, less than 2 -fold in beef. In practise, the effect is considerable for fish and egg, interesting for poultry and rabbit, extremely low for beef, mutton and sheep. The effect on the price paid by the consumer is very low compared to the considerable gain in nutritional value...|$|R

Its production is energy-consuming for the animal but can be limited by specific means or by adequate systems of livestock management. Several methods have been tried (though not yet applied at an agricultural scale) with the aim of reducing the production of methane : additives that inhibit the methane-producing microorganisms or modify the metabolic pathways in the rumen; biotechnological trials (selection of rumen microorganisms or vaccination against the methane-producing microorganisms). When the amounts ingested by the animal increase and when the feed is rich in concentrates (and therefore poor in cell-walls) or in poly-insaturated fatty acids (linolenic acid), the production of methane diminishes. Intensified rearing methods result in a noteworthy reduction of the methane production per unit of animal product (kg milk or kg meat). This real possibility with an immediate effect goes however against the general trend where public opinion favours more extensive farming with high-quality products, the maintenance of the lands, and the preservation of the environment...|$|R
