5|$|The {{andesite}} lava of Ember Ridge comprises 55% brownish-green <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass</b> with a trachytic {{matrix of}} plagioclase. About 35% of Ember Ridge andesite contains phenocrysts of hornblende, augite, plagioclase and orthopyroxene and exist as isolated crystals and clots. A feature south of Ember Ridge, unofficially known as Betty's Bump, comprises andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite and olivine. Dark brown <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass</b> composes the Betty's Bump andesite {{as much as}} 20%. The relationship of Betty's Bump with Ember Ridge is unclear but it likely represents a separate volcanic feature due to its topographic isolation.|$|E
5|$|The dacite volcanics {{composing}} Mount Fee contain brown <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass</b> {{as much as}} 70% and vesicular textures as much as 15%. About 25% of the volcanics contain crystal content, including plagioclase, hornblende, orthopyroxene, orthoclase and sporadic quartz. The orthoclase crystals {{are interpreted}} to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas. A portion of the southwestern flank of Mount Fee comprises no <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass,</b> but rather composed of an abnormal cryptocrystalline matrix. This indicates {{that it might have}} developed as part of a subvolcanic intrusion.|$|E
5|$|Andesite at Slag Hill {{consists}} of 70% dark brown <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass</b> with varied degrees of trachytic texture in the plagioclastic matrix {{and less than}} 5% of the andesite comprises vesicular textures. Plagioclase, hornblende and augite are mostly in form as phenocrysts and comprise 1% to 10% of the andesite. Orthoclase crystals are found occasionally and they likely represent xenocrysts.|$|E
25|$|Although tektites are superficially {{similar to}} some {{terrestrial}} <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> (obsidians), they have unusual distinctive physical characteristics that distinguish them from such glasses. First, {{they are completely}} glassy and lack any microlites or phenocrysts, unlike terrestrial <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses.</b> Second, although high in silica (>65 wt%), the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of tektites is closer to those of shales and similar sedimentary rocks and {{quite different from the}} bulk chemical and isotopic composition of terrestrial <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses.</b> Third, tektites contain virtually no water (<0.02 wt%), unlike terrestrial <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses.</b> Fourth, the flow-banding within tektites often contains particles and bands of lechatelierite, which are not found in terrestrial <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses.</b> Finally, a few tektites contain partly melted inclusions of shocked and unshocked mineral grains, i.e. quartz, apatite, and zircon, as well as coesite.|$|R

5|$|At Ring Mountain, {{andesite}} comprises 70% brown <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass</b> and vesicular textures {{as much as}} 15%. The plagioclastic matrix is trachytic. Augite, biotite, plagioclase and hornblende {{occur as}} microphenocrysts and comprise 1% to 7% of the andesite. Small qualities of quartz are common and occur as microxenocrysts. Microxenocrysts of orthoclase likely exist in andesite at Ring Mountain.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Gareloi Volcano {{underwent}} a major explosive eruption where it generated four lava flows, andesitic tuff, <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass,</b> and scoria of red tone. Thirteen craters, all {{located in the}} fissure, contributed to this episode. All are most likely phreatic. During the eruption, pyroclastic flows convened with tephra, as suggested by deposits. Lahar also streamed from the summit.|$|E
5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint. The late Holocene eruption of the Mount Aniakchak, a volcano in Alaska, is now {{believed to be the}} source of the minute shards of <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass</b> in the Greenland ice core.|$|E

40|$|The VLT (very low titanium) <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> from Apollo 14 and Apollo 17 {{have been}} {{analyzed}} {{for the major}} elements and trace Ni. These glasses display compositional trends that may not result entirely from olivine fractionation. The phase relations have been determined experimentally. Olivine is the liquidus phase in the pressure interval from 0 to about 18 kbar. Pigeonite is the liquidus phase from about 18 kbar to 22 kbar or more. If these VLT <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> are samples of primary melts {{that had been in}} chemical equilibrium with olivine and low-Ca pyroxene in their source regions, then these liquids were derived from depths of 360 - 380 km within the moon...|$|R
40|$|The {{compositional}} {{properties of}} <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> from the Apollo 11, 14, 15 and 16 landing sites are examined {{and implications of}} the results for mare basalt petrogenesis and deep lunar structures are discussed. Major-element and nickel analyses were performed on the glasses using electron probe techniques, and R-mode principal component analysis {{was performed on the}} 19 different compositions of glass distinguished. The glasses are found to form two distinct chemical arrays based on the major elements and Ni. The presence of two chemically isolated cumulate systems in the mantle at different depths is thus inferred, and a model is developed for mare petrogenesis in which each system was itself composed of two lithologic components that underwent hybridization, assimilation or mixing to generate the large compositional range of magmas represented by the lunar <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses.</b> The surface-correlated elements associated with the <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> are attributed to another reservoir in the deep interior which may be responsible for gas emissions causing lunar transient phenomena. The model developed allows predictions to be made concerning the liquidus phase relations, trace and radiogenic element distributions, nonradiogenic isotope compositions and sample ages...|$|R
5|$|Little Ring Mountain at the {{northern}} end of the field contains at least 70% brown <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass</b> with isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase. Vesicular textures are up to 5%, suggesting that the lava erupted subaerially. Probable xenocrysts of quartz have been identified at the volcano. At least one xenolith fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several quartz xenocrysts and polycrystalline quartz xenoliths in a glassy matrix with trachytic plagioclase.|$|E
5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>glass</b> and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} {{explosive}} subaqueous volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch. This subaqueous volcano, known as White Horse Bluff, {{is thought to}} have formed in three phases. Its first phase of activity was involved with water, possibly dammed by glacial ice which filled the Clearwater River valley. The volcano heated glacial water then flooded down the volcano's vent, creating violent steam explosions and broken lava fragments. Once the steam explosions had subsided, the broken lava fragments settled back into the glacial water, creating the unvolcano-like form of White Horse Bluff which is mostly made of fragmental <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass</b> called hyaloclastite. The volcano ceased erupting soon after breaching the surface of the glacial water.|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of our ongoing investigations of Apollo 15 green and Apollo 17 orange and black <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> are threefold: first, {{to increase our}} understanding of the volcanic origin of the glasses; second, to determine the nature of the coating materials deposited on the glasses during their cooling in the volcanic environment; and, third, to help determine the nature of the gases involved in the volcanic fire-fountaining that occurred at approximately 3. 5 Ga on the moon. We are continuing studies of coatings on <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> using analytical techniques not available when these glasses were originally studied; these include high-resolution FE-TEM and X-ray mapping, along with other highly detailed methods including TEM electron diffraction analysis. Initial studies of Apollo 15 green <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> using the techniques described above revealed {{for the first time the}} presence of areas containing distinct layering of volcanic surface deposits. S was associated with some of the inner layer of metallic Fe but was absent from the outer layer. Zn was associated with S in some places in the inner layer. An example of a typical spherule used for this study is shown in Fig. 1. It is a black (quench-crystallized) bead from near the bottom of the 74001 / 2 double drive tube; black beads such as this one are essentially identical in composition to the orange (uncrystallized) beads of the 74001 / 2 core...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of microbial communities inhabiting two terrestrial <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> of contrasting mineralogy and age was characterised. Basaltic glass from a Bacteria community than the younger rhyolitic glass from ~ 150 - 300 AD (Dόmadalshraun lava flow). Actinobacteria dominated 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries from both sites, however, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Cyanobacteria were also numerically abundant in each. A significant proportion (15 - 34 %) of the sequenced clones displayed Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria were {{more similar to}} sequences from other lithic environments, included among these Icelandic clones from crystalline basalt and rhyolite, however, no similarities to sequences reported from marine <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> were observed. PhyloChip analysis detected substantially greater numbers of phylotypes at both sites than the corresponding clone libraries, but nonetheless also identified the basaltic glass community as the richer, containing approximately 29 % unique phylotypes compared to rhyolitic glass...|$|R

5|$|Indigenous {{people of}} the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} the area for hundreds of years. In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as caribou, martin, moose and caribou were hunted and trapped by the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass</b> called obsidian. Anahim obsidian was traded widely throughout the Interior {{and up and down}} the Coast from the community of Bella Coola. Arrowheads and knives were made from obsidian because when it breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, it creates very sharp edges. A modified form of this lifestyle is practiced by some indigenous people to this day.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of fragments of pulverized rock, minerals and <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass,</b> created during volcanic eruptions and measuring less than 2mm (0.079inches) in diameter. The term volcanic ash is also often loosely {{used to refer}} to all explosive eruption products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2mm. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the operating temperature (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly <b>volcanic</b> <b>glass,</b> can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine thrust. The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E
40|$|The geology of the Dalradian rocks near Tayvallich is {{described}} with a detailed geological map. 78 new chemical analyses of metamorphic rocks, each for 30 elements, are given including intrusive epidiorites, basic pillow lavas, agglomerates, grits, slates, limestones and calcareous slates. Basic <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> have been locally showered into the sediments. The epidiorites are albite-chlorite-calcite-quartz-sphene (epidote) rocks with actinolite being confined to rocks with mg {{in excess of}} 0. 44. Metasomatic movement occurred between the margins and centres of the pillow lavas and is also believed to have affected the <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses.</b> The sedimentary rocks can be distinguished from the epidiorites {{by a number of}} chemical characteristics including the high P, Ti and Nb of the epidiorites and their differing trends of variation such as Cr against Niggli mg. The Loch Awe epidiorites are characterised by high Zr and P and are less tholeiitic than epidiorites higher in the Dalradian sequence.

40|$|The liquid {{lines of}} descent were {{calculated}} for low-pressure equilibrium and fractional crystallization of mare basaltic liquids {{in order to examine}} the postulated link between picritic <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> and mare basalts. The models of Longhi (1977, 1982) were modified by including expressions for the armalcolite/ilmenite surface boundary and the Cr-spinel liquidus surface, average molar partition coefficients for armalcolite/liquid pairs, and new experimental data of Longhi and Pan (1987). The results indicate that, with two exceptions, mare basalts and picritic <b>volcanic</b> <b>glasses</b> are not related by simple, linear-surface crystallization processes. However, the compositions of Luna 24 ferrobasalt and Apollo 11 high-K basalts could be closely matched with the lines of liquid descent of certain green and orange picritic glasses, respectively. The calculations also show that the picritic magmas would have fractionated to produce basalts with bulk and mineral compositions similar to those of mare basalts, supporting the hypothesis that mare basalts have fractionated compositions and that the small number of observed linkages between basalts and picritic parents is a consequence of limited sampling...|$|R
