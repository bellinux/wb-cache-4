25|$|The {{landscape}} of the region is much more agrarian than other parts of Burgundy with pastures and orchards interspersed among vineyards. The soft rolling hills of the area reach altitudes between 750-1,050 feet (230–320 metres). These hills provide some protection from frost and hail damage. The soil is predominately limestone mixed with sand and clay and the occasional iron deposit. Around the city of Mercurey, the soil has {{a high concentration of}} iron-enriched marl. The diversity in slopes and soils creates a myriad of microclimates that can greatly influence the <b>varying</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> wine from the Côte Chalonnaise, even among vineyards labeled as premier cru.|$|E

500|$|Bizenghast {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The September 2005 issue of Teen People listed Bizenghast as the Hot Book of the Month. [...] Sheena McNeil of Sequential Tart praised {{the first volume}} as [...] "a highly enjoyable read". Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux described the series as [...] "belong to a fantasy subgenre {{sometimes referred to as}} 'pop Gothic' and relying on atmosphere and looks. Critics praised the art of Bizenghast as detailed, but did not see it as manga-styled. Anime Jumps Chad Clayton called the series [...] "heavily steeped in the gothic tradition" [...] and commented that the series [...] "successfully develops an inventive visual style all its own. It seems to owe more to classical art, gothic comics, and even artists like Edward Gorey than it does to manga." [...] Johanna Draper Carlson, a longtime reviewer for Publishers Weekly, found the art reminiscent [...] "of classic fantasy indy comics" [...] and noted [...] "stock elements" [...] in the story. Reviewers found Dinah's character design [...] "striking" [...] and with the potential to appeal to fans of the Gothic Lolita fashion. Criticism focused on the writing, [...] "uneven pacing", flat characters, and the <b>varying</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the art. Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy heavily criticized Bizenghast for the [...] "slightly modified generic monster-of-the-week cliché" [...] plot, one-dimensional characters, and art. David Welsh compared Bizenghast to [...] "a cosplay of a horror manga", and wrote: [...] "It’s got a handle on the cosmetics, but central elements of story and character are vague and underdeveloped." ...|$|E

Moreover, nurses and physicians did not significantly agree {{with one another in}} their predictions of patients' preferences for any of these decisions. These results suggest that while nurses' and physicians' perceptions of patients' preferences for life-sustaining treatment are not necessarily similar, neither nurses nor physicians systematically understand their elderly patients' resuscitation preferences...|$|R

25|$|While the {{transition}} from city-state to empire affected philosophy a great deal, shifting the emphasis from political theory to personal ethics, Greek letters continued to flourish both under the Successors (especially the Ptolemies) and under Roman rule. Romans of literary or rhetorical inclination looked to Greek models, and Greek literature of all types continued to be read and produced both by native speakers of Greek and later by Roman authors as well. A notable characteristic of this period was the expansion of literary criticism as a genre, particularly as exemplified by Demetrius, Pseudo-Longinus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The New Testament, written by various authors in <b>varying</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> Koine Greek also hails from this period, the most important works being the Gospels and the Epistles of Saint Paul.|$|R

5000|$|Those {{subscribing to}} the first and fourth of Packer's risk {{categories}} are likely to believe no rider can sense when he is near the traction limit, while {{the second and third}} risk categories include those who share Spiegel's view that a rider need not lose traction and start to skid to know where the limit is.
