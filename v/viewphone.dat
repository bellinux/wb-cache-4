50|$|In {{science fiction}} literature, names {{commonly}} associated with videophones include <b>viewphone,</b> vidphone, vidfone, and visiphone. In many science fiction movies and TV programs that are set in the future, videophones were used as a primary method of communication. One of the first movies where a videophone was used was Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927).|$|E
50|$|Other {{names for}} {{videophone}} {{that have been}} used in English are: <b>Viewphone</b> (the British Telecom equivalent to AT&T's Picturephone), and visiophone, a common French translation that has also crept into limited English usage, as well as over twenty less common names and expressions. Latin-based translations of videophone in other languages include vidéophone (French), Bildtelefon (German), videotelefono (Italian), both videófono and videoteléfono (Spanish), both beeldtelefoon and videofoon (Dutch), and videofonía (Catalan).|$|E
5000|$|In 1970 the British General Post Office had 16 {{demonstration}} {{models of}} its <b>Viewphone</b> built, {{meant to be}} the equivalent to AT&T's Picturephone. Their initial attempt at a first generation commercial videophone later lead to the British Telecom Relate 2000, which was released for sale in 1993, costing between £400-£500 each. The Relate 2000 featured a 74 mm flip-up colour LCD display screen operating at a nominal rate of 8 video frames per second, which could be depressed to 3-4 frames per second if the PSTN bandwidth was limited. In the era prior to low-cost, high-speed broadband service, its video quality {{was found to be}} generally poor by the public with images shifting jerkily between frames, due to British phone lines that generally provided less than 3.4 kHz of bandwidth. [...] British Telecom had initially expected the device, manufactured by Marconi Electronics, to sell at a rate of 10,000 per year, but its actual sales were minimal. [...] Its second generation videophone thus also proved to be commercially unsuccessful, similar to AT&T's VideoPhone 2500 of the same time period.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The initial phase of the research programme involves the design, development and construction of a reliable and versatile Video Acquisition and Display System (VADS) to provide a means of subjective {{evaluation of the results}} of computer simulations. An orthogonal transformation generates a set of uncorrelated coefficients and has, in addition, an energy compaction property which leads to more efficient coding of the source data. As an introduction to its application, its use in the detection and correction of transmission errors is considered. Simulations are performed on two-dimensional Gauss-Markov sequences. One-dimensional Hadamard transformation is performed in the horizontal direction and the vertical correlation of the simulated data is exploited to achieve partial error detection and correction. <b>Viewphone</b> signals, particularly those derived from head and shoulder scenes, possess much spatial and temporal redundancy which may be significantly reduced at the expense of a slight, but subjectively tolerable, degree of degregation in picture quality. The discrete Cosine transform offers a corriparatively fast and efficient transformation for achieving this objective, and is used extensively here, in conjunction with various adaptive algorithms which select and code the transform coefficients for transmission {{on the basis of the}} statistical and local content of the data. Initially, twodimensional adaptive techniques are employed followed by an extension of the ideas developed to the time domain. It is demonstrated that a marked reduction in the signal transmission rate can be achieved by this method...|$|E
