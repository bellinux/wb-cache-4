The simulated system under investigation with 4 × 4 antenna configuration implements various types of channel coding (LDPC & Turbo) and signal detection (MMSE-SIC, BLUE, ZF & OSIC) techniques. On considering transmission of secured <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> in a hostile fading channel under MATLAB based simulative study, it is observable that the simulated system shows satisfactory performance in retrieving transmitted audio signal under scenario of implementing Turbo channel coding, MMSE-SIC signal detection and 8 -QAM digital modulation schemes...|$|E

5000|$|In a nutshell, an FXO {{device is}} any device that, {{from the point}} of view of a {{telephone}} exchange, appears to be a regular telephone. As such, it should be able to accept ringing signals, go on-hook and off-hook, and send and receive <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signals.</b> It may use loop start or ground start signaling. FXO channel units were invented and named in the middle 20th century for service at the [...] "Office" [...] end of an FX line via carrier system.|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent the}} DSL signal from {{entering}} the phone lines into telephones, answering machines, faxes and other devices where it could cause interference, DSL modems come with low pass filters which must be plugged into the phone lines going to all voiceband devices on the same line. The filter blocks all frequencies above 4 kHz, so it blocks the DSL <b>signal</b> while allowing <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signals</b> through. A filter must not be inserted in the phone line going to the DSL modem, because it would block the communication between the modem and switching center.|$|R
5000|$|The public {{switched}} telephone network, {{the network}} of switching centers, trunk lines, amplifiers and switches which transmits telephone calls from one phone to another, is designed to carry <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>signals,</b> and is therefore limited to a bandwidth of 3.4 kHz. Before DSL, voice-band modems transmitted information through the telephone network with audio frequencies within that bandwidth, which limited them to a data rate of about 56 kbit/s. However, the copper wires that connect telephones with the local switching center (telephone exchange), called the subscriber loop, are actually able to carry a much wider band of frequencies, up to several megahertz. [...] This capacity is unused in normal phone service. DSL uses these higher frequencies to send digital data between the DSL modem and the local switching center, without interfering with normal telephone service. At the local switching center the data is transferred directly between the customer's phone line and internet lines, so DSL signals do not travel through the telephone network itself. It {{is not necessary to}} dial a telephone number to initiate a connection; the DSL connection is [...] "on" [...] whenever the modem is on.|$|R
40|$|Human voice {{intonation}} {{is affected}} by pitch and loudness. Pitch {{is related to the}} <b>frequency</b> of human <b>voice,</b> while Loudness is related to the magnitude of human voice. Someone who does not have vocal cords, He has no ability to produce voice and speech. This problem is suffered by laryngectomy patients. Over half of all laryngectomy patients worldwide are using electrolarynx for the rehabilitation of their speech ability. Unfortunately, the electrolarynx voice is monotonic and flatted intonation. Small changes in pitch and loudness of electrolarynx will give a better expression in laryngectomy patients. Previous researches have focused on utilization of Electromyography (EMG) signal of neck muscle for only pitch control. In this research, the relationship between human voice intonation (i. e., frequency and magnitude) and EMG signals of neck muscles was studied by looking for their correlation and their mutual information. Human voice signal and EMG signal of neck muscle were recorded simultaneuosly while subjects were saying “A” with varying intonation. The EMG signal of neck muscle was processed using amplifying, filtering, rectifying and “moving average” process. On the other hand, the human voice was processed by FFT Algorithm to obtain magnitude and fundamental frequency. The result shows that the correlation coefficient between human voice magnitudes and EMG signal of neck muscle is 0. 93, while the correlation coefficient between human <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> and EMG <b>signal</b> of neck muscle is 0. 88. Moreover, the mutual information between human voice magnitudes and EMG signal of neck muscle is 1. 07, while the mutual information between human <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> and EMG <b>signal</b> of neck muscle is 0. 65. These results show that the relationship between human voice magnitudes and EMG signal of neck muscle is stronger than the relationship between human <b>voice</b> <b>frequencies</b> and EMG <b>signal</b> of neck muscle. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use the EMG signal of neck muscle for controlling loudness of electrolarynx than that of the pitch of electrolarynx...|$|R
50|$|Just before World War II, Tommy Flowers MBE, {{employed}} at the GPO, {{had been working}} on VF (<b>voice</b> <b>frequency)</b> <b>signalling,</b> using valves (vacuum tubes), and this had led him to realise that valves could be very reliable if not switched on and off. This gave him the confidence during the war to build the world's first digital computer, called Colossus, at Bletchley Park. This computer used about a thousand valves and was a major factor in helping British Intelligence to break the German codes, though details of this were only released in 2000. After the war, the success of Colossus encouraged him to contemplate the possibility of telephone exchanges each using tens of thousands of valves. He was told that this was impossible and he could not say he had already done it with Colossus because he was bound by the Official Secrets Act. However, a fully electronic prototype Time Division Multiplex Model Exchange was constructed at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill and then an experimental TDM exchange system was built and tested at Highgate Wood, North London, in 1962, but it was found to be beyond the technology of the time: the solid-state switching worked well, but the analogue transmission (which had worked on the short cable runs of a laboratory model at Dollis Hill) was too noisy for public service on the long cable runs of a large exchange. However, the principles would be used later, as transmission became digital, in the development of digital exchanges the world over, including System X.|$|R

5000|$|Commonly, microfilters {{are only}} {{low-pass}} filters, so beyond them only low <b>frequencies</b> (<b>voice</b> <b>signals)</b> can pass. In the data section, a microfilter {{is not used}} because digital devices that are intended to extract data from the DSL signal will, themselves, filter out low <b>frequencies.</b> <b>Voice</b> telephone devices {{will pick up the}} entire spectrum so high frequencies, including the ADSL signal, will be [...] "heard" [...] as noise in telephone terminals, and will affect and often degrade the service in fax, dataphones and modems. From {{the point of view of}} DSL devices, any acceptance of their signal by POTS devices mean that there is a degradation of the DSL signal to the devices, and this is the central reason why these filters are required.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Oxandrolone (Ox) {{increases}} {{height gain}} {{but may also}} cause voice deepening in growth hormone (GH) -treated girls with Turner syndrome (TS). We assessed the effect of Ox on objective and subjective speaking <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> in GH-treated girls with TS. STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, placebo (Pl) -controlled, double-blind study was conducted. METHODS: One hundred thirty-three patients were included and treated with GH (1. 33 mg/m 2 /d) from baseline, combined with Pl or Ox in a low (0. 03 mg/kg/d) or conventional (0. 06 mg/kg/d) dose {{from the age of}} 8 years and estrogens from the age of 12 years. Yearly from starting Ox/Pl until 6 months after discontinuing GH+Ox/Pl, voices were recorded and questionnaires were completed. RESULTS: At start, mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> SD score (SDS) was high for age (1. 0 +/- 1. 2, P< 0. 001) but normal for height. Compared with GH+Pl, voices tended to lower on GH+Ox 0. 03 (P= 0. 09) and significantly lowered on GH+Ox 0. 06 (P= 0. 007). At the last measurement, <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> SDS was still relatively high in GH+Pl group (0. 6 +/- 0. 7, P= 0. 002) but similar to healthy girls in both GH+Ox groups. <b>Voice</b> <b>frequency</b> became lower than - 2 SDS in one patient (3 %) on GH+Ox 0. 03 and three patients (11 %) on GH+Ox 0. 06. The percentage of patients reporting subjective voice deepening was similar between the dosage groups. CONCLUSIONS: Untreated girls with TS have relatively high-pitched voices. The addition of Ox to GH decreases <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> in a dose-dependent way. Although most <b>voice</b> <b>frequencies</b> remain within the normal range, they may occasionally become lower than - 2 SDS, especially on GH+Ox 0. 06 mg/kg/d...|$|R
50|$|In telephony, the usable <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> band {{ranges from}} {{approximately}} 300 Hz to 3400 Hz. It {{is for this}} reason that the ultra low frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum between 300 and 3000 Hz is also referred to as <b>voice</b> <b>frequency,</b> being the electromagnetic energy that represents acoustic energy at baseband. The bandwidth allocated for a single voice-frequency transmission channel is usually 4 kHz, including guard bands, allowing a sampling rate of 8 kHz to be used as the basis of the pulse code modulation system used for the digital PSTN. Per the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, the sampling frequency (8 kHz) must be at least twice the highest component of the <b>voice</b> <b>frequency</b> via appropriate filtering prior to sampling at discrete times (4 kHz) for effective reconstruction of the voice signal.|$|R
