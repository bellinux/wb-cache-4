5000|$|The system {{experienced}} {{intermittent reception}} among field units {{and at the}} dispatch console. In one instance, the report describes an officer {{at the scene of}} a call.

It also cites an event where two officers were in a [...] "potentially-deadly" [...] situation and had to shout to one another because their radios could not communicate. Because calls to dispatch were sometimes not heard, there was friction between officers and dispatchers: officers thought the dispatcher was ignoring their call.|$|E

50|$|After 1955 television's {{visual images}} {{replaced}} the audio-only limitation of radio as the predominant entertainment and news <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Radio</b> adapted by replacing entertainment programs with schedules of music interspersed with news and features, a free-form format adopted by NBC when it launched its popular weekend-long Monitor in 1955. During the 1950s automobile manufacturers began offering car radios as standard accessories, and radio received a boost as Americans {{listened to their}} car radios as they drove to and from work. Although this period saw the overall decline of the AM radio, some new stations, like the WGIV station in Charlotte dedicated to African American Music, were still coming up.|$|E
5000|$|While dining at a {{restaurant}} with Scarlet and Destiny (Liz Morgan) and Melody Angels, Blue explains how he knew of the car park's approximate location and why Macey seemed to hear Big Ben strike 13. Because he was near to the tower with a <b>vehicle</b> <b>radio</b> switched on, Macey was hearing two sets of chimes: however, those issuing from Big Ben itself were delayed due to the distance travelled, {{with the result that}} the [...] "13th" [...] chime, heard through the air, was simply a duplicate of the 12th that had sounded over the radio. Scarlet declares that he will make 13 his lucky number.|$|E
5000|$|Models are {{designated}} [...] "UK/PRC" [...] or [...] "UK/VRC", which stand for [...] "United Kingdom / Portable Radio Communications" [...] and [...] "United Kingdom / <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Radio</b> Communications" [...] respectively. The radios {{first came into}} service in the late 1970s {{at that time the}} main advantage of the Clansman radios was that they were all frequency synthesised (switched channels, as opposed to using a variable tuning scale for example). This provided frequency stability, obviating the need to tune the radio again, once a frequency was set. Previous UK military radios were much less stable, and had to be frequently tuned (or might need to be tweaked to [...] "pull in" [...] a weak signal).|$|E

5000|$|In the 1950s, {{two factors}} changed the {{provision}} of <b>vehicle</b> <b>radio</b> within the British Army. The first of these was a change of philosophy for battlefield radio communication {{as a result of}} wartime experiences and the political and military situation in Europe after 1945 which was addressed by the [...] "New Range" [...] of sealed, primarily VHF/FM Combat Net Radio introduced from 1954. This would later become known as the Larkspur series of equipment after the 1962 project to equip the whole army with the new radio system. This modern design of equipment, although still using valves, was lightweight and where possible avoided the motor-generator/ rotary converter power supplies of earlier generation equipment such as the No. 19 set, {{in order to reduce the}} sets' power requirements. [...] The second factor was the development of the 'CT' (a contraction of CombaT) range of soft-skin combat vehicles, as a purpose-designed and more rugged alternative to the General Service vehicles based on modified commercial (CL) vehicles. These CT vehicles, particularly the FV1801 Austin Champ ¼ ton and the FV1600 series Humber 1 ton, were powered by the new Rolls-Royce B range engines. Drawing on wartime experience, these engines were designed with built-in radio suppression, especially their ignition system, and they were also available with purpose-designed high-output generators, and were based on 24v systems in accordance with agreements reached with the US and Canadian armies in 1948. These 25A generators were initially thought sufficiently powerful to supply and charge the radio batteries directly, no longer needing the separate charging set. The generator had an internal two-speed automatic gearbox, which increased the charging rate when the engine was running at near-idling speed. However it soon became clear that this was insufficient to meet the demands of the new sets and higher output systems based on alternators were later introduced.|$|E
40|$|Conclusions Currently the Army {{manually}} {{identifies the}} vehicles and enters this information into TC-AIMS II. The Army also weighs vehicles manually calculates vehicle individual axle weights, total vehicular weight and manually measure {{the length of}} the vehicle. The center of balance data is then calculated, and this information is manually marked on the vehicle. This information is then manually transferred to the AALPS personnel who manually enter it into the AALPS system. Each of these steps in the process is prone to human error. By establishing (1) an automated data exchange link between the <b>vehicle</b> <b>Radio</b> Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and WIM; and (2) an automated data exchange link between WIM and AALPS, this WIM data has been automatically transferred from TC-AIMS-II to WIM and from WIM to AALPS thus eliminating those human errors {{and at the same time}} expediting the process. ORNL’s modeling efforts, utilizing Rational Rose, were critical and instrumental to the success of automatically transferring this information electronically and seamlessly. Key use cases and data/information flow are presented here. Method...|$|E
3000|$|Wireless {{communication}} serving {{vehicles for}} road safety, reduced accident risks, and improved transportation system efficiencies {{will be an}} important new development for vehicular environments. A further important indirect [...] "green" [...] benefit of this technology will be reduced carbon emissions. The IEEE protocol addressing this application is the IEEE 802.11 p Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE). The system is built on an infrastructure of roadside wireless stations and onboard <b>vehicle</b> <b>radio</b> units, and its primary goal is the sharing of safety-related information with road vehicles. WAVE's MAC protocol to mediate competition for the transmission medium is the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA). Jose R. Gallardo et al. in their paper [...] "Mathematical analysis of EDCA's performance on the control channel of an IEEE 802.11 p WAVE vehicular network" [...] present improvements to analytical tools which can be used to evaluate the performance of WAVE as a technology under the specific conditions of the WAVE control channel (CCH). The conditions include the fact that all safety-critical data frames are broadcasted which in turn means no acknowledgments or retransmissions, and therefore the binary exponential backoff technique cannot be implemented. Using Markov chains in the modelling of the protocol, they show how to obtain performance results relating throughput, frame-error rate, buffer occupancy, and delay obtained under different traffic-load conditions.|$|E
