40|$|The {{construct}} <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> organizational <b>commitment</b> {{has recently}} been investigated in several studies. The authors of these studies have concluded that organizational commitment is a valid construct, sufficiently distinct from job satisfaction.

40|$|Abstract—Communities of web {{services}} {{have been proposed}} to gather {{web services}} having the same functionalities but possibly different nonfunctional properties. Current approaches into communities of web services focus on developing, managing and designing communities of web services through a suitable architecture, but can benefit from a stronger treatment of flexible interactions. These approaches ignore the collaboration and business-level contracts between various web services {{and the ability to}} formally delegate service to another web service within the same community. This paper presents a significant step towards enhancing communities of web services using an agent-based approach that synthesizes mentalistic states (e. g. goals, tasks), social commitments and argumentative dialogues for modeling and establishing communities of web services. This paper has three contributions: first, we extend the community structure with alliances structure to allow collaboration between various web services; second, we propose a new engineering methodology based on concepts of Tropos methodology for managing communities of web services with alliances structure; and third, we specify internal-organizational business interactions within web services in terms <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> augmented with argumentative dialogues to reason about the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> these <b>commitments.</b> We evaluate our methodology using a large existing case study of auto insurance claim processing.

This paper explores the contestation and {{semantic}} uncertainty of ‘knowledge economy’ and ‘knowledge society’ in academic discourses, their emphatic usage in policy discourses {{and the ways}} in which media have responded to the increasing and pervasive use of these key phrases across several sectors of public life. In a detailed examination of a body of newspaper material containing references to the knowledge economy or knowledge society, it is observed that journalists are more likely to use such phrases in attribution to others than to appropriate them directly. Analysing the occurrence of selected phrases in Irish newspapers, the paper notes that media caution and (to a lesser degree) scepticism about the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the policy <b>commitment</b> to the knowledge economy grew as evidence became stronger of the emerging economic crisis.

This research was carried out in three phases: pre-development, conceptual development, and instrument try out. The data were analyzed using the item response theory partial credit model, {{confirmatory factor analysis}}, concurrent validity, convergent validity, and reliability coefficient. The result of this research is a teacher aptitude instrument that consists of three dimensions: pedagogical creativity, pedagogical commitment, and emotional intelligence. The three dimensions of the instrument have IRT PCM qualification. The result of CFA shows that the teacher aptitude instrument is fit. The coefficient of the reliability is high. The correlation between pedagogical creativity score and intelligence quotient score is low. The correlation between pedagogical commitment and Edwards Personal Preference Schedule score is sufficient. The correlation between emotional intelligence score and EPPS score is sufficient. The convergent <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> pedagogical <b>commitment</b> is high, while the convergent <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> emotional intelligence is high. Therefore the teacher aptitude instrument has a good content validity, construct validity, and convergent <b>validity,</b> while dimension <b>of</b> pedagogical <b>commitment</b> and emotional intelligence has sufficient concurrent <b>validity.</b> The coefficient <b>of</b> composite reliability of the instrument meets the minimum requirements. Therefore the teacher aptitude instrument could be used by LPTK as an aptitude test for student candidates.

40|$|AbstractThe most widely-used {{model in}} studies <b>of</b> {{organizational}} <b>commitment</b> is the three-dimensional model developed by Meyer and Allen in 1991. This model understands the construct as being composed of instrumental, affective, and normative dimensions. However, {{it has been}} criticized by researchers who do not view instrumental commitment as related to the concept <b>of</b> <b>commitment,</b> but instead as a possible organizational link. In order to address the conceptual and empirical problems of the instrument, Powell and Meyer perfected the sub-scale <b>of</b> instrumental <b>commitment</b> and recommended that a new scale, named Perceived Sacrifices Associated with Leaving, be used in future research. This article aims to adapt and obtain evidence <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the new scale, and analyze how teachers perceive the sacrifices associated with leaving a Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology. The scale has undergone cross-cultural adaptation and the adapted version was applied to teachers. Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis were applied, displaying evidence <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the construct for the Brazilian version. The results revealed that teachers agree on the high intensity level of the sacrifices associated with leaving, and that teachers who occupy management positions perceive it to a higher degree than others. The proposed changes in the scale should be evaluated in future research, and other studies are important to confirm the results found...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge workers, who {{typically}} enjoy global labour mobility, are considered critical {{to economic growth}} in developing countries. The purpose of this dissertation {{was to examine the}} organizational <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> South African knowledge workers, a commitment widely considered both improbable and unobtainable. In this study, a critical review <b>of</b> the organizational <b>commitment</b> literature, to ascertain its psychometric applicability to knowledge workers in South Africa, uncovered an unsystematic and fragmented body of research that has been imperfectly integrated in previous research models. A new definition <b>of</b> organizational <b>commitment</b> is therefore developed to account for current contextual complexities and theoretical advances in commitment research (e. g. multiple foci, variable duration, and changing intensities). A mixed-method research design was used in all stages of the investigation. To establish the construct validity and practical <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the organizational <b>commitment</b> construct, a multidisciplinary explanatory model was developed based on the extant literature and focus group discussions with knowledge workers. To test the proposed model, a self-administered survey questionnaire was developed. A total of 637 usable questionnaires from knowledge workers employed in the accounting and information technology occupations in both the public and private sector were analysed using a variety of statistical techniques, primarily hierarchical regression analysis and structural equation modelling. Particular care was taken that appropriate and strict statistical criteria guided the analyses. The survey results were then presented to focus groups for discussion. The results clearly evidence the widely accepted three-component structure <b>of</b> organizational <b>commitment</b> but provide new insight into {{the nature of the relationship}} between the commitment components. The veracity of a multiple foci approach is demonstrated and interaction effects between commitment bases and commitment foci are examined. The results are mixed concerning the proposed model, which required revision after the psychometric analyses. Overall, however, the results are both surprising and encouraging. Surprising given the evidence of high levels <b>of</b> organizational <b>commitment</b> amongst knowledge workers, and encouraging given the amount of variance explained in salient organizational outcomes such as turnover intentions (37 %) and boosting behaviour (24 %). Analysis per employment sector showed no overall effect of sector in the regression models but further analyses showed different patterns of significant antecedents amongst knowledge workers employed in the public and private sectors. The empirical findings and theoretical position of this study challenge prevailing assumptions about the organizational <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> knowledge workers and provide refreshment to both scholars and practitioners faced with the development of new management approaches and insights.

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} {{was to develop a}} psychometrically sound measure of coach identity prominence. This dissertation was divided into three manuscripts. The first manuscript was designed to gain a more in-depth understanding of the coach identity. Coaches (n = 8) participated in semi-structured interviews and answered questions pertaining to the meanings and prominence of the coach identity. Participants’ responses were used to create the initial 20 items of the Coach Identity Prominence Scale (CIPS). Manuscript 2 included three studies; item generation and pilot study, Study 1, and Study 2. The item generation and pilot study was designed to investigate the technical qualities and the content <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the CIPS items. Six construct and 10 context specialists served as participants in this study. Based on participants’ responses, 13 items that were deemed technically sound and demonstrated adequate content validity were selected to serve as the CIPS items. Study 1 and Study 2 assessed the reliability and factorial <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the CIPS items. Additionally, Study 2 investigated the group invariance, concurrent validity, and nomological <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the CIPS items. Coach participants in Study 1 (n = 343) and Study 2 (n = 454) completed the CIPS, while participants in Study 2 also completed a measure <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> (Raedeke, 2004). The results of both studies demonstrated evidence of reliability and factorial <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> participants’ scores on the CIPS. Based on the results of Study 1, eight items were selected and were assigned to one of the two subscales (centrality, 5 items; evaluative emotions, 3 items).

The relationship between football club and shirt sponsor {{is an important one}} for both parties leading them to routinely profess their commitment to one another. Common notions <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> are often associated with long-term relationships, although evidence from the sponsorship literature contradicts this. Many football shirt sponsorship deals are short-term, often accompanied by a low rate of contract renewal. In this context, the study therefore sets out to identify determinants <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> in the dyadic relationship between English professional football clubs and their shirt sponsors. A review of printed and electronic media is initially undertaken to confirm the relevance of the study. This forms the basis for a subsequent examination of critical incident interview data which leads {{to the development of a}} questionnaire which was despatched to clubs and sponsors, achieving a response rate of 60. 4 %. Returns have been analysed using factor and multiple regression analyses in order to identify statistically significant determinants <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> A final research stage involving structured face-to-face interviews within six sponsorship dyads is presented to establish the generalisability and <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> findings. Following the review of printed and electronic media,used term in shirt sponsorship programmes and the critical incident interviews highlight nine determinants <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> questionnaire returns indicates three variables (shared values, perceived benefits and opportunistic behavior) are statistically significant determinants <b>of</b> sponsorship <b>commitment.</b> Further analysis <b>of</b> dyadic interview data results in the development of a typology which highlights the nature and characteristics <b>of</b> four sponsorship <b>commitment</b> types (Calculators and Commercials, Cynics and Short-Termers, Carers and Communals, and Innocents and Indifferents). In the light of these findings, the study concludes by examining issues and implications for academics, practitioners and researchers. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{questions}} the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the definition <b>of</b> union <b>commitment</b> {{derived from the}} literature on organisational commitment.

The definition of 'union commitment' developed in this paper attempts to anticipate this by adopting Granovetter's concept of embeddedness and Marx's concept of class consciousness.

Our examination of the principles of direct effect indicates, however, that reliance on this concept may cause difficulties for national courts. Secondly, the principle of national procedural autonomy requires that enforcement proceedings will be governed by the procedural rules of the national court seized of the action.

Instead, we argue that general organizational commitment can best be conceived <b>of</b> as affective <b>commitment</b> only, being a genuine attitude towards an object: the organization. Normative and continuance commitment, in contrast, appear to be attitudes regarding specific forms of behavior (i. e., staying or leaving) {{that may or may not}} follow from the affective bond with the organization. The conclusion of our analysis is that the threecomponent model fails to qualify as a general model <b>of</b> organizational <b>commitment,</b> but instead represents a specific model to predict turnover behavior. Therefore, we suggest limiting the use of the TCM to predicting turnover and to abandon it as a general model <b>of</b> employee <b>commitment.</b> We propose to return to the conceptualization <b>of</b> organizational <b>commitment</b> as an attitude towards the organization and to use Eagly & Chaiken’s model to generate specific models for predicting a broad range of organizational behaviors. Finally, we discuss the definition and measurement <b>of</b> organizational <b>commitment,</b> arguing that covering affective, cognitive and behavioral facets of this attitude helps to differentiate the construct from other constructs and to enhance the construct <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> measurement instruments. management and organization theory;...|$|R
40|$|In his essay, Philosophical Reflections on Experimenting with Human Subjects, Hans Jonas {{contends that}} except {{in cases of}} {{widespread}} medical emergencies, {{people do not have}} a moral or social obligation to volunteer to be subjects in medical experiments. He further argues that any appeal for volunteer subjects in medical experiments should whenever possible give priority to those who can identify with the project and offer a strong sense <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to its goals. The first of these claims is given support against some recent criticisms, but argument is offered to show that the second claim not only does little to enhance the stature of the standard requirement of free and informed consent but may even weaken the moral <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the consent...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} various conceptualisations <b>of</b> organisational <b>commitment</b> and posits {{an inclusive}} model <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> derived {{in part from}} past research endeavours. Our proposed framework captures six subfactors <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> framed within five themes (emotion, finance, esteem, culture and focus). The relationship <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to strategy {{and the role of}} strategy in determining antecedents <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> are then examined. Additionally, commitment as an intervening variable affected by and affecting various antecedents and consequences respectively are discussed. Finally, the framework is used to identify further areas of research into this important organisational concept. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that relationship quality {{consists of three}} dimensions, i. e. satisfaction, trust, and commitment {{but there is no}} research about relationship between the dimensions. Data were gathered from 267 consumers of saloon service in 7 locations. The findings suggest that satisfaction is a positive predictor of trust. Satisfaction is a positive predictor <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Trust is a positive predictor <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b>  Satisfaction is a direct predictor <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> or an indirect predictor <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> via trust...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and measure the effects of Hofstede‟s cultural factors on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> for hospitality managers among American and Chinese managers. Typical cultural factors include power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism and collectivism, masculinity and femininity, and orientation. Escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> refers to making decisions in risky circumstances. First, the effect of cultural factors on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> was measured through antecedents (mediator variables). Second, the first effect of antecedents on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> was measured through agency and negative framing effects. Structural equation modeling (SEM) found significant relationships between cultural factors and mediator variables, mediator variables and escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and cultural factors and escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> The comparisons between American and Chinese managers showed that some of the cultural factors and antecedents (mediator variables) were found to have different significant impacts on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Implication and discussion were discussed in terms of employee training, job assigning, and close monitoring based on employee tendency for escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Limitations and recommendations for future research were also discussed in terms of unsatisfactory level of measurement reliability and variance explained by the research model...|$|R

The study also assesses {{the direction and}} strength {{of the relationship between}} OCB and its predictors <b>of</b> affective <b>commitment,</b> procedural justice, leadership trust and incentive satisfaction. 112 public school teachers from ten randomly chosen schools participated. The results showed that cash incentive satisfaction had incremental validity over the other three predictors in predicting OCB with variance accounted for jumping from 22...|$|R
