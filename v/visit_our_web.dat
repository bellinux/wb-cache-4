40|$|The 2 -dimensional {{barcodes}} {{known as}} QR (Quick Response) Codesare increasing their popularity {{as they appear}} in more places in theurban environment. QR Codes {{can be considered as}} physical hyper-linksthat give the ability to users to access, through their mobile devicesthat are able to scan QR Codes, additional information located in aweb-page. Apart from marketing, QR Codes have been also adopted indifferent areas such as the on-line payments. This development alongwith the trend that some of the users may follow which indicates toscan unauthenticated data, such as QR Codes located in public places,motivated us to investigate how QR Codes can be used as an attackvector. We first developed an implementation which attempts to brute-force QR Codes by attacking directly the modules, aiming to retrieve analternated URL upon scanning the QR Code and after having appliedthe module changes. Our implementation showed us that such an attackis unfeasible in a real attack scenario. However, the second approachthat we followed, in which we attacked the binary representation of theencoded string, we managed to produce the desired result. Furthermore,we conducted an empirical study aiming to identify the users? level ofsecurity awareness concerning the security issues related to QR Codes. The on-line survey that was accessible through our QR Code stickers,was our mean of interaction with the users. We deployed our stickers in 4 European cities (Vienna, Helsinki, Athens and Paris) and we managed toattract 273 individuals that scanned and <b>visited</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> pages. Out ofthese visitors, 83 participants completed our online survey. The resultscollected indicate that users are motivated mainly by their curiosity andthey have serious lack of knowledge on the potential threats and the waysto protect themselves. </p...|$|R

40|$|As this is {{the first}} {{newsletter}} in my tenure as chair of the Site Remediation Committee, let me take this opportunity to greet all committee members, and to proudly offer to you our issue on the theme of contaminated sediments. Our committee strives to bring together legal and technical expertise and points of view on specific issues in site remediation, and this issue shows how well the concept can work. We are pleased to present (in no particular order), an analysis of natural resource damages claims in sediment sites; a proposal for streamlining the remedial investigation and feasibility study process at sediment sites; a discussion of assigning costs for restoring urban rivers, co-authored by a former Section chair; an analysis of the use of Superfund to deal with contaminated sediments in urban waterways and embayments; and a study of special considerations for conducting remedial investigations at sediment sites. In the coming year we will be looking into new themes for newsletters. If there is a particular theme of interest to you, please contact me or one of our Newsletter vice chairs, Peter Hapke or Karen Mignone. If you have an article or would like to prepare an article on such a topic, even better! We love volunteers! We love volunteers and we NEED volunteers to make this committee even more active.
