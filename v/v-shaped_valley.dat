5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valley,</b> indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the river}} valley is {{subsequently}} subject to glaciation, glacial erosion widens the <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valley</b> and removes {{the ends of}} the interlock spurs projecting into the valley. As a result, the ridges are truncated to form truncated spurs.|$|E

50|$|The {{relief of}} the natural {{environment}} {{is characterized by a}} distinctive ridge with steep hillsides, extending from the Pickelhaube (360.7 m above sea level (NHN)) in the north to the Rahnfels and the Heidenfels (496.0 m) in the south, and which drops steeply to the Eckbach valley, the Upper Rhine Plain and, especially, into the Isenach valley by 250 to 300 metres in altitude. Rivers both large and small have cut deeply into the sandstone beds, so that the landscape has a varied topography with <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys,</b> rock formations and cliffs. Larger valleys include the Langental to the northwest of the spur and the Krumbach valley beginning at the Ungeheuersee and running in a northeasterly direction as far as the Kleinkarlbach stream. In the south, on the other hand, the hill range is only drained by a few smaller streams that flow in narrow <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys</b> into the Isenach.|$|R
50|$|Glaciers, while {{geographically}} restricted, {{are effective}} agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking {{of the underlying}} rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, {{as opposed to the}} <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys</b> of fluvial origin.|$|R
5000|$|The ridges (Eggen or [...] "edges") of the Ardey {{are covered}} by beech woods.

Traces of historic woodland usages like coppicing, wood pasture and charcoal burning may still be found in many places today.|$|R
50|$|The headstreams in {{the valley}} do not carry water all year round; but have {{nonetheless}} carved out the <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valley.</b> In the post-glacial period the quantities of water flowing out of the Central Uplands were greater, so that the streams were able to cut down more strongly into the terrain than they are today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Malaria in {{the western}} Kenya {{highlands}} is characterized by unstable and high transmission variability which results in epidemics during periods of suitable climatic conditions. The sensitivity of a site to malaria epidemics depends {{on the level of}} immunity of the human population. This study examined how terrain in the highlands affects exposure and sensitivity of a site to malaria. Methods The study was conducted in five sites {{in the western}} Kenya highlands, two U-shaped valleys (Iguhu, Emutete), two <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys</b> (Marani, Fort-Ternan) and one plateau (Shikondi) for 16 months among 6 - 15 years old children. Exposure to malaria was tested using circum-sporozoite protein (CSP) and merozoite surface protein (MSP) immunochromatographic antibody tests; malaria infections were tested by microscopic examination of thick and thin smears, the children's homes were georeferenced using a global positioning system. Paired t-test was used to compare the mean prevalence rates of the sites, K-function was use to determine if the clustering of malaria infections was significant. Results and Discussion The mean antibody prevalence was 22. 6 % in Iguhu, 24 % in Emutete, 11. 5 % in Shikondi, 8. 3 % in Fort-Ternan and 9. 3 % in Marani. The mean malaria infection prevalence was 23. 3 % in Iguhu, 21. 9 % in Emutete, 4. 7 % in Shikondi, 2. 9 % in Fort-Ternan and 2. 4 % in Marani. There was {{a significant difference in the}} antibodies and malaria infection prevalence between the two valley systems, and between the two valley systems and the plateau (P 0. 05). There was 8. 5 - fold and a 2 -fold greater parasite and antibody prevalence respectively, in the U-shaped compared to the <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys.</b> The plateau antibody and parasite prevalence was similar to that of the <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys.</b> There was clustering of malaria antibodies and infections around flat areas in the U-shaped valleys, the infections were randomly distributed in the <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys</b> and less clustered at the plateau. Conclusion This study showed that the V-shaped ecosystems have very low malaria prevalence and few individuals with an immune response to two major malaria antigens and they can be considered as epidemic hotspots. These populations are at higher risk of severe forms of malaria during hyper-transmission seasons. The plateau ecosystem has a similar infection and immune response to the V-shaped ecosystems. The U-shaped ecosystems are transmission hotspots...|$|R
50|$|Along the Ruhr the Ardey has {{a decidedly}} hilly {{character}} with large height differences, steep, rocky slopes and deep <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys.</b> Seen {{from the north}} and east the Ardey Hills have a gentler appearance. Here there are gently curved hilltops covered in woods and meadows. Due to its proximity to the city of Dortmund and town of Witten the northern edge of the hills is a popular residential area and, as a result, densely populated.|$|R
5000|$|The Mensinger Ravine is {{a typical}} example of a Siepe, a narrow, wet, ravine-like, <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valley</b> in higher hills or low {{mountains}} with a source stream. (in the East Westphalian region of Ravensberg Land and in the Lipperland such a terrain feature {{is known as a}} Siek). The source streams in such a valley do not necessarily carry water all-year round, {{as in the case of}} that in the Mensiger Ravine, however, the stream is the reason the <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valley</b> was formed. It must however be taken into account for terrain shaping, that in the post ice age the water levels flowing out of the mountain ranges, including the Wiehen, were greater, so that streams were able to cut into the terrain much more than they do today. This is the reason the ravine is so deep despite the rather low levels of water flow on the ravine floor today.|$|E
50|$|The Kiso Valley (Kiso-dani) is a {{geographical}} area that {{centers on the}} valley of the upper portions of the Kiso River in the southwestern part of Nagano Prefecture in Japan.

50|$|Triberg Falls {{is one of}} {{the highest}} waterfalls in Germany with a descent of 163 m (at between 711 and 872 metres above sea level), and is a {{landmark}} in the Black Forest region. Above Triberg, in the midst of Black Forest, the Gutach river plunges over seven major steps from a gently undulated high plain into a rocky <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|E
50|$|The very steep-sided <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys</b> {{that are}} typical of the Keuper Uplands are known here as klingen. Such klingen occur in the petrographically harder {{sandstone}} beds of the keuper, for example in the Stubensandstein. These rocks are able to resist significantly the erosion forces (especially side erosion) of water. In less erosion-resistant rocks of the keuper like the clays or marls, the valleys are more deeply carved out so that many wider-profiled valley are formed.|$|R
50|$|The Ōi River {{flows from}} the Akaishi Mountains, the branch of the Japanese Southern Alps which form the border between Shizuoka, Nagano and Yamanashi prefectures. These mountains, with peaks ranging from 2000-3000 meters, are {{characterized}} by heavy rainfall (up to 3000 mm per year) and deep <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys.</b> The river follows a generally southern course, with seven wide bends in its central region, before exiting into Suruga Bay in the Philippine Sea.|$|R
5000|$|The {{description}} klinge {{for small}} <b>V-shaped</b> <b>valleys</b> may {{derive from the}} noise of the streams when in spate (klingen in German means [...] "ring" [...] "clang" [...] or [...] "jingle"). Another interpretation maintains that the little valleys were supposed to be cut by blades ("Klinge" [...] = blade). In the whole of southwest Germany, including the Swabian and Franconian Jura, this sort of valley is known as a Klinge, Tobel or Klamm.|$|R
