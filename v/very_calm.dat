25|$|During the Santa Ana winds, large ocean waves can develop. These waves {{come from}} a northeasterly direction; toward the {{normally}} sheltered side of Catalina Island. Protected harbors such as Avalon and Two Harbors are normally sheltered and the waters within the harbors are <b>very</b> <b>calm.</b> In strong Santa Ana conditions, these harbors develop high surf and strong winds that can tear boats from their moorings and crash them onto the shore. During a Santa Ana, it is advised that boaters moor {{on the back side}} of the island to avoid the dangerous conditions of the front side.|$|E
25|$|No large all galley battles were fought {{after the}} {{gigantic}} clash at Lepanto in 1571, and galleys were mostly used as cruisers or for supporting sailing warships as a rearguard in fleet actions, {{similar to the}} duties performed by frigates outside the Mediterranean. They could assist damaged ships out of the line, but generally only in <b>very</b> <b>calm</b> weather, {{as was the case}} at the Battle of Málaga in 1704. For small states and principalities as well as groups of private merchants, galleys were more affordable than large and complex sailing warships, and were used as defense against piracy. Galleys required less timber to build, the design was relatively simple and they carried fewer guns. They were tactically flexible and could be used for naval ambushes as well amphibious operations. They also required few skilled seamen and were difficult for sailing ships to catch, but vital in hunting down catching other galleys and oared raiders.|$|E
25|$|While off {{the burning}} Tysami, at 11:00 pm the Chui A-poo {{and his men}} were spotted in {{fourteen}} large junks heading southwest in two lines of seven vessels. Hay ordered his men to battle stations, raised his colors and then gave chase. The wind was <b>very</b> <b>calm</b> but Hay counted on this as it meant his steam ships could advance while the junks could barely move. At 11:45 the Columbine fired the first shots at the largest junk closest to her. The British scored some hits {{but not enough to}} disable any of the junks. From there on the battle continued for several hours as the Columbine chased the pirates, occasionally exchanging fire. The pirates were searching for some sort of waterway to escape but they found none and it was not until noon the following morning on September 29 that the main action occurred. Chui A-poo was heading west followed by Columbine when the Canton appeared, roughly in front of the war-junks. Seeing the chase, Cantons commander Lieutenant Bridges changed course into the direction of the pirates in order to assist Commander Hay.|$|E

25|$|A small {{force of}} corvettes {{proceeded}} the LCAs to their landing beaches in Ambararata Bay, sweeping mines clear and placing navigational lights to mark safe {{passage through the}} rocks, enabling the flotillas to land 29th Brigade without casualties. The beaches here were designated Blue for the South Lancashire Regiment and {{the balance of the}} East Lancashires north of the bay, White for the Royal Welch Fusiliers in the centre, and Green for the Royal Scots Fusiliers {{at the south end of}} the bay. Touch down was 04:45, 1¼ hours before sunrise (06:06 on 5.5.42). The landings were made in darkness, though with almost a half-moon in the sky. Also, the sea was <b>very</b> <b>calm.</b> Complete surprise was achieved, against light or no opposition, as the Vichy French believed navigating through the reefs and rocks efficiently in the dark was not likely. After retracting, the LCAs began making return trips back and forth with reinforcements and equipment. When the sun rose, the landing craft crews in Courrier Bay discovered that they were surrounded by jagged rocks that continued as far out to seaward as they could see.|$|E
25|$|The {{guns were}} still {{operable}} so Brooke had his men return the pirates' fire. No hits were made but near hits forced the pirates {{to leave their}} wounded and abandon ship without fighting. Brooke then decided on rescuing the survivors {{though most of the}} Sulus took their weapons into the water and continued to fight. The captain also had his men refloat the steamer which was done somewhat easily. Few pirates were recovered according to McDougall and when they saved all that could be, the Rainbow and the Jolly Bachelor continued on slowly down the coast. During this time one of the pirates said that there were three more prahus nearby which were waiting for the three already engaged to rejoin them. After an hour the weather was <b>very</b> <b>calm</b> and a lookout at the masthead spotted the three enemy ships to the starboard, lining up to bear their bow guns on the approaching steamers. However, when the wind picked up again the pirates changed their tactics and hoisted sail to move their ships into broadside position. As the Sarawakians neared the pirates they opened up with their swivels but Brooke waited until his ships were 250 yards away before he gave his men the order to return the fire.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is <b>very</b> <b>calm</b> and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E

One widely accepted framework used to classify these diverse emotional experiences describes emotion in two orthogo-nal dimensions: Valence is a continuum specifying how negative or positive an event is, whereas arousal refers to the intensity of an event, ranging from <b>very</b> <b>calming</b> to highly exciting or agitating (e. g., Lang, Greenwald, Brad-ley, & Hamm, 1993; Mehrabian & Russell, 1974; Russell, 1980).

50|$|Sevagram ashram was the {{residence}} of Mahatma Gandhi from 1936 to 1948. After his 1930 Dandi salt march, Gandhi decided not {{to return to his}} ashram at Sabarmati. After spending two years in jail, he travelled around India and, at the invitation of the Gandhian industrialist Jamnalal Bajaj., stayed for some time in Wardha City at Jamnalal's bungalow. In 1936, at the age of 67, Gandhiji moved to a village (which he subsequently called Sewagram - Hindi for village of service) at the outskirts of Wardha and started to live here in a group of huts with his wife Kasturba and other disciples. This slowly grew into an ashram, where Gandhi lived with his followers for the next twelve years, till his death.

500|$|In {{addition}} to Scuzzlebutt, [...] "Volcano" [...] included the first appearances of recurring characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is identified {{only as the}} South Park geologist, {{and it is only}} in the episode [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] that he is first introduced as Stan's father. Parker, who provides the voice of Randy Marsh, said the design, voice, and personality of the character are based on his real-life father, who works as a geologist for the United States Geological Survey. Parker said his father is <b>very</b> <b>calm</b> in real life and Randy's relaxed reaction to learning of the volcano—calmly sipping his coffee—is [...] "about how my dad would react to anything". The look of the Ned character was based on a drawing Parker made in high school, although the character did not originally have a voice box. The voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, where Parker and Stone would visit while attending the University of Colorado. The duo said they would go to the restaurant just to hear her voice, but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders. Stone and Parker had trouble creating the right voice for the character; they tried putting the microphone directly on their throat, and also bought an actual voice box, but ultimately decided that the best way to provide the character's voice was with natural voice simulation.|$|E

500|$|Rumours {{about the}} Night of the Long Knives rapidly spread. Although many Germans {{approached}} the official {{news of the}} events as described by Joseph Goebbels {{with a great deal}} of scepticism, many others took the regime at its word, and believed that Hitler had saved Germany from a descent into chaos. Luise Solmitz, a Hamburg schoolteacher, echoed the sentiments of many Germans when she cited Hitler's [...] "personal courage, decisiveness and effectiveness" [...] in her private diary. She even compared him to Frederick the Great, the 18th-century King of Prussia. Others were appalled at the scale of the executions and at the relative complacency of many of their fellow Germans. [...] "A <b>very</b> <b>calm</b> and easy going mailman," [...] the diarist Victor Klemperer wrote, [...] "who is not at all National Socialist, said, 'Well, he simply sentenced them.'" [...] It did not escape Klemperer's notice that many of the victims had played a role in bringing Hitler to power. [...] "A chancellor", he wrote, [...] "sentences and shoots members of his own private army!" [...] The extent of the massacre and the relative ubiquity of the Gestapo, however, meant that those who disapproved of the purge generally kept quiet about it. Among the few exceptions were General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord and Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who started a campaign to have Schleicher rehabilitated by Hitler. Hammerstein, who was a close friend of Schleicher, had been much offended at Schleicher's funeral when the SS refused to allow him to attend the service and confiscated the wreaths that the mourners had brought. Besides working for the rehabilitation of Schleicher and Bredow, Hammerstein and Mackensen sent a memo to Hindenburg on July 18 setting out in considerable detail the circumstances of the murders of the two generals and noted that Papen had barely escaped. The memo went on to demand that Hindenburg punish those responsible, and criticised Blomberg for his outspoken support of the murders of Schleicher and Bredow. Finally, Hammerstein and Mackensen asked that Hindenburg reorganise the government by firing Baron Konstantin von Neurath, Robert Ley, Hermann Göring, Werner von Blomberg, Joseph Goebbels and Richard Walther Darré from the Cabinet. Instead, the memo asked that Hindenburg create a directorate to rule Germany comprising the Chancellor (who was not named), General Werner von Fritsch as Vice-Chancellor, Hammerstein as Minister of Defense, the Minister for National Economy (also unnamed) and Rudolf Nadolny as Foreign Minister. The request that Neurath be replaced by Nadolny, the former Ambassador to Moscow who had resigned earlier that year in protest against Hitler's anti-Soviet foreign policy, indicated that Hammerstein and Mackensen wanted a return to the [...] "distant friendliness" [...] towards the Soviet Union that existed until 1933. Mackensen and Hammerstein ended their memo with: ...|$|E
