500|$|In {{his time}} with the institute, Moser {{continued}} his taxonomic studies. In 1953, he published {{the first edition of}} his Die Blätter und Bauchpilze (Agaricales und Gastromycetes), a monograph of the Agaricales and Gastromycetes of central Europe, containing 3150 taxa. The work served as an update on Adalbert Ricken's <b>Vademecum</b> für Pilzfreunde (1918), though reflecting Moser's taxonomic views, which were highly influenced by Singer. The book was part of a series named Kleine Kryptogamenﬂora Mitteleuropa, edited by Helmut Gams. The work, which became known simply as [...] "Moser", was updated and republished numerous times over the following decades, and translated into both Italian and English, with the latter translation being sponsored by Roger Phillips. His monograph on the Agaricales was also published separately from this work. René Pomerleau described a 1967 reprint of the Agaricales monograph, containing descriptions of 2547 species, as [...] "probably the most complete and up-to-date descriptive flora of this group of fungi for central Europe". Die Blätter und Bauchpilze (Agaricales und Gastromycetes) became important for the study of biodiversity in and out of Europe, and was a [...] "much used and appreciated field manual". The work continued to be used as an authoritative reference for several decades; in 1981, it was still being called [...] "the most-used and most authoritative handbook on larger European fleshy fungi".|$|E

30|$|This work is thus {{aimed at}} {{developing}} {{a prototype of}} real-time simulator for pancreatic surgery (very few examples exist, see [18]), able of providing an immersive response for surgery training and planning. This simulator {{should be able to}} run in standard laptops, without any supercomputing facility, thus being able {{to be used in the}} operating room (OR). In this framework, ta PGD-based surgery simulator here developed is composed by the necessary number of organ <b>vademecums</b> (depending on the particular type of surgery considered). These organ <b>vademecums,</b> that provide the system with each organ response to an applied load at any point of its surface, are then assembled together by considering their relative contact, giving finally a very realistic haptic sensation and immersive feeling.|$|R
50|$|ComCal {{developed}} {{the so called}} LST software, a software solution that converted reference works such as encyclopedias or pharmaceutical <b>vademecums</b> to large datebases, making those works computer-readable. LST software processed the same SGML format (precursor of HTML) files used by publishers. In the pre-Internet era, the possibilities of this technology were revolutionary.|$|R
30|$|This paper proposes an {{original}} approach to simulate AFP composites manufacturing processes. First, using a spatial transformation to match a reference domain, {{the number of}} plies composing the laminate was considered as model parameter and then as problem extra-coordinate within the PGD framework. Different parametric solutions (computational <b>vademecums)</b> were defined by incorporating model parameters, boundary conditions and geometrical parameters. These parametric solutions were then used in order to define the heating laws in a very simple and efficient manner. The online use of all these offline pre-computed solutions allows for real time simulation, optimization and simulation based control of heating in AFP processes. Even if the offline calculations could be expensive from the computational point of view, they are performed offline and only once. Then, further online calculation are accomplished under the real-time constraint, opening a plethora of unimaginable and appealing possibilities.|$|R

40|$|Proper Generalized Decomposition methods {{allow to}} obtain an {{efficient}} solution for multi-parametric problems {{without the need for}} simulating numerous problems to obtain a response surface. Instead, PGD obtains a priori a reduced solution {{in the form of a}} finite sum of sep-arable functions, easy to store in memory so as to be evaluated under real-time constraints. The present work proposes to use this tool to optimize the main RTM process parameters, the injection flow rate and the injection/mould temperature, in order to ensure the complete filling of the mould and reasonable fabrication costs (fabrication time, mould heating). To do so, the two process parameters should be introduced in the model as new coordinates, and the Proper Generalized Decomposition method used to solve the multiparametric model then obtained. By using this procedure, we could build computational <b>vademecums,</b> having the two parameters of interest as coordinates, allowing the fabricant to define the best compromise between injec-tion time and process cost (mould heating) while ensuring the complete filling of the mould. In this work, after revisiting some applications of PGD in RTM processes, the separability of parametric RTM solutions will be evaluated. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{excellent}} and useful book {{is based on}} the early editions of J. C. Willis’s ‘Dictionary of the flowering plants and ferns’. Those early works have been called ‘the most remarkable botanical works of reference ever written – true <b>vademecums</b> for every botanists’s pocket’ (Prof. P. W. Richards). The last edition dates as far back as 1931. After that time the late Dr. Airy Shaw changed the format drastically in making a catalogue which is very useful in its own and ornates nearly every botanist‘s desk. But most of the general information had to be deleted. The omitted data were gathered again and updated by F. N. Howes of Kew, but because of his untimely death the book was not published. It is Dr. Mabberley’s merit to have taken up the task again and even to finish it. Thus a tremendous amount of general information on plants is given to be used as well by botanists as by other people who are professionally or just {{for the fun of it}} interested in this kind of information. Mabberley has taken a broad approach to family and genus concept, convinced by the arguments of the late Professor Van Steenis and Davis and Heywood. For the user this makes the book easier to work with than Airy Shaw’s editions with all that small split-off families and genera. In case of doubt Mabberley uses the broader concept, but includes entries of all the accepted and most common synonymous names. Sometimes the author of a recent revision is added, sometimes not. If a recent revision of an entire group exists the reference is given...|$|R
