50|$|<b>Vinasse</b> is a {{byproduct}} of the sugar industry. Sugarcane or Sugar beet is processed to produce crystalline sugar, pulp and molasses. The latter are further processed by fermentation to ethanol, ascorbic acid or other products. After {{the removal of the}} desired product (alcohol, ascorbic acid, etc.) the remaining material is called <b>vinasse.</b> <b>Vinasse</b> is sold after a partial dehydration and usually has a viscosity comparable to molasses. Commercially offered <b>vinasse</b> comes either from sugar cane and is called cane-vinasse or from sugar beet and is called beet-vinasse.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vinasse</b> {{can be used}} as a basal {{medium for}} Haematococcus pluvialis culture. The <b>vinasse</b> culture medium consist of <b>vinasse</b> diluted to 3% and {{supplemented}} with 0.7% NaCl, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. A 0.4 g.L-1 quantity of inoculum can be used for the initial culture (cells in vegetative growth). The culture must be performed with 0.5 vvm air at 25°C, and until 15 days of culture.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the process}} of {{distillation}} of the alcohol {{and as a result}} of the heating in the distillation process, in the pulp of the beet reactions of condensation and predominantly molecular ruptures take place. This causes a high fulvic acid concentration in this byproduct. One use of <b>vinasse</b> is in thermophilic digesters. In Brazil thermophilic digester is a source of biogas using pure and hot <b>vinasse</b> as the source of production of methane. In the past, <b>vinasse</b> was a problem in production of ethanol, but <b>vinasse</b> is also a good fertilizer (at least for some time) and a source of methane that can be used to generate heat or electricity. Moreover, other uses of <b>vinasse</b> involving also the formulation of nutritive solutions for hydroponics, formulation of culture media for plant tissue culture [...] and culture media for algal growth.|$|E
50|$|The two {{greatest}} {{sources of}} water pollution from ethanol production come from mills {{in the form}} of waste water from washing sugarcane stems prior to passing through mills, and <b>vinasse,</b> produced in distillation. These sources increase the biochemical oxygen demand in the waters where they are discharged which leads to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in the water and often causes anoxia. Legislation has banned the direct discharge of <b>vinasse</b> onto surface waters, leading it to be mixed with waste water from the sugarcane washing process to be reused as organic fertilizer on sugarcane fields. Despite this ban, some small sugarcane mills still discharge <b>vinasse</b> into streams and rivers {{due to a lack of}} transportation and application resources. Furthermore, <b>vinasse</b> is sometimes mishandled in storage and transport in mills.|$|E
50|$|Treated <b>vinasse</b> is {{originated}} by a decantation and filtration process.|$|E
50|$|A {{thermophilic}} digester or thermophilic biodigester {{is a kind}} of biodigester {{that operates}} in temperatures above 50 °C producing biogas. It has some advantages: it does not need agitation and is faster in fermentation than a mesophilic digester. In fact, it can be as much as six to ten times faster than a normal biodigester. The problem is that for use in this biodigester, the source must enter at high temperature. <b>Vinasse</b> is produced at more than 70 °C and can be used in this kind of biodigester. For each unit of volume of ethanol, about eight units of <b>vinasse</b> are produced. In Brazil, this kind of biodigester is used to process <b>vinasse</b> as a cheap source of methane.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Manuelita Azúcar y Energía (Manuelita Sugar and Energy) is Colombia's oldest {{sugar mill}} and the {{original}} business of the Manuelita group of companies. Currently Manuelita Azúcar y Energía is served by 25,000 hectares of land, 15,000 of which are company owned, and has a crushing capacity of 10,000 tons of cane per day, making it the second largest mill in Colombia after Ingenio del Cauca, a mill that was founded by Harold Henry Eder Caicedo and the Manuelita Group in the 1950s. Currently, Manuelita Azúcar y Energía produces nearly 300,000 tons of high quality refined sugar per year, and has a fuel ethanol production capacity of 250,000 lts per day (80,000 m3/year). It is one of Colombia's first fuel bio ethanol producers and its most efficient producer. Given Manuelita's strict adherence to a sound environmental policy, the company's ethanol production process is geared to produce as little <b>vinasse</b> as possible (2 liters of <b>vinasse</b> per liter of ethanol vs. 12-20 liters of <b>vinasse</b> per liter of ethanol in standard plants).|$|E
50|$|In 2009 a 50% join-venture {{was made}} with Island Liquid Fertiliser, Evapo, to {{evaporate}} <b>vinasse</b> (a distillation residue), creating CMS, Concentrated Molasses Solids, which is a bio fertilizer. In 2011 Evapo was rebranded to TopTerra along when Harel Freres which was rebranded Terra.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} making the product begins with the raw {{material}} called pre-processed alcohol, which FANAL receives mainly from mills {{in the area of}} Guanacaste. The alcohol passes into the distillate area where it begins preparation, through columns whose primary function is to purify <b>vinasse.</b> Once purified, the alcohol is passed to the storage area.|$|E
50|$|Molasses-based distilleries {{all over}} the world {{generate}} large amount of effluent termed as spent wash or <b>vinasse.</b> For each liter of alcohol produced, around 8 liters of effluent is generated. This effluent has COD of 1,50,000 PPM and BOD of 60,000 PPM and even more. This effluent needs to be treated and the only effective method for conclusive disposal is by composting.|$|E
50|$|The used cossettes, or pulp, {{exit the}} {{diffuser}} at about 95% moisture, but low sucrose content. Using screw presses, the wet pulp is then pressed down to 75% moisture. This recovers additional sucrose in the liquid pressed {{out of the}} pulp, and reduces the energy needed to dry the pulp. The pressed pulp is dried and sold as animal feed, while the liquid pressed out of the pulp is combined with the raw juice, or more often introduced into the diffuser at the appropriate point in the countercurrent process. The final byproduct, <b>vinasse,</b> is used as fertilizer or growth substrate for yeast cultures.|$|E
50|$|Once harvested, {{sugarcane}} {{is usually}} {{transported to the}} plant by semi-trailer trucks. After quality control, sugarcane is washed, chopped, and shredded by revolving knives; the feedstock is fed to and extracted {{by a set of}} mill combinations to collect a juice, called garapa in Brazil, that contain 10-15% sucrose, and bagasse, the fiber residue. The main objective of the milling process is to extract the largest possible amount of sucrose from the cane, and a secondary but important objective is the production of bagasse with a low moisture content as boiler fuel, as bagasse is burned for electricity generation (see below), allowing the plant to be self-sufficient in energy and to generate electricity for the local power grid.The cane juice or garapa is then filtered and treated by chemicals and pasteurized. Before evaporation, the juice is filtered once again, producing <b>vinasse,</b> a fluid rich in organic compounds. The syrup resulting from evaporation is then precipitated by crystallization producing a mixture of clear crystals surrounded by molasses. A centrifuge is used to separate the sugar from molasses, and the crystals are washed by addition of steam, after which the crystals are dried by an airflow. Upon cooling, sugar crystallizes out of the syrup. From this point, the sugar refining process continues to produce different grades of sugar, and the molasses continue a separate process to produce ethanol.|$|E

The sugar and integrated industries company in Hawamdyia produces more than 2, 000 m of <b>vinasse.</b> The large amount of <b>vinasse</b> can harm the environment, causing salinization and river Nile pollution. Therefore it was though useful to try overcoming the created problem using it in agriculture land. Greenhouse experiment was conducted to assess and evaluate the nutritional value of <b>Vinasse</b> {{and its effect on}} nutrient uptake and yield production of wheat. <b>Vinasse</b> was applied at three rates 5, 10 and 20 mL L in irrigation water along the period of plant growing. The obtained data revealed that the addition of <b>vinasse</b> to sandy soil increased the productivity of wheat yield. Highest yield was obtained with 5 mL L of <b>vinasse</b> applied. Also <b>vinasse</b> application increased the uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The residual available N, P and K and organic matter in soil after harvesting generally increased with increasing rates of <b>vinasse</b> applied. As an organic fertilizer, the optimum level of addition of <b>vinasse</b> in sandy soil with irrigation was 5 mL L. Finally, it could be concluded that <b>vinasse</b> is a good source of available P and K when applied to soil and its application may reduce the amount of fertilizers required for optimum crop yield. It is suggested that <b>vinasse</b> could substitute for about 62 % of P and 100 % of K required for wheat yield...|$|E

40|$|<b>Vinasse,</b> {{which is}} {{commonly}} referred to as stillage, is a aqueous by-product of bioethanol processing. This side-product is yielded in a very large quantity in bioethanol industry since the production of 1 L of ethanol will generate 13 L of <b>vinasse.</b> Hence it is become a problem of bioethanol industry since <b>vinasse</b> waste doesn 2 ̆ 7 t have economic value and it is harmful to the environment. This industrial waste has high COD and BOD, high acidity, and high temperature when it is discharged from the bottom of distillation unit. To overwhelmed this drawbacks, it is crucial to attempt reduction of the negative characteristic of <b>vinasse</b> as well as creation of added value of <b>vinasse.</b> In fact, <b>vinasse</b> contains a considerable amount of potassium and organic matter which is beneficial for plant growth and improving the soil fertility.

The <b>vinasse</b> is produced in large quantities, because of the high volume ratio 1 : 10 - 15 of ethanol to <b>vinasse</b> and has been labelled an increasing environmental problem in South America. In a new proposed treatment process for <b>vinasse,</b> evaporation is used to concentrate the <b>vinasse</b> to be able to combust it in a boiler. In this thesis an experimental investigation was conducted on a pilot plant on the evaporation of <b>vinasse.</b> It was found possible to evaporate <b>vinasse</b> to a high dry solid content of at least 70 %.

The middle strip of the plots was compacted by three passes of the tractor-trailed <b>vinasse</b> sprayer producing the compacted treatment. During the experiment, the physical and chemical properties of the soil were measured as well as the plant growth and yield. It was found that the compacted plots had higher dry bulk density and soil strength, while <b>vinasse</b> rate and time of application effects were not significant. An increase in N, exchangeable Na +, K + and available Mn was caused by <b>vinasse</b> application. Compaction had a significant effect on plant growth, while <b>vinasse</b> rate and time of application effects were not significant. Yields were affected by weather conditions. In the compacted plots, the yields were generally lower but in the wet years they were also significant. Yields were higher at higher <b>vinasse</b> rates and lower for the application before ploughing in the autumn, indicating an adverse effect of that treatment.

40|$|The <b>vinasse</b> is a {{by-product}} generated during {{the manufacture of}} alcohol from sugarcane fermentation. Rich in organic matter, {{it is known that}} the <b>vinasse</b> {{has the potential to be}} used as a source of nutrients for plants as well as microorganisms. In this study, the fungi Pleurotus sajor-caju, P. ostreatus, P. albidus and P. flabellatus were cultivated in <b>vinasse</b> and utilised as a complementary diet for Danio rerio fish. The fungi mycelia cultured in <b>vinasse</b> for 15 days were lyophilised and offered to the fishes at a rate of 2 % (medium/body weight) for 28 days. P. albidus produced the highest biomass (16. 27 g L− 1). Bromatological analysis of mycelia showed similar values to commercial rations. Toxicity tests showed that fish survival was 100 % and no significant biomass loss was observed, indicating that the tested fungi grown in <b>vinasse</b> showed no toxicity. Our results showed that <b>vinasse</b> is a promising by-product for fungal growth and the mycelia of Pleurotus sp. fungi can be included in the diets of fish as a nutritional supplement...|$|E

The soil bioremediation was simulated in Bartha biometer flasks, used to measure the microbial CO 2 production, during 48 days, where <b>vinasse</b> was added at a concentration of 33 mL. Kg- 1 of soil. Biodegradation efficiency was also measured by quantifying the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) by gas chromatography. The groundwater bioremediation was carried out in laboratory experiments simulating aerated (bioreactors) and not aerated (BOD flasks) conditions. In both the cases, the concentration of <b>vinasse</b> was 5 % (v/v) and different physicochemical parameters were evaluated during 20 days. Although an increase in the soil fertility and microbial population were obtained with the <b>vinasse,</b> it demonstrated not to be adequate to enhance the bioremediation efficiency of diesel oil contaminated soils. The addition of the <b>vinasse</b> in the contaminated groundwaters had negative effects on the biodegradation of the hydrocarbons, since <b>vinasse,</b> as a labile carbon source, was preferentially consumed...|$|E
