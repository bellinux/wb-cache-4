40|$|ABSTRACT The present paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} and numerical study regarding air dehumidification {{by means of}} a hydrophobic membrane contactor and LiCl desiccant solution. The desiccant-membrane systems offer several potential benefits: large working membrane area per unit volume, no carryover of liquid-phase droplets, no pollution of the liquid phase by atmospheric dust, good dehumidification efficiency, potential high-efficiency control {{of the quality of the}} handled air. A plane-plate cross-flow contactor, made up of composite PVDF membranes and able to handle air flow rates of about 200 m 3 /h, has been constructed. The heat and <b>vapour</b> <b>mass</b> transfer between the liquid phase and the process air is analysed. The membrane contactor behaviour has been studied {{by means of a}}n experimental apparatus. Thermodynamic conditions and flow rates of air and LiCl solution have been measured at the inlet and outlet of the test section. Experiments have been carried out using different air and solution mass flow rates. A computer code able to study the behaviour of the contactor has been developed. Theoretical analysis involves mass and energy equations for both air and liquid desiccant. Moreover, heat and <b>vapour</b> <b>mass</b> fluxes through the membrane have been analysed.

40|$|During {{landfall}} of extratropical cyclones between 2005 and 2011, nearly 1400 precipitation {{samples were}} collected at intervals of 30 -min time resolution with novel automated collectors at four NOAA sites in northern California [Alta (ATA), Bodega Bay (BBY), Cazadero (CZD) and Shasta Dam (STD) ] during 43 events. Substantial decreases were commonly followed hours later by substantial increases in hydrogen isotopic composition (δ 					 2 HVSMOW where VSMOW is Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water) and oxygen isotopic composition (δ 					 18 OVSMOW) of precipitation. These variations likely occur as pre-cold frontal precipitation generation transitions from marine <b>vapour</b> <b>masses</b> having low rainout to cold cloud layers having much higher rainout (with concomitant brightband signatures measured by an S-band profiling radar and lower δ 					 2 HVSMOW values of precipitation), and finally to shallower, warmer precipitating clouds having lower rainout (with non-brightband signatures and higher δ 					 2 HVSMOW values of precipitation), in accord with ‘seeder–feeder’ precipitation. Of 82 intervals identified, a remarkable 100. 5 ‰ decrease in δ 					 2 HVSMOW value was observed for a 21 January 2010 event at BBY. Of the 61 intervals identified with increases in δ 					 2 HVSMOW values as precipitation transitioned to shallower, warmer clouds having substantially less rainout (the feeder part of the seeder–feeder mechanism), a remarkable increase in δ 					 2 HVSMOW value of precipitation of 82. 3 ‰ was observed for a 10 February 2007 event at CZD. All CZD and ATA events having δ 					 2 HVSMOW values of precipitation below − 105 ‰ were atmospheric rivers (ARs), and of the 13 events having δ 					 2 HVSMOW values of precipitation below − 80 ‰, 77 % were ARs. Cloud echo-top heights (a proxy for atmospheric temperature) were available for 23 events. The mean echo-top height is greater for higher rainout periods than that for lower rainout periods in 22 of the 23 events. The lowest δ 					 2 HVSMOW of precipitation of 28 CZD events was − 137. 9 ‰ on 16 February 2009 during an AR with cold precipitating clouds and very high rainout with tops > 6. 5 km altitude. An altitude effect of − 2. 5 ‰ per 100 m was measured from BBY and CZD δ 					 2 HVSMOW data and of − 1. 8 ‰ per 100 m for CZD and ATA δ 					 2 HVSMOW data. We present {{a new approach to}} categorise rainfall intervals using δ 					 2 HVSMOW values of precipitation and rainfall rates.

One problem is developing materials that can mitigate an event of interplanetary spacecraft fire. A numerical simulation of piloted ignition delay time of solid fuel material for PMMA sample, subjected to various incident radiant heat fluxes and airflows was developed based on thermo-chemical solid phase model. The model incorporates, conduction, convection, surface re-radiation and radiation surface absorption heat transfer modes and solid phase chemical degradation described by first order Arrhenius law chemistry.

The field campaign took place at the University of Western Ontario Environmental Re- search Field Station, near London Ontario Canada, from May 23 rd to June 10 th 2012 and resulted in 57 hours of measurements taken over 12 clear nights. On each night a minimum of one RS 92 radiosonde was launched. In addition 3 cryogenic frost-point hygrometer (CFH) sondes were launched on clear nights over the course of the campaign.

Comparisons between measurements of water <b>vapour</b> <b>mass</b> mixing ratio taken by RS 92 ra- diosondes, Cryogenic Frostpoint Hygometers, and the ALVICE and PCL lidars has resulted in the derivation of a system calibration factor of ξ sys = 0. 7545.

The maximum burning rate, the pool fire duration and the development of phases I (growth - transitory period corresponding to fire development), II (steady-state period corresponding to fully developed fire, with an about invariable burning rate) and III (exhaustion - transitory period preluding the end of fuel, during which both the size of flames and the burning rate decreased continuously up to fire extinction) are mainly analyzed. The model approach based on the grid theory appears as a good mechanistic type and fast-running method for simulating the pool fire dynamics and performing interpretative and predictive analysis of fire scenarios including hydrocarbons pool fires. Particularly satisfying is the reproduction of phases I, II and III of the transient.

Image analysis was introduced to estimate the volume vapour fraction, which can be converted into the <b>mass</b> <b>vapour</b> fraction using the slip ratio. The estimation of this slip ratio is discussed in this paper...|$|R
25|$|Relative humidity: The {{relative}} humidity of air {{is defined as}} the partial pressure of water vapour divided by the saturated vapour pressure at the same temperature and total pressure (Siau, 1984). If the temperature is kept constant, lower relative humidities result in higher drying rates due to the increased moisture gradient in wood, resulting from the reduction of the moisture content in the surface layers when the {{relative humidity}} of air is reduced. The relative humidity is usually expressed on a percentage basis. For drying, the other essential parameter related to relative humidity is the absolute humidity, which is the <b>mass</b> of water <b>vapour</b> per unit <b>mass</b> of dry air (kg of water per kg of dry air).However, its influenced by the amount of water in the heated air.|$|R
