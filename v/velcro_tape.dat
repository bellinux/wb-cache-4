Modifications include <b>velcro</b> <b>tape</b> to attach to surfaces, upgrades to the CPU and video card cooling fans to accommodate {{for the lack of}} gravity (hotter air doesn't rise) and lower density of the cabin air, and an adapter to the station's 28 volt DC power.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{if you use}} {{the tarp}} method or the carpet method you install it via the {{following}} steps, for the tarp method each section is installed slightly overlapping adjacent ones and secured with special adhesive tape and with the carpet method you eliminate the waste generated from the single use adhesive tape and it is installed using reusable velcro strips instead. The newer tile systems allow more flexibility in installation and do not require adhesive or <b>velcro</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{few months}} after the first Springtime, Landman built the Springtime II on {{specifications}} made up by Lou Barlow. Barlow's version has eight tuning pegs, two of them unused, but available for an alternative seven or eight string set up. The other six employ the strings for the instruments in four positions similar to a bass guitar, but the upper two positions are double coursed strings. Because of this the instrument remains a six string guitar. Also the pickup configuration is different and four single coils are present instead of three. The lowest positioned pickup is left out and a regular bridge and neck pickup are placed aside of the rotated pickup duo. The <b>velcro</b> <b>tape</b> to mute undesired string resonance from the tailed bridge is also not present on this version.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — It is {{observed}} that garment elastic cutting methods {{are not fully}} successful due to the given measurement for elastic length was not cut properly. And also no such machine in an Indian make. The main objective of this proposed system is to avoid elastic shrinkage problem and reduces the machine cost and also save the machine importing cost. This machine is particularly useful for small and medium size serial productions, where flexible and automated cutting solutions for Elastic and <b>VELCRO</b> <b>tape</b> are required. This ERS (Elastic, Rope, and Shoe lace) cutting machine provides a best cutting solution for garment technology with cheapest price...|$|E
40|$|CO 2 {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{is one of}} {{the complications}} of laparoscopic surgery using CO 2 gas. During laparoscopic surgery, CO 2 gas can spread to the entire body surface through the subcutaneous tissue layer. Extensive CO 2 subcutaneous emphysema results in hypercarbia and acute respiratory acidosis. Hypercarbia and acidosis can lead to decreased cardiac contractility and arrhythmia. A cloth band, 5 cm in width and 120 cm in length, was made with <b>Velcro</b> <b>tape</b> at both tips, and placed on the patient’s xyphoid process level and inframammary fold to prevent CO 2 subcutaneous emphysema. This report describes two successful cases using a chest band to prevent the expansion of CO 2 subcutaneous emphysema.

40|$|For ages {{people have}} sought {{inspiration}} in nature. Biomimicry {{has been the}} propelling power of such inventions, like <b>Velcro</b> <b>tape</b> or "cat's eyes" - retroreflective road marking. At the same time, scientists have been developing biologically inspired techniques: genetic algorithms, neural and sensor networks, etc. Although at a first glance {{there is no direct}} inspiration behind offensive and defensive techniques seen in the Internet and the patterns present in nature, closer inspection reveals many analogies between these two worlds. Botnets, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, IDS/IPSs (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems), and others, all employ strategies which very closely resemble actions undertaken by certain species of the kingdoms of living things. The main conclusion of the analysis is that security community should turn to nature in search of new offensive and defensive techniques for virtual world security. Comment: 15 pages, 1 tabl...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} conducted to investigate the low gravity burning characteristics on nylon and Nomex <b>Velcro</b> fastening <b>tapes</b> {{in an atmosphere of}} 30 -percent oxygen, 70 -percent nitrogen at a 70 -kPa pressure. The tests were conducted using the NASA Lewis Research Center Zero Gravity Facility. The test results, as documented by high-speed cameras, indicate that both nylon and Nomex burn in low gravity for the full 5. 18 sec test time but that Nomex burns less vigorously than nylon. Nylon melts as it burns, whereas Nomex forms a solid char. Nylon also sputters burning droplets as it burns. Thus, from these limited tests, it appears that Nomex Velcro is less hazardous than nylon Velcro for spacecraft applications. The results also show that residual gas velocities, and by analogy spacecraft air circulation, can enhance the low-gravity combustion...|$|R
30|$|At {{the day of}} the PET study, {{catheters}} {{were placed}} in the antecubital vein for tracer injection and in the radial artery for blood sampling. Next, subjects were positioned on the HRRT scanner bed such that the head was {{in the center of the}} field of view. <b>Velcro</b> <b>tapes</b> were used to minimize patient movement during the entire imaging procedure. Lights were dimmed, noise was minimized, and subjects were asked to close their eyes and stay awake during data acquisition. Prior to or immediately after the 15 O]H 2 O scan, a 6 -min singles-based transmission scan with a fan-collimated 137 Cs moving point source was acquired. A 10 -min dynamic emission scan was started 10 s prior to a bolus injection of approximately 800 MBq 15 O]H 2 O. Radioactivity was contained within a volume of approximately 5 mL and was followed by a saline flush to give a total injected volume of 40 mL, administered at a rate of 2 mL/s using an infusion pump (Medrad Inc., Indianola, MS, USA). To allow for radioactive decay of 15 O, the 18 [*]F]FDG scan was acquired after an interval of at least 10 min following the 15 O]H 2 O scan. A 60 -min dynamic emission scan was started 30 s prior to a bolus injection of 186 [*]±[*] 9 MBq 18 [*]F]FDG. The administration protocol was identical to the one used for the 15 O]H 2 O scan. During both emission scans, arterial blood concentrations were monitored continuously using a dedicated on-line blood sampler (Veenstra Instruments, Joure, Netherlands [22]). During the first 4 min of the 15 O]H 2 O scan, blood was withdrawn at a rate of 450 mL/h and activity was read out once per second. For the remaining 6 min, the withdrawal rate was reduced to 150 mL/h and the readout sampling time increased to 10 s. In addition, three manual blood samples were taken at 5, 7.5, and 9 min post-injection. These samples were taken from the same arterial line by briefly interrupting continuous withdrawal. After each sample, the arterial line was flushed with heparinized saline to prevent clotting. Manual samples were used to measure whole blood radioactivity concentrations. The sampling procedure during the 18 [*]F]FDG scan was similar to that of the 15 O]H 2 O scan but with withdrawal rates of 300 mL/h during the first 5 min and 150 mL/h thereafter. During this scan, manual blood samples were taken 15, 35, and 55 min post-injection. These samples were used to measure both whole blood and plasma radioactivity concentrations, as well as arterial plasma glucose levels. This BSIF was used in all analyses except for analyses based on an IDIF.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel is {{constructed}} {{of a series}} of two to eight rings, usually eight to ten feet in diameter to allow headroom for the people using the tunnel. The vertical rings are connected to horizontal braces forming a cylinder similar in shape to a large coffee can with the ends removed. The interior of the spinning tunnel is lined with fabric or plastic sheeting with secured to the rings and braces in whatever manner is expedient to the builder or designer of the tunnel. <b>Velcro</b> straps, duct <b>tape,</b> and staples are used in different constructions. The liner can be printed or decorated with images or abstract designs that draw the eye and further the optical illusion fostered by the rotating liner. The use of flourescent inks or paint and black lighting can add to the enjoyment of the attraction by creating a spooky, darkly lit environment. Music or other sound effects help to mask the sound of the rotating tunnel and the operation of the drive motor.|$|R
40|$|<b>Velcro</b> <b>tape</b> {{has got a}} {{counterpart}} on the micro-level: "Gecko tape". The Centre for Mesoscience and Nanotechnology in the University of Manchester {{has developed}} a new adhesive, a tape coated with 500 -nanometer fibers that are 2 micrometers long. The glueless tape mimics the toe of the gecko. You can find already many articles on the "Gecko tape " in the Net, for example Liz Kalaugher's story in nanotechweb. org [3]. Zoologist, broadcaster and author on wildlife David Attenborough described the gecko as follows: "These small tropical lizards can run up walls, scuttle upside down over ceilings, even cling to vertical panes of glass [...] . scales are responsible. Those on the underside on the toes carry pads formed from enormous numbers of microscopic hairs, invisible {{to the naked eye}} [...] . When pressed hard it engages on the tiniest roughnesses, even those that occur on the surface of glass. " [1, p...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is about}} a new product concept that can warm up persons in an outside hiking {{environment}} where {{you do not have}} access to electricity in abundance. As a secondary objective for this product it should minimize or prevent thermal signature when used. The product should be small enough to be stored in the backpack of the soldier or the hiker. The interface and functions of the product should be simple enough to be operated in the dark by everyone no matter what condition they are in. This work is done with guidance from The Swedish armed forces. The Swedish armed forces are the major authority in Sweden with over 13000 employees all around Sweden, most of them working and sleeping outside and in need of heat gear. Since the authority’s objective is unique due to their ability to use armed combat they often do not want to be spotted by their enemy. The basic goal of this work is to provide a concept design on how a product like this would look and operate. The markets are both the civilian hiking community and the military authorities. Many product development tools will be used to ensure that the finished product meet the objectives and goals defined. The finished product will be presented in CAD-models, drawings and a presentation. The finished product consists of a Sodium acetate pad inside a heat-insulating polyester container. The product is used on the inside of the thigh and is secured with <b>Velcro</b> <b>tape...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Indusec AB in Stockholm. Indusec AB {{is a company}} that develops security solutions. Together with the Police of Sweden they have gotten the assignment to develop an application based on one of their already existing product Inferno sound barrier. This application is supposed to be mounted on a ballistic shield that the police use, the application consists of a speaker box (the sound barrier) and a trigger with wire. The trigger with wire is the part that will be addressed in this thesis. The application will then be used as a tool to surprise a target at various skirmishes. The project consists of three major phases, pre-study, concept generation and modeling. In the pre-study consists in selecting the literature that is necessary as well as gathering information on similar products and different materials. In the next phase, different concepts are generated using different methods. In this phase the final concept will be determined. After this, the final concept is constructed according to the requirement specification and manufacturing blueprints are made. The project resulted in a simple and flexible solution. The trigger is mounted on the shield handle using a velcro-strap looped around the handle and with a <b>velcro</b> which is <b>taped</b> under the trigger. The manufacturing blueprints on the plastic casing are meant to be ready for manufacturing. But there is, as always, still potential for improvement...|$|R
