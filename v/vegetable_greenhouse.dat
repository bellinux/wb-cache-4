Progeny of F 1 reciprocal crosses and backcrosses between F 1 larvae and resistant (PR) and susceptible (PS) populations were assayed at different B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki concentrations. The responses of progeny of reciprocal F 1 crosses were identical, indicating that the resistant trait was autosomal. The 50 % lethal concentration for the F 1 larvae was slightly higher than that for PS, suggesting that resistance is partially recessive. The responses of both backcross progeny (F 1 × PR, F 1 × PS) did not correspond to predictions from a single-locus model. The inclusion of a nonhomozygous resistant parental line in the monogenic model significantly increased the correspondence between the expected and observed results for the F 1 × PR backcross but decreased the correspondence with the F 1 × PS backcross results.

In the North China Plain, soil nutrients and organic carbon are still lacking in salt-affected soil after a successfully reclamation in the 1980 s. Our objectives were to investigate the effects of land use types under different soil management practices on soil fertility, organic carbon pools, and the microbial community at this site. Three land use types were investigated: original land without farming, farmland with residue return, and a <b>vegetable</b> <b>greenhouse</b> with farmyard manure amendment. The carbon stocks were calculated according to the equivalent soil mass method, and microbial community structure was determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Over 30 years, the current concentrations of alkali-hydrolysis nitrogen, available potassium (AK), and available phosphorus increased in the three land use types, except for the AK concentration in farmland, which decreased due to the lack of potassium fertilizer input. The nutrients in the greenhouse were significantly higher than those in the original land and farmland. The carbon stocks in the original land, farmland, and greenhouse were increased by 103 %, 179 %, and 660 %, respectively. Both land use types and seasons influenced particulate organic carbon, chemical-labile organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon. The microbial community structures were distinctly different between the three land use types. Overall, the soil available nutrients and carbon stocks increased compared to their 1980 levels in the three land use types, and labile carbon pools and microbial community structure exhibited different responses in the three land use types.

Additional organic fertilizers (compost and chicken manure) were applied before cucumber and tomato planting. In the period between cucumber and tomato cultivation the soil in greenhouse was solarizated. In both crops soil surface was mulched with black fleece or fresh red clover biomass. Transplants of both species were produced in organic substrate. Cucumbers were planting in the soil but tomatoes in bottomless containers of 0, 5 dm 3, placed directly on the soil surface. The period of cucumbers growing was 90 days and tomatoes 120 days. Every 2 – 3 weeks in cultivation period nutrients concentration in soil solution was monitored on the depth of 30 and 60 cm.

40|$|Bioenergy is {{the major}} {{domestic}} energy for rural households in developing countries due to its cheap or easy-getting characteristics. Productive use of bioenergy is an important strategy for rural households to improve not only their income, but also their health, living environment and so on. In Tibet of China, which is rich in cattle dung and firewood as the major energy sources for rural households, the efficiency of energy utilization is just about 10 %. In order to improve energy utilization efficiency and the living conditions for rural residents, the Tibet Autonomous Region government introduced residential biogas model (RBM) to local households, which was a comprehensive utilization system of energy integrated with residential biogas digester, <b>vegetable</b> <b>greenhouse</b> and livestock shed. This paper aims to show the productive use of the bioenergy by the RBM, which could be depicted as the feasibility and the benefits on economic, eco-environmental and social aspects of biogas utilization, based on household questionnaires in Panam County. In RBM, biogas digester works as the biomass material supplement loop to transform originally biomass flow from single-direction to recycling-direction. The {{results indicate that the}} output of unit biogas digester could replace 1. 44 Â t of firewood, 1. 65 Â t of agricultural residues and 1. 75 Â t of cattle dung, respectively. The net incremental benefit of RBM could reach 5550. 72 Yuan in 15 years. The reduced amount of CO 2 emission when substituted by biogas in other agricultural areas and the areas of semi-agricultural and semi-husbandry in Tibet could be (76. 66 - 79. 89) Â xÂ  104 Â t/year and the capability for nitrogen storage could achieve (0. 39 - 0. 99) Â xÂ  104 Â t/year. The amount of cattle dung replaced by biogas could reach 78. 29 Â xÂ  104 Â t/year; this means that the saved cattle dung, 3. 51 Â t/hm 2, could be reallocated back to cultivated land to improve the soil fertility and to keep the balance of nutrient elements in cultivated land. Biogas utilization reduces the labor opportunity costs of women compared to use of traditional bioenergy sources. It could be concluded that the productive use of bioenergy through RBM in this area has its capability to release the current pressures on biomass sources by adjusting patterns of rural energy consumption, and to improve the conditions of health, environment, economy and energy conservation.

Microalgae are eukaryotic phototrophs or prokaryotic cyanobacteria (blue green algae) {{that are able to}} capture CO 2 and produce lipids suitable for biodiesel, thus can mitigate these challenges. The potential application of microalgae biomass for biofuel production is a clean and sustainable approach to replace fossil fuels. An important consideration for reducing the cost of biofuel is the economical production of algal biomass with high lipid yields. In this study, the marine microalgae Nannochloropsis gaditana were investigated for biomass and lipid production using two wastewater streams, i. e., road salt run-off and <b>vegetable</b> <b>Greenhouse</b> industry effluents as the growth media using batch or fed-batch cultivation. The recovery of biomass was also investigated using coagulants or pH change. In {{the first phase of the}} research the effect of salinity on biomass concentration and lipid production was examined in the batch cultures. Increasing the concentration of salt in the nutrient road salt growth media increased the lipid content from 17 % to 21. 6 % (w/w dry weight) which had the 70 %(w/w) of long chain fatty acid, which are suitable for the biofuel production. The fed-batch cultivation system was next applied to provide the nutrition sufficient, depletion and repletion conditions. Three different feeding strategies were examined: continuous, pulse and stage feeding for the effect on biomass and lipid yields. The best condition of the feeding regime was identified as pulse feeding based on the substrate to biomass conversion and lipid yield, which resulted the biomass of 2. 08 +/- 0. 03 g. The increased light intensity doubled the lipid yields with the maximum of 58 % (w/w) lipid content and the lipid productivity of 47 mg/L/day was obtained.

The obtained results exhibited that irrigating pea plants whenever 25 % 0 f pot available water capacity was depleted appeared to be the paramount irrigation treatment followed by that of 50 % depletion and irrigation level of 75 % are not advisable. 25 % irrigation level manifested the highest leaf number per plant (26. 33), plant height (141. 15 cm), root dry weight (0. 16 g), flower number per plant (6. 48), individual pod fresh weight (3. 56 g), seed number per pod (3. 47), green pod yield per plant (14. 53 g), weight 100 seeds (23. 02 g), seed fresh weight per pod (1. 44 g), pericarp fresh weight (2. 05 g), aperture length of upper leaf stomata (4. 38 μm), stomata length of leaf lower surface (6. 23 μm), stomata aperture length of leaf lower surface (4. 75 μm), smallest vessel width (3. 72 μm), protein content of dry seed (25. 3 %), GA 3 (346. 63 mgkg- 1 dry seeds), and IAA (4109. 72 mgkg- 1 dry seeds). The best plant response was confined to these sprayed with micronutrient, then IBA and the lowest was GA 3 -treated pea. Pea sprayed by 2 gl- 1 micronutrients manifested the highest root dry weight (0. 16 g), leaf dry matter percentage (26. 36 %), stem dry matter percentage (35. 77 %), flower number per plant (6. 43), pod number per plant (4. 49), individual pod fresh weight (3. 01 g), seed number per pod (3. 64), yield of fresh pods per plant (13. 33 g), total pod number per plant (4. 11), weight of 100 seeds (23. 51), fresh weight of pericarp (1. 6 g), stomata length at upper leaf surface (6. 05 μm), stomata length at lower leaf surface (6. 6 μm), stomata width at lower leaf surface (3. 78 μm), stomata aperture length at lower leaf surface (4. 61 μm), stomata aperture width at lower leaf surface (2. 38 μm), stomata population at lower and upper leaf surface (5971. 88 and 3792. 19 stomata mm- 2, respectively), chlorophyll percentage out of gross pigments (40. 05 %), proline content (0. 0062 μgg- 1 dry seeds), ABA (713. 31 mgkg- 1 dry seeds) and IAA (3725. 23 mgkg- 1 dry seeds). Crinkle pea appeared to be the potent cultivar it gave the highest yield of green pod (14. 6 gplant- 1), plant height (119. 8 cm), leaf dry weight (0. 27 g), root dry weight (0. 25 g), leaf dry mater percentage (28. 79 %), stem dry matter percentage (36. 39 %), flower number (6. 75), pod number per plant (4. 62), individual pod dry weight (1. 21 g), pod fresh weight (2. 72 g), seed number per pod (2. 95), pericap fresh weight (1. 51 g), dry pericarp (0. 57 g), upper leaf surface stomata width (3. 7 μm), upper leaf surface stomata length (6 μm), stomata aperture length of upper leaf surface (4. 32 μm), stomata aperture width of upper leaf surface (2. 2 μm), aperture length of lower leaf surface stomata (4. 64 μm), aperture width of lower leaf surface stomata (2. 32 μm), stomata length at lower leaf surface (6. 4 μm), stomata width at lower leaf surface (3. 96 μm), the widest and lowest vessels width (10. 37 and 3. 8 μm, respectively), vessels number per bundle (12. 46) and chlorophyll percentage related to gross pigments (34. 74 %). Local smooth comes next then the worst cultivar was Canadian. Therefore, crinkle was most drought resistant pea cultivar...|$|E

40|$|The {{microbial}} insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{has become}} the mainstay of non-chemical control of Lepidopteran pests, either as sprays or through the incorporation of Bt toxins into transgenic crops. Given the wide use of Bt, it is striking that currently only one pest species, Plutella xylostella, {{has been reported to}} have developed significant resistance to Bt outside the laboratory. By contrast, we report here the frequent and rapid development of resistance to B. thuringiensis kurstaki (Dipel, Abbott) in populations of cabbage loopers, Trichoplusia ni, in commercial greenhouses. Resistance to Bt appears to be costly and there is a rapid decline of resistance in populations collected from greenhouses and maintained in the laboratory without selection. Management of pests resistant to Bt in <b>vegetable</b> <b>greenhouses</b> will require sporadic use of Bt-based sprays or alternatively use of sprays containing other Bt toxins...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{accumulation}} of heavy metals in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>vegetable</b> soil {{is one of}} the main reasons leading to the deterioration of soil quality and the contamination of agricultural products by heavy metals. A survey was conducted to determine the status of copper and cadmium accumulations in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>vegetable</b> soils in Tongzhou of Beijing. Based on the investigated results, the contamination degree of the two heavy metals in the <b>greenhouse</b> <b>vegetable</b> soils was assessed and the main influence factors caused the {{accumulation of}} copper and cadmium was analyzed. The results indicated that there was a distinct increase of copper and cadmium concentration in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>vegetable</b> soils. The concentrations of copper and cadmium in part of soil samples exceeded the environmental quality evaluation standard for farmland of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>vegetables</b> production of China. These over-standard soil samples were mainly collected from Lucheng town and Xiji town. The contents of copper and cadmium in greenhouse soil were increased significantly as the cultivated time of the soil added. The content of copper in greenhouse soil varied from 19. 8 mg/kg to 39. 2 mg/kg when the cultivation time of the greenhouse increased from 1 year to 5 years, nearly increased one times. The content of cadmium in vegetable soils of 20 -year age greenhouse was 3. 2 times of that in 1 -year age greenhouse. Significant correlations were found between the content of copper and cadmium in soil, soil organic carbon content, CEC, and available phosphorus and potassium content in soils. Soil physical and chemical properties should be considerated integratedly to reduce the heavy metal contamination in greenhouse soils...|$|R
