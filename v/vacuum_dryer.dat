40|$|Abstract In this work, an {{experimental}} unit of a <b>vacuum</b> spray <b>dryer</b> was built. This prototype attempted {{to combine the}} advantages of freeze-drying (drying at low temperatures due to vacuum) and spray drying (increase of surface area aiming the improvement of heat transfer efficiency). Maltodextrin solutions were dried in the vacuum operated equipment and in conventional spray <b>dryer.</b> The <b>vacuum</b> spray <b>dryer</b> system allowed obtaining powder at low temperatures due to the lowering of pressure conditions (2 - 5 kPa) inside the drying chamber. The products obtained in the two systems were characterized and compared for particle size distribution, moisture content, water activity, bulk density and solubility in water. The processes yields were also evaluated and compared. The <b>vacuum</b> spray <b>dryer</b> system allowed the production of larger, more soluble and less dense particles than those obtained in the conventional configuration of the equipment, resulting in drier and, therefore, with lower water activity particles. Thus, {{the use of the}} <b>vacuum</b> spray <b>dryer</b> as a drying technique may be an alternative for the production of powder rich in thermosensitive compounds...|$|R

40|$|Massive {{consumption}} {{of energy in}} drying industry makes it a matter of challenge regarding economical aspects and limited recourses. Several methods for drying including hot air convection, vacuum, infrared and hot air convection-infrared technologies were applied in order to estimate the consumed energy during the drying of mulberry fruit. Moreover, microwave heating, chemical (ethyl oleate and potassium), mechanical (ultrasonic) and blanching (hot water) pretreatments were compared.

30|$|However, {{metallic}} nanoparticle inks {{often require}} high annealing temperatures (> 150 °C) to decompose stabilizing agents and other polymeric additives that inhibit electrical conductivity, {{with the high}} annealing temperature limiting the choice of substrate. Besides, they still cannot completely avoid the condensation and agglomeration of nanoparticles, especially after long-term storage. The agglomerated particles may damage the equipment and influence the printing quality. During preparation, a high-speed centrifuge or <b>vacuum</b> <b>dryer</b> must be used to take nanometal particles out, so these inks cannot be produced on a large scale.

40|$|The European Drying Group (EDG) {{proposal}} on a wood drying quality standard defines demands on {{final moisture content}} variation of the dried wood. The final moisture content variation will depend on material parameters {{as well as the}} production process and the wood will always show a “natural” moisture content variation after drying. Thus the drying process has to be defined well enough to allow for the natural moisture content variation in order to fulfil the demands of the drying standards. As the average equilibrium moisture content of the wood in a vacuum drying kiln with pure steam atmosphere is determined by the pressure and the temperature, the demands on the climate control system to fulfil the demands of the drying standard can be calculated with regard to the natural moisture content variation of the wood. In {{the first part of this}} contribution the demands on climate control in <b>vacuum</b> <b>dryers</b> are calculated based on the EDG-standard and the natural moisture content variation.
