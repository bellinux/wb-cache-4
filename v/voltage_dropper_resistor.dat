5000|$|Linear {{regulators}} {{which are}} used to output a stable DC independent of input voltage and output load from a higher but less stable input by dissipating excess volt-amperes as heat, could be described literally as DC-to-DC converters, {{but this is not}} usual usage. (The same could be said of a simple <b>voltage</b> <b>dropper</b> <b>resistor,</b> whether or not stabilised by a following voltage regulator or Zener diode.) ...|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, {{the power}} for these {{circuits}} was derived {{directly from the}} mains supply.A simple circuit consisted of a series <b>voltage</b> <b>dropper</b> resistance and a rectifier valve (tube) or semiconductor diode. This avoided {{the cost of a}} large high voltage mains supply (50 or 60 Hz) transformer. This type of circuit was used for thermionic valve (vacuum tube) technology. It was inefficient and produced a lot of heat which led to premature failures in the circuitry.|$|R
50|$|Voltage {{converters}} {{can be used}} in {{vehicles with}} 12 V DC outlets. A simple <b>voltage</b> <b>dropper</b> can be used to reduce the voltage for low-power devices; if more than 12V is required, or for high-powered devices, a switched-mode power supply is used. The output will usually be DC in the range 1.5-24 V. Power supplies that output either 100-120 V AC or 210-240 V AC are available; they are called inverters, due to the conversion from DC to AC rather than the voltage change. The output frequency and waveform of an inverter may not accurately replicate that supplied by mains electricity, although this is not usually a problem.|$|R
5000|$|The {{radio was}} called the [...] "All American Five" [...] because the design {{represented}} the majority of radios manufactured for home use in the USA and Canada in the tube era. They were manufactured in the millions by hundreds of manufacturers from the 1930s onward, with the last examples being made in Japan. The heaters of the tubes were connected in series, all consequently drawing the same current, but with different voltages across them. The standard line up of tubes were designed so that the total rated voltage of the five tubes was 121 volts, slightly more than the electricity supply voltage of 110-117V. An extra <b>dropper</b> <b>resistor</b> was therefore not required. Transformerless designs had a metal chassis connected {{to one side of}} the power line, which was a dangerous electric shock hazard and required a thoroughly insulated cabinet. Transformerless radios could be powered by either AC or DC (consequently called AC/DC receivers)—DC supplies were still not uncommon. When operated on DC, they would only work if the plug was inserted with the correct polarity. Also, if run from a DC supply the radio had a reduced performance because the B+ voltage would only be 120 volts compared with 160-170 volts when operated from AC.|$|R
5000|$|LED strip lights most {{commonly}} operate on 12 or 24 volts of direct current from a power supply, {{sometimes referred to}} as a driver. USB strip lights operate on the standard 5-volt direct current used by USB devices. Mains voltage LED strips are also available. These have the advantages of being usable in much longer single runs without a brightness drop along the length, but are less flexible and heavier due to higher voltage and current ratings and thick coatings for shock safety and high IP ratings in their intended outdoor positions, with limited cut points. No separate power supply is needed, although there must be a rectifier between the mains supply {{and the end of the}} LED strip.The most common PCB designs use multiple parallel circuits consisting of passive <b>dropper</b> <b>resistors</b> in series with a certain number of LED SMDs, to operate at a certain current and power level with the expected input voltage. This design is referred to as constant-voltage and is rather sensitive to small variations in input voltage and to the voltage drop that occurs along long lengths of strip when driven from a single power input. Alternative design is the [...] "constant current" [...] design where each parallel circuit of several SMDs includes a small integrated circuit to provide a fix current to that group of LEDs, within a wide range of applied voltages. This allows the strip to operate at the same power level and brightness along its entire length, or with some variation in the driver voltage.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{due to the}} {{advantages}} inherent in using renewable energy, renewable power generation is becoming established worldwide. Direct current (DC) microgrid systems, which have been proposed as alternatives for traditional alternating current (AC) networks, enable {{the introduction of a}} large amount of solar energy by using distributed photovoltaic generation units. Meanwhile, small-scale DC microgrid systems designed at the household level are also viable options used to harness renewable energy (like solar energy) and have broad development prospects. One of the ‘hot topics’ in the field of renewable energies is how to make efficient use of this type of energy. In this thesis, a high-efficiency DC microgrid system with supercapacitor (SC) -assisted power converter is introduced as a way to harness solar energy to run a 12 V, 50 W household lighting system. Supercapacitor-assisted low dropout regulator (SCALDO) techniques were used to build an SC-assisted converter for a DC microgrid system. Supercapacitors in the DC microgrid acted as <b>voltage</b> <b>droppers</b> to convert 24 V solar panel’s output to 11 V – 13 V. Supercapacitors were also used as energy storage devices, and performed as a power source to run the household lighting system {{for a period of time}} after a sudden mains power outage. Real weather condition data, including local Hamilton illuminance values, were required to design this system. These data were measured at the University of Waikato. They were converted into irradiance data and were used to create similar patterns for simulation. Prototype circuit of the complete DC microgrid system, with an SC-assisted converter was also developed and shown at the end of the thesis...|$|R
40|$|State-of-the-art {{electronic}} systems employ three fundamental techniques for DC-DC converters: (a) {{switch-mode power supplies}} (SMPS); (b) linear power supplies; (c) switched capacitor (charge pump) converters. In practical systems, these three techniques are mixed to provide a complex, but elegant, overall solution, with energy efficiency, effective PCB footprint, noise and transient performance to suit different electronic circuit blocks. Switching regulators have relatively high end-to-end efficiency, {{in the range of}} 70 to 93 %, but can have issues with output noise and EMI/RFI emissions. Switched capacitor converters use a set of capacitors for energy storage and conversion. In general, linear regulators have low efficiencies in the range 30 to 60 %. However, they have outstanding output characteristics such as low noise, excellent transient response to load current fluctuations, design simplicity and low cost design which are far superior to SMPS. Given the complex situation in switch-mode converters, low dropout (LDO) regulators were introduced to address the equirements of noise-sensitive and fast transient loads in portable devices. A typical commercial off-the-shelf LDO has its input voltage slightly higher than the desired regulated output for optimal efficiency. The approximate efficiency of a linear regulator, if the power consumed by the control circuits is negligible, can be expressed by the ratio of Vo/Vin. A very low frequency supercapacitor circulation technique can be combined with commercial low dropout regulator ICs to significantly increase the end-to-end efficiency by a multiplication factor in the range of 1. 33 to 3, compared to the efficiency of a linear regulator circuit with the same input-output voltages. In this patented supercapacitor-assisted low dropout (SCALDO) regulator technique developed by a research team at the University of Waikato, supercapacitors are used as lossless <b>voltage</b> <b>droppers,</b> and the energy reuse occurs at very low frequencies in the range of less than ten hertz, eliminating RFI/EMI concerns. This SCALDO technique opens up a new approach to design step-down, DC-DC converters suitable for processor power supplies with very high end-to-end efficiency which is closer to the efficiencies of practical switching regulators, while maintaining the superior output specifications of a linear design. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that the SCALDO technique is not a variation of well-known switched capacitor DC-DC converters. In this thesis, the basic SCALDO concept is further developed to achieve generalised topologies, with the relevant theory that can be applied to a converter with any input-output step-down voltage combination. For these generalised topologies, some important design parameters, such as the number of supercapacitors, switching matrix details and efficiency improvement factors, are derived to form the basis of designing SCALDO regulators. With the availability of commercial LDO ICs with output current ratings up to 10 A, and thin-prole supercapacitors with DC voltage ratings from 2. 3 to 5. 5 V, several practically useful, medium-current SCALDO prototypes: 12 V-to- 5 V, 5 V-to- 2 V, 5. 5 V-to- 3. 3 V have been developed. Experimental studies were carried out on these SCALDO prototypes to quantify performance in terms of line regulation, load regulation, efficiency and transient response. In order to accurately predict the performance and associated waveforms of the individual phases (charge, discharge and transition) of the SCALDO regulator, Laplace transform-based theory for supercapacitor circulation is developed, and analytical predictions are compared with experimental measurements for a 12 V-to- 5 V prototype. The analytical results tallied well with the practical waveforms observed in a 12 V-to- 5 V converter, indicating that the SCALDO technique can be generalized to other versatile configurations, and confirming that the simplified assumptions used to describe the circuit elements are reasonable and justifiable. After analysing the performance of several SCALDO prototypes, some practical issues in designing SCALDO regulators have been identified. These relate to power losses and implications for future development of the SCALDO design...|$|R
