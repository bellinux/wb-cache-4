50|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> can force the current {{in the circuit}} to zero, before the natural zero and reversal of current in the alternating current circuit. Additionally, if the timing of interrupter operation is unfavorable {{with respect to the}} ac voltage waveform, when the arc has extinguished but the contacts are still moving and ionization has not yet dissipated in the interrupter, the applied voltage may exceed the withstand voltage of the gap. This can cause reignition of the arc and abrupt transient currents. In either of these cases, oscillations are introduced in the system, and may result in significant overvoltage. Manufacturers of vacuum interrupters address these concerns by selection of contact materials and contact designs selected to minimize current chopping. To protect apparatus from overvoltages, vacuum switchgear assemblies will usually include surge arrester components to prevent damaging over voltage.|$|E

In this report <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> in small-scale hydropower stations with {{the rated power}} 4 MVA and below has been studied. Models of the stations are modeled and analyzed in PSCAD/EMTDC to study the high voltage transients that are created after current chopping with <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> <b>Vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> may chop the current before it reaches zero value, which means that high voltage transients can be created. The equipment of the stations can be destroyed by high voltage transients. The purpose of this thesis {{is to examine the}} use of <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> in small-scale hydropower stations and the risk for high voltage transients from current chopping. According to the results there is a risk of high voltage transients after current chopping with small synchronous generators in stations with the operating voltages 0. 4 kV and 3. 6 kV. When the <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is placed on the high voltage side of the transformer the risk increases of high voltages transients and reignitions due to the low capacitance of the transformer.

40|$|The {{main task}} of <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> is the {{switching}} of short circuit currents, which can reach values of about 50 kA in medium voltage systems. In the medium voltage area the vacuum technique {{is the dominant}} switching principle and is mostly used worldwide whereas the market share amounts 60 %. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are typically used up to a voltage of 36 kV and a short circuit current of 50 kV. The substantial switching element is the lightning arc which forms when separating the contacts. The constriction of this arc at higher currents because of the pinch effect leads to a strong erosion of material on the contact surfaces, especially on the anode surface, and consequently decreases the switching capability. The positive effect of axial magnetic field (AMF) contacts on the switching behaviour {{is based on the}} stabilisation of the vacuum arc by the axial magnetic field, which is produced by the current flowing through the contacts. This concept does not only enable the switching of higher currents. It also allows the application of <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> at higher voltages because of the reduced erosion on the contact surface. Within the scope of this work the arc plasma between AMF contacts is modelled by a simulation program and hence the influence of axial magnetic fields on the discharge of high current vacuum arcs is studied. The main intentions are the determination of the important plasma parameters such as charge density, current density and internal fields, the investigation of the forming time of the anode spots and an estimation of the influencing variables. This work aims to point out an alternative to the widely used fluid models, which are based on a local thermodynamic equilibrium, by a kinetic modelling of the arc plasma and to present possibilities for its solution. For this reason, a substantial contribution to the characterisation of the switching behaviour of AMF-contacts is done by this project...|$|R

When combined with other elements, such as copper, specialized alloys may be made that are of particular value for certain applications. In the electrical industry copper beryllium alloys are frequently present in electrical components in the contactors, relays, springs and other metallic components. Though beryllium has many excellent physical properties and poses minimal to no human health hazard when in a solid finished form, inhaling the dust or fumes of beryllium containing materials can cause serious health issues. This project assesses whether removable beryllium surface contamination is present on four different types of electrical switchgear equipment. A total of 119 wipe samples were collected from four different styles of electrical switchgear. All wipe sample results were well below the established criteria of 0. 2 μg/ 100 cm 2.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} two {{applications for}} using <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (VCBs) in flexible ac transmission {{systems in the}} high-voltage (HV) power grid. This is first a mechanically switched reactor, which is series connected to a thyristor-controlled series compensator {{in order to enhance}} the inductive working range. Nevertheless, the switching frequency of VCBs is limited by their mechanical properties. In order to achieve a higher switching frequency, more VCBs are switched in parallel to each other. Second. A device is investigated, which consists of mechanically switched capacitors and a mechanically switched reactor. It is connected to a node in the HV system in order to enhance the voltage quality and to avoid a voltage collapse. Since VCBs are mainly available in the medium-voltage range, a transformer is used to connect the mechanically switched device to the HV system. In this paper, it could be shown that the mechanically switched series reactor is able to enhance the damping progress of power oscillations and that the mechanically switched device using VCBs can stabilize the voltage of the node in case of disturbances, such as faults in the power system. Furthermore, the electrical stress on the VCBs has been assessed for different simulation cases with PSCAD.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of a {{rotating}} arc by coupling a finite element method (FEM) and an arc model. A FEM is used to calculate magnetic field between electrodes taking into account the real current distribution in the contacts and in the arc; moreover, ferromagnetic effects and induced currents can be taken into account. A phenomenological arc model is used to predict the arc voltage, which depends on the local magnetic field and the arc length. This arc voltage is updated as the arc displaces itself across the contact surface. The information about arc voltage and local circuit equations is sufficient to find the velocity of the moving arc; hence this model seems more effective than models using Lorentz-forces to describe arc movement which need a priori knowledge about viscosity.

40|$|The vacuum {{switching}} technology is preferred {{used in the}} medium voltage level due to its high reliability, {{the high number of}} switching operations, its free-maintenance as well as its long term durability. Contrary to gas-insulated switches, the contact surface of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> has a substantial influence on the withstand voltage. Charge carriers, escaped from the contacts due to an electrical field stress, will be accelerated in the contact gap, whereas the absorbed energy could not be reduced significantly, because of the marginal number of collisions. Caused by the impact on the contact surface, additional charge carriers may be generated with a subsequent breakdown. The required withstand voltage of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> is reached by a conditioning of the metallic surfaces inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> A mechanical handling alone is not sufficient. All established procedures for conditioning vacuum circuit breakers to reach a required withstand voltage use current limited breakdowns to remove emission centers which are the origin of a breakdown. In this work, a conditioning process for industrial type vacuum circuit breakers is investigated, using high-frequency currents in the kHz-range. Due to high current rises before and high voltage rises after a current interruption during a current zero crossing, a reignition of a vacuum insulation can be enforced. On the one hand the high-frequency conditioning process has been evaluated if the required lightning impulse withstand voltage can be reached reliably, on the other hand it has been investigated, how far the lightning impulse withstand voltage can be increased beyond it. It is investigated, to what extend the voltage and current distribution, measured during a high frequency conditioning process, can be used to specify the reached lightning impulse withstand voltage. The conditioning process is successful only, if every critical emission centre is removed. Therefore the spatial distribution of the arcs is an important information for the evaluation of the conditioning process. Here, a circuit breaker model is used for optical investigations of the conditioning arcs. The surfaces of the contacts are investigated using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy...|$|E
