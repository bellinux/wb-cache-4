50|$|When the {{automobile}} industry in the United States was threatened by the popularity of cheaper more fuel efficient Japanese cars, a 1981 <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>agreement</b> limited the Japanese to exporting 1.68 million cars to the U.S. annually as stipulated by U.S Government. This quota was originally intended to expire after three years, in April 1984. However, with a growing deficit in trade with Japan, and under pressure from domestic manufacturers, the US government extended the quotas for an additional year. The cap was raised to 1.85 million cars for this additional year, then to 2.3 million for 1985. The voluntary restraint was removed in 1994.|$|E
40|$|The EEC Sheepmeat Regime was {{introduced}} in October 1980, {{in order to establish}} a common market in sheepmeats within the Community. During the first year (1980 / 81) higher support prices led to increased supply in Britain whilst the imposition of a Clawback tax and the strength of the sterling reduced exports from Britain. The British market was somewhat depressed for these and other reasons. Imports into the EEC from New Zealand were also considerably lower than the <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Restraint</b> <b>Agreement</b> (VRA) allows for, though returns from trade were higher, due to the reduction in the import tariff. Assessment of the Regime indicates that it is progressing satisfactorily, but at some high and increasing expense to the EEC (FEOGA) fund. The outlook to 1984 / 5 is for increased supply in most EEC countries, with a further small decline in consumption in Britain. Intra EEC trade will increase, but third country imports are likely to fall. There is some uncertainty surrounding these projections, especially on price movements, because of possible changes in the Regime and in the usual market forces. The EEC is likely therefore to remain a major but declining market for New Zealand unless efforts are made to fulfill the voluntary quota by expanding the continental market to offset the forecast decline in exports to Britai...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} aims {{to understand}} a firm's optimal capital structure decision when it confronts Knightian uncertainty. It contains three chapters. In Chapter One, I derive the optimal capital structure of a firm when its manager is ambiguity-averse. My model predicts substantially lower leverage for such firms, in comparison to traditional static trade-off models. I use the 1982 <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Restraint</b> <b>Agreement</b> (VRA) on steel import quotas between the U. S. government and the European Community as an exogenous reduction in Knightian uncertainty faced by firms in the U. S. steel industry. Using a difference-in-difference methodology, I find that when uncertainty is resolved, a median firm in the U. S. steel industry increases its market and book leverage by approximately 12 percent relative to a matched control firm from another industry. The results are not explained away by changes in traditional risk factors or by a change in expected future profitability. In Chapter Two, I develop a new measure of Knightian uncertainty using a mixture of normal distributions. Using this novel measure, I find that a median firm in the sample decreases its market leverage by approximately 3. 6 percent, when the firm's measure of uncertainty increases by one standard deviation. I also find an increase in a firm's uncertainty measure from the minimum to the maximum {{is associated with a}} 6. 3 percent increase in the firm's propensity to take almost zero leverage. In Chapter Three, I consider a firm's decision to exercise real options, when the firm faces Knightian uncertainty about the evolution of project value. I provide two continuous time applications extended from the discrete time applications in Miao and Wang (2011) that show the value of waiting (which increases with risk) decreases with uncertainty. I incorporate ambiguity-averse investors who are uncertain about the evolution of a firm's assets into the dynamic capital structure model of Leland (1994). I show that even in this dynamic setting, uncertainty provides a more plausible explanation for firms taking on low leverage than risk alone...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present for the}} first time {{estimates}} of cost and efficiency differences between U.

We demonstrate that the cost difference estimates for 1979 which were influential in the debate that resulted in the <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Restraints</b> <b>Agreements</b> of 1981 - 85 were substantial over estimates of the Japanese advantage. While our estimate of the Japanese cost advantage for 1980 is similar to previous estimates, we attribute most of this advantage to short-run phenomena -underutilization of U. S. production capacity and an undervalued yen. In a previous paper we have shown that the Japanese TFP growth rate was much faster than the U. S. rate during the 1970 's. However we estimate the long-run underlying Japanese efficiency advantage as of 1980 to have been only 1 - 2 %, much less than previously estimated. This results from the fact that Japan began the 1970 's with a long-run efficiency disadvantage of over 20 %, and the decade of the 1970 's represented a catch-up period for Japanese producers. ...|$|R

A system of intervention buying or deficiency payments ensures that producers are guaranteed a minimum price.

There are a number of disadvantages and benefits for New Zealand attached to this agreement, for example no allowance for market growth but higher per unit returns.

40|$|A primary {{function}} of trade {{policy is to}} restrict imports to benefit the targeted domestic sector. However, a well-established theoretical literature highlights that the form of trade policy (e. g., quotas versus tariffs) can {{have a significant impact}} on how much trade policy affects firms’ abilities to price above marginal cost (i. e., market power). The US steel industry provides an excellent example to study these issues, as it has received many different types of trade protection over the past decades. We model the US steel market and then use a panel of data on major steel products from 1980 through 2006 to examine the effects of various trade policies on the steel market. We find that the US steel market is very competitive throughout our sample with the exception of the period in which they received comprehensive <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>agreements</b> (i. e., quotas) and were able to price substantially above marginal cost. All other forms of protection were in tariff form and had little effect on market power, consistent with prior theoretical literature on the nonequivalence of tariffs and quotas.

40|$|Literature about {{strategic}} {{trade policy}} (Brender, Krugman, [...] .) has been concerned only with implicit internal strategic trade policies. We define them as policy tools targeting exclusively {{the behavior of}} national firms. In duopolistic terms, {{the goal is to}} move the reaction function of the domestic firm and to locate it in a better position than previously. The home country government must credibly commits itself to pursue a particular trade policy before firms make decisions about prices or production. On the contrary, external strategic trade policies influence the behaviour of foreign firms and force them to act in the way desired by the home government. Mixed strategies associate both actions and may lead to a collusive agreement. We show that if subsidy is an attractive policy tool for internal strategic trade policy with Cournot-Nash competition, <b>Voluntary</b> Export <b>Restraints</b> <b>agreements</b> are an equivalent and alternative strategic trade policy for governments having more preference for fiscal restraints than for the surplus of consumers and the general welfare.

In the case of cassava, Thailand appears to have had parts of GATT law on its side, but the government was very reluctant to use the law to its own advantage. This reluctance was due to unclear procedures under GATTas to how to make effective use of these legal advantages. On the rice subsidy issue, conversely, the substantive law is unclear and provides limited protection for competing exporters. The wider lesson drawn from the two cases is that GATT's law should be modified and its role reevaluated so that both developed and developing countries can participate more fully in the GATT system.

40|$|The {{realization}} of a multifaceted self {{is an ideal}} one strives to realize. One realizes such a self in large part through interaction with others in various social roles. Such realization requires a significant degree of informational privacy. Informational privacy {{is the ability to}} determine for yourself when others may collect and how they may use your information. The {{realization of}} multifaceted selves requires informational privacy in public. There is no contradiction here: informational privacy is a matter of control, and you can have such control in public. Current information processing practices greatly reduce privacy in public thereby threatening the realization of multifaceted selves. To understand way this is happening and {{to figure out how to}} respond, we analyze the foundations of privacy in public. Privacy in public consists in privacy by obscurity and privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> Privacy by obscurity is essentially a matter of getting lost in the crowd. Privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> was perhaps first explicitly discussed by the great nineteen century sociologist, Georg Simmel. He was impressed by the fact that people voluntary limit their knowledge of each other as interact in various social roles. Merchants and customers, students and teachers, restaurant customers and waiters, for example, typically exchange only the information necessary to their interaction in those roles and voluntarily refrain from requesting, disclosing, or otherwise discovering more. Advances in information processing have greatly reduced both privacy by obscurity and privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> We focus on the latter. One reason is that, as privacy by obscurity declines, the need for privacy in public by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> increases. We confine our attention to the private sector; however, given the current corporate-government surveillance partnership, constraining private information processing is an essential part of constraining governmental processing. Unlike privacy by obscurity, you need the cooperation of others to realize privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> We explain the cooperation by appeal to informational norms, norms that define contextually varying permissions and restrictions on the collection, use, and distribution of information. Norm-implemented coordination is essential to privacy in public (in the form of <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint),</b> and it is this coordination that advances in information processing and related business practices undermined. This happens in two ways. First, businesses exploit existing norms to create a debased form of “coordination” that serves their interests while eroding privacy in public. Second, technology-driven business innovation has created new forms of interaction not governed by relevant information norms. This lack of norms means the lack the coordination essential to privacy in public. As privacy in public disappears, multifaceted selves face the threat of disappearing—literally—from the scene. The solution is to establish norms that ensure sufficient privacy in public. We conclude by considering the prospects for doing so. Our results are highly relevant to the proper legal approach to privacy. A critical task for legal regulation, as well as public policy generally, is the creation of appropriate informational norms. One of our primary motives is to reorient privacy regulation toward that task...|$|R
