40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{presence}} of spillover effects of marketing in mutual fund families. We find that funds with high <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses</b> generate spillovers, and enhance cash inflows to family members with low <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses.</b> In particular, low-marketing funds that are operated by a family with high <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses</b> have substantially larger inflows after positive returns than otherwise similar funds that are operated by a family with low <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses,</b> while they have smaller outflows after negative returns. One way to interpret the spillovers {{is that they are}} a by-product of individual fund marketing whereby the entire family is made more visible to investors. An alternative explanation of this observation is that funds with low <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses</b> are directly subsidized by family members with high <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses.</b> We develop and perform a set of tests to evaluate these two alternative hypotheses. The results of all tests support the subsidization hypothesis, and suggest that {{at least part of the}} spillovers can be attributed to favoritism. These results suggest that conflicts of interest between investors and fund families have been exacerbated by competition in the mutual fund industry...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{customer}}-specific <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses</b> on customer retention and customer profitability in a business-to-business setting. Using data from a company providing hygiene services, we look at the impact of a hitherto unstudied type of expense targeted at individual customer relationships: the offering of free equipment to customers. The data allow tracking the activities performed in more than 4, 500 customer relationships over a period of 4 years. Retention rates are higher for customers targeted with free equipment, but this effect results from an interaction with customer size. First-order dynamic panel data analyses show that the impact of targeted <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses</b> on customer dollar profit is positive for large customers, but there is no effect for smaller customers. Thus, targeted <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses</b> seem to be a tool for relationship maintenance rather than customer development: they help in retaining large customers that generate more profit, but they do not seem to work in developing new customers into larger, more profitable ones.

Its advertising and <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses</b> decreased by approximately 3.9% to US$2,805,260 from US$2,921,327 over the year ended December 31, 2008. Advertising and <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses</b> were approximately 5.1% of their total revenues in 2009 and 2008. The decrease was attributed to a shift in advertising, including using billboard trucks for mobile advertising versus leasing fixed billboard signs.

40|$|How can {{a service}} firm right-size <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses</b> and yet strive to {{maximize}} revenue? This paper represents {{the first attempt}} to model these efficiency and effectiveness issues using a 49 -unit Asia-Pacific hotel chain as illustration. We employ a triangular DEA model with total expenses (controlling for number of rooms) as the raw input, <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses</b> as intermediate output/input and revenues from room rentals and F&B as final outputs. We infer that efficiency tails off when more than 12 % of the budget is expended on marketing activities. In terms of effectiveness, we find that all the units rated as relatively inefficient can accrue increasing returns to scale in revenues from marketing activities. By contrast, in the productivity stage linking the raw inputs to the revenues, we observe mostly decreasing returns to scale. Our results highlight the crucial role of marketing in service organizations. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

An augmented reality presentation provides a more complete idea of a design than other presentations such as 3 D model renderings and hand drawn artist sketches.

This difficulty has been associated with lower spatial ability in people who are not accustomed to reviewing plans. Augmented reality can be used to make visualization easier and help developers save on <b>marketing</b> <b>expenses.</b> The use of augmented reality could lower sales and <b>marketing</b> <b>expense</b> by reducing the number of model homes built to help potential buyers visualize new concepts.
