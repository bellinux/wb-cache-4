50|$|Mg2+ {{block the}} NMDA {{receptor}} channels in voltage dependent manner {{but they are}} highly permeable to Ca2+. Activation of the receptor depends on glutamate binding, D-serine or glycine binding at its NR1-linked binding site and AMPA receptor-mediated depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, which relieves the <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>channel</b> block by Mg2+. Activation and opening of the receptors channel thus allows the flow of K+, Na+ and Ca2+ ions, and the influx of Ca2+ triggers intracellular signaling pathways. Allosteric receptor binding sites for zinc, proteins and the polyamines spermidine and spermine are also modulators for the NMDA receptor channels.|$|E

Mammalians possess a similar structure, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The composition of these pores is under debate. Among other components, the <b>voltage-dependent</b> anion <b>channel</b> has been proposed as a component of either pore. In yeast from an industrial strain, octylguanidine and calcium closed the yeast mitochondrial unspecific channel. Here, the effects of the cations Ca 2 + or octylguanidine and the <b>voltage-dependent</b> anion <b>channel</b> effector decavanadate were evaluated in yeast mitochondria from either a wild type or a <b>voltage-dependent</b> anion <b>channel</b> deletion laboratory strain.

40|$|Removal of Ca 2 + {{from the}} {{solution}} bathing neurons {{is known in}} many cases to alter the gating properties of <b>voltage-dependent</b> K+ <b>channels</b> and to induce a large, nonselective "leak" conductance. We used a heterologous expression system to test whether the leak conductance observed in neurons is mediated by <b>voltage-dependent</b> K+ <b>channels</b> in an altered, debased conformation. <b>Voltage-dependent</b> K+ <b>channels</b> were expressed in an insect cell line infected with a recombinant baculovirus carrying the cDNA for Drosophila Shaker "A-type" K+ channels. These expressed channels respond to low Ca 2 + identically to <b>voltage-dependent</b> K+ <b>channels</b> in native neuronal membranes; upon removal of external Ca 2 +, Shaker K+ currents disappear and are replaced by a steady, nonselective leak conductance. However, control cells devoid of Shaker channels were free of any voltage-dependent conductances and did not generate a leak when external Ca 2 + was removed. These results show that Ca 2 + is essential for proper function of <b>voltage-dependent</b> K+ <b>channels</b> and is required to stabilize the native conformations of these membrane proteins...|$|R

In this study, we present data on a <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>channel</b> in rabbit ventricular cells; the properties indicate that it is an IK channel. Patch-clamp experiments were carried out on cell-attached and inside-out patches of rabbit ventricular cells. Single-channel currents were recorded at negative potentials as inward currents with 150 mM K+ in the pipette. <b>Voltage-dependent</b> <b>channel</b> activity was only present after the return from a depolarizing test pulse, indicating activation on depolarization. Single-channel conductance calculated from the current-voltage relation was 13. 1 pS (pooled data, n = 8). The shift in reversal potential of the unitary currents, determined at 150 and 300 mM K+ at the intracellular side of the membrane, showed that the channels were highly permeable to potassium ions. Increase of the duration or the amplitude of the depolarizing test pulse increased channel activity. The time constant for activation at + 30 mV was 187 msec (pooled data, n = 4). Half-activation potential was - 4. 9 +/- 3. 8 mV (mean +/- SD), and the slope factor was 7. 2 +/- 3. 7 mV (mean +/- SD). Current tails, reconstructed from averaged single-channel currents, revealed that the time course of deactivation decreased from 694 +/- 73 msec at - 80 mV to 136 +/- 39 msec at - 110 mV.

Previously, we reported the characterization in planar bilayers of a high conductance Ca 2 +-selective, voltage-dependent multistate channel from S. purpuratus sea urchin sperm plasma membranes [14]. Here we show that this ion channel can be directly transferred to planar lipid bilayers upon sperm addition, from sea urchin [S. purpuratus and L. pictus) and from mouse. We found that spermatozoa from these species posses a conspicuous Ca 2 +-selective, high conductance, multi-state, <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>channel,</b> which displays similar voltage dependence and equal PBa 2 +/PK+ ~ 4 in the three species. The presence of this Ca 2 + channel in such diverse species suggests it plays a relevant role in sperm physiology.

This function critically {{depends on the}} reliable opening of HCN channels in the subthreshold voltage-range. Here we show that activation of HCN channels at physiologically relevant voltages requires interaction with phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2). PIP 2 acts as a ligand that allosterically opens HCN channels by shifting <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>channel</b> activation ∼ 20 mV toward depolarized potentials. Allosteric gating by PIP 2 occurs in all HCN subtypes and is independent of the action of cyclic nucleotides. In CNS neurons and cardiomyocytes, enzymatic degradation of phospholipids results in reduced channel activation and slowing of the spontaneous firing rate. These results demonstrate that gating by phospholipids {{is essential for the}} pacemaking activity of HCN channels in cardiac and neuronal rhythmogenesis...|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanism}} for regulating voltage-gated channels is presented. The treatment amplifies {{the effect of}} the applied membrane potential resulting in a dramatic increase in the channel's voltage dependence. Addition of a large polyvalent anion to the medium bathing a phospholipid bilayer containing the <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>channel</b> from the mitochondrial outer membrane, VDAC, induced up to a 12 -fold increase in the channel's voltage sensitivity. The highest polyvalent anion concentration tested resulted in an e-fold conductance change for a 0. 36 -mV change in membrane potential. On the low end, a concentration of 2 microM resulted in a 50 % increase in VDAC voltage dependence. A mechanism based on polyvalent anion accumulation in the access resistance region {{at the mouth of the}} pore is consistent with all findings. Perhaps the voltage dependence of voltage-gated channels is amplified in vivo by polyvalent ions. If so, the control of excitable phenomena may be under much finer regulation than that provided by membrane potential alone...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a mathematical model of the L-type Ca 2 + current, {{which is based on}} data from whole-cell voltage clamp experiments on rat ventricular myocytes. Ion substitution methods were employed to investigate the ionic selectivity of the channel. Experiments were configured with Na+, Ca 2 + or Ba 2 + as the majority current carrier. The amplitude of current through the channel is attenuated in the presence of extracellular Ca 2 + or Ba 2 +. Our model accounts for channel selectivity by using a modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) configuration that employs <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>channel</b> binding functions for external divalent ions. Stronger binding functions were used for Ca 2 + than for Ba 2 +. Decay of the ionic current during maintained depolarization was characterized by means of voltage- and Ca 2 +-dependent inactivation pathways embedded in a five-state dynamic channel model. Particularly, Ca 2 + first binds to calmodulin and the Ca 2 +-calmodulin complex is the mediator of Ca 2 + inactivation. Ba 2 +-dependent inactivation was characterized using the same scheme, but with a decreased binding to calmodulin. A reduced amount of steady-state inactivation, as evidenced by a U-shaped curve at higher depolarization levels (> 40 mV) in the presence of [Ca 2 +]o, was observed in double-pulse protocols used to study channel inactivation. To characterize this phenomenon, a mechanism was incorporated into the model whereby Ca 2 + or Ba 2 + also inhibits the voltage-dependent inactivation pathway. The five-state dynamic channel model was also used to simulate single channel activity. Calculations of the open probability of the channel model are generally consistent with experimental data. A sixth state can be used to simulate modal activity by way of introducing long silent intervals. Our model has been tested extensively using experimental data {{from a wide variety of}} voltage clamp protocols and bathing solution manipulations. It provides: (a) biophysically based explanations of putative mechanisms underlying Ca 2 +- and <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>channel</b> inactivation, and (b) close fits to voltage clamp data.
