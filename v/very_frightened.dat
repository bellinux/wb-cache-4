The Law of the Sea required their rescue and they were returned to their homeland through diplomatic channels.|$|E
25|$|The pig {{was moving}} its ears. Since the cat saw it, it {{thought it was}} a mouse and in a rush jumped there. The pig was <b>very</b> <b>frightened</b> and, {{emitting}} loud shouts, ran away to the forest. The wolf, the hare and the fox thought that a great animal or something was coming and, one running faster than the other, they ran away. All the ram's meat was left to the cat. For seven days the cat ate, ate until it was full the spoils of the wolf and the fox.|$|E
25|$|Although mice {{are small}} animals and {{care must be}} taken to avoid injury, they are also {{surprisingly}} robust and inquisitive. Once out of the cage many enjoy running along their owners' arms, investigating pockets, or just sitting on the owner's lap and grooming. Some mice also tolerate gentle petting. Care must be taken as mice have poor eyesight and may try to lean too far over an edge and fall. Care must especially be taken when being handled by small children as they may be overly rough. Fancy mice very rarely bite except when hurt or <b>very</b> <b>frightened.</b> Biting behavior may result from improper handling, as mice are generally considered non-aggressive. They do have a greater likelihood of biting unfamiliar people, especially males who are wild and territorial.|$|E

500|$|The noted {{photographer}} Joseph Baynor Roberts of National Geographic {{magazine was}} able to snap several photos of this unexpected interloper (pictured) through the ship's periscope before Triton moved out of range. The November 1960 issue identified the fisherman as 19-year-old Rufino Baring of Punta Engano, Mactan Island, who believed he had encountered a sea monster: [...] "I was <b>very</b> <b>frightened.</b> I tried to get away as fast as I could." ...|$|E

In June 2010, she begins {{receiving}} threats via text messages and emails, {{telling her to}} stay away from the university. She is later followed by an unseen person in a car.

Susan tries to stand up to the bully and refuses {{to stay away from}} the university. However, when she arrives for her lesson, she receives another threatening message. This terrifies her and she locks herself in the toilets.|$|E
500|$|Raymond Benson {{noted that}} Dalton [...] "purposely played Bond as a {{ruthless}} and serious man {{with very little}} of the wit displayed by Connery, Lazenby or Moore", and considered him to be [...] "the most accurate and literal interpretation of the role... ever seen on screen". His character also reflected a degree of moral ambiguity; in Licence to Kill, for instance, he becomes a rogue agent, while Dalton himself saw the character as a [...] "man, not a superhuman; a man who is beset with moral confusions and apathies and uncertainties, and who is often <b>very</b> <b>frightened</b> and nervous and tense". Smith and Lavington observed that during Dalton's portrayal in Licence to Kill, Bond appeared [...] "self-absorbed... reckless, brutal, prone to nervous laughter and... probably insane, or at least seriously disturbed. In the light of Licence to Kill, one academic, Martin Willis, referred to Dalton's Bond as a [...] "muscular vigilante". Steven Jay Rubin noted that Dalton's films had [...] "a hard-edged reality and some unflinching violent episodes that were better suited to Dalton's more realistic approach to the character". Rubin considered Dalton's portrayal to be [...] "Fleming's Bond... the suffering Bond". In contrast to the previous incarnations of the character, Smith and Lavington identified Dalton's humour as [...] "brooding rather than flippant"; combined with his heavy smoking, they considered him [...] "an effective leading man". Eoghan Lyng, writing for The James Bond Dossier, favourably compared him to Daniel Craig, stating that [...] "Despite chronological placement, it was Dalton, not Brosnan, who proved to be the prototype for the 21st century Bond.". Although Bond screenwriter Richard Maibaum called Sean Connery the best Bond, he considered Dalton the best actor of the four he worked with. His predecessor, Roger Moore also felt that [...] Dalton was the best actor to play Bond.|$|E

5000|$|With Tales of Terror, {{we tried}} to do {{something}} a little different. The screenplay was actually a series of <b>very</b> <b>frightening,</b> dramatic sequences inspired by several of the Poe stories. To break things up, we tried introducing humor into one of them..." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "I {{stood looking}} at the school— it looked so big! Just then the guards let some white {{students}} through. The crowd was quiet. I guess they were {{waiting to see what}} was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. He didn’t move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was <b>very</b> <b>frightened</b> and didn’t know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, [...] "Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The hare couldn't see; {{at night}} the hare couldn't see. When the hare arrived there, the cat began to move. When he heard the movement, the hare ran back without taking any water. The pig asked: [...] "Why did you run away without {{bringing}} water?" [...] The hare {{said that there was}} some man there. Again the fox and the hare went to the water. When they came to the spring, they asked the cat: [...] "What are you?" [...] — [...] "I am a man", said the cat. [...] "What is that on your shoulder?", asks the fox. [...] "A rifle", says the cat. The fox and the hare were <b>very</b> <b>frightened,</b> but since they knew it was a cat, afterwards the three of them went together to cook meat. The pig hid behind a bunch of trees and, pushing out its ears, slept, and the cat was warming itself by the fire.|$|E
2500|$|Another legend {{involves}} {{a group of}} teenagers who, while drunk and/or tripping {{on some sort of}} hallucinogen, find what they perceive to be a gnome (sometimes a dwarf, hobgoblin or smurf), capture it, and bring it home. [...] They sleep off the drug's effects, and the next morning they find out that the [...] "gnome" [...] was really a lost (and <b>very</b> <b>frightened)</b> child. [...] Though the story may be told by some tellers in a negative light, it may also have a positive spin in that the teens become unwitting heroes in finding a missing child whose parents (as well as the police) had been unable to find. [...] According to Snopes.com, the legend had first surfaced in 2004, and as of 2007 the legend's truth status remains undetermined and unverifiable. [...] In some versions of a legend the [...] "gnome" [...] is not a child but a midget or a person with Down Syndrome; some have even gone as far to say it was a dead baby.|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was <b>very</b> <b>frightened</b> by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{contribution}} of mammography {{to the early}} diagnosis of cancer is controversial, and for those found with benign lesions, mammography can create a high psychological and financial cost.
