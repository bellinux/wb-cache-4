5|$|One of the Prussian playing-for-time {{requests}} to the Patriotic Party was {{that before the}} treaty is signed, {{they need to see}} more reforms within the Commonwealth government. In October 1789, the changing international situation (primarily the military defeats of the Ottoman Empire) suddenly and temporarily increased the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alliance with Poland for Prussia. In the meantime, the previously anti-royalist Patriotic Party has begun drifting closer to the king. In February and March 1790, concrete proposals were exchanged between Warsaw and Berlin. Some difficulties were centered around Prussian demands for the cession of Gdańsk and Toruń, and tariffs, but a threat of a Polish-Austrian alliance, recently brought forward by Austria, caused Prussia to withdraw most of the demands the Polish side was finding difficult to accept.|$|E

Carucage never raised as much as other taxes, but nevertheless helped to fund several projects. It paid the ransom for Richard's release in 1194, after he was taken prisoner by Leopold V, Duke of Austria; it covered the tax John had to pay Philip II of France in 1200 on land he inherited in that country; and it helped to finance Henry III's military campaigns in England and on continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Davis fell in {{love with}} Sarah Knox Taylor, {{daughter}} of his commanding officer, future president Zachary Taylor. Both Sarah and Davis sought Taylor's permission to marry. Taylor refused, as he did not wish his daughter to have the difficult life of a military wife on frontier army posts. Davis's own experience led him to appreciate Taylor's objection. He consulted with his older brother Joseph, and they both began to question the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Army career. Davis hesitated to leave, but his desire for Sarah overcame this, and he resigned his commission in a letter dated April 20, 1835. He had arranged for the letter to be sent to the War Department for him on May 12 when he did not return from leave; he had made no mention to Taylor of his intention to resign. Against his former commander's wishes, on June 17, he married Sarah in Louisville, Kentucky. His resignation became effective June 30.|$|E

5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical Life {{represents}} {{how much}} a population values reducing the probability of death. American citizens and government agencies use the <b>Value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical Life estimates in benefit-cost analysis to pass life-saving policies. The public uses this measurement as a scientific and objective tool to identify potentially favorable policy from ineffective and inefficient policy. Institutional incentives, however, are aligned for agencies to exaggerate <b>Value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical Life calculations and overregulate markets. This thesis summarizes how the <b>Value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical Life data sources, methods of estimation, and inconsistent behavioral reference points distort the statistical calculations. Despite the distorted estimation, agencies still rely heavily on the <b>Value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical Life {{as a tool to}} pass policy. Public choice theory explains that agencies employ distorted information as a tactic to pass regulation. The theory demonstrates that regulators are self-interested not unlike the general public. This thesis provides a public choice analysis and concludes that agencies are incentivized to employ distorted data sources, methods of calculation, and public risk perceptions to inflate the <b>Value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical Life and overregulate. <b>As</b> such, the <b>Value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Statistical Life will continue to be biased and inaccurate with the current methods of calculation and addressing political incentives...|$|R
