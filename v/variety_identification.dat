Current <b>variety</b> <b>identification</b> methods within the grain trade rely on differentiation by protein molecular weights, but increasingly the industry is confronted with different varieties demonstrating identical protein patterns and inhibiting conclusive varietal identity of a parcel of grain.

40|$|There is a {{continuous}} development of different crop varieties in the crop trade. The cultivated crops {{tend to be}} more and more alike which require an effective method for crop identification. Crop type and crop type purity has become a quality measure in crop trade both nationally and internationally. A number of well known quality attributes of interest in the crop trade can be correlated to the specific crop type and therefore it is of great importance to reliably be able to identify different crop varieties. It is well known from the literature that there exist genomic variations at the nucleotide level between different crop varieties and these variations might potentially be useful for automated <b>variety</b> <b>identification.</b> This project deals with the crop <b>variety</b> <b>identification</b> area where the possibilities of distinguishing between different wheat varieties are investigated.

Cluster analysis based on the allele frequency data at 29 SSR loci classified most of the varieties except for ‘Iwatsuki- 2 ’ into the predicted variety groups, ‘Kaga’, ‘Senju’ or ‘Kujo’, which were categorized based on morphological traits.

However, the available morphological traits are limited in number and easily affected by environments and growth stages of tea (Gunasekare 2007; Bandyopadhyay 2011). DNA markers are genetic markers that came from various classes of DNA mutations and rearrangements (Collard et al. 2005). Compared with morphological traits, DNA markers have numerous advantages such as multiple marker types, relative abundance of polymorphism, extensive genomic coverage, not disturbed by growth stage and tissue of plants, not affected by environment and gene expression, only a small quantity of DNA needed for assay, only a short period required for analyzing large amounts of samples, and more reproducible (Powell et al. 1996; Collard et al. 2005; Jones et al. 2009). DNA markers, including RAPD (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA), ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeat) and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) have been well developed for genetic fingerprinting and phylogenetic studies of tea in Taiwan (Lai et al. 2001; Tsai et al. 2003; Hu et al. 2005; Lin et al. 2005).

The performance of a hybrid large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer, which combines multi-layer perceptrons and Hidden Markov Models, degrades heavily {{in the presence of}} African Portuguese varieties in broadcast news. Variety-specific acoustic and language models are shown to improve recognition significantly by up to 21. 1 %, from 30. 1 % WER to 23. 7 % WER. Further, this document discusses a novel and efficient approach to automatically distinguish African from European Portuguese, first presented in [8] [10]. The phonotactic <b>variety</b> <b>identification</b> system, based on phone recognition and language modeling, focuses on a single tokenizer that combines distinctive knowledge about differences between the target varieties. This knowledge is introduced into a multi-layer perceptron phone recognizer by training variety-dependent phone models for two varieties as contrasting classes. Significant improvements were achieved, lowering the computational cost and reducing the equal error rate by more than 60 %, from 11. 4 % EER to 4. 1 % EER, compared to conventional single and fused phonotactic and acoustic systems.

SSR sequences were isolated from the flax genome using a modified fast isolation by amplified fragment length polymorphism of sequences containing repeats (FIASCO) procedure. Primers were made around the SSRs, and these regions were amplified using polymerase chain reaction. Forty-two of 92 (46 %) SSRs showed polymorphisms. The number of alleles for each SSR ranged from two to eight, with an average of 3. 32. Polymorphism information content (PIC) was calculated for the polymorphic SSRs, with a range of 0. 1049 &ndash; 0. 8642, the average being 0. 47. Several SSRs were also found informatically using genome sequence data from the flax variety Bethune.

This paper reports the development of a simple and automatic method of classification of grapevine varieties from leaf spectroscopy. The method consists of a classifier based on partial least squares that discriminates among grapevine varieties using a hyperspectral image of a leaf measured in reflectance mode. Hyperspectral imaging was conducted with a camera with 1040 wavelength bands operating between 380. nm and 1028. nm. The classifier was created using 300 leaves, 100 of each of the varieties Vitis vinifera L., Tempranillo, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon. Monte-Carlo cross-validation confirmed the classifier's performance for the three varieties, which exceeded 92 % in all cases.
