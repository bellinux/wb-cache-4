5|$|Simple {{versions}} are prepared by slicing vegetables and drying them, without any cooking involved. Sometimes a mandoline {{is used to}} slice <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> vegetable chips, which can accommodate thin slicing and enhance size consistency. Vegetable chips may be flavored with spices such as salt, sea salt, pepper, cajun spice, curry, allspice, chipotle powder, sweet or smoked paprika, adobo seasoning, dried chives and many others. Mass-produced varieties may contain food preservatives or monosodium glutamate. Vegetable chips can be homemade using various recipes and preparation processes.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E
5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled {{kitchen garden}} {{was built in}} the early 1700s to provide fruit and <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is built into the {{southern}} wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys built into the wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E

50|$|Though it is botanically a berry, {{a subset}} of fruit, the tomato is a <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> culinary purposes, because of its savory flavor (see below).|$|R
5000|$|In Korean cuisine, dasima {{is used to}} make broth, deep-fried into bugak or twigak (coated and {{uncoated}} fries), pickled in {{soy sauce}} as jangajji, and eaten raw as a sea <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> ssam (wraps).|$|R
5|$|The {{southern}} colonies can be culturally {{divided between}} the uplands and the lowlands, and this distinction is seen in diet and food preparation in the two regions. The diet of the uplands often included cabbage, string beans, white potatoes, while most affluent whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because they were associated with, and reflected the social inferiority of, black slaves. Those who could grow or afford wheat often had biscuits on their table for breakfast, along with healthy portions of pork. Salted pork was a staple of any meal, as it {{was used in the}} preparations of <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> flavor, in addition to its direct consumption as a protein.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{proposed}} {{building a}} dock accessed by the railway for export of coal, iron and limestone, and import of hay, grain and <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> the mining districts. The idea was also attractive to railway developers of the period. The Ogmore Valley Railway Company wanted to increase revenue by carrying coal for shipment to the docks at Cardiff and Penarth. H. Voss, the engineer of the Ely Valley Railway Company and the Great Western Railway, also saw its commercial potential, {{and made a}} proposal to Jenner of Wenvoe Castle to build a dock at Barry, {{the largest in the}} district, which would be connected by rail to Peterston-super-Ely on the main South Wales line.|$|E
5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E
50|$|Jackfruit {{industries}} are established in Sri Lanka and Vietnam, where the fruit is processed into {{products such as}} flour, noodles, papad, and ice cream. It is also canned and sold as a <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> export.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Botanically, {{a tomato}} is a fruit. However, in common parlance {{it is seen}} as a vegetable; hence the United States Supreme Court ruled that a tomato is a <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> the {{purposes}} of the customs regulations.|$|R
50|$|Lathyrus tuberosus is {{occasionally}} {{grown as}} a root <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> its edible tuber {{and has been}} cultivated {{at least since the}} 17th century. The sweet, starchy tubers are edible cooked or raw. Although palatable and nutritious, the crop is hampered by low productivity.|$|R

25|$|The area of {{the gardens}} closest to the palace is {{reserved}} for the Royal Family, but is usually {{open to the public}} in July. Here are the kitchen gardens, which supply fresh <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> the household, and a modern orangery, which was opened in 1995.|$|E
50|$|The law exempts fruit but not vegetables, causing tomato {{importers}} to file sue {{claiming that}} tomatoes are a fruit, {{resulting in the}} unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision in Nix v. Hedden (May 10, 1893) that tomatoes are {{to be considered a}} <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> purposes of this tariff.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves and}} the scaly bulb of myeongi {{are most often}} eaten as namul-type side dish, or as a ssam <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> a samgyeopsal("grilled pork belly") meal. Myeongi is also eaten pickled as jangajji-type side dish, or used as the last {{ingredient}} in dakgomtang("chicken bone soup").|$|R

But I never can look upon an apple of that variety without thinking of my poisoned nestling! Ah! so plump, and rosy, and--rotten!" ...|$|R
25|$|Longley Hall Farm was {{adjacent}} to the Hall on what is now Crowder Road. Between 1906 and the 1950s the farm produced fresh milk, meat and <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> the nearby Northern General Hospital. The farm was demolished in 1969 and its land was used for housing.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally in winter, jams, preserves, and pickles {{are brought}} to the table. Gathering and conserving fruits, mushrooms, and <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> winter has always been popular, but today {{gathering}} and conserving is becoming less common because everything can be bought from stores. However, preparing food for winter is still very popular in the countryside.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries laundresses {{stretched}} their lines across the village green and market gardeners tended their <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> Pembroke College, Oxford. Farmers also reared pigs {{for the college}} tables. The 1871 Census recorded a population of 373, including 93 employed on the land, 14 craftsmen, 30 in other trades, a curate and two publicans. There were 12 farmers in 1841 and only two in 1990, but the village still has two publicans.|$|E

25|$|In the past, celery {{was grown}} as a <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> winter and early spring; it was {{perceived}} as a cleansing tonic, welcomed to counter the salt-sickness of a winter diet based on salted meats without greens. By the 19th century, the season for celery had been extended, to last {{from the beginning of}} September to late in April.|$|R
25|$|Goodall {{played his}} last {{football}} game for Watford on 14 September 1907 {{at the age}} of 44 years, 87 days in a Southern League game against Bradford Park Avenue, becoming the oldest person ever to have played for Watford. He came back to football in 1910 with RC Roubaix and retired in 1913 as player-manager of Mardy. Thereafter, lived out a rather impecunious existence, tending to an allotment to provide <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> his family and forlornly walking one of his pet foxes around the town.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{published}} in the Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism focused on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components in different African populations using various criteria. Reports from Lagos, Nigeria, for instance, showed the prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome as high as over 80% among diabetic patients. The current trend of rising metabolic syndrome in African populations is largely and generally attributed to “adoption of western lifestyle which is characterized by reduced physical activity, substitution of the traditional African diet rich in fruits, and <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> the more energy-laden foods”.|$|E
25|$|In mediaeval times, Homerton, {{like much}} of Hackney, was {{predominantly}} rural and arable crops were grown, together with fruit and <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> the City of London markets. The majority of land was given over to pasture for sheep and cattle, and milk and cheese was also supplied to the City. Small kitchen gardens ran {{at the back of}} the houses along the road, with large fields behind. Domestic brewing was common (there are records of brewing performed at Sutton House and the Tan House). Many unsavoury activities (banned in the City) were also undertaken, such as tanning and fulling - the cleaning of felt cloth using urine.|$|E
50|$|Other uses include {{manufacturing}} sulfur dyes, insecticides, synthetic rubbers. Also used in cold vulcanization of rubbers, as polymerization catalyst <b>for</b> <b>vegetable</b> {{oils and}} <b>for</b> hardening soft woods.|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, four gardeners were {{employed}} at Inveresk Lodge. After having been used <b>for</b> <b>vegetable</b> growing <b>for</b> the war effort, the garden became neglected. The National Trust redesigned the garden so that it could be managed by just one gardener.|$|R
25|$|Crop {{areas were}} farmed in two highly diverse manners. Areas relying on {{non-irrigated}} cultivation (secano), which made up 85% {{of the entire}} crop area, depended solely on rainfall {{as a source of}} water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (regadío) accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in Almería—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> export to Europe.|$|E
25|$|The Shimōsa Plateau {{remains an}} {{important}} economic center of Japan. Compared to the post-war period, {{the distribution of}} economic activity on the plateau has changed. Primary industry accounts for only 5% of economic activity, secondary accounted for 27%, and tertiary 68%. Tertiary industry on the plateau consists of both the service industry serving the densely populated areas of northern Chiba Prefecture, {{as well as the}} extensive logistics network connecting the Keiyō Industrial Zone and Narita International Airport with other areas of Japan. While agriculture accounts for {{a small part of the}} overall economy on the Shimōsa Plateau, the northern and eastern area of the plateau is a large producer of <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> the Tokyo Metropolitan Region. The flat, eastern part of the Shimōsa Plateau continues to support rice production.|$|E
25|$|Cardboard, {{aluminium}} foil, {{and plastic}} bags {{for well over}} 10,000 solar cookers have been donated to the Iridimi Refugee Camp and Touloum Refugee Camps in Chad by the combined efforts of the Jewish World Watch, the Dutch foundation KoZon, and SCI. The refugees construct the cookers themselves, using the donated supplies and locally purchased Arabic gum, and use them for midday and evening meals. The goal of this project was to reduce the Darfuri women's need to leave the relative safety of the camp to gather firewood, which exposed them to {{a high risk of}} being beaten, raped, kidnapped, or murdered. It has also significantly reduced the amount of time women spend tending open fires each day, with the results that they are healthier and they have more time to grow <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> their families and make handicrafts for export.|$|E

50|$|Brassica {{vegetables}} are highly regarded for their nutritional value. They provide high amounts of vitamin C and soluble fiber and contain nutrients with anticancer properties: 3,3'-diindolylmethane, sulforaphane and selenium. Boiling reduces {{the level of}} anticancer compounds, but steaming, microwaving, and stir frying do not result in significant loss. Steaming these <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> three to four minutes is recommended to maximize sulforaphane.|$|R
