5|$|HDMI 1.0 was {{released}} on December 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface. The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same <b>video</b> <b>transmission</b> format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165MHz (4.95 Gbit/s), the same as DVI. It defined two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for <b>video</b> <b>transmission,</b> giving it 3.96Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1920×1080 or 1920×1200 at 60Hz) and 8channel LPCM/192kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 supported only 24bit/px color depth and required support for RGB video, with optional support for YCBCR 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device had support for YCBCR on other interfaces). Only the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces were supported. HDMI 1.0 allowed only specific pre-defined video formats to be transmitted, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B {{as well as some}} additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources are also required to be capable of sending or receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the ship, Jill and Parker enter a {{room where}} they believe Chris is being held, realizing too late {{that it was a}} trap set by a Veltro operative. Meanwhile, Chris and Jessica find a base of {{operations}} for Veltro; the Valkoinen Mökki airstrip in the mountains. Being informed by O'Brian that Jill and Parker are missing in the Mediterranean, they are redeployed to investigate their whereabouts. O'Brian also sends BSAA agents Quint Cetcham and Keith Lumley to Valkoinen Mökki to gather information. Awakening in separate locked rooms, Jill and Parker manage to regroup and witness a <b>video</b> <b>transmission</b> of a Veltro member threatening to infect one fifth of the Earth's oceans with the T-Abyss, which was created in retaliation to the FBC for their involvement in the destruction of Veltro's forces on Terragrigia. Jill and Parker reach the ship's antenna to request evacuation, but learn that FBC director Morgan Lansdale activated a satellite attack on the Queen Zenobia, which floods the ship with water.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 2.0 {{increases}} the maximum TMDS clock to 600MHz (18.0Gbit/s). HDMI 2.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for <b>video</b> <b>transmission</b> like previous versions, {{giving it a}} maximum video bandwidth of 14.4Gbit/s. This enables HDMI 2.0 to carry 4K video at 60Hz with 24bit/px color depth. Other features of HDMI 2.0 include support for the Rec. 2020 color space, up to 32 audio channels, up to 1536kHz audio sample frequency, dual video streams to multiple users on the same screen, up to four audio streams, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, 25 fps 3D formats, support for the 21:9 aspect ratio, dynamic synchronization of video and audio streams, the HE-AAC and DRA audio standards, improved 3D capability, and additional CEC functions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{proposes a}} joint source-channel rate control {{algorithm}} for real-time <b>video</b> <b>transmissions</b> over WCDMA systems. The algorithm encompasses a region-based bit allocation strategy and a macroblock-based segmentation technique. To enhance the video quality while saving bits, the algorithm effectively allocates more bits to {{important parts of}} a video frame, and also adapts to time-varying WCDMA channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively improves perceptual quality, reduces frame skipping and, thereby, maintains the motion continuity in wireless <b>video</b> <b>transmissions.</b> I...|$|R

25|$|The Malaysian Army {{currently}} has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, {{as well as}} equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness {{up and down as}} well as <b>video</b> <b>transmission</b> to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales St@rmille radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban profile analysis. The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia.|$|E
500|$|On 8 April 2008, Flocke {{made her}} first public {{appearance}} in the polar bear enclosure {{that had once been}} home to Vilma; the adult polar bear had been relocated to another zoo. [...] The four-month-old cub was greeted by more than 160 journalists and a half-dozen international camera crews on the first day. During the first week, Flocke was displayed for short intervals with breaks at midday. [...] Expecting a peak of 20,000 visitors, the zoo built a viewing platform, capable of holding 500 people at a time, in front of the enclosure, but attendance by zoo patrons was initially lower than expected. [...] The zoo uses a <b>video</b> <b>transmission</b> and recording system from Bosch Security Systems to transmit TV-quality live images of the cub to a pair of [...] large-format screens. [...] This system, which includes one screen outside the enclosure, was implemented to help the zoo meet the demands of visitors wanting {{to catch a glimpse of}} Flocke.|$|E
500|$|In , a {{research}} station of the Dharma Initiative, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) is {{captured by the}} resident Others Greta (Lana Parrilla) and Bonnie (Tracy Middendorf). Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) learns of Charlie's infiltration and sends Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff) to the station to kill the three to preserve the signal jamming. Mikhail arrives and kills Greta and Bonnie, only to be shot through the chest with a spear gun by Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) who emerges from a closet where he had hidden after diving down a short time after Charlie. Getting the code from Bonnie before she dies (the notes to the middle eight of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] by The Beach Boys), Charlie disables the jammer, and is contacted by Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger) via <b>video</b> <b>transmission.</b> Penny informs Charlie {{that she does not}} know Naomi, and did not send the boat that Naomi claims to be from.

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{time-varying}} wireless channels, deterministic {{quality of}} service (QoS) is usually difficult to guarantee for real-time multi-layer <b>video</b> <b>transmissions</b> in wireless networks. Consequently, statistical QoS guarantees have become an important alternative in supporting real-time <b>video</b> <b>transmissions.</b> In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to model the statistical delay QoS guarantees, in terms of QoS exponent, effective bandwidth/capacity, and delay-bound violation probability, for multi-layer <b>video</b> <b>transmissions</b> over wireless fading channels. In particular, a separate queue is maintained for each video layer, and the same delay bound and corresponding violation probability threshold are set up for all layers. Applying the effective bandwidth/capacity analyses on the incoming video stream, we obtain a set of QoS exponents for all video layers to effectively characterize this delay QoS requirement. We then develop a set of optimal adaptive transmission schemes to minimize the resource consumption while satisfying the diverse QoS requirements under various scenarios, including video unicast/multicast with and/or without loss tolerance. Simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the impact of statistical QoS provisionings on resource allocations of our proposed adaptive transmission schemes.
