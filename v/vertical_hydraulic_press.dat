30|$|Both {{windmill}} and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressed</b> oils {{have been}} used in the 19 th century. However, we preferred to use the water-washed windmill pressed oil above the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressed</b> oil for several reasons. Firstly, by using the windmill extraction method relative large amounts of linseed oil could be pressed at once; if we had used the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>press</b> at our disposal instead, the process would have been far more time consuming. Furthermore, the water-washed windmill oil has a somewhat lower quality—a higher acid value and a more yellow colour—than the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressed</b> oil, which is possibly what one might expect for a linseed oil produced in the 19 th century.|$|R
