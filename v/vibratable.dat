40|$|Particle packing {{is one of}} {{important}} parameters, which dictates physical and thermo-mechanical properties of refractories. Fillers play a substantial role in the packing behaviour of low cement castable. Fine filler particles fill the voids of the castable aggregate leading to a high packing density of the castable and thereby decrease the cement as well as water requirement of the castable. Micro-silica and calcined alumina are normally used as filler materials {{in the development of}} low cement castable. It has been established that these fine fillers particles are responsible to provide ceramic bond and the intermediate temperature and provides high strength at high temperature due to formation of secondary mullite. In the present work an attempt has been made to develop low cement castable with suitable filler addition. Effect of particle size and particle size distribution of calcined alumina filler has been studied in order to achieve high flow behaviour in low cement 70 % alumina based <b>vibratable</b> castable formulation. This alumina filler particle has further been used to optimize and develop a suitable self-flow castable, wherein the amount of micro-silica and calcined alumina amount has been optimized. Physical and thermo-mechanical properties of the castables thus developed have also been studied in detail. Attempt has also been made to study the effect of setting accelerator amount on the properties of self-flow castable thus developed with an aim for shotcreating application...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the most}} {{impressive}} developments observed in the last 20 years, {{the improvement of the}} installation methods of monolithic refractories is certainly to be taken into account. However, this evolution, from <b>vibratable</b> castables to shotcrete and drycrete was not applied to materials based on magnesia, which are still mostly commercialized as ramming mixes, or as pouring castables with poor properties due to excessive water use. The major issues associated to this lack of technology is the scarcity of submicrometric powders compatible to magnesian systems, and the expansion followed by hydration of the magnesia, which is a disruptive reaction. By a thorough research on the literature, some potential additives were identified to be tested as anti-hydration additives. Hydration tests of powders in autoclave, complemented by pH and rheological measurements on magnesia pastes have identified five possible additives which can be used to inhibit the hydration: tartaric acid, citric acid, boric acid, magnesium fluoride and microsilica. Salts from the organic acids can also be successfully used. Of these, microsilica also presented the advantage of providing the submicrometric particles necessary to improve the flow of the castable, and to improve the bond of the castable. The three acids are very effective in inhibiting the formation of magnesium hydroxide, but affect negatively flow properties and mechanical resistance after cure. Microsilica prevented hydration cracks due to the reaction between the silicic acid generated under basic environment with the newly formed brucite, leading to the precipitation of a magnesium-silica-hydrated phase of poor crystallinity between the magnesia grains. This phase does not promote volumetric change, and also enable water release at a wider temperature range. Due to its nature close to serpentine minerals, it forms forsterite and enstatite at low temperatures, thus generating suitable strength between room temperature and at least 1400 Â°C. Magnesium fluoride changed the nature of this magnesium-silica-hydrated phase, by being incorporated to it and forming a phase more similar to the humite minerals. These minerals present higher MgO:SiO 2 molar ratio than serpentine, and their formation requires a lower content of microsilica for a same effect against hydration, which is beneficial for the overall properties of the castable. The properties of the castable, as well as the influence of a number of other variables (for instance, refractoriness under load, creep, cold crushing strength, cold modulus of rupture, bulk density and apparent porosity) were also studied and hereby reported. It is believed that this technology can be further developed for industrial use, provided that some issues regarding the properties at high temperatures are solved. Not only had the study and comprehension {{of the nature of the}} bond between microsilica and magnesia, and the role of magnesium fluoride been pioneered by this work, but also the methodology used to evaluate the hydration after the drying process of castings, which was close to real refractory components...|$|E
