25|$|The {{differences}} {{are much more}} pronounced in <b>vibrational</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> such as infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and in rotational spectra such as microwave spectroscopy because the reduced mass of the deuterium is markedly {{higher than that of}} protium. In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, deuterium has a very different NMR frequency (e.g. 61 MHz when protium is at 400 MHz) and is much less sensitive. Deuterated solvents are usually used in protium NMR to prevent the solvent from overlapping with the signal, although deuterium NMR on its own right is also possible.|$|E

25|$|General {{secondary}} structure composition {{can be determined}} via circular dichroism. <b>Vibrational</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> {{can also be used}} to characterize the conformation of peptides, polypeptides, and proteins. Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy has become a valuable method to investigate the structures of flexible peptides and proteins that cannot be studied with other methods. A more qualitative picture of protein structure is often obtained by proteolysis, which is also useful to screen for more crystallizable protein samples. Novel implementations of this approach, including fast parallel proteolysis (FASTpp), can probe the structured fraction and its stability without the need for purification. Once a protein's structure has been experimentally determined, further detailed studies can be done computationally, using molecular dynamic simulations of that structure.|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear {{resonance}} <b>vibrational</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is a synchrotron-based {{technique that}} probes vibrational energy levels. [...] The technique, often called NRVS, is specific for samples that contain nuclei that respond to Mössbauer spectroscopy, most commonly iron. [...] The method exploits the high resolution offered by synchrotron light sources, which enables {{the resolution of}} vibrational fine structure, especially those vibrations that are coupled {{to the position of}} the Fe centre(s). [...] The method is popularly applied to problems in bioinorganic chemistry, materials science, and geophysics. A novel aspect of the method is the ability to determine the 3D-trajectory of iron atoms within vibrational modes, providing a unique appraisal of DFT-prediction accuracy. Other names for this method include nuclear inelastic scattering (NIS), nuclear inelastic absorption (NIA), nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NRIXS), and phonon assisted Mössbauer effect.|$|E
2500|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} (IR spectroscopy or <b>vibrational</b> <b>spectroscopy)</b> {{involves the}} interaction of infrared radiation with matter. It covers a range of techniques, mostly based on absorption spectroscopy. As with all spectroscopic techniques, {{it can be used}} to identify and study chemicals. Samples may be solid, liquid, or gas. The method or technique of infrared spectroscopy is conducted with an instrument called an infrared spectrometer (or spectrophotometer) to produce an infrared spectrum. [...] An IR spectrum can be visualized in a graph of infrared light absorbance (or transmittance) on the vertical axis vs. frequency or wavelength on the horizontal axis. Typical units of frequency used in IR spectra are reciprocal centimeters (sometimes called wave numbers), with the symbol cm−1. Units of IR wavelength are commonly given in micrometers (formerly called [...] "microns"), symbol μm, which are related to wave numbers in a reciprocal way. A common laboratory instrument that uses this technique is a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. Two-dimensional IR is also possible as discussed below.|$|E

Optical excitation of the intrinsic chromophore in PYP, p-coumaric acid, leads to the initiation of a photocycle that comprises several distinct intermediates. The dynamical processes responsible for the initiation of the PYP photocycle have been explored with several time-resolved techniques, which include ultrafast electronic and <b>vibrational</b> <b>spectroscopies</b> Ultrafast electronic spectroscopies, such as pump-visible probe, pump-dump-visible probe, and fluorescence upconversion, are useful in identifying the timescales and connectivity of the transient intermediates, while ultrafast <b>vibrational</b> <b>spectroscopies</b> link these intermediates to dynamic structures therein, we present {{the use of these}} techniques for exploring the initial dynamics of PYP and show how these techniques provide the basis for understanding the complex relationship between protein and chromophore, which ultimately results in biological function. © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH&Co.

30|$|It {{has also}} to be {{considered}} that measuring the surface composition of a material in vacuum (e.g. when using electron spectroscopies) or in an ambient atmosphere (e.g. <b>vibrational</b> <b>spectroscopies)</b> does not necessarily reflect the surface composition (and morphology) in an aqueous environment or blood. In situ measurements in aqueous solutions are much more complicated -if not impossible in some cases- and require specialized instruments (e.g. nonlinear optical techniques) not readily available in most laboratories.|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{the change}} in the metal-to-ligand bond {{distance}} (M-L) between the HS and LS state, the vibrational modes of the M-L are going to be affected. <b>Vibrational</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, are going to be sensitive to these M-L vibrational modes. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify which spin state is predominant in a SCO complex. [...] The spin crossover phenomenon is very sensitive to grinding, milling and pressure but Raman spectroscopy has the advantage that the sample does not require further preparation, which is in contrast to Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, FT-IR, techniques; highly colored samples may affect the measurements however. Raman spectroscopy is also advantageous because it allows perturbation of the sample with external stimuli in many ways in order to induce SCO. [...] Thermally induced spin crossover is due to the higher electronic degeneracies of the LS form and lower vibrational frequencies of the HS form, thus increasing the entropy. [...] Figure 5 shows the Raman spectrum of an iron(II) complex in the HS and LS state, emphasizing the changes in the M-L vibrational modes, where a shift from 2114cm−1 to 2070cm−1 corresponds to changes in the stretching vibrational modes of the thiocyanate ligand from a LS state to a HS state, respectively.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{characterization}} of materials involved in painted works of art provides a better knowledge of artworks through the understanding of artistic and technological processes. In this study, some pieces selected from a large corpus of French Decorative Arts objects from 18 th century museum collections were analyzed. These materials are complex system made of a multilayered colored background, covered with varnish layers. Colored or gilded ornaments are applied, representing different characters, flowers or landscapes, then varnished again. The {{aim of this study}} was to improve the painting and varnishing techniques knowledge in the Decorative Arts field during the 18 th century. <b>Vibrational</b> <b>spectroscopies,</b> Raman, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and infrared, were used to analyze some specific parts of these objects, especially organic materials such as lake pigments, binders and varnishes, and some of them were identified. For this purpose, a set of experimental setups and parameters were used according to the samples. The performed analyses were thus done using conventional FT-Raman at 1064 nm, SERS with a 458 nm excitation wavelength, infrared using a micro-ATR mode, and by defining for each technique and each analysed sample the best set of analytical parameters. The results obtained are all complementary and allowed us to completely identify and characterize multilayered paint systems as well as varnish compositions using specific data treatment methodology.
