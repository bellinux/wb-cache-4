5|$|On 10 November 1718, Bonnet {{was brought}} to trial before Sir Nicholas Trott, sitting in his {{capacity}} as <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> <b>judge.</b> Trott had already sat in judgment on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to hang. Bonnet was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to testify against Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character witness in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.|$|E
50|$|The courts became quickly unpopular. This was {{not only}} because of the express {{prohibition}} of jury trials or the fact that <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>judges</b> tended to believe that common law courts did not have superior status. It was also because a whole range of technical issues confused the legal system. It was often not clear whether vice-admiralty courts had jurisdiction over creeks or bays, or whether the governor could create vice-admiralty courts through vice-regal powers, or whether or not there was a clear method of separating the jurisdictions and procedures of vice-admiralty and common law jurisdiction. As a consequence of this, vice-admiralty courts became ineffective and, as many colonists perceived, unjust.|$|R
2500|$|In English {{admiralty}} law, piracy {{was classified}} as petit treason during the medieval period, and offenders were accordingly liable to be drawn and quartered on conviction. Piracy was redefined as a felony {{during the reign of}} Henry VIII. In either case, piracy cases were cognizable in the courts of the Lord High Admiral. English admiralty <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>judges</b> emphasized that [...] "neither Faith nor Oath is to be kept" [...] with pirates; i.e. contracts with pirates and oaths sworn to them were not legally binding. Pirates were legally subject to summary execution by their captors if captured in battle. In practice, instances of summary justice and annulment of oaths and contracts involving pirates do not appear to have been common.|$|R
50|$|In the 1700s, the British {{passed a}} variety of laws aimed at combating illegal {{smuggling}} in the American colonies. Americans had developed trade relationships with places such as southern Europe, the Netherlands and the West Indies, {{despite the fact that}} the Navigation Acts intended to give Great Britain a trade monopoly with its American colonies. The Molasses Act of 1733 had tried to tax molasses and non-British sugar, though it was largely unsuccessful. Shipowners who imported manufactured goods from the Netherlands smuggled these products in absolute secrecy, with Crown officials estimating that the annual value of manufactured goods smuggled equaled Â£500,000. British admiralty prepared commissions to authorize governors to erect vice-admiralty courts throughout the American colonies. In 1701, William Atwood was dispatched to preside as judge of the Admiralty for New Hampshire and the Jerseys. Due to firm colonial opposition, however, the task was practically impossible so he retired only a few years later. Other <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>judges</b> in Pennsylvania and southern colonies faced similar difficulties as locally elected authorities strongly opposed the work they were sent to do.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was argued}} by American colonists that <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> <b>judges</b> were corrupt and often abused their power. In the {{proceedings}} of the Continental Congress held in Philadelphia on 5 September 1774, a complaint was drafted to King George III that the [...] "judges of admiralty and vice-admiralty courts are empowered to receive their salaries and fees from the effects condemned by themselves" [...] with officers of the customs being empowered to [...] "break open and enter houses without the authority of any civil magistrate". James Otis had further complained of the lack of justice in having juryless trials and the burden of proof on the accused. The complaint made in the Continental Congress is probably alluding to the payments made to the <b>judge</b> of the <b>vice-admiralty</b> court in Halifax, where they actually received their payment not through a Crown salary but through compensation through fees charged for condemning a ship, and through the sharing of the profits of the condemnation of that ship. This was not the case in the Vice-Admiralty Courts established in Boston, Charleston and Philadelphia, where judges were paid only through salaries. In fact, the British government replied to the Congress' complaints in their Address of the People of Great Britain to the Inhabitants of America, where they mentioned that [...] "four great Vice-Admiralty Courts were ... erected in different stations in America" [...] and that [...] "large salaries were settled upon the Judges, to make them independent. These salaries were paid not from the fines and forfeitures, but in the common way".|$|R
50|$|Owing to bad health, he was induced {{to seek an}} {{appointment}} in Australia. Through the influence of his cousin Sir William Webb Follett, the then Attorney-General of England, he was appointed Master in Equity of New South Wales, and left London in September 1842 for Sydney. He landed on 1 January 1843, and held the post of Master in Equity, together with that of Chief Commissioner of Insolvent Estates, until his appointment as Resident Judge {{in the district of}} Moreton Bay (now Queensland) in January 1856. Then he returned to Sydney in February 1859, and was a Supreme Court Judge till his death on 26 May 1865 in Maitland, New South Wales. He held also during this period the offices of Judge of the Court of <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> and Primary <b>Judge</b> in Equity.|$|R
