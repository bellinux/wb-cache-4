25|$|Moto-Guzzi V50 with a {{longitudinally}} mounted 90° <b>V-twin</b> engine (500), {{not used}} anymore.|$|E
25|$|The company's {{motorcycles}} {{are noted}} for their air-cooled 90° <b>V-twin</b> engines with a longitudinal crankshaft orientation where the engines' transverse cylinder heads project prominently {{on either side}} of the motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|The classic Harley-Davidson {{engines are}} <b>V-twin</b> engines, with a 45° angle between the cylinders. The {{crankshaft}} {{has a single}} pin, and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods.|$|E
5000|$|<b>V-twins</b> may {{be mounted}} either {{longitudinally}} with the cylinders protruding either side (e.g. Honda CX500 and Moto Guzzi [...] ), or transversely, (e.g. Harley-Davidson, Ducati, Hesketh, Vincent, Moto Morini and Aprilia). Transverse <b>V-twins</b> can raise difficulties in cooling the aft cylinder, and in siting the airbox, battery, aft carburetor, and aft exhaust pipe.|$|R
50|$|Mazda made 356 cc and 571 cc <b>V-twins</b> {{beginning}} in 1960 for the Mazda R360.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, the {{parallel}} twin reverse cylinder version, 3MA arrived, then in 1991-1996 the <b>V-twins</b> 3XV.|$|R
25|$|The Scout and Chief V-twins, {{introduced}} in the early 1920s, became the Springfield firm's most successful models. Designed by Charles Franklin, the middleweight Scout and larger Chief shared a 42-degree <b>V-twin</b> engine layout. Both models gained a reputation for strength and reliability.|$|E
25|$|Ducati has {{produced}} several styles of motorcycle engines, including varying {{the number of}} cylinders, type of valve actuation and fuel delivery. Ducati {{is best known for}} its <b>V-twin</b> engine, called a L-twin by the company, which is the powerplant in the majority of Ducati-marqued motorcycles.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014 Indian re{{introduced}} the Scout {{and attempt}} to engage new markets with a low-end price. The Scout came with a 100-horsepower liquid cooled <b>V-Twin.</b> In 2016 Indian introduced the new lower priced Scout Sixty, which is similar in style but came with slightly less power.|$|E
50|$|From 1900, {{the company}} {{produced}} motorcycle engines in various capacities up to 8h.p. <b>V-twins.</b> From 1903 until 1914 they also produced complete motorcycles.|$|R
25|$|Ducati's liquid-cooled, {{multi-valve}} <b>V-twins,</b> {{made from}} 1985 on, {{are known as}} Desmoquattro ("desmodromic valve four"). These include the 851, 916 and 996, 999 and a few predecessors and derivatives.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{drivetrain}} configurations, using wide-angle longitudinally mounted <b>V-twins</b> with shaft drive, {{were later}} {{used on the}} 1953-1956 Victoria Bergmeister motorcycle, the Honda CX series, and, most notably, on medium- and large-sized Moto Guzzi motorcycles.|$|R
25|$|In June 1994, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Wayne Baughman, {{president}} of Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Incorporated, presented, started, and rode a prototype Indian Century <b>V-Twin</b> Chief. Baughman had made previous statements about building new motorcycles under the Indian brand {{but this was}} his first appearance with a working motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{machine gun}} units each {{comprised}} 3 Scott 552cc machines, {{one with the}} gun (the Vickers when deployed late in 1914), one carrying ammunition, and one as a spare. Enfield were also commissioned to produce {{their own version of}} this mobile machine gun platform powered by the 770cc JAP <b>V-twin</b> engine.|$|E
25|$|Giulio Cesare Carcano: {{engineer}} with Guzzi from 1936 to 1966, {{inventor of the}} DOHC V8 engine and the air-cooled <b>V-twin</b> that became synonymous with Moto Guzzi. He died in September 2005 after a second career as a Naval Architect, but remained in service to Moto Guzzi into his retirement.|$|E
5000|$|Matchless was {{not given}} a {{contract}} to make motorcycles for the army during the First World War. Peacetime production resumed in 1919, concentrating at first on <b>V-twins</b> for sidecar use, leaving singles until 1923.|$|R
50|$|It {{could have}} been a {{superbike}} before its time, but tire technology was not ready. There were other bikes developed as a result: the 1970 500 cc GP bikes and 750 cc production 90-degree <b>V-twins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|BMW has {{produced}} shaft drive motorcycles since 1923; and Moto Guzzi have built shaft-drive <b>V-twins</b> since the 1960s. The British company, Triumph {{and the major}} Japanese brands, Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Yamaha, have produced shaft drive motorcycles.|$|R
25|$|One of {{only two}} American cycle {{manufacturers}} to survive the Great Depression, Harley-Davidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the US Army in World War II and resumed civilian production afterwards, producing a range of large <b>V-twin</b> motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers.|$|E
25|$|Moto Guzzi {{was limited}} in its endeavors to {{penetrate}} the important scooter market as motorcycle popularity waned after WWII. Italian scooter competitors would not tolerate an incursion from Moto Guzzi. By innovating the first large-wheeled scooter, Guzzi competed less directly with manufacturers of small-wheeled scooters such as Piaggio (Vespa) and Lambretta. To illustrate the delicate balance within the Italian post-war motorcycle and scooter markets, when Guzzi developed their own prototype for a small-wheeled scooter, Lambretta retaliated with a prototype for a small <b>V-twin</b> motorcycle threatening to directly compete on Moto Guzzi's turf. The two companies compromised: Guzzi never produced their small-wheeled scooter and Lambretta never manufactured the motorcycle. The drive train that Lambretta made in their 1953 motorcycle prototype remarkably resembles the <b>V-twin</b> + drive shaft arrangement that Guzzi developed {{more than ten years}} later, ultimately to become iconic of the company.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as the}} Daimler car range, BSA Cycles Ltd re-entered the car market {{under the}} BSA name in 1921 with a <b>V-twin</b> engined light car {{followed}} by four-cylinder models up to 1926, when the name was temporarily dropped. In 1929 a new range of 3- and 4-wheel cars appeared and production of these continued until 1936.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 five 500 cc <b>V-twins</b> {{were built}} {{to compete in}} Italian {{championship}} and Grand Prix events. Ducati felt that this would demonstrate the bike before a large audience and gain publicity. If they won, that was a bonus.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the new engine is a special 'Pent-roof {{combustion}} chamber', designed {{to increase the efficiency}} of gas flow. The engine also has counter-rotating balancers on both ends of the crankshaft to reduce the vibration typical of large <b>V-Twins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Examples of odd-firing {{engines are}} Harley-Davidson Evolution engines and most 4-stroke <b>V-Twins,</b> 2009-2014 Yamaha YZF-R1, Audi V10 FSI {{as used in}} the Audi R8 V10 and 2nd / 3rd {{generation}} Lamborghini Gallardo, Viper V10, Yamaha V-Max and VMAX, Buick 231 Odd-Fire V6.|$|R
25|$|In 1997, Knievel {{signed with}} the California Motorcycle Company to release a limited Evel Knievel Motorcycle. The {{motorcycle}} was not built to jump, but was rather a <b>V-twin</b> cruiser motorcycle intended to compete with Harley-Davidson street bikes. Knievel promoted the motorcycle at his various public appearances. After the company closed in 2003, Knievel returned to riding modern street Harley-Davidson motorcycles at his public appearances.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as the}} Daimler car range, BSA Cycles Ltd re-entered the car market {{under the}} BSA name in 1921, with a <b>V-twin</b> engined ten h.p. light car, {{followed}} by four-cylinder eleven h.p. and fourteen h.p. and six-cylinder twelve h.p. and sixteen h.p. models up to 1926, when the name was temporarily dropped. In 1929, a new range of 3- and 4-wheel cars appeared and production of these continued until 1936.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, the Japanese company Tokyu Kurogane Kogyo built {{approximately}} 4,700 four-wheel-drive roadsters, {{called the}} Type 95 {{used by the}} Imperial Japanese Army from 1937 until 1944, used during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Three different bodystyles were manufactured; a 2-door roadster, a 2-door pickup truck and a 4-door phaeton, all equipped with a transfer case that engaged the front wheels, powered by a 1.3 litre, 2-cylinder, air-cooled OHV <b>V-twin</b> engine.|$|E
50|$|Subaru’s <b>V-Twins</b> feature {{overhead}} valve (OHV) technology. OHV engines {{are known to}} be durable and compact in size. The OHV engine design is fairly simple and consists of a camshaft installed inside the engine block and valves are operated through lifters, pushrods and rocker arms.|$|R
2500|$|The {{progress}} of jet engine development overtook {{that of the}} Crecy and replaced the need for this engine. [...] As a result, work on the project ceased in December 1945 at which point only six complete examples had been built, however an additional eight <b>V-twins</b> were built during the project. Crecy s/n 10 achieved [...] on 21 December 1944 which after adjustment {{for the inclusion of}} an exhaust turbine would have equated to [...] Subsequent single-cylinder tests carried out on the Ricardo E65 engine achieved the equivalent of [...] for the complete engine. By June 1945 a total of 1,060 hours had been run on the V12 engines with a further 8,600 hours of testing on the <b>V-twins.</b> The fate of the six Crecy engines remains unknown.|$|R
50|$|Examples of even-firing {{engines are}} Honda NSR500V and most 2-stroke <b>V-Twins,</b> most current {{production}} inline 4s (with {{the exception of}} the Yamaha R1), most current production V6s, Lotus Esprit V8, Porsche 918 Spyder, McLaren M838T engine, Audi V10, 1st generation Lamborghini Gallardo and Toyota LR engine.|$|R
25|$|Cruisers are styled after American {{machines}} {{from the}} 1930s {{to the early}} 1960s, such as those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, and Excelsior-Henderson. Harley-Davidsons largely define the cruiser category, and large-displacement <b>V-twin</b> engines are the norm, although other engine configurations and small to medium displacements also exist. Their engines are tuned for low-end torque, making them less demanding to ride {{because it is not}} necessary to shift as frequently to accelerate or maintain control.|$|E
25|$|Rover {{supplied}} 499cc {{single cylinder}} motorcycles to the Russian Army during the First World War. The company {{began to focus}} on car production {{at the end of the}} war, but Rover still produced motorcycles with 248cc and 348cc Rover overhead valve engines and with JAP engines, including a 676cc <b>V-twin.</b> In 1924 Rover introduced a new lightweight 250cc motorcycle with unit construction of engine and gearbox. This had lights front and rear as well as a new design of internal expanding brakes.|$|E
25|$|Touring {{models are}} {{distinguishable}} by their large saddlebags, rear coil-over air suspension {{and are the}} only models to offer full fairings with radios and CBs. All touring models use the same frame, first introduced with a Shovelhead motor in 1980, and carried forward with only modest upgrades until 2009, when it was extensively redesigned. The frame is distinguished by {{the location of the}} steering head in front of the forks and was the first H-D frame to rubber mount the drivetrain to isolate the rider from the vibration of the big <b>V-twin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 6/1 was {{designed}} primarily {{for use as}} a sidecar hauler, mainly as a smaller, more economical alternative to the one litre <b>V-Twins</b> and fours usually used to pull sidecars at the time. As such, strength and durability were given priority, resulting in a large motorcycle weighing 412 lb.|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>V-twins,</b> straight-twin engines {{do not use}} {{a common}} crank pin for both {{connecting}} rods, each cylinder has its own crank pin. Most vintage British straight-twin motorcycle engines, such as Triumph, BSA, Norton and Royal Enfield, had two main bearings, the exception being AJS/Matchless, which used a third, center main bearing.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Harley-Davidson bought the ailing Aermacchi factory near Milan, {{with the aim}} of selling a range of bikes from 125cc {{machines}} to complement the traditional big <b>V-twins</b> built in the USA. First, they marketed Aermacchi's horizontal single cylinder four-strokes, and then began to develop their own two-strokes.|$|R
