40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we address a supply vessel {{planning}} problem arising in servicing oil and gas offshore installations. Supply vessels provide offshore installations with necessary supplies on periodic basis from offshore supply bases according to weekly sailing schedules. The execution of weekly schedules during the year is affected by weather conditions influencing on sailing time and service duration at installations. When the contracted vessel cannot complete a voyage before the start of its next planned voyage, a vessel from the spot market is hired to perform it. Deciding on the number of supply vessels hired to perform operations from a supply base for a year ahead has a strong economic effect on the total annual <b>vessel</b> <b>costs.</b> We present a discrete-event simulation model for evaluation of alternative fleet size configurations taking into consideration uncertainty in weather conditions and future spot vessel rates.

30|$|A more {{realistic}} {{variation of the}} base case assumes that an escort vessel is employed for the 30 [*]days. The cost of the escort vessel is shared between 3 platforms at a daily cost of $ 25, 000 for a total cost of $ 0.25 million per platform. We assume that 10 % of the time, the escort vessel is able to stop a floating ice threat from moving from one threat level to the next higher level. When the escort vessel is present, the middle circle is breached only 4 %*(0.9) 2 [*]=[*] 3.24 %[*]=[*]of the time, and the inner circle is breached just (0.9) 3 x 1 %[*]=[*] 0.729 % of the time. So the expected loss due to ice decreases to $ 5.6 million. As the escort <b>vessel</b> <b>costs</b> $ 250, 000, the total expected loss with escort vessel is $ 5.85 million. This represents a savings of $ 1.55 million relative to the original base case, suggesting that with the crude assumptions employed here, an escort vessel is well worth the money {{even in the absence}} of EP.|$|E

The crinoid bed is located in an enclave of gravelly sand surrounded by muddy sediments, the latter constituting the typical habitat of Norway lobster. An overall description of the geological and oceanographic features off the Portuguese southern coast is presented, highlighting the complexity of factors influencing the research zone. A delimitation of the crinoid bed and a comparison of taxa richness for the epibenthic megafauna of the adjacent towed zone are carried out.

40|$|Firestone, JeremyThe recent {{emphasis}} on development of {{offshore wind energy}} projects has powered the movement to evaluate distribution of current ocean activities. As wind energy development becomes more prevalent, existing users of the oceans, such as commercial shippers, will be compelled to share their historically open-access waters with these projects. Here, we demonstrate the utility of using cost-benefit analysis (CBA) framework to reduce potential spatial conflicts and assess tradeoffs between offshore wind development and commercial shipping. Specifically, we evaluate whether rerouting commercial vessel traffic farther from shore to open areas for wind development would produce net societal benefits. We focus on less than 1, 500 transits by deep-draft vessels between the ports in the US Mid-Atlantic. We propose to reroute these ships {{by an average of}} 18. 5 km (10 nautical miles) per trip. We estimate that over 29 years of the study, the added private and external <b>vessel</b> <b>costs</b> amount to approximately $ 0. 2 billion (in 2012 $).

40|$|Deciding {{when and}} how to {{maintain}} offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future <b>vessel</b> <b>costs</b> and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{management}} options in a coastal lagoon with intensive shellfish (Tapes philippinarum) farming and macroalgal (Ulva sp.) blooms, a biogeochemical model has been developed. The model considers the nutrient cycles and oxygen {{in the water column}} {{as well as in the}} sediments, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and Ulva sp. dynamics. Furthermore, a discrete stage-based model for the growth of Tapes philippinarum has been coupled with this continuous biogeochemical model. By studying the growth of lams, it considers the nutrient contents in the water column as well as its temperature, including the effects of harvesting and the mortality due to anoxic crisis. The results from 1989 to 1999 show that the model is able to capture the essential dynamics of the lagoon, with values in the same order of magnitude as the measurements from experimental campaigns and with data on clam productivity. The model has therefore been used to assess the effects of Ulva’s mechanical removal on the lagoon’s eutrophication level using the exergy and specific exergy, as well as economic factors in terms of operating <b>vessel</b> <b>costs</b> and averaged prices for clams as optimization parameters. The results show that a combination of ecosystem models and health indicators constitute a sound method for optimizing the management in such complex systems. JRC.

40|$|Rationalization” or {{the change}} to catch share {{management}} in fisheries {{has been shown to}} lead to the slowing of fishing activity, input and effort consolidation, cost savings, as well as new market and product development. The effects of rationalization on fishermen’s behavior become more complex when one accounts for the spillover effects that catch share programs can create in other fisheries and other regions. The possession of secure harvesting privileges in one catch share fishery allows quota shareholders to expand operations in other fisheries since their share of the catch share fishery is protected (a “diversification” effect). However, there is an opportunity cost related to the slowing of the rate of fishing, given that more time spent fishing in the catch share fishery means there will be less time available for fishing elsewhere. Therefore, it is possible that more efficient vessels may expand their operations and specialize in the catch share fishery leaving the selling/lessor vessels to specialize in another fishery and/or region (a “specialization” effect). Which outcome is more likely is an empirical question, which we address by examining the recently implemented U. S. West Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program. Newly available cost and earnings data, product revenues and prices, and biological stock data allow us to calculate the average marginal effect of changes in West Coast species total allowable catches, prices, and <b>vessel</b> <b>costs</b> on the expected number of days spent fishing in Alaska to quantify the spillover effects of West Coast trawl rationalization on fisheries in Alaska...|$|E
40|$|The cost {{effectiveness}} of condition monitoring systems for {{offshore wind energy}} is uncertain and thus a research concern. Unlike onshore wind turbines, the O&M costs of offshore wind turbines are directly affected by the marine environment, mainly wind and wave conditions, and <b>vessel</b> <b>costs</b> are a main contributor to offshore O&M costs. The lack of offshore O&M data makes wind turbine component failure rates essential for component risk assessment and cost model design. However, the failure rate data, especially from the offshore turbines, are highly protected by the manufacturers and the offshore operators. The method developed in this paper deals with this lack of data by adjusting onshore failure rate data to offshore {{to account for the}} different operational conditions. Internal cooperation of a large onshore wind farm in the UK and a large Swedish offshore wind farm has been reached, and three-year-period operational data records are used for this research. Both the sites use Siemens - 2. 3 - 93 turbines, which enable the comparison with minimum deviation caused by the types of the turbines between onshore and offshore. Failure Modes Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), which follows the U. S. Military Standard 1629 a, has been applied in many industrial areas including onshore wind energy successfully but as yet there are no examples in an offshore wind context. In most cases, the components were ranked using the Risk Priority Number, and in one instance, a cost priority number. A statistical cost model with specific concern for offshore vessel cost and marine access thresholds is presented in this paper and compared with other cost models in the research domain. A sensitivity analysis is applied to the selected offshore wind farm through the cost model in terms of changing the failure detectability of the condition monitoring system, and compares the effectiveness of maintenance with and without condition monitoring...|$|E
40|$|The EU generally, and the UK, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany specifically, have ambitious {{plans for}} the large scale {{installation}} of offshore wind-power capacity. However, the cost of energy from offshore wind {{is much higher than}} that from land-based generation and a substantial portion of that cost, anything between 15 % and 30 %, {{may be due to the}} cost of O&M alone, largely driven by delays in access and repair caused by adverse weather and sea-state, high <b>vessel</b> <b>costs,</b> higher wage costs, and lost revenue from extended down-time. As part of a condition monitoring project commissioned and funded by the ETI (Energy Technologies Institute), the authors have developed a simple tool to estimate the cost of O&M and associated lost revenue, and also to estimate the potential for condition monitoring to allow operators to reduce those costs and the loss in revenue through better maintenance scheduling. The tool builds on earlier work conducted at Strathclyde and presented at EOW 2009 on estimating offshore access delays and turbine availability using a closed form probabilistic method based on an event tree, but without extensive time-domain or Monte Carlo simulation. It currently uses wind and wave data, reliability data and component cost data mainly available in the public domain. Repairs and replacements of subsystems have been classified into a small range of different repair severities, each having their specific requirements for vessels, plant, personnel and time. Expected delays can be calculated directly for each type of repair and the overall effects are summed. Condition monitoring and other maintenance strategies are assumed to change the allocation of a particular subsystem's faults between repair categories and thereby affect its overall impact on down-time and other costs. Calculations are carried out in a spreadsheet that updates instantly when any parameter is changed. The advantage of the approach developed is that it is possible to explore the impact of changing access thresholds, reliabilities or site parameters quickly and easily without having to run a long series of simulations for each new situation...|$|E
