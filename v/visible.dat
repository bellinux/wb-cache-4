5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are <b>visible</b> {{to the naked}} eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped {{over the edge of the}} table is clearly <b>visible</b> in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still <b>visible</b> on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be <b>visible.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>visible</b> {{surface of}} the Sun, the {{photosphere}}, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to <b>visible</b> light. Above the photosphere <b>visible</b> sunlight is free to propagate into space, {{and almost all of}} its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb <b>visible</b> light easily. Conversely, the <b>visible</b> light we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2006 census, the country's largest {{self-reported}} {{ethnic origin}} is Canadian (accounting for 32% of the population), followed by English (21%), French (15.8%), Scottish (15.1%), Irish (13.9%), German (10.2%), Italian (4.6%), Chinese (4.3%), First Nations (4.0%), Ukrainian (3.9%), and Dutch (3.3%). There are 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands, encompassing {{a total of}} 1,172,790 people. Canada's indigenous population is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's population claimed an indigenous identity in 2006. Another 16.2 {{percent of the population}} belonged to a non-indigenous <b>visible</b> minority. In 2006, the largest <b>visible</b> minority groups were South Asian (4.0%), Chinese (3.9%) and Black (2.5%). Between 2001 and 2006, the <b>visible</b> minority population rose by 27.2 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of <b>visible</b> minority groups. By 2007, almost one in five (19.8%) were foreign-born, with nearly 60 percent of new immigrants coming from Asia (including the Middle East). The leading sources of immigrants to Canada were China, the Philippines and India. According to Statistics Canada, <b>visible</b> minority groups could account for a third of the Canadian population by 2031.|$|E
5|$|As {{it passed}} {{perihelion}} on April 1, 1997 the comet {{developed into a}} spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius, and its dust tail stretched 40–45 degrees across the sky. The comet was <b>visible</b> well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great comets {{are very close to}} the Sun as they pass perihelion, comet Hale–Bopp was <b>visible</b> all night to northern hemisphere observers.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, {{there were}} 4,205 members of <b>visible</b> {{minorities}} in the city. The largest <b>visible</b> minority group were South Asians (1.2%), followed by Chinese Canadian (1.0%), and Blacks (0.9%). There were 4,305 Aboriginals in St. John's, comprising 4.1% of the city's population. First Nations people made up 2.9% of the city's population, Inuit comprised 0.8% of St. John's population, and 0.6% were Métis.|$|E
5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of {{pubic hair}} beyond the bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair <b>visible</b> beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. <b>Visible</b> pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become <b>visible</b> when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be <b>visible</b> {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be <b>visible</b> to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more <b>visible</b> than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are <b>visible</b> when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth <b>visible</b> when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{original}} working titles of the film were first The Beatles and then Beatlemania, the group's name is never spoken in the movie—it is, however, <b>visible</b> on Ringo's drum kit, on the stage lighting, and on the helicopter in the final scene. The television performance scene also contains a visual pun on the group's name, with photos of beetles <b>visible</b> on the wall behind the dancers.|$|E
5|$|Halley's Comet or Comet Halley, officially {{designated}} 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet <b>visible</b> from Earth every 74–79 years. Halley is {{the only}} known short-period comet that is regularly <b>visible</b> {{to the naked eye}} from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.|$|E

5|$|In the 2006 census, {{over five}} million Canadians {{identified}} themselves {{as a member of}} a <b>visible</b> minority. Together, they make up 16.2% of the total population: most numerous among these are South Asian (4.0%), Black (2.5%), and Filipino (1.1%). Indigenous peoples are not considered a <b>visible</b> minority under the Employment Equity Act, and this is the definition that Statistics Canada also uses.|$|E
5|$|In the {{iconography}} of Kashmir, during the 8th and 9th centuries, the gods of Hindu Trimurti - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - each are depicted with three heads. In a sculpture displayed in the Metropolitan Art Museum of New York, the four-headed Brahma as well as Shiva are shown with three <b>visible</b> heads. Vishnu is depicted as Vaikuntha Chaturmurti in this configuration, with three <b>visible</b> heads.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} 2006 census, about 41% of Coquitlam {{residents}} were foreign-born, {{much higher than}} the 27% foreign-born for the whole of British Columbia. 61% of respondents claimed to not be a <b>visible</b> minority, while the largest <b>visible</b> minorities included Chinese (17.2%), Korean (5.3%), South Asian and West Asian (both 3.7%), and Filipino (2.7%). 58% of respondents list English as their mother tongue, while 96% state having knowledge of English.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to give rise to phenomena <b>visible</b> from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give rise to electrostatic discharges <b>visible</b> from Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon <b>visible</b> from Earth.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} that the {{silicate}} particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for <b>visible</b> light. However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under <b>visible</b> light.|$|E
5|$|Malta's fortifications are {{featured}} {{a number of}} times on the islands' heraldry. The coat of arms of Malta contains a mural crown in gold with a sally port and eight turrets (five of which are <b>visible),</b> which represents the fortifications as well as Malta's status as a city-state. The coats of arms of the five regions of Malta have a similar crown but with five turrets, all of which are <b>visible.</b> A mural crown with four <b>visible</b> turrets can be seen on the coats of arms of Valletta, Mdina and Birgu, indicating their status as capital city or former capitals. Another version with four turrets (three <b>visible)</b> can be seen on the coats of arms of Cospicua, Senglea, Qormi, Siġġiewi, Żabbar, Żebbuġ, Żejtun and Victoria, indicating the status of a city.|$|E
5|$|Mount Pilchuck, and Mount Rainier are <b>visible</b> on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an extension}} of the heterodyne technique to higher (<b>visible)</b> frequencies.|$|E
5|$|Panavision 3D was {{a system}} for {{presenting}} 3-D film in a digital cinema. It was a passive stereoscopic 3D system that utilized spectral comb filters produced using thin-film optics technology. In such systems, the <b>visible</b> spectrum is broken into alternate bands of light that evenly span the entire <b>visible</b> spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{family members}} painted {{signatures}} and graffiti {{in the attic}} around 1856, which remain <b>visible</b> on the stairwell wall.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are <b>visible</b> regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of <b>visible</b> patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E
5|$|Porosity, {{often not}} <b>visible</b> {{without the use}} of {{advanced}} nondestructive testing methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily <b>visible.</b> It is caused by low current, contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an improper electrode.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{methods for}} observing the {{absorption}} of electromagnetic radiation in the <b>visible</b> spectrum were known {{as early as the}} 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{resemble}} spiraling pinwheels. Though {{the stars}} and other <b>visible</b> material contained in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane, the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter that extends beyond the <b>visible</b> component, {{as demonstrated by the}} universal rotation curve concept.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen of all mantises {{consists}} of 10 tergites, with a corresponding set of nine sternites <b>visible</b> in males and seven <b>visible</b> in females. The abdomen {{tends to be}} slimmer in males than females, but ends {{in a pair of}} cerci in both sexes.|$|E
5|$|The comet {{was bright}} enough to be <b>visible</b> next to the Sun in the daytime sky at its perihelion.|$|E
5|$|The {{events were}} {{quite close to}} the sun {{and would not have}} been <b>visible</b> to the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|The site is privately owned, {{although}} <b>visible</b> from a {{road that}} cuts {{through the middle of}} the barrow.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from galactic motion. Galaxies rotate {{much faster than}} the amount of <b>visible</b> matter suggests they should; the gravity from the ordinary matter {{is not enough to}} hold the galaxy together. Scientists theorize that the galaxy is held together by huge quantities of dark matter. Similarly, clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough <b>visible</b> matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{previously}} {{dominated the}} valley's farmed and grazed land, {{due to its}} height and full foliage, and was <b>visible</b> from a long distance, as is shown in old photographs. However, much of the surrounding land has now {{been taken over by}} forest, and Pi de les Tres Branques now has many other trees in its vicinity, which, together with its current skeletal form, make it much less <b>visible</b> than before.|$|E
5|$|The underdrawing is <b>visible</b> through modern {{technical}} analysis, {{revealing the}} main group of figures and contour {{lines in the}} folds and drape of the clothing. The angels' wings to Mary's left are <b>visible,</b> but not those to the right, probably because of later overpainting. In the underdrawing Mary's gown extends {{far to the left}} of the angel, but Christus apparently changed his mind about its execution.|$|E
5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused {{hydrothermal}} alteration of country rock. These fumaroles form <b>visible</b> clouds of steam. This heat may have been replenished from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic activity is distinct enough to be <b>visible</b> from ASTER satellite image but barely <b>visible</b> from the ground. The temperature of the hotspot has been relatively constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of lava flows overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial activity, is controversial; the summit lava flows have been glaciated.|$|E
5|$|There are 2,990 Aboriginal {{people living}} in Moncton, who make up 4.3% of the city's population. There are 3,305 <b>visible</b> {{minorities}} in Moncton. Blacks and South Asians are the largest <b>visible</b> minority groups, comprising 1.7% and 0.7% of the city's population, respectively. There is also a growing Korean community in Moncton.|$|E
