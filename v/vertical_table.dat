50|$|Bales may {{be picked}} up {{from the field and}} stacked using a {{self-powered}} machine called a bale stacker, bale wagon or harobed. There are several designs and sizes. One type picks up square bales are dropped by the baler with the strings facing upward. The stacker will drive up to each bale, pick it up and set it on a three-bale-wide table (the strings are now facing upwards). Once three bales are on the table, the table lifts up and back, causing the three bales to face strings to the side again; this happens three more times until there are 16 bales on the main table. This table will lift like the smaller one, and the bales will be up against a <b>vertical</b> <b>table.</b> The machine will hold 160 bales (ten tiers); usually there will be cross-tiers near the center to keep the stack from swaying or collapsing if any weight is applied {{to the top of the}} stack. The full load will be transported to a barn; the whole rear of the stacker will tilt upwards until it is vertical. There will be two pushers that will extend through the machine and hold the bottom of the stack from being pulled out from the stacker while it is driven out of the barn.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Multidimensional {{data are}} used in popular to support OLAP(On-Line Analytical Processing) {{operations}} efficiently. Many OLAP tools {{have been developed to}} manipulate the multidimensional data to provide users with useful information for decision making. While they are equipped with useful features, they seem be sometimes complicated to relational database users. In this paper, we developed an easy and effective interface manipulating multidimensional data on the top of relational DBMSs. The proposed interface provides a mechanism handling data in relational tables like spreadsheet (e. g., Microsoft Excel) does. Spreadsheet is the most popular tool for end users to analysis their data conveniently. The interface provides the features browsing relational tables virtually with sheet by sheet and creating pivot tables. Pivot tables are a useful presentation form of multidimensional data, which have attribute values (not attribute names) as their columns thus have horizontal format. We store pivot tables of horizontal format as <b>vertical</b> <b>tables</b> in relational DBMSs and we provide the transformation of queries on horizontal table into ones on <b>vertical</b> <b>tables.</b> With this user-friendly interface, users will be able to perform analysis activities on data in relational DBMSs easily and effectively...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, ontologies {{are more}} and more used in several {{research}} and application domains, in particular e-commerce, e-business and the Semantic Web. Several tools for managing ontology data and ontology-based data (also called individuals or ontology class instances) are available. Usually, ontology-based data manipulated by these tools are stored in the main memory. Thus, for applications that manipulate a large amount of ontology-based data, it is difficult to ensure an acceptable performance. So, there is a real need for storing ontology-based data in database schemas to get benefit of the capabilities offered by DBMSs (query performance, data storage, transaction management, etc.). We call this kind of databases Ontology-Based Databases (OBDBs). Over the last five years, two main OBDB structures for storing ontology and ontology-based data were proposed [1]. In the single table approach, the description of classes, properties and their instances are described by means of triples (subject, predicate, object) stored in a single table, called the <b>vertical</b> <b>table.</b> In the dual scheme approach, ontologies are described by specific schemas, dependin...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMobile-captured {{images are}} usually {{severely}} degraded {{due to the}} presence of geometrical distortion, non-uniform lighting and noise, such that table detection becomes more challenging compared to that in scanned images. To improve the performance of junction detection in junction based table detection algorithms, we propose a two-step table junction detection method for mobile-captured golf scorecard images based on observations. The first step is table boundary detection, which aims to detect and extract the table boundaries, or table ruling-lines. We efficiently detect the boundaries based on observations that the table boundaries constitute the only single maximum connected component in the luminance image. The second step is junction detection, which tries to capture table junctions at the intersections of horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>table</b> boundaries. A novel pattern matching technique is employed to capture the junctions on the line-enhanced skeleton of table ruling-lines. To further reduce computational power, down-sampling is performed on the high resolution scorecard images before table boundary detection, and the table region is cropped out for junction detection. As there is no available application specific image set, we build one which contains an amount of mobile-captured golf scorecard images with diversity in scorecard forms and mobile brands. Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully locate tables and detect junctions on the mobile-captured golf scorecard image set...|$|E

From 358 papers submitted in the conference, 106 papers {{were selected for}} presentation. Among them, eleven qualified papers have been selected as the papers for this special issue, which deal with state-of-the-art software technology. Explosive growth {{of information on the}} Internet has made data search algorithm a critical issue nowadays. Thus, five papers focus on data search algorithm: “Energy Valid Scope for Location-Dependent Spatial Queries in Mobile Environments,” by Ken C. K. Lee, Wang-Chien Lee, Hong Va Leong, Brandon Unger, and Baihua Zheng, designed an algorithm to compute the valid scope where clients receive the same query result, thus eliminating the waste of sending many LDSQs to the server by nearby clients. “ Small Knowledge Canvas: Software for Managing Fragmental Knowledge,” by Akiko Hino and Katsumi Tanaka, introduces the concept of “Small knowledge canvas” to utilize the fragmental knowledge, and thus they design a Web browsing model and context extraction algorithm to enrich the bookmark for personal context. “Improving Search and Information Credibility Analysis from Interaction between Web 1. 0 and Web 2. 0 Contents,” by Katsumi Tanaka, Satoshi Nakamura, Hiroaki Ohshima, Yusuke Yamamoto, Yusuke Yanbe, and Makoto Kato, proposes a new idea for improving the Web search performance and increasing the information credibility of search results by the usage of Web 1. 0 and Web 2. 0 contents in a complementary manner. “ Pivoted Table Index for Querying Product-Property-Value Information, ” by Hyunja Lee and Junho Shim, proposes two storage-schemas: a vertical schema as a primary table structure for the triple information in RDBMS and a pivoted table index created from the basic <b>vertical</b> <b>table</b> as an additional index structure for accelerating query triple (product–attribute–value) information. “ Metadata Management for Integration and Analysis of Earth Observation Data, ” by Akira Takahashi, Masashi Tatedoko, Toshiyuki Shimizu, Hiroko Kinutani, and Masatoshi Yoshikawa, proposes a conceptual model of earth observation data store and manage earth observation. The model is a simple quintuple with information extracted from conventional data models, and it is used to uniquely determine portions of earth observation data, and thus easy to add annotations to data. Three data analysis and mining related papers are presented: “PicAChoo: A Text Analysis Tool for Customizable Feature Selection with Dynamic Composition of Primitive Methods,” by Jaeseok Myung, Jung-Yeon Yang, and Sang-goo Lee, presents a framework named ‘PicAChoo’, which stands for ‘Pick And Choose’ that enables customizable feature selection environments by composing several primitive feature selection methods without hard-coding. “An Interpretation of Biological Metabolites and their Reactions Based on Relation Degree of Compound Pairs in KEGG XML Files,” by Myungha Jang, Jiyoung Whang, Coleen S. Lewis, and Hyun S. Park, provides the statistical analysis of metabolic reactions, based on the parsing result of publicly available XML files. “High-speed Detection of Ontological Knowledge and Bi-directional Lexico-Syntactic Patterns from the Web,” by Hiroaki Ohshima and Katsumi Tanaka, proposes a high-speed method of detecting ontological knowledge from the Web and a method of automatically discovering superior bi-directional lexico-syntactic patterns using Web search engines. The special issue also includes security issue and papers related to intelligent systems and applications are presented: “A High-Performance Inter-Domain Data Transferring System for Virtual Machines,” by Dingding Li, Hai Jin, Yingzhe Shao, Xiaofei Liao, Zongfen Han, and Kai Chen, proposes a system called IDTS (Inter-Domain Transferring System) which uses the shared memory between different domains (also called hosted or guest OSes) to expand the communication bandwidth and shorten the latency for network applications running in the co-resident VMs. “DCT-based Reversible Data Hiding Scheme,” by Chia-Chen Lin and Pei-Feng Shiu, proposes a method called a layer- 1 data embedding strategy to enhance the hiding capacity of Chang et al. ’s reversible DCT-based data hiding scheme. Their proposed layer- 1 strategy considers some areas not used by Chang et al. ’s scheme, which they call layer- 2 data embedding. “Merging Textual Knowledge Represented by Element Fuzzy Cognitive Maps,” by Xiangfeng Luo, Jun Zhang, Fangfang Liu,Yi Du, Zhian Yu and Weimin Xu, introduces a logic “and” operation to roughly evaluate the similarities between the mass E-FCMs in order to form the similar sets of textual knowledge and propose an E-FCMs-based knowledge merging algorithm to inspect the noisy and the redundancy information hidden in the original E-FCMs. We wish to thank Sungkyunkwan University, Korea for providing the venue to host the conference.

A series of column experiments were setup: first a study on in-well mixing was completed to understand the suitability of down-hole logging in existing piezometers versus multi level sampling; then, an unsaturated–saturated column experiment with sandy aeolian dune sediments of the target aquifer was performed to characterize the mixing zone thickness; finally the third column experiment was conducted by imposing a groundwater fluctuation of 0. 1 m to quantify the increase of the freshwater–saltwater mixing zone due to <b>vertical</b> water <b>table</b> oscillations. The freshwater–saltwater mixing zone increase was very limited and did not exceed 0. 1 m. All experiments were modeled by means of the SEAWAT numerical code, and calibrated against saltwater concentrations.
