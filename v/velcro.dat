5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that he will use memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with a monkey puppet called Falzouille, in which the puppet never speaks. He talks about how the puppet is not alive as it has <b>Velcro</b> pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with <b>Velcro</b> on their paws. He tells a story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the telephone numbers of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making the shadows, and he gets annoyed at three stagehands called David.|$|E
5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and {{can be seen as a}} form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or <b>velcro</b> to reduce noise.|$|E
5|$|Geneva and {{the nearby}} French {{department}} of Ain co-host the world's largest laboratory, CERN, dedicated to particle physics research. Another important research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute. Notable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), diazepam (Valium), the scanning tunnelling microscope (Nobel prize) and <b>Velcro.</b> Some technologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the pressurised balloon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques Piccard to reach the deepest point of the world's oceans.|$|E
5|$|Unlike early models, {{the current}} {{structures}} {{are made up}} of six sections attached together by zippers and <b>Velcro</b> to allow quick replacement if damaged by a plane. Prior to May 2008, the races had used more than eight tons of fabric for the various pylons, and the average life of each pylon was 15 races. Thirty-five pylons are transported to each race, and at each race's completion, the pylons are sent to Innsbruck, Austria to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding <b>Velcro,</b> with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake <b>Velcro</b> suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E
25|$|Boxing gloves {{usually come}} with either lace-ups or <b>velcro.</b> In <b>velcro</b> gloves, the <b>velcro</b> {{acts as a}} second handwrap that adds more {{stability}} to the wrist. Lace-up gloves provide a more snug and secure fit, but unlike <b>velcro</b> gloves, require assistance from another person to lace, and are usually wrapped with tape before the match. Lace-up gloves {{can be converted to}} <b>velcro</b> gloves using a hook and loop converter.|$|E
25|$|The ACU {{trousers}} (or ACU pants) {{are worn}} with a two-inch nylon web belt, and feature <b>Velcro</b> pouches for knee pad inserts, two forward-tilted thigh storage pockets with elastic drawstring and <b>Velcro</b> for closure during movement, and two calf storage pockets {{one on each}} pant leg with a <b>Velcro</b> closure. Army Combat trousers with flame resistant materials are being issued for use in Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Velcro</b> {{hook-and-loop}} fasteners, another system {{sometimes used}} to secure footwear.|$|E
25|$|The jacket's Mandarin collar was {{intended}} to be worn up in combat to fit with the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) body armor, and worn in the down position otherwise. With the change of pattern to OCP, the <b>Velcro</b> tab that closed the Mandarin collar was removed, along with other <b>Velcro</b> closures.|$|E
25|$|The belt loops are of new design, {{much wider}} (double width) {{and there is}} 8 of them now {{compared}} to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the <b>Velcro</b> waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has <b>Velcro</b> hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs {{at the bottom of}} the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the <b>Velcro</b> cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more <b>Velcro</b> with buttons.|$|E
25|$|The spiny {{fruit of}} burdock or cocklebur {{inspired}} {{the invention of}} <b>Velcro.</b>|$|E
25|$|The updates to the ACU {{trousers}} in late 2010 included {{removal of}} <b>Velcro</b> fasteners from forward-tilted thigh cargo pocket flaps which were replaced with 3 buttons. This change was introduced gradually from 2009 onward {{and is now}} in full effect. Two buttons are standard (same function as on BDU trouser cargo pockets), while the third button located {{at the very end of}} the pocket can be used to allow for more load and extra volume in cargo pockets. On the small calf pockets the 3-piece <b>Velcro</b> (2 square hook on pocket and one rectangular loop patch on the flap) have been replaced with a single button in 2012. Buttons were re-introduced and replaced <b>Velcro</b> on pockets after numerous complaints from soldiers in the field.|$|E
25|$|The Army Combat Uniform {{features}} hook-and-loop fasteners, {{also known}} by the genericized trademark <b>Velcro,</b> on its sleeve pockets.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers have {{expressed}} concern about the <b>Velcro</b> on the ACU. Dirt and mud can clog the hooks and loops or they can wear out with use, requiring the use of cleaning brushes for clearing the <b>Velcro</b> as part of daily maintenance. Zippers have also been a topic of concern. Soldiers also expressed concern because the zippers (as with any zipper) can bind up, and render the uniform uncomfortable to wear, especially with body armor.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, cloth diapers {{consisted}} of a folded square or rectangle of cloth, fastened with safety pins. Today, most cloth diapers are fastened with hook and loop tape (<b>velcro)</b> or snaps.|$|E
25|$|The Met {{approved}} {{the use of}} name badges in October 2003, with new recruits wearing the <b>Velcro</b> badges from September 2004. The badge consists of the wearer's rank, followed by their surname.|$|E
25|$|De Mestral {{gave the}} name <b>Velcro,</b> a {{portmanteau}} of the French words velour ("velvet") and crochet ("hook"), to his invention {{as well as}} his company, which continues to manufacture and market the fastening system.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, <b>Velcro</b> was {{phased out}} on the MultiCam version of the ACU in favor of buttons, which are silent, work well in dust, mud and snow, support heavier use and hold more securely.|$|E
25|$|Some {{suits are}} {{provided}} with a flap which can be closed over {{the outside of the}} zipper to protect it from being damaged by contact with the diver's equipment or the environment. these flaps may be held in place by <b>velcro</b> or a non-watertight outer zipper.|$|E
25|$|Near Infrared (NIR) Signature Management Technology is {{incorporated}} {{to minimize the}} infrared silhouette. Permanent IR IFF squares are sewn to each shoulder to help identify friendly personnel when night vision devices are used, and are protected by <b>Velcro</b> tabs in garrison or when not in use.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{project was}} shut down and its {{participants}} laid off, {{some of whom were}} suing for severance pay and unpaid wages. The project’s assets were frozen in 2015, and some former employees revealed that some parts of the car debuted in 2012 were glued with <b>Velcro</b> and superglue.|$|E
25|$|The front closure is zippered and {{reinforced}} with <b>Velcro,</b> {{designed for use}} with OTV. The tilted chest pockets, cuffs, and elbow pad insert pockets also utilize hook-and-loop closure. There is a three slot pen pocket on the left arm of the jacket, and blouse bellows for increased mobility.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Police {{approved}} {{the use of}} name badges in October 2003, and new recruits started wearing the <b>Velcro</b> badges in September 2004. The badges consist of the wearer's rank, followed by their surname. Senior officers wear these in No.1 Dress, due to the public nature of their role.|$|E
25|$|Like <b>velcro,</b> {{carbohydrate}} ligands on the circulating leukocytes bind to selectin molecules on {{the inner}} wall of the vessel, with marginal affinity. This causes the leukocytes {{to slow down and}} begin rolling along the inner surface of the vessel wall. During this rolling motion, transitory bonds are formed and broken between selectins and their ligands.|$|E
25|$|A fly is a {{covering}} over an opening join concealing the mechanism, {{such as a}} zipper, <b>velcro</b> or buttons, used to join the opening. In trousers, this is most commonly an opening covering the groin, which makes the pants easier to put on or take off. The opening also allows men to urinate without lowering their trousers.|$|E
25|$|A {{surfboard}} leash or leg rope is {{the cord}} that attaches a surfboard to the surfer. It prevents the surfboard from being {{swept away by}} waves and prevents a runaway surfboard from hitting other surfers and swimmers. Modern leashes comprise a urethane cord where one end has a band with a <b>velcro</b> strap attached to the surfer's trailing foot, and the opposite has a <b>velcro</b> strap attached to {{the tail end of}} the surfboard. The surfboard leash was invented in 1970 by Santa Cruz, California resident Pat O'Neill, son of wetsuit innovator Jack O'Neill, who fastened surgical tubing to the nose of his surfboard with a suction cup looped to the end of his wrist in order to leverage turns and cutbacks in the water. However, modifications in 1971 by O'Neill made the surf leash attached to the ankle and to a surfboard's tail, a practice still in use today.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} chip+antenna {{controls}} the range {{from which it}} can be read. Short range compact chips are twist tied to the shoe or <b>velcro</b> strapped the ankle. These need to be about 400mm from the mat and so give very good temporal resolution. Alternatively, a chip plus a very large (a 125mm square) antenna {{can be incorporated into}} the bib number worn on the athlete's chest at about 1.25m height.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{boxing gloves}} started showing up towards {{end of the}} 1990s. Over ten years of {{engineering}} and testing {{by some of the}} biggest boxing manufacturers and sport names have helped create safe, durable equipment. Modern boxing gloves include mesh palm, <b>velcro,</b> leather-based stitching, suspension cushioning and new padding for the boxer. The International Boxing Association (amateur) approves new designs of gloves according to rules around weight and the amount of leather, padding and support allowed.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 - 2009, {{the black}} {{engraved}} plastic name-tags {{was changed to}} the black epoxy coated name-tags with the Home Team badge on the left. The name-tags with a safety-pinned backing were a safety hazard when struggling with suspects, progressively, the backing name-tags were fitted with <b>Velcro</b> for ease of fitting, and safety. The previous black engraved plastic name-tags is still in use by the National Police Cadet Corps. All officers under the Home Team are issued with these epoxy name-tags.|$|E
25|$|The authors {{illustrate}} {{their arguments}} with anecdotes throughout the work. Kiyosaki discusses his military contributions during the Vietnam War. He talks about an unsuccessful business venture attempting to sell wallets {{made out of}} <b>Velcro.</b> Kiyosaki recounts his increased success and popularity after an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He discusses his surprise {{when he found out}} one of his businesses was deriving profit from a sweatshop. Trump recounts adventures experienced while engaged in real estate investing in Manhattan. He discusses {{what it was like to}} star in the television program The Apprentice.|$|E
25|$|Most uppers have a mechanism, such as laces, straps with buckles, zippers, elastic, <b>velcro</b> straps, buttons, or snaps, for {{tightening}} the upper on the foot. Uppers with laces {{usually have a}} tongue that helps seal the laced opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the laces. Uppers with laces also have eyelets or hooks {{to make it easier}} to tighten and loosen the laces and to prevent the lace from tearing through the upper material. An aglet is the protective wrapping on the end of the lace.|$|E
25|$|In March a new U.S. Army {{combat uniform}} {{that takes into}} {{consideration}} fit requirements of female soldiers (the Army Combat Uniform-Alternate, known as ACU-A) was approved for use by both men and women. The new uniform is wider in the hips and backside and has elastic around the waistband instead of a draw string, as well as adjusted pockets and elbow-pad and knee-pad inserts and shortened crotch length. The rank and name plate were also repositioned on the uniform jacket. The new uniform also has slimmer shoulders, a longer coat, and buttons that replace the <b>Velcro</b> pockets.|$|E
25|$|The medial is {{the part}} of the shoe closest to a person's center of symmetry, and the lateral is on the {{opposite}} side, away from their center of symmetry. This can be in reference to either the outsole or the vamp. Most shoes have shoelaces on the upper, connecting the medial and lateral parts after one puts their shoes on and aiding in keeping their shoes on their feet. In 1968, Puma SE introduced the first pair of sneakers with <b>Velcro</b> straps in lieu of shoelaces, and these became popular by the 1980s, especially among children and the elderly.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{scientists}} at BMI-TNO, the research unit of Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research at the University of Amsterdam, invented and patented {{a series of}} additional key elements that make the volume clamp work in clinical practice. These methods {{include the use of}} modulated infrared light in the optical system inside the sensor, the lightweight, easy-to-wrap finger cuff with <b>velcro</b> fixation, a new pneumatic proportional control valve principle, and a set point strategy for the determining and tracking the correct volume at which to clamp the finger arteries—the Physiocal system. An acronym for physiological calibration of the finger arteries, this Physiocal tracker was found to be accurate, robust and reliable.|$|E
25|$|All {{officers}} {{have a unique}} identification number. These are usually referred to as shoulder or collar numbers, referring {{to the fact that}} they were once worn on the uniform collar and later on the epaulettes by constables and sergeants. Uniformed officers in many forces still wear them on the epaulettes, but other forces have badges or other ways of displaying their identification numbers. Kent Police, for instance, refers to its numbers as force numbers and officers wear them on a <b>velcro</b> tab on their stab vest or on a badge attached to their shirt or tunic. Officers in all forces of the rank of inspector or above do not usually wear their numbers.|$|E
