In June 2011, Apple overtook Nokia to become the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume. On October 4, 2011, Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S, which was first released on October 14, 2011. It features the Apple A5 processor and Siri <b>voice</b> <b>assistant</b> <b>technology,</b> the latter of which Apple had acquired in 2010. It also features an updated 8MP camera with new optics. Apple began a new accessibility feature, Made for iPhone Hearing Aids with the iPhone 4S.

5000|$|Siri's {{original}} {{release on}} iPhone 4S in 2011 received mixed reviews. It received praise for its voice recognition and contextual knowledge of user information, including calendar appointments, but {{was criticized for}} requiring stiff user commands and having a lack of flexibility. It was also criticized for lacking information on certain nearby places, and for its inability to understand certain English accents. In 2016 and 2017, a number of media reports have indicated that Siri is lacking in innovation, particularly against new competing <b>voice</b> <b>assistants</b> from other <b>technology</b> companies. The reports concerned Siri's limited set of features, [...] "bad" [...] voice recognition, and undeveloped service integrations as causing trouble for Apple {{in the field of}} artificial intelligence and cloud-based services; the basis for the complaints reportedly due to stifled development, as caused by Apple's prioritization of user privacy and executive power struggles within the company.|$|R
40|$|Voice {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} popular User Interaction (UI) channel, mainly contributing to the ongoing trend of wearables, smart vehicles, and home automation systems. <b>Voice</b> <b>assistants</b> such as Siri, Google Now and Cortana, have become our everyday fixtures, especially in scenarios where touch interfaces are inconvenient or even dangerous to use, such as driving or exercising. Nevertheless, the open nature of the voice channel makes <b>voice</b> <b>assistants</b> difficult to secure and exposed to various attacks as demonstrated by security researchers. In this paper, we present VAuth, the first system that provides continuous and usable authentication for <b>voice</b> <b>assistants.</b> We design VAuth to fit in various widely-adopted wearable devices, such as eyeglasses, earphones/buds and necklaces, where it collects the body-surface vibrations of the user and matches it with the speech signal received by the <b>voice</b> <b>assistant's</b> microphone. VAuth guarantees that the <b>voice</b> <b>assistant</b> executes only the commands that originate from {{the voice of the}} owner. We have evaluated VAuth with 18 users and 30 voice commands and find it to achieve an almost perfect matching accuracy with less than 0. 1 % false positive rate, regardless of VAuth's position on the body and the user's language, accent or mobility. VAuth successfully thwarts different practical attacks, such as replayed attacks, mangled voice attacks, or impersonation attacks. It also has low energy and latency overheads and is compatible with most existing <b>voice</b> <b>assistants...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>assistants</b> like Siri {{enable us}} to control IoT devices {{conveniently}} with voice commands, however, they also provide new attack opportunities for adversaries. Previous papers attack <b>voice</b> <b>assistants</b> with obfuscated <b>voice</b> commands by leveraging the gap between speech recognition system and human voice perception. The limitation is that these obfuscated commands are audible and thus conspicuous to device owners. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to directly attack the microphone used for sensing voice data with inaudible voice commands. We show that the adversary can exploit the microphone's non-linearity and play well-designed inaudible ultrasounds to cause the microphone to record normal voice commands, and thus control the victim device inconspicuously. We demonstrate via end-to-end real-world experiments that our inaudible voice commands can attack an Android phone and an Amazon Echo device with high success rates at a range of 2 - 3 meters...|$|R

40|$|Sentiment {{analysis}} from large-scale networked data attracts increasing attention in recent years. Most previous works on sentiment prediction mainly focus on text or image data. However, voice {{is the most}} natural and direct way to express people's sentiments in real-time. With the rapid development of smart phone voice dialogue applications (e. g., Siri and Sogou <b>Voice</b> <b>Assistant),</b> the large-scale networked voice data can help us better quantitatively understand the sentimental world we live in. In this paper, we study the problem of sentiment prediction from large-scale networked voice data. In particular, we first investigate the data observations and underlying sentiment patterns in human-mobile voice communication. Then we propose a deep sparse neural network (DSNN) model to incorporate acoustic features, content information and geo-information to automatically predict sentiments. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by the experiments on a real dataset from Sogou <b>Voice</b> <b>Assistant</b> application.
