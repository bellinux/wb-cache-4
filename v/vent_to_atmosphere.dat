40|$|Distillation column units present special {{safety hazards}} {{because of their}} large inventories, which often involve {{flammable}} solvents. Thus study of operational failures, which may results into incidents or accidents, in a distillation column unit by simulation is of value. In such cases, a mandatory condition in safety assessment is the detailed disturbance analysis through simulation to cover {{a wide range of}} operation. In this paper, scenarios such as loss of cooling, more or less steam flow rate, high or low feed flow rate etc. are simulated to evaluate control structures and for safety examination. This is achieved through introduction of small and large disturbances. The distillation column unit, which is part of a hydrocarbon recovery plant, from a real chemical plant is taken for case study. The operational failures in distillation column unit under study were identified through simulation with two different inferential configurations and a dual composition control scheme. Simulation results illustrates that the condenser level controller, sump level controller, temperature controller and <b>vent</b> <b>to</b> <b>atmosphere</b> keeps the process controlled variables at the set point for these disturbances except for the case where 20 % reduction in feed was introduced...|$|E
40|$|Low cost, robust, {{in-house}} hardware {{for heart}} cutting two-dimensional gas chromatography Natural materials are so complex {{that no single}} column can separate all of the com-ponents. Heart cutting 2 -D GC (GC-GC) using a Deans switch provides maximum sep-aration, but the requisite gas flow configurations have earned {{a reputation for being}} fiddly and time consuming to set up and tune, unless electronic gas controls and costly software are employed. A design for a vented Deans switch is presented that can be assembled in-house from standard commercial components. A <b>vent</b> <b>to</b> <b>atmosphere</b> replaces the balancing resistor, which solves the problem of balancing the pressures and flows, and requires no compensation for changes in gas viscosity and back-pressure during temperature programming. First and second dimension columns can both be run at optimum flow rates, even if they are of different diame-ters. Analyte detectability is preserved by cutting only the target fraction from the first column and transferring the whole of it to the second column. Cryotrapping the selected fraction allows cuts of any width, and transfer of analytes to the second column as sharp bands. I have applied the vented Deans switch–cold trap to the identification of flavour and fragrance compounds from South African plants and foods; cuts are very repeatable, and the detectability of trace components is enhan-ced. Its capabilities are demonstrated by examples from analyses of essential oils and flavour extracts...|$|E

50|$|Most {{detonation}} {{flame arrester}} applications are in systems which collect gases emitted by liquids and solids. These systems, {{commonly used in}} many industries, may be called vapor control systems. The gases which are <b>vented</b> <b>to</b> <b>atmosphere</b> or controlled via vapor control systems are typically flammable. If the conditions are such that ignition occurs, a flame inside or outside of the system could result, {{with the potential to}} do catastrophic damage.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be <b>vented</b> <b>to</b> the <b>atmosphere</b> (blow off valve). Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge <b>vents</b> <b>to</b> <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{relatively}} high temperature in a locomotive condenser, the potential improvement in thermal efficiency expected from including the condenser in the cycle is not usually realised within the space constraints of a typical locomotive. Indeed, losses due to viscous friction in the condenser piping, and having to pump the condensate back into the boiler is likely to reduce the power output over what was achievable from simply <b>venting</b> <b>to</b> <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|R

50|$|To {{avoid this}} {{manufactures}} created a ventilation system. Originally this {{was often a}} very basic setup where a filter {{was placed on the}} top of the cam case and the pressure and vapors were <b>vented</b> <b>to</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> This was deemed unacceptable as it allowed fumes and oil mist <b>to</b> be <b>vented</b> out into the atmosphere which caused pollution. It could also cause issues for the occupants of the car as it could be drawn into the inside of the car which was often unpleasant.|$|R

25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve, the train line <b>vents</b> <b>to</b> <b>atmosphere</b> at a controlled rate, reducing the train line pressure {{and in turn}} triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder. When the engine operator releases the brake, the locomotive brake valve portal <b>to</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is closed, allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive. The subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge {{the contents of the}} brake cylinder <b>to</b> the <b>atmosphere,</b> releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|The {{exhaust valve}} opens at point 1. As the piston moves from BDC (point 1) to TDC (point 0) with the exhaust valve opened, the gaseous mixture is <b>vented</b> <b>to</b> the <b>atmosphere</b> {{and the process}} starts anew.|$|R
50|$|As {{an option}} with this arrangement, if the vacuum is shut off prior to cure completion, as {{is called for}} in some applications, before the supply line is <b>vented</b> <b>to</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> the gauge line is backfilled with {{nitrogen}} from a zero-pressure gas regulator, thus preventing atmospheric contaminants from entering the breather/bleeder fabric. Individual monitoring of each vacuum line does not necessarily require gauge lines, nor does inert gas backfill. However, the extra cost of providing for gauge lines is not much. If vacuum bag pressure control is used, then the appropriate valves and regulators must be built in.|$|R

2500|$|When {{the train}} brakes are applied during normal operations, the engine {{operator}} makes a [...] "service application" [...] or a [...] "service rate reduction”, {{which means that}} the train line pressure reduces at a controlled rate.

50|$|Where a {{pipeline}} containing passes under a road or railway, {{it is usually}} enclosed in a protective casing.

50|$|The {{possibility}} of using carbon dioxide enrichment in greenhouse cultivation to enhance plant {{growth has been}} known for nearly 100 years. After the development of equipment for the controlled serial enrichment of carbon dioxide, the technique was established on a broad scale in the Netherlands. Secondary metabolites, e.g., cardiac glycosides in Digitalis lanata, are produced in higher amounts by greenhouse cultivation at enhanced temperature and at enhanced carbon dioxide concentration. Commercial greenhouses are now frequently located near appropriate industrial facilities for mutual benefit. For example, Cornerways Nursery in the UK is strategically placed near a major sugar refinery, consuming both waste heat and CO2 from the refinery which would otherwise be <b>vented</b> <b>to</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The refinery reduces its carbon emissions, whilst the nursery enjoys boosted tomato yields and does not need to provide its own greenhouse heating.|$|R
