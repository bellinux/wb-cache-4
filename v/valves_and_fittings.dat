40|$|The {{fraction}} of layout engineering costs {{on the total}} costs of a chemical plant is about 5 per cent. Layout engineering costs for long-distance energy networks are even higher. Therefore, the application of computer aided methods for fluiddynamic calculation of pipework becomes more important. <b>Valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> characteristics supplied by the manufacturer are valid for stationary conditions. Characteristics of valve opening positions less than 15 per cent, which are important for dynamic analysis, are mainly not available.

40|$|Pressure-polishing is {{a method}} for shaping glass {{pipettes}} for patch-clamp recording. We first developed this method for fabricating pipettes suitable for recording from small (< 3 m) neuronal cell bodies. The basic principal is similar to glass-blowing and combines air pressure and heat to modify the shape of patch pipettes prepared by a conventional micropipette puller. It {{can be applied to}} so-called soft (soda lime) and hard (borosilicate) glasses. Generally speaking, pressure polishing can reduce pipette resistance by 25 % without decreasing the diameter of the tip opening (Goodman and Lockery, 2000). It can be applied to virtually any type of glass and requires only the addition of a high-pressure <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> to a microforge. This technique is essential for recording from ultrasmall cells (< 5 m) and can also improve single-channel recording by minimizing pipette resistance. The blunt shape is also useful for perforated-patch clamp recording since this tip shape results in a larger membrane bleb available for perforation...|$|R
