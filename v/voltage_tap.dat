50|$|If {{only one}} tap changer is required, {{manually}} operated tap points are usually {{made on the}} high voltage (primary) or lower current winding of the transformer to minimize the current handling requirements of the contacts. However, a transformer may include a tap changer on each winding if there are advantages to do so. For example, in power distribution networks, a large step-down transformer may have an off-load tap changer on the primary winding and an on load automatic tap changer on the secondary winding or windings. The high <b>voltage</b> <b>tap</b> is set to match long term system profile on the high voltage network (typically supply voltage averages) and is rarely changed. The low <b>voltage</b> <b>tap</b> may be requested to change positions multiple times each day, without interrupting the power delivery, to follow loading conditions on the low-voltage (secondary winding) network.|$|E

40|$|The current-voltage (I-V) {{curve is}} the basic {{characteristic}} of a superconducting wire or tape. Measuring I-V curves is generally problematic when samples have poor stabilization. Soldering <b>voltage</b> <b>taps</b> to an active part of the conductor affects {{the effectiveness of the}} local cooling and/or can be difficult to do in certain devices such as fault current limiters and cables where the tapes are closely packed. In order to overcome these problems, <b>voltage</b> <b>taps</b> can be placed outside the active area of the superconductor. We proved both by simulations and experiments that this arrangement leads to the same results as the standard four point method and it provides more detailed information for sample protection. The same arrangement can also be used for AC transport loss measurement. However in this case particular care has to be taken because the eddy current loss in the current leads contributes to the total measured loss. We used numerical simulations to evaluate the contribution of the eddy current loss to the measured AC loss. With help of simulations one can determine whether the contribution of the eddy current loss is significant and possibly optimize the current leads to reduce that loss contribution...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAC high {{temperature}} superconducting (HTS) coils {{have been developed}} for transformers, motors and so on. Quench detection and protection system are essential for safety operations of the AC HTS facilities. The balance voltage method is universally used for the quench detection and protection, however especially for AC operations, the method has risks in terms of high voltage sparks. Because the method needs a <b>voltage</b> <b>tap</b> soldered to a midpoint of the coil winding and the AC HTS facilities generally operate at high voltages and therefore high voltage sparks may occur at the midpoint with no insulation. We have proposed the active power method for the quench detection and protection. The method requires no <b>voltage</b> <b>tap</b> on the midpoint of the coil winding and therefore it has in-built effectiveness for the AC HTS facilities.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} applications of superconductivity is high field magnet. Mechanical disturbance such as abrupt conductor motion {{is one of the main}} origin of premature quench (transition from superconducting state to the normal resistive state) in high current density superconducting coils. The wire motion occurs when electromagnetic force to conductor exceeds constrain force including frictional force on the surface of conductor. Behavior of superconducting wire motion depends on the electromagnetic force acting on it, frictional property of the insulating material and thrust force applied to the superconducting wire. 　　　The experiments for superconducting wire motion in magnetic field was carried out using small coil wound on stainless steel (SUS) bobbin using Polyimide film as an insulating material and high strength polyethylene fiber (Dyneema: DF) reinforced plastic (DFRP) bobbin [1]. The Dyneema fiber has negative thermal expansion [2] and low coefficient of friction [3]. It was found that voltage spikes generated due to sudden wire motion in case of DFRP bobbin are a few and small in amplitude. The speculations are; the negative thermal expansion of the DFRP bobbin restrains the wire motion and low coefficient of friction between superconducting wire and DFRP bobbin reduces sudden motion. 　　　In order to study the effect of frictional coefficient of insulating material on superconducting wire motion under the influence of electromagnetic force, a special experimental setup was designed and fabricated. The main distinctiveness of the experimental setup is that the tension of the superconducting wire can be changed during the experiments. The experimental set up consists of a cryostat, superconducting solenoid magnet, sample holder, tensional unit to apply tension to the superconducting wire, power supplies and pen recorder or a 16 -bit data recorder to measure the <b>voltage</b> <b>tap</b> signal. The sample holder consists of two parts, a semi- circular head and a body part. Experiments were conducted at 4. 2 K by varying the experimental conditions such as the tension to the superconducting wire, superconducting wire current ramp rate and different insulating materials at the interface of the superconducting wire and semi-circular head. 　　　Voltage taps to measure the signal generated due to the superconducting wire motion are connected at the end of the semi-circular head. To reduce the <b>voltage</b> <b>tap</b> loop area, a groove was incorporated in the semi-circular head and the <b>voltage</b> <b>tap</b> wire was passed through it. The <b>voltage</b> <b>tap</b> signal is measured by a pen recorder or a 16 -bit data recorder with a sampling rate of 1 MS/s. Sudden wire motion was indicated by observing the voltage spikes. 　　　In order to examine the effect of the current ramp rate on the superconducting wire motion, ramp rate was changed from 0. 4 A/s to 1. 69 A/s. The superconducting wire tension was varied from 7. 1 N to 35. 8 N to study the effect of tension on the superconducting wire motion. During all experiments, a constant magnetic field of 6 T was applied by superconducting solenoid magnet. 　　　In the thesis work, different types of insulating material were used to study superconducting wire motion under electromagnetic force. They are Polyimide film, cloth / sheet material fabricated using Dyneema fiber, Zylon fiber and Teflon. The Dyneema / Zylon fiber has negative thermal expansion and a low coefficient of friction. 　　　We have verified the effectiveness of this system. We could measure the pattern of voltage spikes. The time duration of voltage spikes are of the same order for all the samples. The peak <b>voltage</b> <b>tap</b> signal amplitude, velocity of wire motion, distance moved by wire and energy dissipated due to wire motion in case of Polyimide film is more than 2 order of magnitude larger than Dyneema based insulating materials and Zylon cloth. Hence use of Dyneema / Zylon based materials as an interface material between layers of superconducting wire may reduce the frictional heat generated due to wire motion and could make superconducting magnet performance more reliable...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{simulations}} with the CUDI–CICC code on the poloidal field insert sample (PFIS) {{tested in the}} SULTAN test facility are presented. The interpretations are based on current distribution analysis from self-field measurements with Hall sensor arrays and current sharing measurements. The possible variation in voltage–current (VI) curves among the sub-cables in the PFIS caused by the cable self-field and joint non-uniformity is a principal issue {{for the evaluation of}} the strand-to-cable performance. The cable transverse voltages, initiated by current non-uniformity in a cabled conductor, can affect the shape of the longitudinal VI curve. The basic cable data are obtained by petal-to-conduit contact resistance and conduit resistivity measurements under transverse cyclic load in the Twente Cryogenic Cable Press. We assessed the impact of the conduit, the sub-cable resistive barrier wraps and the location of the <b>voltage</b> <b>taps</b> on the measured voltage, and some comparisons were carried out with experimental runs on the PFIS. The outcome confirms that the transverse voltages, caused by current redistribution, do affect the shape of the VI transition. This effect seems particularly important in short sample tests. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the location of the <b>voltage</b> <b>taps</b> can affect the experimentally obtained VI curve and solutions for most accurate measurement of the VI are discussed in the paper. The numerical model, CUDI–CICC covers the final cabling stage of inter-petal interactions only, by which the possible role of intra-petal non-uniformities is ignored, although recognized as potentially relevant. ...|$|R

For various examples, it is presented how such local monitoring helps to improve the security of the power distribution field stations, when malicious commands are sent from the control room (insider attacks).
