To perform these checks we determined the infinite <b>volume</b> defect form <b>factors</b> in the Lee–Yang model exactly, including their vacuum expectation values. We used these data to calculate the two point functions, which we compared, at short distance, to defect CFT.

50|$|The {{program is}} based on a theorem by David Malament that states {{that if there is a}} {{bijective}} map between two past and future distinguishing space times that preserves their causal structure then the map is a conformal isomorphism. The conformal factor that is left undetermined is related to the volume of regions in the spacetime. This <b>volume</b> <b>factor</b> can be recovered by specifying a volume element for each space time point. The volume of a space time region could then be found by counting the number of points in that region.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} finite size effects in 1 + 1 dimensional integrable QFT. In particular we consider matrix elements of local operators (finite <b>volume</b> form <b>factors)</b> and vacuum expectation values and correlation functions at finite temperature. In {{the first part}} of the thesis we give a complete description of the finite <b>volume</b> form <b>factors</b> in terms of the infinite <b>volume</b> form <b>factors</b> (solutions of the bootstrap program) and the S-matrix of the theory. The calculations are correct to all orders in the inverse of the volume, only exponentially decaying (residual) finite size effects are neglected. We also consider matrix elements with disconnected pieces and determine the general rule for evaluating such contributions in a finite volume. The analytic results are tested against numerical data obtained by the truncated conformal space approach in the Lee-Yang model and the Ising model in a magnetic field. In a separate section we also evaluate the leading exponential correction (the μ-term) associated to multi-particle energies and matrix elements. In the second part of the thesis we show that finite <b>volume</b> <b>factors</b> can be used to derive a systematic low-temperature expansion for correlation functions at finite temperature. In the case of vacuum expectation values the series is worked out up to the third non-trivial order and a complete agreement with the LeClair-Mussardo formula is observed. A preliminary treatment of the two-point function is also given by considering the first nontrivial contributions. Comment: PhD thesis, 141 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} of mass outflow rates of AGN winds {{is of great}} importance in understanding the role that such winds play in AGN-galaxy feedback processes. The mass outflow rates are, however, difficult to estimate since the <b>volume</b> filling <b>factors</b> of the winds are unknown. In this paper, we use constraints imposed by the observed radio emission to obtain upper limits to the <b>volume</b> filling <b>factors</b> of wind components in certain nearby AGN. We do this by predicting the 1. 4 GHz radio flux densities emitted by those components, assuming a uniform wind, and then comparing these with the observed flux densities for each AGN at this frequency. We find that the upper limits to the <b>volume</b> filling <b>factors</b> {{are in the range}} 10 ^{- 4 }- 0. 5. Comment: 6 pages, accepted by MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Various type of detector, such as {{ionization}} chamber, {{has been}} used in small field radiotherapy dosimetry. There is a limitation in detector’s dimension which can produce the volume averaging effect. Detector will average the measured dose because of fluence perturbation that happens in gas-filled cavity around detector’s active volume. Purpose {{of this study is to}} calculate <b>volume</b> averaging correction <b>factor</b> of some detectors. <b>Volume</b> averaging correction <b>factor</b> can be calculated using MATLAB based algorithm. The result shows that detector with the lowest <b>volume</b> averaging correction <b>factor</b> is SFD diode detector with <b>volume</b> averaging correction <b>factor</b> value is 1, 0086 in 4 cm x 4 cm field size. Whereas GD- 302 has the largest volume averaging correction, 1, 6083 in 0, 8 cm x 0, 8 cm field size. The larger size of detector, the greater <b>volume</b> averaging correction <b>factor</b> will be produced. Therefore, detector with small enough dimension is required in order to minimize the effect of volume averaging...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of dispersion measures of pulsars, distances {{from the model}} of Cordes and Lazio (2002) and emission measures from the WHAM survey enabled a statistical study of electron densities and filling factors of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in the Milky Way. The emission measures were corrected for absorption and contributions from beyond the pulsar distance. For a sample of 157 pulsars at |b| > 5 degrees, mainly located in interarm regions within about 3 kpc from the Sun, we find that: (1) The average <b>volume</b> filling <b>factor</b> {{along the line of}} sight is inversely proportional to the mean electron density in clouds. (2) The average <b>volume</b> filling <b>factor</b> increases towards larger distances from the Galactic plane. (3) The local <b>volume</b> filling <b>factor</b> may reach a maximum near |z| = 0. 9 kpc, whereas the local electron density continues to decrease at higher |z|, thus causing the observed flattening in the distribution of dispersion measures perpendicular to the plane above this height.
