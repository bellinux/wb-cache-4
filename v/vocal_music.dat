5|$|Since the 1950s Josquin's {{reputation}} {{has been}} boosted by the increasing availability of recordings, {{of which there}} are many, and the rise of ensembles specializing in the performance of 16th century <b>vocal</b> <b>music,</b> many of which place Josquin's output at the heart of their repertoire.|$|E
5|$|Before {{researchers}} took active {{interest in}} it, {{the field of}} 17th-century British song had not been investigated. Music historian Charles Burney had a negative opinion towards British <b>vocal</b> <b>music</b> in this period. That attitude was carried through {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, where in the first edition of the Oxford History of Music, Hubert Parry stated that English composers' sense of musical line was deficient.|$|E
5|$|Jacques Arcadelt (also Jacob Arcadelt; 14 October 1568) was a Franco-Flemish {{composer}} of the Renaissance, {{active in}} both Italy and France, and principally {{known as a}} composer of secular <b>vocal</b> <b>music.</b> Although he also wrote sacred <b>vocal</b> <b>music,</b> {{he was one of}} the most famous of the early composers of madrigals; his first book of madrigals, published within a decade of the appearance of the earliest examples of the form, was the most widely printed collection of madrigals of the entire era. In addition to his work as a madrigalist, and distinguishing him from the other prominent early composers of madrigals – Philippe Verdelot and Costanzo Festa – he was equally prolific and adept at composing chansons, particularly late in his career when he lived in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Returning to the United States in 1890, Smith {{began working}} at the {{settlement}} house, Hull House, as a music instructor. Within three years she had co-founded the Hull House Music School, a school which followed her progressive teaching ideas, cross-training students in <b>vocal</b> <b>music</b> as well as instruments. Simultaneously, she worked in several institutions in the Chicago area which trained music educators.|$|E

5|$|While in college, Conway was {{a member}} of the Ursinius Meistersingers <b>vocal</b> <b>music</b> group, and the {{performing}} arts honor society Pi Nu Epsilon. He became a volunteer for the American Red Cross Disaster Service in 1989, but quit in 1998 due to his perception of high-level corruption in the organization. He was an Emergency Management Coordinator while residing in Malvern, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|After {{her initial}} {{formation}} {{as a member}} of her religious congregation, Hudson was permitted to attend VanderCook College of Music, concentrating in music and religious education. This led to a nearly three decade long career as a music teacher at a series of Roman Catholic junior high schools in Michigan, where she taught piano and band as well as <b>vocal</b> <b>music.</b> Throughout this time, she also sang in a musical group composed of other Dominican Sisters, known as the Mellow D’s.|$|E
5|$|Bennett had a {{significant}} influence on English music, not solely as a composer {{but also as a}} teacher, as a promoter of standards of musical education and as an important figure in London concert life. In recent years, appreciation of Bennett's compositions has been rekindled and a number of his works, including a symphony, his piano concerti, some <b>vocal</b> <b>music</b> and many of his piano compositions, have been recorded. In his bicentenary year of 2016, several concerts of his music and other related events took place.|$|E

5|$|In eastern Indonesia (i.e. in {{the music}} of the Toraja in South Sulawesi, in Flores, in East Kalimantan and in North Sulawesi), two-part harmonies are common, usually in {{intervals}} of thirds, fourths or fifths. Additionally, much music of the Middle East is generally homophonic, although polyphony is also an important texture, while Chinese music is generally thought to be homophonic, since instruments typically provide accompaniment in parallel fourths and fifths and often double the voice in <b>vocal</b> <b>music,</b> heterophony also being common in China.|$|E
5|$|In <b>vocal</b> <b>music,</b> noisy {{nonsense}} syllables {{were used to}} imitate battle drums and cannon fire long before Clément Janequin made these devices famous in his programmatic chanson La bataille (The Battle) in 1528. Unpitched or semi-pitched performance was introduced to formal composition in 1897 by Engelbert Humperdinck, in {{the first version of}} his melodrama, Königskinder. This style of performance {{is believed to have been}} used previously by singers of lieder and popular songs. The technique is best known, however, from somewhat later compositions by Arnold Schoenberg, who introduced it for solo voices in his Gurrelieder (1900–11), Pierrot Lunaire (1913), and the opera Moses und Aron (1930–32), and for chorus in Die Glückliche Hand (1910–13). Later composers who have made prominent use of the device include Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Benjamin Britten (in Death in Venice, 1973), Mauricio Kagel, and Wolfgang Rihm (in his opera Jakob Lenz, 1977–78, amongst other works). A well-known example of this style of performance in popular music was Rex Harrison's portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady. Another form of unpitched <b>vocal</b> <b>music</b> is the speaking chorus, prominently represented by Ernst Toch's 1930 Geographical Fugue, an example of the Gebrauchsmusik fashionable in Germany at that time.|$|E

5|$|Before the Baroque era, {{keyboard}} music generally was {{not written}} for one instrument or another, but rather was written {{to be played}} on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period {{is the same as}} that of the harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions from a variety of regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of <b>vocal</b> <b>music</b> by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her work at Hull House, Smith was involved in public education. Francis Wayland Parker invited her to head the <b>vocal</b> <b>music</b> department at the Chicago Normal School in 1897 and she was asked by John Dewey to teach at the University of Chicago {{as the head of}} the Department of Music, School of Education from 1901 to 1910. She not only trained teachers for Dewey but assisted him in developing a revised curriculum for the music education program. Smith also instructed courses at the Chicago Kindergarten College and at the Froebel Kindergarten College, both training colleges for teachers of very young children.|$|E
5|$|Italian folk {{styles are}} very diverse, and include monophonic, polyphonic, and responsorial song, choral, {{instrumental}} and <b>vocal</b> <b>music,</b> and other styles. Choral singing and polyphonic song forms are primarily found in northern Italy, while south of Naples, solo singing is more common, and groups usually use unison singing {{in two or}} three parts carried by a single performer. Northern ballad-singing is syllabic, with a strict tempo and intelligible lyrics, while southern styles use a rubato tempo, and a strained, tense vocal style. Folk musicians use the dialect of their own regional tradition; this rejection of the standard Italian language in folk song is nearly universal. There is little perception of a common Italian folk tradition, and the country's folk music never became a national symbol.|$|E

5|$|John Stanford {{hoped that}} his son would follow him into the legal {{profession}} but accepted his decision to pursue music as a career. However, he stipulated that Stanford should have a conventional university education before going on to musical studies abroad. Stanford tried unsuccessfully for a classics scholarship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, but gained an organ scholarship, and later a classics scholarship, at Queens' College. By the time {{he went up to}} Cambridge in 1870 he had written a substantial number of compositions, including <b>vocal</b> <b>music,</b> both sacred and secular, and orchestral works (a rondo for cello and orchestra and a concert overture).|$|E
5|$|Visual art study {{begins with}} drawing and {{painting}} and then advances to more complex techniques such as sculpture, stained glass, architecture, photography, and pottery. Students learn {{in a variety of}} media, including watercolor, oil pastels, charcoal, and clay. Music study begins in the early childhood program. As they progress, Avery Coonley students participate in <b>vocal</b> <b>music,</b> playing Orff instruments and recorders, dancing, and public performance. In middle school, students develop music literacy by reading and writing music, playing choir chimes, and choral singing. The study of music in culture and the history of jazz and opera are taught alongside theory and performance.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and <b>vocal</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
