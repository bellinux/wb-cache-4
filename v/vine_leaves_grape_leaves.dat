There are over 70 kinds of köfte, usually made with wheat and other ingredients. Kağıt kebabı {{is one of the most}} {{important}} local specialties - a dish made of lamb and vegetables broiled in a wrapper, usually oily paper. Other important dishes are a variety of stuffed specialties, including stuffed mulberry leaves, cabbage, chard, lettuce wraps with olive oil, <b>vine</b> <b>leaves,</b> cherry <b>leaves,</b> bean <b>leaves,</b> <b>grape</b> <b>leaves,</b> beets, onions, and zucchini flowers.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the {{volatile}} composition of <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> and <b>vine</b> leaf infusion prepared from <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> collected at 30 and 60 days after grape harvest of two Vitis vinifera L. species. Eighteen volatile compounds were identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry in <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> and in <b>vine</b> leaf infusions. It was observed that the volatile compounds present in <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> are dependent {{on the time of}} harvest, with benzaldehyde being the major volatile present in <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> collected at 30 days after harvesting. There are significant differences in the volatile composition of the <b>leaves</b> from the two <b>grape</b> cultivars, especially in the sample collected at 60 days after grape harvest. This is not reflected in the volatile composition of the vine leaf infusion made from this two cultivars, the more important being the harvesting date for the volatile profile of vine leaf infusion than the <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar...|$|R
40|$|The {{main object}} {{of the present study}} was to {{investigate}} the volatile composition and sensorial profile of <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> infusions prepared from <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> collected 30 and 60 days after grape harvest from two Portuguese red grape varieties (Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz). Twelve volatile compounds were detected in <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> infusions (6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, 1 -undecene, Z-citral, cedrenol, DL-limonene, 2, 4 -hexadien- 2 -ol, benzaldehyde, heptane- 1, 2, 4, 6 -tetraene, cyclohexene 1 -methyl- 4 -(1 -methylethyl), 1, 6 -octadien- 3 -ol, 3, 7 -dimethyl, 5, 9 -undecadien- 2 -one- 6, 10 -dimethyl-(5 E) and α-cedrol). In addition, it was observed that the volatile compounds present in <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> infusions were dependent on the harvest time, with significantly major volatile content in <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> collected after 30 days of harvesting. Thus, it was more important the harvesting date for the volatile profile of <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> infusion than the <b>vine</b> <b>leave</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar. Similar tendency was also obtained for the sensory profile, with significant differences for astringency and aroma intensity attributes of <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> infusions according to the harvesting date...|$|R

5000|$|The {{former east}} house is {{constructed}} with sandstone {{in the lower}} storey, and timber framing above. It has an undercroft, and two storeys plus an attic. On the side facing Watergate Street is a gable, an entrance door, a beer-drop door, and a five-light transomed window in the lower storey. Between the storeys is a bressumer carved with <b>vine</b> <b>leaves,</b> <b>grapes,</b> and the initials [...] "T.W.A.". The upper storey contains a seven-light transomed oriel window, with a small two-light window on each side. Around these windows are panels, {{some of which are}} plain, the others arched. The gable is jettied and carries the date 1637. It contains a three-light mullioned casement window with herringbone struts at the sides and above it. The bargeboards are plain. The former west house has a rendered lower storey, and a brick upper storey. It has a doorway and two three-light windows in the lower storey, and sash windows above. The former cottage at the rear is in Georgian style. It is constructed in brick on a sandstone plinth, with a grey slate roof. It contains sash windows, and two dormers in the gables above. [...] Many alterations have been carried out to the interior of the inn, but it does retain oak beams dating from about 1642, and a carved stone fireplace.|$|R

50|$|A first gate, {{dating from}} {{the second half of}} the thirteenth century, has its mediaeval strap hinges still visible. The arched {{tympanum}} was carved in 1844 by Emile Sichler, a local sculptor. The Adoration of the Magi is represented on the tympanum, and oak <b>leaves</b> and <b>vines</b> are carved on the capitals of the columns. A second portal is dated to the construction of the nave, around 1220-1230; the doors and hinges are mediaeval, and <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> and <b>grapes</b> adorn the door. A third portal, which is Romanesque, probably comes from the nave and transept, built in the thirteenth century. It was probably moved to this location at a later date unknown.

25|$|In Chile, Merlot {{thrives in}} the Apalta region of Colchagua Province. It is also grown in {{significant}} quantities in Curicó, Casablanca and the Maipo Valley. Until the early 1990s, the Chilean wine industry mistakenly sold a large quantity of wine {{made from the}} Carménère grape as Merlot. Following the discovery that many Chilean vineyards thought to be planted with Sauvignon blanc was actually Sauvignonasse, {{the owners of the}} Chilean winery Domaine Paul Bruno (who previously worked with Château Margaux and Château Cos d'Estournel) invited ampelographers to comb through their vineyards to make sure that their wines were properly identified. Genetic studies discovered that much of what had been grown as Merlot was actually Carménère, an old French variety that had gone largely extinct in France due to its poor resistance to phylloxera. While the <b>vines,</b> <b>leaves</b> and <b>grapes</b> look very similar, both grapes produce wines with distinct characteristics — Carménère being more strongly flavored with green pepper notes and Merlot having softer fruit with chocolate notes.|$|R
5000|$|Examples of his {{still life}} {{paintings}} are the [...] (640-1645, Prado Museum) and the [...] (after 1640, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen), which both depict {{a young man}} and a young woman in an orchard with the man offering the sitting woman a piece of fruit. A still life of fruit is in front of the figures. The figures show clearly the influence of the Caravaggesque naturalism. The somewhat contorted expression of the young man, his naked torso and the open white shirt bring to mind the memory of certain early works of Caravaggio. The superb rendering of the <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> and <b>grapes</b> in the Prado piece evoke Caravaggios Basket of fruit in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana. However, the opulence of the pumpkins, the open pomegranate and the presence of a landscape barely visible in the background point to a more advanced phase {{in the evolution of the}} genre and show full Baroque influences.

25|$|Screens {{made up of}} {{labyrinths}} {{of complicated}} joinery, consisting of multitudes of tiny balusters connecting hexagons, squares or other forms, with the flat surfaces constantly enriched with small carvings, are familiar to every one. In Cairo we also have examples in the mosque of Qous (12th century) of that finely arranged geometrical interlacing of curves with foliage terminations which distinguishes the Saracenic designer. Six panels in the Victoria and Albert Museum (13th century), {{and work on the}} tomb of the sultan Li Ghoury (16th century), show how deeply this form of decoration was ingrained in the Arab nature. Figure work and animals were sometimes introduced, in medieval fashion, as in the six panels just referred to, and at the hflpital du Moristan (13th century) and the mosque of El Nesfy Qeycoun (14th century). There is a magnificent panel on the door of Beyt-el-Emyr. This exquisite design is composed of <b>vine</b> <b>leaves</b> and, <b>grapes</b> of conventional treatment in low relief. The Arab designer was fond of breaking up his paneling in a way reminding one of a similar Jacobean custom. The main panel would be divided into a number of hexagonal, triangular or other shapes, and each small space filled in with conventional scroll work. Much of this simple flat design reminds one of that Byzantine method from which the Elizabethan carvers were inspired.|$|R

Samples of soil, biomass, <b>vine</b> wood, <b>vine</b> <b>leaves,</b> berries, <b>grapes,</b> rough wine and cider sediment of red wine and also four liquid samples of white wine were analyzed. All the samples originated from the area of Malé Žernoseky and Rudoltice nad Bílinou, white wine samples were collected in Chrámce u Mostu {{in the northern part of}} the Czech Republic. Analyzer AMA 254 was used for determination of mercury in solid samples and liquid samples had to be prearranged by PSA analyzer. This analytical approach was not so sufficient and mercury from liquid samples had to be captured by gold-coated amalgamator in first step and then analyzed by AMA 254.
