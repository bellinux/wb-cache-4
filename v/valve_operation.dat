25|$|Whilst {{retaining}} {{the dimensions of}} the Titan TD7 and Tiger TS11, the 1945 Titan PD1 and Tiger PS1 were entirely new designs featuring a new E181 7.4-litre engine with pushrod <b>valve</b> <b>operation</b> and a brand new four-speed constant mesh gearbox. The export versions with an O prefix for overseas markets, the OPS1, not only had longer wheelbases (where legally applicable) but were equipped with the pre-war design overhead-camshaft E87 engine, which had the same nominal 100bhp output but was larger at 8.6 litres. No UK operator took the OPS1 but Potteries Motor Traction took a batch of long-wheelbase OPD1 Titans as single-deckers, later rebodying them as double decks once overall length rules had been relaxed to allow this. When fitted with left-hand drive, the Tiger became the LOPS1, this prefix attaching to all left-hand drive Leyland buses (and Leyland-designed British United Traction trolleybuses) until the mid-1960s when later designs adopted a suffix letter for driving control position.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The interrelationships among {{coronary}} and valvular operations, microemboli, and neurobehavioral outcome are unclear. We {{hypothesized that}} adult patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> {{would have more}} total emboli delivered to the brain than patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and that this would associate with worse neurobehavioral outcomes. Methods: One hundred ninety-three patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and 73 patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> were compared. Patients received neurologic, neuro-ophthalmologic, and 11 standardized neurobehavioral tests preoperatively and 5 to 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months postoperatively. Left common carotid Doppler ultrasonographic embolus detection was performed intraoperatively. Repeated measures and logistic regression analyses of outcome were performed. Results: Patients undergoing either coronary or <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> were well matched by age (61 ± 10 and 59 ± 12 years, respectively), but a significantly greater fraction of patients undergoing <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> were female, diabetic, or had undergone previous cardiac operations. Neurobehavioral scores of patients undergoing either coronary artery bypass grafting or cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> {{did not differ significantly}} at any time. Total embolus counts differed significantly: the median was 105 during coronary artery bypass grafting and 479 during cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> (geometric means of 104 and 412, respectively; P =. 0001). Significantly more emboli were detected in the patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> after removal of the left ventricular vent and after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, but comparable numbers of emboli were seen in the 2 groups before cardiopulmonary bypass. In both groups decreased neurobehavioral performance was apparent at 5 to 7 days, with improvement at 1 and 6 months. Increasing numbers of carotid emboli significantly associated with worse performance on the letter cancellation test. There {{were no significant differences between}} patients undergoing <b>valve</b> and coronary <b>operations</b> in neurobehavioral outcomes, strokes, transient ischemic attacks, or deaths. Conclusions: The significantly greater number of emboli in the group of patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> is likely the result of the entrainment of intracardiac air. The greater numbers of emboli during cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> do not appear associated with a commensurately greater risk of adverse neurologic or neurobehavioral outcome.

40|$|ObjectiveReports of {{minimally}} invasive tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> are rare, and results are often contradictory. This study analyzes our 5 -year experience with {{minimally invasive}} tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> in high-risk patients. MethodsBetween November 2005 and December 2011, tricuspid valve surgery using a nonsternotomy minimally invasive technique {{was performed in}} 64 patients (19 male, 45 female; mean age, 63. 2  ±  12. 8  years). Mean preoperative European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation was 7. 3  ±  2. 9, and predicted mortality was 11. 6 % ±  11. 7 %. Tricuspid valve regurgitation cause was functional in 36 patients (56. 2 %), endocarditis in 2 patients (3. 1 %), and rheumatic in 24 patients (37. 5 %). Two patients (3. 1 %) showed prosthesis dysfunction. Forty patients (62. 5 %) had undergone previous cardiac surgery. ResultsTricuspid valve repair was performed in 35 patients (54. 7 %). Tricuspid valve replacement with bioprosthesis was performed in 27 patients (42. 2 %), and the remaining 2 patients (3. 1 %) underwent bioprosthetic replacement. Concomitant procedures (48) included mitral valve surgery (42 patients), atrial septal defect closure (5 patients), and myxoma exeresis (1 patient). Conversion to sternotomy occurred in 1 patient (1. 6 %). Overall hospital mortality was 7. 9 %. Stroke occurred in 1 patient (1. 6 %), and 5 patients underwent reoperation for bleeding (7. 8 %). Mean follow-up time was 21  ±  16  months (range, 1 - 59  months) and 100 % completed. Cumulative Kaplan–Meier estimated 5 -year survival was 81. 3 %, and 5 -year freedom from reoperation was 100 %. ConclusionsThe heart-port–based minimally invasive approach seems to be safe, feasible, and reproducible in case of tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>operations.</b> It ensures low perioperative morbidity, moderate to low rates of tricuspid regurgitation recurrence, and low late mortality. It also seems to have an added value in case of reoperative procedures...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Combined {{coronary}} artery bypass (CAB) and valve surgery {{is one of the}} most challenging surgical procedures, but the operative results have improved over the years. Materials and Methods: From 1989 through 2004, combined CAB and <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> were performed in 125 patients. Mean age was 63 years, and 86 patients were male. Forty-six patients were diagnosed with {{coronary artery}} disease during preoperative evaluation for valvular heart disease (VHD). All patients underwent CAB, and one or more underwent valve replacement or repair (mitral: 54, aortic: 61, tricuspid: 3, DVR: 7) simultaneously. Results: Mean number of distal graft was 1. 98 ± 1. 07, and LIMA was used in 68 % of patients. Early mortality occurred in 6 patients (4. 8 %), and the causes were heart failure (4) and sepsis (2). Mean follow-up duration was 91. 4 ± 40. 9 months (range: 47 - 245), and late mortality occurred in 4 patients. Kaplan Meier estimated survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years were 94. 4 %, 92. 3 %, and 89. 9 %, respectively. Conclusion: Combined coronary and <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> can be performed safely with optimal surgical results. Although the surgical mortality of coexisting coronary and VHD is higher than either isolated coronary or valvular operations, it may not affect the long-term survival...|$|R
