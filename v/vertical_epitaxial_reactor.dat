40|$|The SEG {{technique}} and its extension epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) have already found many applications in device fabrication {{both in terms}} of process simplification and new device structures. The basic processes involve substrate preparation, ex-situ cleaning, in-situ surface oxide removal and SEG/ELO growth. Substrate preparation involves fabrication of the necessary "seed-windows" in, e. g. oxide or nitride layers down to the single crystal substrate : this is usually achieved using a reactive ion etch (RIE) process followed by the growth and subsequent etching of a sacrificial oxide (SO) for surface damage removal. Ex-situ cleaning usually consists of a wet chemical treatment, e. g. RCA, with the final RCA- 2 step leaving the silicon surface coated with a reproducible thin oxide layer which also serves to remove various contaminants. The in-situ clean removes the latter oxide through a low pressure H 2 prebake, using a temperature which effectively etches the oxide via the [MATH] disproportionation reaction, but which minimises the concomitant undercutting of the exposed SiO 2 /Si oxide - substrate interface by the same reaction. The growth process involves optimisation of the main parameters, i. e. temperature, pressure and gas flows, to obtain full control of selectivity (i. e. polysilicon nucleation on the field area), sidewall faceting, defect generation and autodoping. This paper will review the technique of selective silicon epitaxy and discuss the results obtained during the optimisation of the above parameters for device applications using a modified Applied Materials LPCVD <b>vertical</b> barrel <b>epitaxial</b> <b>reactor</b> system...|$|R

For various types of horizontal <b>epitaxial</b> <b>reactors</b> the flow of these four carrier gases has been studied in detail using in situ optical measuring techniques i. c. interference holography. Analysis of the results clearly shows the dominant influence of the so called entrance effects, which, especially are of importance for argon and nitrogen.

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{success of}} complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) technology over the last five decades is now facing serious challenges due to aggressive device scaling. To this end, novel nanoscale materials including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and semiconductor nanowires have attracted much interest with the expectation that such materials may be able to complement or replace CMOS in the future. In particular, semiconductor nanowires (NWs) hold much technological promise. These are single-crystals with diameters of a few nanometers and lengths up to tens of micrometers, typically grown through a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process mediated by metal catalyst nanoparticles. Here we explore the technological potential of NWs along three fronts. First, we develop growth techniques for the growth of Si and Ge NWs with an eye toward hybrid nanowire-CMOS systems. We demonstrate the growth of Si NWs using CMOS-compatible Al as the catalyst, with high yield, small diameter, and recovery of semiconducting behavior at small diameter. We also develop the growth of <b>vertical</b> <b>epitaxial</b> Ge and Ge/Si core/shell NWs on Si, with diameter ~ 20 nm and at high nucleation and vertical yields. Second, using these vertical NWs, we investigate the prospects for a vertical Ge NW-based tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET). We fabricate vertical Esaki diodes using the heterojunction at the interface between the Ge NW and Si substrate. At room temperature a representative device shows a peak-to-valley current ratio of 2. 75, a peak current density of 2. 4 kA/cm^ 2, and a tunnel current density of 237 kA/cm^ 2 at 1 V reverse bias.

This work addresses the latter, focusing on device level improvements to tightly couple a low capacitance photodiode with the first stage transistor of the receiver as a single phototransistor device. First I motivate the need for a coupled phototransistor using a simple circuit model which shows how receiver sensitivity is determined by photodiode capacitance and the length of wire connecting it to the first transistor in a receiver amplifier.

Simulations show how MOSFET scaling rules can be easily applied to increase both speed and sensitivity. The second is a floating base germanium bipolar phototransistor on silicon photonics with a 15 GHz gain x bandwidth product.

Figure  1 d shows the interfaces between the nanowires and the substrate without the interfacial layer. That is, the GaN nanowires grow {{directly from the}} substrate. The result indicates that Au has {{a critical role in}} preventing the formation of the interfacial layer, thereby enabling the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>vertical</b> growth of GaN nanowires. The inset of Figure  1 d shows the end of nanowires grown by the Au/Ni catalyst. It shows the metal globule at the end of nanowires and clearly indicates that the nanowires are grown by the catalyst via VLS mechanism. The diameter and length of nanowires were 80 to 100 nm and several hundred micrometers, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Multiferroics which combine {{two or more}} order {{parameters}} of ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity, have drawn great interests {{in the past few}} years due to their promising potential of application in sensors, transducers, spintronics and multistate memories. Coupling between the ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism renders the induction of an electric polarization P upon applying a magnetic field, or the induction of a magnetization M upon applying an electric field which is called magnetoelectric coupling effect. There are single phase multiferroics which simultaneously possess ferroelectricity and magnetism in nature. However, these natural multiferroics only exhibit weak magnetoelectric coupling effect at very low temperature which hinders the practical applications. An alternative and more promising choice is to fabricate multiferroic composites. In the multiferroic composite systems, large magnetoelectric coupling effects can be produced indirectly from the strain-mediated interaction even at room temperature and great design flexibility can be obtained. In the present study, two types of multiferroic composite nanostructures are investigated: the vertical heteroepitaxial multiferroic thin films and film-on-substrate heterogeneous bilayers with incorporation of various influences, such as film thickness, misfit strains and flexoelectricity. Since the first fabrication of <b>vertical</b> <b>epitaxial</b> multiferroic nanostructures, great scientific interests have been attracted for the potential large magnetoelectric effects arising from the relaxed substrate constraint and large interfacial area between the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic phases. A three dimensional phase field model is devised to precisely describe the complex strain state of this nanostructure. The simulation results demonstrate that both film thickness and misfit strains are important in determining the magnitude of magnetoelectric effect. Due to the strong strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling effect in film-on-substrate system with a ferromagnetic thin film directly growing on a thick ferroelectric substrate, precision electric control of local ferromagnetism, i. e. ferromagnetic domain pattern and domain wall properties, are achievable. The results show that the domain pattern of the ferroelectric substrate can be fully transferred onto the as-deposited ferromagnetic thin film. High stability of the magnetic domain is observed when the system is subjected to an external magnetic field. Under an applied electric field, the transferred domain pattern in magnetic film can be either maintained or erased depending on the direction of applied electric field. Moreover, when a pulse of in-plane electric field is applied, the magnetic domain wall motion can be observed in concurrence with the ferroelectric domain wall motion. With the decrease of material size, some effects that can be neglected in bulk materials may play an important role on the overall properties of material, such as flexoelectric effects which describe the induction of polarization from strain gradient. A two dimensional phase field model is adopted to study the influence of flexoelectric effects on the epitaxial ferroelectric films. A thermodynamic phenomenological model is then utilized to analyze the influence of flexoelectric effects on magnetic field induced electric polarization in the multiferroic nanocomposite bilayers. By decreasing the film thickness, the induced polarization from flexoelectric effects becomes more and more dominant and finally overcomes the electrostrictive induced polarization which is dominant when film thickness is large. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
