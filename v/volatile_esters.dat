40|$|Grape vineyards, {{especially}} in regions of mixed cereal and field crop production {{have historically been}} exposed to auxin-type herbicides, presumably {{from a combination of}} local spray drift and regional off-target movement. The combined efforts among affected grape and cereal grain commodity groups, regulatory agencies, and land grant university research has significantly reduced the severity and number of reported auxin-type herbicide injuries over the past fifty years. These efforts have lead to the banning of dust and <b>volatile</b> <b>ester</b> formulations, restricting the timing of low <b>volatile</b> <b>ester</b> formulations, and prohibiting applications when physical drift is likely. Unfortunately, episodic vine injuries from off-target herbicide movement remain severe and occasionally cause economic losses to the grape industry. Recent WSU air and vine injury monitoring programs further underscore the chronic nature of regional off-target movement of this class of herbicides to vineyards throughout the Columbia River and Walla Walla valleys. The auxin-type herbicides will remain important agrochemical tools for economically managing broadleaf weeds cereal grains and field crops. To minimize future injury to non-target sensitive crops, all stakeholders must continue to work together. Cooperation among commodity grower groups and policy harmonization among state agricultural departments in the Pacific Northwest should be encouraged. Meanwhile, applied field research should also continue to assist stakeholders in characterizing potential sources of local, regional, and long-range transport of chlorophenoxy herbicides and taking necessary steps to more effectively mitigate non-crop injury of these highly active herbicides...|$|R

The three yeasts showed similar growth kinetics and pH changes during fermentation. W. californica was the least sugar consumer. Many of the naturally occurring <b>volatiles</b> (ethyl <b>esters,</b> fatty acids, aldehydes, and terpenes) in the juice were partially or completely degraded. The three yeasts varied with their ability to produce and utilise <b>volatiles.</b> <b>Esters</b> were the major volatiles produced with some esters being catabolised while other esters remained stable. The amount of most alcohols increased while of aldehydes decreased. W. saturnus CBS 254 was the best producer of ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and 2 -phenethyl acetate, whereas W. californica NCYC 2590 was the highest producer of butyl acetate. Ethanol was produced in similar amounts by W. mrakii and W. saturnus but at a minimal level by W. californica.

Moreover, a model wine medium containing isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate and linalool was enriched with each extract at 100 mg/L, and stored in sealed bottles at 20 °C for 45 – 90 days. All samples were analysed for volatiles using SPME along with GC-MS analysis. Phenolic composition of wine extracts was determined using HPLC-DAD. No effect on the concentration of any volatiles was observed {{as a result of}} the addition of each extract in each wine or the model medium.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{establish}} the limiting factors affecting the biosynthesis of <b>volatile</b> <b>esters</b> present in virgin olive oil (VOO). Oil volatile fractions of the main Spanish olive cultivars, Arbequina and Picual, were analyzed. It was observed that acetate esters were the most abundant class of <b>volatile</b> <b>esters</b> in the oils, in concordance with the high content of acetyl-CoA found in olive fruit, and that the content of C 6 alcohols is limited for the synthesis of <b>volatile</b> <b>esters</b> during the production of VOO. Thus, the increase of C 6 alcohol availability during VOO production produced a significant increase of the corresponding ester in the oils in both cultivars at two different maturity stages. However, the increase of acetyl-CoA availability {{had no effect on}} the VOO volatile fraction. The low synthesis of these C 6 alcohols seems not to be due to a shortage of precursors or cofactors for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity because their increase during VOO production had no effect on the C 6 alcohol levels. The experimental findings are compatible with a deactivation of ADH activity during olive oil production in the cultivars under study. In this sense, a strong inhibition of olive ADH activity by compounds present in the different tissues of olive fruit has been observed. Â© 2012 American Chemical Society.

40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{responsible for}} postpollination changes in floral scent emission were investigated in snapdragon cv Maryland True Pink and petunia cv Mitchell flowers using a <b>volatile</b> <b>ester,</b> methylbenzoate, {{one of the}} major scent compounds emitted by these flowers, as an example. In both species, a 70 to 75 % pollination-induced decrease in methylbenzoate emission begins only after pollen tubes reach the ovary, a process that takes between 35 and 40 h in snapdragon and ∼ 32 h in petunia. This postpollination decrease in emission is not triggered by pollen deposition on the stigma. Petunia and snapdragon both synthesize methylbenzoate from benzoic acid and S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM); however, they use different mechanisms to downregulate its production after pollination. In petunia, expression of the gene responsible for methylbenzoate synthesis is suppressed by ethylene. In snapdragon, the decrease in methylbenzoate emission {{is the result of a}} decrease in both S-adenosyl-l-methionine:benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BAMT) activity and the ratio of SAM to S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (“methylation index”) after pollination, although the BAMT gene also is sensitive to ethylene...|$|R

Cold storage of pawpaw seems limited to 4 weeks at 4 °C. A study of several cultivars with commercial appeal showed that ripening traits such as ethylene production, respiration and loss of firmness were similar in all genotypes, and that no cultivar showed superior responses to cold storage.

We chose an understudied cross kingdom interaction to experimentally evaluate the effect of fruit infection by fungi on both vertebrate (mammals and birds) fruit preferences and on ecologically relevant fruit traits (volatile compounds, toughness, etc). Our well-replicated field experiments revealed that, in contrast to previous studies, frugivorous mammals and birds consistently preferred infested over intact fruits. This was concordant with the higher level of attractive <b>volatiles</b> (<b>esters,</b> ethanol) in infested fruits.
