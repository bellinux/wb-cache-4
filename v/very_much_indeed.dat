5|$|The biographer Montague Haltrecht {{suggests}} that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext {{to abandon the}} Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden. However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed.</b> He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged {{that he had had}} a lucky escape, as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|... "I like Lloyd Bentsen <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed,</b> I was sad when he resigned. He's a real {{marvelous}} politician, {{a person}} of great dignity, a person we can look up to respect and like as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Long ago the Indians {{were forced}} into Indian Territory, because it was land the white man did not then want. Then oil was found, and the white man wanted it <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed.</b> But now they could not force the Indian to leave, they had to pay him for the oil. They gave him money for the oil, then cheated {{him out of the}} money." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'He'd be <b>very</b> <b>much</b> flattered <b>indeed</b> by your {{interposition}} on his behalf, no doubt, Popsy; but I'm {{afraid it}} wouldn't produce much effect upon his ultimate decision.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am," [...] said Austin. [...] "In fact, I'm <b>very</b> <b>much</b> so, <b>indeed.</b> You see, I had {{practically}} nothing on, {{and he got}} his festering arms round me." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1974, after {{reviewing}} company documents about Midland Works, a T {{public relations officer}} wrote: [...] "I hope <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed</b> that we are never called upon to discuss Armley in the public arena." [...] In 1978, however, Leeds City Council informed T that the factory was still [...] "badly contaminated" [...] with asbestos, with dust found in the basement, lift shaft, roof, ventilation shafts and beneath the floors. Hessian sacks containing asbestos fibre were still present, and the yard was filled with 'a few hundred tonnes' of blue asbestos waste mixed with soil. R.D. Lunt, T's Safety and Environment manager, wrote of the factory basement: [...] "Every nook and cranny has asbestos fibre in it". T contributed Â£15,000 towards the clean-up of the factory, and claimed they were doing so out of [...] "a moral, not a legal responsibility" [...] to do so. The surrounding houses and buildings {{were not included in}} this operation, and Leeds City Council and T [...] "agreed to keep the whole matter 'low-key' if approached by the media," [...] while a T internal memo stated [...] "The Principal Inspector of Factories and the Assistant Director of Environmental Health are anxious to play this down and have given us considerable support." ...|$|E

60|$|Rollo {{would not}} {{take it away from}} Nathan, though he wanted it <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary, I {{have but}} little to think of,--and my {{thoughts}} must be <b>very</b> <b>much</b> engaged, <b>indeed,</b> when they shall be too full to admit of my seeing you." ...|$|R
60|$|Tom {{had never}} opened his lips; {{so he was}} <b>very</b> <b>much</b> taken aback <b>indeed.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> so, <b>indeed,</b> sir,' {{said the}} powdered-headed footman, taking Sam's remarks {{as a high}} compliment. 'Very <b>much</b> so <b>indeed.</b> Do you do {{anything}} in this way, Sir?' inquired the tall footman, producing a small snuff-box with a fox's head {{on the top of}} it.|$|R
60|$|Simon Cheyneys {{seemed to}} mind <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed,</b> for he swelled in silence while Puck laughed.|$|E
60|$|Jonas {{enjoyed this}} joke <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed.</b> It was quite in his {{peculiar}} vein of humour.|$|E
60|$|Plorn's {{admission}} {{that he likes}} the school <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed,</b> is the great social triumph of modern times.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, oh no. Business is all right. Nothing is the matter." [...] And {{ended by}} convincing her that {{something}} was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> wrong <b>indeed.</b> And she grieved in silence, not daring to question him further.|$|R
60|$|This he swore, {{trembling}} sorely, {{for he was}} <b>very</b> <b>much</b> afraid. Nor, <b>indeed,</b> did he reveal them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> so <b>indeed,</b> my Lady!" [...] the Professor hastily replied, unconsciously {{rubbing his}} ear, while some painful {{recollection}} seemed to cross his mind. [...] "I was very forcibly struck by His Magnificence, I assure you!" ...|$|R
60|$|Well, the King {{would do}} that, only let her make haste, for {{he wanted it}} <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mary Bell and Bella {{looked at}} the desk which Mary Erskine had {{prepared}} for them, and liked it <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I am Lady Clavering's daughter--you {{have heard}} of Sir Francis Clavering? And I wish <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed</b> to see Fanny Bolton." ...|$|E
6000|$|If any {{one were}} to ask me (which is highly unlikely) 'In what {{university}} would an intelligent young man do best to study?' I think I should be <b>very</b> <b>much</b> inclined <b>indeed</b> to answer offhand, 'In the Tropics.' ...|$|R
60|$|During {{the course}} of his inventive life Roland Clewe had become {{accustomed}} to disappointments; he was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> afraid, <b>indeed,</b> that he was beginning to expect them. If that really happened, there would be an end to his career.|$|R
60|$|Algernon. But why {{on earth}} did you break it off? What had I done? I had done nothing at all. Cecily, I am <b>very</b> <b>much</b> hurt <b>indeed</b> to hear you broke it off. Particularly when the weather was so charming.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] {{continued}} Red Shirt, {{removing his}} wide-awake, and looking steadily at his companions, [...] "I must have changed <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed</b> when two of my--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{sounds like}} a remark made to open the way to conversation." [...] Jeff went on to burlesque a reply in the same spirit. [...] "Oh, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> so <b>indeed,</b> Miss Lynde! We are all {{looking forward to it}} so eagerly. Are you coming?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> so <b>indeed.</b> Open {{carriages}} are nasty things. A clean gown is {{not five}} minutes' wear in them. You are splashed {{getting in and}} getting out; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction. I hate an open carriage myself." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{all very}} well for Tommy to {{disclaim}} credit {{for what he had}} done; but the glad triumphant expression of his face, and his firm erect gait, proved that he was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> satisfied <b>indeed</b> with the share he had had in that night's adventure.|$|R
6000|$|L. You {{would like}} it <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed,</b> Florrie, if you were there. The serpents would not bite you; the only fear would be of your turning into one! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>indeed,</b> sir. But {{will you}} kindly choose for me? I have read but few English books, for {{of course in}} France my reading was entirely French." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{account of}} Mr Gowan's {{painting}} Papa's picture (which I am not quite convinced I {{should have known}} from the likeness if I had not seen him doing it), I have had more opportunities of being with her since then than I might have had without this fortunate chance. She is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alone. <b>Very</b> <b>much</b> alone <b>indeed.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was {{her best}} bit of phrasing and it pleased Benham <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> But, <b>indeed,</b> {{it was not}} her own phrasing, she had culled it from a disquisition into which she had led Mr. Rathbone-Sanders, and she had sent it to Benham as she might have sent him a flower.|$|R
6000|$|He was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> admired <b>indeed.</b> [...] "He is as {{beautiful}} as a weathercock," [...] remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; [...] "only not quite so useful," [...] he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.|$|R
