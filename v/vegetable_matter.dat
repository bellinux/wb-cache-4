40|$|Stomach {{contents}} of Mogera wogura wogura were studied based on 125 specimens trapped at the Hanno Golf Course, Hanno City, Saitama Prefecture. The contents were sorted {{into the following}} food items: animal <b>matters,</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>matters</b> and others. Number of stomachs containing each food item was given for four seasonal periods, spring (March to May), summer (June to August), autumn (September to November) and winter (December to February). The results obtained were as follows: Insects and earthworms were the main foods of the moles. The ocourrence rate of Formicidae (adult) was the highest and Scarabaeidae (larvae) was the second. The number of stomachs containing the larvae of Scarabaeidae was found in winter and spring in plenty, but that of the adults was seen in summer and autumn, {{and that of the}} hairs of M. w. wogura as a mass was often found in winter and spring. Namely, because these seasons were breeding seasons of the moles they seemed to fight with each other. And hairs found thin in each stomachs in summer and autumn seemed to be swallowed in case of grooming. All <b>vegetable</b> <b>matters</b> were found as fibers in the stomachs in summer. Sand and soil were found in most of the stomachs. They seemed to be swallowed with other foods, moreover they might have come out of the intestines of earthworms. 埼玉県飯能市の飯能ゴルフ場において採集した 125 個体のアズマモグラの胃内容物を調査した。 1. アズマモグラの主要食物は昆虫類と貧毛類であった。 2. 昆虫類のうち出現頻度は、アリ科の成虫が最も大きく、次にコガネムシ科の幼虫であった。 3. コガネムシ科の幼虫を含む胃は冬と春に、また成虫を含む胃は夏と秋によく認められた。 4. 貧毛類を含む胃は冬と春によく認められたが、夏と秋にはあまり認められなかった。 5. アズマモグラの毛を含む胃は、とくに冬と春によく認められ、しかもかたまりとして存在していた。この時期は本種の繁殖期にあたるため、モグラどおしの闘争があったと考えられた。そして夏と秋には、わずかの毛が少数の胃内に認められたのみで、グルーミング等によって呑みこまれたものと考えられた。 6. 植物質は、胃内にあっては全て繊維状を呈しており、これを含む胃は夏期に多くみられた。 7. 大部分の胃内には土砂が認められたが、これは他の食物とともに不意に呑みこまれたと思われるが、土砂の一部はミミズの消化管内のものも含まれていると考えられた...|$|R

5|$|Flea larvae {{emerge from}} the eggs to feed on any {{available}} organic material such as dead insects, faeces, conspecific eggs, and <b>vegetable</b> <b>matter.</b> In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of larvae to mature, whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all larvae to mature. Another study also showed that 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs. They are blind and avoid sunlight, keeping to dark, humid places such as sand or soil, cracks and crevices, under carpets and in bedding.|$|E
5|$|The Mecoptera {{are closely}} related to the Siphonaptera (fleas), and a little more distantly to the Diptera (true flies). They are {{somewhat}} fly-like in appearance, being small to medium-sized insects with long slender bodies and narrow membranous wings. Most breed in moist environments such as leaf litter or moss, and the eggs may not hatch until the wet season arrives. The larvae are caterpillar-like and mostly feed on <b>vegetable</b> <b>matter,</b> and the non-feeding pupae may pass through a diapause until favourable weather conditions occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} {{is both a}} {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with a diet that varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>matter</b> forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden rain tree Cassia fistula.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea was}} officially {{adopted by the}} Health of Towns Commission, and various schemes (known as sewage farms) were trialled by {{different}} municipalities over the next 50 years. At first, the heavier solids were channeled into ditches {{on the side of}} the farm and were covered over when full, but soon flat-bottomed tanks were employed as reservoirs for the sewage; the earliest patent was taken out by William Higgs in 1846 for [...] "tanks or reservoirs in which the contents of sewers and drains from cities, towns and villages are to be collected and the solid animal or <b>vegetable</b> <b>matters</b> therein contained, solidified and dried..." [...] Improvements to the design of the tanks included the introduction of the horizontal-flow tank in the 1850s and the radial-flow tank in 1905. These tanks had to be manually de-sludged periodically, until the introduction of automatic mechanical de-sludgers in the early 1900s.|$|R
5|$|The red-billed chough's food {{consists}} {{largely of}} insects, spiders and other invertebrates {{taken from the}} ground, with ants probably being the most significant item. The Central Asian subspecies P. p. centralis will perch {{on the backs of}} wild or domesticated mammals to feed on parasites. Although invertebrates make up most of the chough's diet, it will eat <b>vegetable</b> <b>matter</b> including fallen grain, and in the Himalayas has been reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn.

5|$|C. lepophagus was {{a similar}} in weight to modern coyotes, but had shorter limb bones that {{indicates}} a less cursorial lifestyle. The coyote represents a more primitive form of Canis than the gray wolf, {{as shown by}} its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws, which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey in which wolves specialize. This is further corroborated by the coyote's sagittal crest, which is low or totally flattened, thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf's. The coyote is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is, {{as shown by the}} larger chewing surfaces on the molars, reflecting the species' relative dependence on <b>vegetable</b> <b>matter.</b> In these respects, the coyote resembles the fox-like progenitors of the genus more so than the wolf.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the larval stage is long and adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, <b>vegetable</b> <b>matter,</b> fungi and, {{in the case of}} parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E
40|$|A {{granuloma}} is {{an organized}} and compact mass of mature mononuclear phagocytes. Granulomas {{are reported to}} form in various organs and sites of the body. Granulomas in stomach are rarely encountered. Foreign body granulomas are formed {{as a result of}} reaction of the tissues to a foreign body which is immunologically inert. Food granuloma is type of foreign body granuloma which is formed in response to food particles like <b>vegetable</b> <b>matters</b> or cereals. These granulomas can be distinguished from other types of granulomas with ease because of their characteristic morphologic features. We report the case of a 29 -year-old male who developed a large gastric ulcer as a result of foreign body-induced giant cell reaction, which was probably of vegetative origin. He was treated with the regimen for Helicobacter pylori, rabeprazole and sucralfate. This treatment resulted in partial healing of the ulcer with persistence of food granuloma; hence, the patient was referred for surgery...|$|R

5|$|In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, golden jackals {{primarily}} hunt hares and mouse-like rodents, {{and also}} pheasants, francolins, ducks, coots, moorhens, and passerines. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>matter</b> eaten by jackals {{in these areas}} includes fruits, such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood, and the cones of common medlars. The jackal is implicated {{in the destruction of}} grape, watermelon, muskmelon, and nut crops. Near the Vakhsh River, their spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild sugar cane, while during winter they feed on wild stony olives. Around the edges of the Karakum Desert, jackals feed on gerbils, lizards, snakes, fish, muskrats, the fruits of wild stony olives, mulberry, dried apricots, watermelons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and grapes.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes {{are usually}} {{together}} in pairs or small groups consisting of families, {{such as a}} mated pair and their young, or a male with several females having kinship ties.

The species primarily feeds on small rodents, though it may also target rabbits, game birds, reptiles, invertebrates and young ungulates. Fruit and <b>vegetable</b> <b>matter</b> is also eaten sometimes. Although the red fox tends to kill smaller predators, including other fox species, it is vulnerable to attack from larger predators, such as wolves, coyotes, golden jackals and medium- and large-sized felines.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} grains were rye, barley, buckwheat, millet and oats. Rice {{remained}} a fairly expensive import {{for most of}} the Middle Ages and was grown in northern Italy only {{towards the end of the}} period. Wheat was common all over Europe and was considered to be the most nutritious of all grains, but was more prestigious and thus more expensive. The finely sifted white flour that modern Europeans are most familiar with was reserved for the bread of the upper classes. As one descended the social ladder, bread became coarser, darker, and its bran content increased. In times of grain shortages or outright famine, grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like chestnuts, dried legumes, acorns, ferns, and a wide variety of more or less nutritious <b>vegetable</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Frank {{was born}} at Horfield near Bristol and was educated at Marcy, near Lille in France and later King's College School. He went to study at the Royal School of Mines in London where he won the Frankland prize of the Institute of Chemistry. With a keen {{interest}} in the study of geology, he joined the British North Borneo Company as a mineral explorer and set off on his first expedition, leaving London in August 1881. He reached Labuan in October and Abai in November. He explored the Sequati and Kurina rivers before recouping at Singapore and in the summer of 1882 he visited the Labuk river followed by Kinoram district. He was killed when his gun, tangled in the forest, went off while pursuing an elephant. Frank had been extremely interested in exploration, with a knowledge of local dialects and well read on the works of earlier explorers. After his death, his body was brought by several days of canoe journey on the Kinabatangan River to Elopura. An enquiry pointed to accidental death and he was buried at Sandakan cemetery.Frank's publications included a note on The Adventures of a Drop of Thames Water to the Whitehall Review and two papers- On the Action of Bacteria on Various Gases, and On the Influence of Intermittent Filtration through Sand and Spongy Iron on Animal and <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Matters</b> dissolved in Water, and the Reduction of Nitrates by savage and other agents.|$|R

The insects spin silk by moving their forelegs {{back and forth over}} the substrate, and rotating their bodies to create a cylindrical, silk-lined tunnel. Older galleries have multiple laminate layers of silk. Each gallery complex contains a number of individuals, often descended from a single female, and forms a complex maze-like structure, extending from a secure retreat into whatever <b>vegetable</b> food <b>matter</b> is available nearby. The size and complexity of the colony varies between species, and they can be very extensive in those species that live in hot and humid climates.|$|R
