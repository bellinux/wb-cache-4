50|$|An exhaust hood, {{extractor}} hood, or {{range hood}} is a device containing a mechanical fan that hangs above the stove or cooktop in the kitchen. It removes airborne grease, combustion products, fumes, smoke, odors, heat, and steam {{from the air}} by evacuation of the air <b>and</b> <b>filtration.</b> In commercial kitchens exhaust hoods are often used in combination with fire suppression devices so that fumes from a grease fire are properly <b>vented</b> <b>and</b> the fire is put out quickly. Commercial vent hoods may also be combined with a fresh air fan that draws in exterior air, circulating it with the cooking fumes, which is then drawn out by the hood.|$|R
40|$|Upon {{their initial}} discovery, {{hydrothermal}} <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> methane seeps {{were considered to}} be related but distinct ecosystems, with different distributions, geomorphology, temperatures, geochemical properties and mostly different species. However, subsequently discovered <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seep systems have blurred this distinction. Here, we report on a composite, hydrothermal seep ecosystem at a subducting seamount on the convergent Costa Rica margin that represents an intermediate between <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep ecosystems. Diffuse flow of shimmering, warm fluids with high methane concentrations supports a mixture of microbes, animal species, assemblages and trophic pathways with <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep affinities. Their coexistence reinforces the continuity of reducing environments and exemplifies a setting conducive to interactive evolution of <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep biota...|$|R
40|$|Deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> cold seeps are submarine springs where nutrient-rich fluids {{emanate from}} the sea floor. <b>Vent</b> <b>and</b> seep ecosystems occur {{in a variety of}} geological settings throughout the global ocean and support food webs based on chemoautotrophic primary production. Most <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep invertebrates arrive at suitable habitats as larvae dispersed by deep-ocean currents. The recent evolution of many <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep invertebrate species (< 100 million years ago) suggests that Cenozoic tectonic history and oceanic circulation patterns have been important in defining contemporary biogeographic patterns. <br/...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{limitations}} to understanding the evolutionary history of hydrothermal <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> cold seep communities is the identification of tube fossils from ancient deposits. Tube-dwelling annelids {{are some of the}} most conspicuous inhabitants of modern <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep ecosystems, <b>and</b> ancient <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tubular fossils are usually considered to have been made by annelids. However, the taxonomic affinities of many tube fossils from <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps are contentious, or have remained largely undetermined due to difficulties in identification. In this study, we employ a detailed chemical (FTIR and pyrolysis gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry) and morphological assessment of modern annelid tubes from six families, and fossil tubes (seven tube types from the Cenozoic, 12 Mesozoic, and four Palaeozoic) from hydrothermal <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> cold seep environments. Characters identified from the above investigations were used to, for the first time, explore the systematics of ancient <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tubes within a cladistic framework. Results reveal details of the compositions and ultrastructure of modern tubes, and also suggest that two types of tubes from ancient vent localities were made by the annelid family Siboglinidae which often dominates modern <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps. Our results also highlight that many <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tube fossils formerly thought to be annelids cannot be assigned an annelid affiliation with any certainty. The findings overall improve the level of quality control with regard to interpretations of fossil tubes, and most importantly, suggest that siboglinids likely occupied Mesozoic <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps, greatly increasing the minimum age of the clade relative to earlier molecular estimates...|$|R
40|$|Problems {{with the}} {{identification}} of tubular fossils from ancient hydrothermal <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> cold seep deposits have hindered understanding of the evolutionary history of <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep communities. This thesis aims to (1) improve knowledge of lesser-studied tubicolous annelids occupying <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps, (2) study the diversity of tubes at <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps, (3) investigate the fossilisation of tubes within modern <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps, (4) better interpret the fossil record, and (5) provide insights into the palaeoecology these environments. Results presented here on investigations of Sclerolinum contortum, a species belonging to a little- studied genus of the major vent/seep dwelling annelid family Siboglinidae, demonstrate that it exhibits tube morphological plasticity, wide habitat preferences and a global distribution spanning the Arctic to the Southern Ocean. These results also suggest that this species has dispersed throughout this range using chemosynthetic habitats as stepping stones. A detailed investigation of the full mineralisation process of Alvinella (Alvinellidae) tubes at modern hydrothermal vents shows that these tubes are fossilised by pyrite and silica that template organic tube layers, and that microorganisms living on tube surfaces are also exceptionally well-preserved alongside the tubes. No known ancient vent tube fossils resemble mineralised Alvinella tubes. A major morphological and compositional comparison of both modern and fossil tubes from <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps revealed that two fossil tube types from the Mesozoic were likely made by vestimentiferans (Siboglinidae), suggesting that this major <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep annelid lineage has a longer history within <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps than proposed by molecular clock age estimates. This analysis also demonstrates the need for greater caution in assigning affinities to fossil <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tubes. Finally, this thesis reports the remarkable preservation of filamentous microorganisms {{on the walls of}} Silurian vent tube fossils, giving the first insights into ecological associations between microbes and metazoans within the oldest known hydrothermal vent community...|$|R

40|$|The review compiles, for {{the first}} time, data on the {{communities}} at 62 shallow-water hydrothermal <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> cold seep sites. ‘Shallow sites’ are defined as sites no deeper than 200 m. The communities at these sites are also compared with communities in reducing sediments at similar depths. Below 200 m, <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep obligate species tend to dominate the fauna living in areas where reducing fluids are released from the seabed. At the shallow sites, <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep obligate species of fauna are rare, only eight having being reported from shallow vents. No definite seep obligates have been found. Shallow <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps are colonized by communities that consist of {{a subset of the}} background fauna, especially those species that are less sensitive to hydrogen sulphide toxicity.
