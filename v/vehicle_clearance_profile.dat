40|$|In vitro {{studies were}} {{designed}} to investigate the influence of peak drug concentration (Cmax), the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and, consequently, the trough concentration on the bactericidal effects of gentamicin against Enterobacter cloacae (MIC, 0. 5 mg/liter) by simulating bolus versus infusion administration and bolus dosing with altered drug clearance. Bacteria in the lag phase were exposed to gentamicin concentration-time profiles modelling either bolus or infusion dosing (AUC constant, Cmax changing) with 30 -min postdose peak concentrations (Cpeak 30) of 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/liter or bolus dosing with normal and double drug clearance (Cmax constant, AUC changing) corresponding to normal <b>clearance</b> <b>profiles</b> with Cpeak 30 of 6 and 8 mg/liter. Exposure to gentamicin caused early bactericidal effects apparent by 2 h, followed by variable bacteriostatic and recovery phases. Exposure to bolus profiles resulted in greater bactericidal activity than the corresponding infusion profile up to a Cpeak 30 of 8 mg/liter. At a Cpeak 30 of 10 mg/liter, {{there were no differences}} in bactericidal effect. Double <b>clearance</b> <b>profiles</b> had a reduced bactericidal effect at 6 mg/liter compared to the corresponding normal <b>clearance</b> <b>profile,</b> but no differences in bactericidal effect were observed for 8 -mg/liter double and normal <b>clearance</b> <b>profiles.</b> These results suggest that the initial exposure (i. e., 0 to 30 min) is a more important determinant for bacterial killing than the AUC or trough concentration for this bacterium. Subject to confirmation of these findings with other gram-negative bacteria, to optimize aminoglycoside efficacy the initial exposure (Cmax) should be maximized by giving higher doses or bolus administration at intervals which may not produce detectable trough concentrations. Clinical trials with a broad range of patients, especially those with higher clearance, would confirm these in vitro observations and define optimal dosing recommendations...|$|R

FRI- 144 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Functional cure {{in chronic}} hepatitis B requires HBV DNA negativity, HBsAg loss and anti-HBs seroconversion. ARC- 520 RNAi drug therapy targets cccDNA derived mRNA, including the full-length HBsAg transcript. Using a 19 plex anti-HBs panel to map HBsAg epitopes, {{we have developed}} a predictive algorithm of an HBsAg <b>clearance</b> <b>profile</b> in patients undergoing HBsAg loss during tenofovir therapy, defined as reduced recognition at loop 1 and loop 2 HBsAg “a” determinant epitopes. Complimentary to this, we have developed assays to detect co-existing complexed anti-HBs (with HBsAg), and analysed the ARC- 520 cohorts {{with the aim of}} evaluating the impact of RNAi therapy on HBsAg loss, the identification of an HBsAg <b>clearance</b> <b>profile</b> and the development of co-existing anti-HBs...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} static and dynamic effects plays a key–role {{in the field}} of rotor {{dynamics}} to evaluate the behavior of hydrodynamic bearings. This paper describes an experimental apparatus and the procedure for measuring the static eccentricities and the bearing clearance distribution in a five–pads tilting pad journal bearing (TPJB). The tests have been carried out on a five– pads TPJB with nominal diameter of 100 mm, length–to– diameter ratio (L/D) of 0. 7 and load–on–pad (LOP) configuration. The results show that the <b>clearance</b> <b>profile,</b> with a pentagon–shape, {{is a function of the}} operating temperature and of the pad dimensions. Besides, the barycenter of the <b>clearance</b> <b>profile</b> is very close to the equilibrium position of the journal center at low rotational speeds.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{investigation of the}} effects of a nonuniform tip <b>clearance</b> <b>profile</b> on the performance and flow field in a centrifugal compressor with a vaneless diffuser. This study focuses in particular on the magnitude and location of the wake. Six impellers with different tip <b>clearance</b> <b>profiles</b> were tested in the flow simulations. The accuracy of the numerical simulations was assessed by comparing the experimental data with the computational results for a system characterized by the original tip clearance. Although the performance improved for low tip clearances, a low tip clearance at the trailing edge improved the compressor performance more significantly than a low tip clearance at the leading edge. The flow field calculated for a system characterized by a low tip clearance at the trailing edge produced a more uniform velocity distribution both in the circumferential and in the axial directions at the impeller exit because the wake magnitude was reduced. As a consequence, this impeller provided a better potential for diffusion processes inside a vaneless diffuser...|$|R

We have further shown that anti-TAR PNA (PNATAR) conjugated with cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) is rapidly taken up by cells and exhibits strong antiviral and anti-HIV- 1 virucidal activities. Here, we pharmacokinetically analyzed 125 I-labeled PNATAR conjugated with two CPPs: a 16 -mer penetratin derived from antennapedia and a 13 -mer Tat peptide derived from HIV- 1 Tat. We administered the 125 I-labeled PNATAR–CPP conjugates to male Balb/C mice through intraperitoneal or gavage routes. The naked 125 I-labeled PNATAR {{was used as a}} control. Following a single administration of the labeled compounds, their distribution and retention in various organs were monitored at various time points. Regardless of the administration route, a significant accumulation of each PNATAR-CPP conjugate was found in different mouse organs and tissues. The <b>clearance</b> <b>profile</b> of the accumulated radioactivity from different organs displayed a biphasic exponential pathway whereby part of the radioactivity cleared rapidly, but a significant portion of it was slowly released over a prolonged period. The kinetics of clearance of individual PNATAR-CPP conjugates slightly varied in different organs, while the overall biphasic clearance pattern remained unaltered regardless of the administration route. Surprisingly, unconjugated naked PNATAR displayed a similar distribution and <b>clearance</b> <b>profile</b> in most organs studied although extent of its uptake was lower than the PNATAR-CPP conjugates...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} influence of the load direction on the characteristics of a five-pad tilting-pad journal bearing (TPJB) is investigated. An analysis is performed for a TPJB using a non- nominal geometry, that is, with a different preload factor for each pad. The analytical results are then compared with the experimental measurements for a real bearing having pads with different geometries due to manufacturing errors. The results show that the load direction has considerable effects on both the static and dynamic characteristics of the TPJB. A robust estimation method is introduced for the calculation of experimental dynamic coefficients.

30|$|We have {{developed}} an automated synthesis for radiotracer [18 F]DCFPyL based on a direct radiofluorination synthesis route. We demonstrated that [18 F]DCFPyL can be prepared in good radiochemical yields and pharmaceutical quality suitable for clinical applications for PSMA imaging in humans. The automated synthesis based on direct radiofluorination should improve availability of [18 F]DCFPyL for PSMA imaging in humans. Dynamic PET imaging of [18 F]DCFPyL in PSMA+ LNCaP and PSMA− PC 3 tumor-bearing mice confirmed the previously reported data describing high PSMA-mediated tumor uptake and favorable <b>clearance</b> <b>profile</b> of the radiotracer. Compartmental model analysis points to a two-step molecular trapping process based on PSMA binding and subsequent internalization leading to retention of radioactivity in PSMA+ LNCaP tumors. These findings further underline the excellent characteristics of [18 F]DCFPyL for PET imaging of PSMA in vivo.|$|R
30|$|IC 50 {{values of}} various {{selective}} COX- 2 inhibitors towards COX- 2 inhibition such as celecoxib (40  nM, determined {{in the same}} assay as Pyricoxib [24]), SC 58125 (10  nM [29]), and rofecoxib (18 – 26  nM [30]) confirm that Pyricoxib displays COX- 2 inhibitory potency comparable or higher to that of selected COX- 2 inhibitors used as blocking agents in this study. Based on its pharmacological properties, [18 F]Pyricoxib meets two basic requirements for a successful PET imaging agents—high metabolic stability and high inhibitory potency and selectivity for the target in the nanomolar range. Data on muscle <b>clearance</b> <b>profile</b> of [18 F]Pyricoxib as reference for non-target tissue clearance suggest that an optimal imaging time window for [18 F]Pyricoxib would be at 120  min p.i. or longer rather than 60  min p.i.|$|R

40|$|When inhaled {{nanoparticles}} deposit in the lungs, they transit through {{respiratory tract}} lining fluid (RTLF) acquiring a biomolecular corona reflecting {{the interaction of}} the RTLF with the nanomaterial surface. Label-free snapshot proteomics was used to generate semi-quantitative profiles of corona proteins formed around silica (SiO 2) and poly(vinyl) acetate (PVAc) nanoparticles in RTLF, the latter employed as an archetype drug delivery vehicle. The evolved PVAc corona was significantly enriched compared to that observed on SiO 2 nanoparticles (698 vs. 429 proteins identified); however both coronas contained a substantial contribution from innate immunity proteins, including surfactant protein A, napsin A and complement (C 1 q and C 3) proteins. Functional protein classification supports the hypothesis that corona formation in RTLF constitutes opsonisation, preparing particles for phagocytosis and clearance from the lungs. These data highlight how an understanding of the evolved corona is necessary for the design of inhaled nanomedicines with acceptable safety and tailored <b>clearance</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{develop a}} {{maturation}} function for drug glucuronidation in children, {{that can be}} used in population and physiologically based modeling approaches, the physiological and physicochemical basis of a semiphysiological glucuronidation function for children was untangled using Simcyp. The results show that using the currently available in vitro data, in vivo morphine and zidovudine clearances were under predicted by the physiologically based model in Simcyp. The maturation profile was similar to the clinically observed profile except for the first 2 weeks of life, and liver size and UGT 2 B 7 ontogeny are the physiological drivers of the maturation of glucuronidation. Physicochemical drug parameters did not affect this maturation profile, although log P and pKa influenced the absolute value of clearance. The results suggest that the semiphysiological glucuronidation function for young children can be used to predict the developmental <b>clearance</b> <b>profile</b> of other UGT 2 B 7 substrates, though scenarios with nonlinear kinetics and high-extraction ratios require further investigation...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of molecularly targeted probes that exhibit high biostability, biocompatibility, and efficient <b>clearance</b> <b>profiles</b> {{is key to}} optimizing biodistribution and transport across biological barriers. Further, coupling probes designed to meet these criteria with high-sensitivity, quantitative imaging strategies is mandatory for ensuring early in vivo tumor detection and timely treatment response. These challenges have often only been examined individually, impeding the clinical translation of fluorescent probes. By simultaneously optimizing these design criteria, we created {{a new generation of}} near-infrared fluorescent core-shell silica-based nanoparticles (C dots) tuned to hydrodynamic diameters of 3. 3 and 6. 0 nm with improved photophysical characteristics over the parent dye. A neutral organic coating prevented adsorption of serum proteins and facilitated efficient urinary excretion.
