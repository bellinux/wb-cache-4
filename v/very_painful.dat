5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends {{into some of the}} underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often <b>very</b> <b>painful.</b> Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Malvern Hill on 1 July 1862, Brandon's {{ankle joint}} {{was struck by}} a ball. As he fell, his hand hit a rolling shell which did not explode. Oblivious to his wounds, Brandon tried to rise again but he fell once more and {{remained}} on the field until men were able to pick him up and carry him to the rear. Because there was no visible bleeding, Brandon thought that his injuries were not serious but was taken on horse-back to a hospital. Initially, Brandon was offered whiskey which would have eased the pain, but he refused to drink it without water and sugar. He drank it only after being convinced it was necessary. Brandon's foot was removed after a torniquet was put in place. Brandon's arteries were then sewn in what was likely to be a <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> procedure, as there was not enough choloroform to produce a full anesthesia. To replace his amputated leg, his doctors gave him a wooden prosthetic leg. Because of Brandon's age, his doctors thought his chances of survival were slight. After coming to Richmond, he was tended to by friends and his servant. Confederate President Jefferson Davis even offered Brandon the hospitality of his mansion in the city.|$|E
5|$|M.regularis is {{a highly}} {{aggressive}} ant that will pursue any intruder to a distance of 1.8–2.7 metres (2–3 yards) if their nests are disturbed. Their stings are <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> and particularly powerful. In some cases, human victims of M.regularis bites have displayed an allergy to the venom. In a 2011 study which investigated the causes of ant sting anaphylaxis in Australia, 265 of the 376 human participants reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, nine serum samples taken from patients were IgE positive to the venom of M.regularis. These ants are both diurnal and nocturnal, foraging on the trunks of Eucalyptus trees to feed on sap and nectar, or capturing small insects (such as caterpillars and ants in the genus Camponotus or subgenus Orthocrema). The larvae are carnivorous and exclusively feed on insects, either consuming small portions of the insect or all of it. Unlike most Myrmecia species, trophallaxis takes place among adults or between adults and larvae. All stages of the frog Metacrinia nichollsi are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies, where they use several galleries constructed by the ants. The parasitic ant M.inquilina may attempt to enter M.regularis nests to establish colonies, but M.inquilina queens may be seized and killed {{as soon as the}} two species come into contact.|$|E

30|$|Careful {{clinical}} examination [18], transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) [19], rectal endoscopic sonography [20], transvaginal sonography, barium enema, and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) [21] have all been recommended to identify deep rectovaginal endometriotic lesions [22]. In our series, examination with a speculum revealed either a normal vaginal mucosa or a protruded bluish nodule in the posterior fornix. By palpation, {{the diameter of the}} lesion could be evaluated. Palpation is <b>very</b> often <b>painful,</b> and the presence of a nodule accounts for symptoms like deep dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea.|$|R
40|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is a <b>very</b> common <b>painful</b> syndrome, but its exact etiology {{still remains}} obscure. The diagnosis is essentially clinical, based on history-taking and physical examination. Complementary laboratory tests and imaging examinations {{may be useful}} for differential diagnoses. The treatment is essentially conservative, with a high success rate (around 90 %). The essence of the conservative treatment is the home-based program of exercises to stretch the plantar fascia. Indications for surgical treatment are only made when the symptoms persist without significant improvement, after {{at least six months}} of conservative treatment supervised directly by the doctor...|$|R

25|$|Eastern {{yellow jackets}} destroy many insects that consume {{cultivated}} and ornamental plants, providing {{a valuable service}} to humans. They can, however, {{be a source of}} irritation when their nests are located near homes. They are adept at stinging, especially if the nest is threatened.

25|$|The {{sulfanilamide}} compound is {{more active}} in the protonated form. The drug has very low solubility and sometimes can crystallize in the kidneys, due to its first pKa of around 10.

5000|$|One {{form the}} rashes take is called [...] "heliotrope" [...] (a purplish color) or lilac, {{but may also}} be red. It can occur around the eyes along with swelling, but also occurs on the upper chest or back {{what is called the}} [...] "shawl" [...] (around the neck) or [...] "V-sign" [...] above the breasts and may also occur on the face, upper arms, thighs, or hands. [...] Another form the rash takes is called Gottron's sign which are red, {{sometimes}} scaly, papules that erupt on any of the finger joints (the metacarpophalangeal joints or the interphalangeal joints). [...] All these rashes are made worse by exposure to sunlight, and are often <b>very</b> itchy, <b>painful,</b> and may bleed.|$|R
25|$|Some {{species of}} centipedes can be {{hazardous}} to humans {{because of their}} bite. Although a bite to an adult human is usually <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> and may cause severe swelling, chills, fever, and weakness, {{it is unlikely to}} be fatal. Bites can be dangerous to small children and those with allergies to bee stings. The venomous bite of larger centipedes can induce anaphylactic shock in such people. Smaller centipedes are generally incapable of piercing human skin.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{disorder}} of a temporomandibular joint is disc displacement.

This, as explained above, is usually <b>very</b> <b>painful,</b> because unlike these adjacent tissues, the central portion of the disc contains no sensory innervation.|$|E
