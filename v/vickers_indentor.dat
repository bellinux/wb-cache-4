40|$|Abstract [...] Al-Pb monoetectic alloys with {{different}} compositions were rapidly solidified from melt using chill-block melt –spin technique. The rapidly solidified ribbons were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The {{results showed that}} the structures of all melt-spun ribbons were completely composed two distinct phases of aluminium rich phase and lead rich phase. Additionally, Elastic moduli, Internal friction, thermal diffusivity and hardness measurements of melt-spun ribbons were examined by using Dynamic resonance method and <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentor</b> for one applied load of 10 grams of force for 5 seconds. The results also show that this material is very sensitive to the compositions...|$|E
40|$|Indentation {{strength}} and self-crack-healing ability were systematically studied using beams containing a semi-elliptical surface crack made by <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentor.</b> Beams of Al 2 O 3 /SiC ceramic nanocomposite {{with a good}} self-crack-healing ability predetermined for four-point and three-point bending test were prepared by ceramographics techniques. Flexural {{strength and}} fracture toughness were determined using three- and four-point bend method. Thermal aging at 1573 K for 1 h was applied to heal the samples with indentation pre-cracking. Fractographical analyses using an optical and/or scanning electron microscopy {{has been carried out}} to investigate the surface crack behaviour. Very good self-crack healing ability has been proved for surface microcracks having length up to 250 μm and depth no higher than 100 μm...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} {{response of}} different glasses to a <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentor</b> {{has been investigated}} between room temperature and T-g + 50 degreesC. The permanent deformation, from which hardness is estimated, {{as well as the}} brittle fracture characteristics, allowing for an evaluation of the fracture toughness, were measured and analysed. Comparison between a standard float glass and advanced glasses such as chalcogenide (with mainly covalent bonding) and metallic glasses was made to get a more general insight into high temperature indentation behaviour. As temperature increases, the glass response becomes more and more time-dependent, and in the vicinity of T-g the permanent deformation was observed to increase rapidly for all glasses. Further, while the standard float glass showed an enhanced apparent toughness at elevated temperatures due to a brittle to ductile transition, almost no change in apparent toughness was revealed in the GeAsSe glass emphasizing the time-dependent response of glass at elevated temperature.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{methods are}} {{currently}} {{used to measure}} fracture toughness of ceramic materials. Methods based on crack-length measurements of cracks introduced into the sample surface by the <b>Vicker's</b> <b>indentor</b> have the advantage that {{they are easy to}} use, but they are very unreliable due to subcritical crack growth and the difficulty in determining the exact length of the cracks. The aim of the present work is to investigate the hardness from Vickers indentations and the fracture toughness based on crack-length measurements of cracks introduced into the sample surface of cold isostatically pressed (CIP) -Al 2 O 3 with 99. 8 % purity...|$|R
40|$|Many {{methods are}} {{currently}} {{used to measure}} the fracture toughness of ceramic materials. Methods based on crack-length measurements of cracks introduced into the sample surface by the <b>Vicker's</b> <b>indentor</b> have the advantage that they are easy to use, but are very unreliable due to subcritical crack growth and the difficulty in determining the exact length of the cracks. Furthermore, depending on the crack shape there are many equations to calculate K Ic. Other methods like the Chevron Notch or Single Edge Pre-cracked Beam (SEPB) are often difficult to execute or expensive. The simple and inexpensive Single-Edge-V-Notched Beam (SEVNB) on the other hand gives reliable values of fracture toughness of ceramic materials. In this method a saw cut is tapered to a sharp V-notch using a razor blade sprinkled with diamond paste. Thus, it is possible to introduce a sharp crack with a notch width of less than 20 micrometers, necessary to conduct valid tests. In this investigation, fracture toughness measurements on LPS-SiC materials carried out by the indentation technique and the SEVNB method have been compared...|$|R
40|$|The {{indentation}} microhardness of stoichiometric {{and reduced}} single crystal rutile (TiO 2) from 25 to 800 C {{is presented in}} this paper. The results serve two main purposes. One is to assess the effect of rutile's stoichiometry on its hardness. The other is to test recently suggested theory on solid lubrication with sub Stoichiometric rutile {{in an effort to}} better understand shear controlled phenomenon. Microhardness was measured using a <b>Vickers</b> diamond <b>indentor</b> on both vacuum and hydrogen reduced single crystal rutile from 25 to 800 C. The results indicate that stoichiometry and temperature have a pronounced effect on rutile's hardness. The measured effects lend support to theory on solid lubrication by enhanced crystallographic slip and suggest that solid lubricant materials may be produced by careful atomic level tailoring (stoichiometry control) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} the self-crack-healing behavior of SiN/SiC nano-laminated film. Moreover, {{we discussed the}} healing condition including heating temperature and heating time. The films were deposited on a silicon substrate using an ion-beam-assisted deposition. The SiN/SiC nano-laminated film was fabricated with alternating layers of SiN and SiC. After the deposition, a pre-crack was introduced using a <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentor.</b> Then, the cracked samples were heated using an electric furnace in an air atmosphere at the temperature of 600 °C to 1200 °C. In {{the case of the}} SiN and SiC monolayer films, the crack was poorly healed after heating irrespective of the temperature. This was because the size of the crack opening increased after heating. On the other hand, slight crack healing occurred at the temperature of 600 °C. Crack healing improved with an increase in the heating temperature and time. From these results, we concluded that SiN/SiC nano-laminated film has a superior self-crack-healing ability...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experimental}} marine epoxy coatings {{on steel}} substrates were tested under four-point bend cyclic-loading in both simulated sea water, at two temperatures, and in air. Freshly prepared and artificially aged coatings were examined. The samples were characterised by sectioning, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and EDX elemental analysis. The ageing processes used had multiple stages involving temperature cycles and/or repeated water soaking and drying. The coatings were loaded at strain amplitudes of 0. 15 % and 0. 22 % for 500, 000 cycles at frequencies simulating wave action. The coatings showed high fatigue resistance, so slot defects of different depths and widths were introduced to simulate damage in service and to act as crack initiators. This permitted observation of crack propagation under cyclic loading. Additionally, plastic substrates were tried so that tests at higher coating strains of 1. 33 % could be performed. The {{results showed that the}} softest epoxy coating was the most fatigue resistant. An epoxy containing large filler particles (50 gm diameter) was the next most resistant while a hard epoxy with small filler particles showed multiple fatigue cracking after 300, 000 cycles when tested on steel substrates. No fatigue cracks were observed on aged coatings. Internal stress measurements were performed that showed the coating which was most resistant to fatigue had the lowest internal stress of around 2 MPa. The other coatings internal stress levels were over 15 MPa. Tensile tests on free-films indicated that the coating most resistant to fatigue showed the lowest tensile strength, approximately 10 MPa, and the highest strain to failure, the latter property being the more important one. Hardness measurements using micro and macro <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentors</b> were performed between stages of an ageing process, along with nano-indentation (to measure Young's modulus) showing that the softest coating exhibited low elasticity. Higher hardness values were observed for coatings after ageing. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceInternational Paint Akzo-Nobel : NECETGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of the refractory hardmetal Ti 5 Si 3, {{with a grain}} size between 5 and 6 μm, was measured using the controlled-flaw method {{in conjunction with the}} miniaturized disc-bend test. The specimens used in these experiments were 3 mm diameter and varied in thickness from 150 – 450 μm. They were indented using a <b>Vickers</b> pyramid <b>indentor</b> to indention loads varying from 2. 9 – 79. 2 N. Indentation cracking was experienced at all indentation loads, and R -curve behaviour was exhibited. The {{fracture toughness}} was determined to be 2. 69 ± 0. 21 MPam 1 / 2 using a straightforward graphical procedure involving an empirical R -curve equation. This value is almost 30 % higher than that of similar material (2. 1 MPam 1 / 2) with a larger grain size, suggesting that the fracture toughness of this material, which fractures intergranularly, might be grain-size dependent...|$|R
