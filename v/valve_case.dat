40|$|SUMMARY A {{mass with}} a {{diameter}} of 0 - 8 cm was detected in the aortic root of a 53 year old woman during routine preoperative cross sectional echocardiographic assessment of a secundum atrial septal defect. Intraoperative epicardial echocardiography showed that the mass was attached by a slender stalk {{to the tip of}} the left coronary cusp of the aortic valve, and histological examination showed that it was a papillary tumour. Intraoperative epicardial echocardiography can help in planning the excision of papillary tumours, and excision is advised even when there are no symptoms. Papillary tumours of the heart are uncommon. Until recently, they were diagnosed only as an incidental finding at necropsy, ' but now they can be detected more frequently by cross sectional echocardio-graphy ' or recognised during cardiac operation. ' The aetiology of papillary tumours is uncertain. These lesions are not always asymptomatic {{and they need to be}} diagnosed accurately and distinguished from other conditions such as vegetations caused by infec-tive endocarditis, which are managed differently. There has been only one previous report of the cross sectional echocardiographic diagnosis of a papillary tumour arising from the aortic valve 4; in another patient who had M mode echocardiography alone, the features were thought to suggest infective endocarditis and the diagnosis was not established until operation. 5 We describe the preoperative and intraoperative epicardial echocardiographic features of a papillary tumour of the aortic <b>valve.</b> <b>Case</b> report A 53 year old woman reported dyspnoea on exertion for two years.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} mathematical models {{describing the}} mechanical {{behavior of the}} human aortic heart valve over a range of length and time scales. In the human heart, the valves perform the vital function of controlling the direction of blood flow. Each valve is an intricate mechanical structure, with distinct features and functions at multiple scales. This effort first develops a framework of reference configurations that enables communication between simulations of the different length scales. Three simulations are created within that framework. At the cell scale, the interaction between a single valvular interstitial cell and its surrounding matrix is described. At the tissue scale, a model is created for the valve cusp tissue mechanical behavior, including the multilayered, nonuniform geometry and nonlinear, anisotropic material properties. At the organ scale, a dynamic, three-dimensional model with fluid-structure interaction predicts {{the motion of the}} valve, blood, and surrounding tissue. Each simulation is verified against a number of experimental measures. These three simulations together constitute a model for the dynamic, three-dimensional, multiscale mechanical behavior of the healthy human aortic heart valve throughout the cardiac cycle. The model is employed to perform multiscale investigation into the mechanisms of the disease calcific aortic stenosis in three ways. First, the model of the healthy valve is extended to describe disease progression on the decade time scale. Calcification is introduced at the tissue level and the effects on valve function are monitored at the organ level. Second, the role of mechanical deformations in the disease process is examined by comparing multiscale deformations between the normal <b>valve</b> <b>case</b> and a known disease-prone case. (cont.) Finally, a combined computational and experimental study investigates the role of fluid shear in calcific disease. Shears computed in the organ-scale simulation are applied to endothelial cells in vitro. The cells express disease-related genes {{in a manner consistent with}} the region-specific nature of calcific disease, providing evidence for a role of shear in the disease process. The multiscale model presented in this thesis has further utility in investigating function, disease, and therapy of the human aortic valve. by Eli J. Weinberg. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Introduction: Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} is {{the most}} common commensal bacteria of the skin; however it can be pathogenic and {{is the most}} frequent cause of medical device associated endocarditis. It is also a well-known cause of endocarditis in IV drug abuse (IVDA). However, in individuals without obvious disruption of the skin barrier, it is a relatively rare, but emerging entity of native valve endocarditis. Coagulase negative staphylococci account for only 1 - 5 % of community acquired native valve infective endocarditis and most resolve with treatment. We report a case of a 56 year old male with an aggressive strain of community acquired Staphylococcus epidermidis acute endocarditis of a native aortic <b>valve.</b> <b>Case</b> Report: A 56 year-old non-IVDA male presented to the emergency department with low back pain and encephalopathy. Past medical history was significant for alcoholic chronic liver disease and aortic stenosis. On exam, he was found to be hypotensive with a 3 / 6 previously noted systolic murmur. He also had tenderness of the L 4 -L 5 spinous processes, splinter hemorrhages of the nails and subconjunctival hemorrhages. Initial laboratory data revealed leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Blood cultures were obtained and vancomycin was initiated. Within hours of admission, he suffered an anterior wall myocardial infarction. Initial blood cultures were positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. To rule out alternative diagnoses, an MRI of the spine, head CT and CT abdomen/pelvis were obtained, all were negative. Finally, due to continued Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, a transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained, which showed that all three cusps of the aortic valve were encased in large vegetations (the largest measured 1. 3 cm x 1. 3 cm) and echolucency in the sinus of Valsalva, indicative of abscess. Serial blood cultures while treating with vancomycin were positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. Due to end-stage liver disease with subsequent thrombocytopenia, the patient was not a candidate for valve repair. The patient subsequently sustained a ventricular tachycardia arrest and expired. Discussion: Staphylococcus epidermidis is a well-known etiology of prosthetic valve endocarditis and emerging etiology of native valve endocarditis. Previous cases reported in the literature of Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis have been successfully treated with antibiotic therapy. Typically, coagulase negative staphylococcus is considered a contaminant of blood cultures; and true infection is not difficult to treat. However in the correct clinical setting, it should be recognized as a formidable pathogen. This case demonstrates the aggressive nature of Staphylococcus epidermidis native valve acute endocarditis with abscess formation...|$|E
40|$|Welcome to International Journal of Anatomical Variations (IJAV) - {{an annual}} journal of {{anatomical}} variations and clinical anatomy case reports. After having a notable experience {{for eight years}} in NEUROANATOMY, we are pleased to introduce you IJAV. We are eventually announcing our new journal {{after three years of}} feasibility and background study period. We hope that IJAV will fill in the gap in anatomy journals’ bunch. IJAV is an annual, open access journal having electronic version only. Despite of unavailability of a budget for publishing IJAV, the evaluation of submissions and access to the full text articles is totally free of charge. Our vision for IJAV is to constitute an online compendium for anatomical variations in gross, radiological and surgical anatomy, neuroanatomy and case reports in clinical anatomy. We believe that cases have an important role in clinical anatomy education. In this aspect, we aim to serve as an open source of case reports. We hope that IJAV will be cited in most of the case reports related to clinical anatomy and anatomical variations in near future. In NEUROANATOMY, we encouraged the submission of case reports in the area of neuroanatomy. Whereas in IJAV, besides neuroanatomy, we will consider case reports in any area related to human anatomy. The scope of IJAV will encompass any anatomical variations in gross, radiological and surgical anatomy. Case reports in clinical anatomy are also welcome. All submitted articles will be peer-reviewed. No processing fee will be charged from authors. One of the most important features of IJAV will be speedy review and rapid publication. We strive to publish an accepted manuscript within three weeks of initial submission. Our young and dynamic Scientific Advisory Board will achieve this objective. A few remarks about our logo and page design: Prof. Dr. M. Mustafa ALDUR designed our logo, being inspired by a quadricuspid aortic <b>valve</b> <b>case,</b> reported by Francesco FORMICA et al. [Formica F, Sangalli F, Ferro O, Paolini G. A rare cause of severe aortic regurgitation: quadricuspid aortic valve. Interact. Cardiovasc. Thorac. Surg. 2004; 3 : 672 - 674]. We appreciate their contribution to our journal. The typeface in our logo and index page is Papyrus. The irregular margins of this font symbolize the non-uniformity in anatomy. The background in the menu bar is parchment; with Papyrus typeface, they refer to the old medical books in the ancient Egypt. As we mentioned earlier, our aim is to constitute an online compendium for anatomical variations similar to the invaluable book written by Ronald A. BERGMAN, Adel K. AFIFI and Ryosuke MIYAUCHI [Bergman RA, Afifi AK, Miyauchi R. Compendium of human anatomical variation. Baltimore, Urban and Schwarzenberg. 1988]. To realize this vision, we need you to submit your case reports to IJAV and encourage your colleagues to do so. As we did in NEUROANATOMY, we hope to be indexed in international indexes beginning from our first issue. Last but not least, I would like to thank to Dr. M. Mustafa ALDUR for his superhuman efforts and everlasting support to IJAV. Moreover, I would like to voice my special gratitude to the members of Scientific Advisory Board, who have accepted to take the road with us in this arduous journey.

40|$|Objective　To {{summarize}} {{the experience with}} resurgery for recurrent valvular heart diseases. Methods　From June 2004 to June 2015, 28 patients (15 males and 13 females) with ages ranging from 44 to 67 years (55. 6 ± 6. 5 years) with recurrent heart valve disease underwent resurgery. The reasons for resurgery included perivalvular leakage (7 <b>cases),</b> bioprosthetic <b>valve</b> decline (6 <b>cases</b> in mitral <b>valve</b> and 3 in tricuspid valve), mechanical prostheses dysfunction (2 cases), infective endocarditis after <b>valve</b> replacement (2 <b>cases),</b> restenosis of repaired native <b>valve</b> (1 <b>case),</b> and severe tricuspid insufficiency after left-side <b>valve</b> surgery (7 <b>cases).</b> Resurgery included mitral valve replacement in 18 patients and tricuspid valve replacement in 10. All the patients underwent third or fourth or even fifth cardiac surgery for valve replacement. Results　There were 2 hospital deaths with a mortality of 7. 1 % (2 / 28). The main causes of early-stage deaths were low cardiac output syndrome. The main postoperative complications were respiratory failure in 3, low cardiac output syndrome in 2, reexploration for bleeding in 2 and serious infectious shock in 1. All the patients were found with the great improvement in heart function and the re-implanted prostheses worked well during follow-up. Conclusions　Although resurgery for recurrent heart valve disease poses a continuing challenge to cardiac surgeon, it could be performed with the satisfactory results. The keys to a successful cardiac resurgery include appropriate operational timing, refined surgical technique and reasonable perioperative managements.
