50|$|During {{his tenure}} at the Turin Polytechnic, Perucca studied the <b>Volta</b> <b>Effect,</b> {{measuring}} with high precision the electronegativity between pairs of dissimilar metals. He was able to establish a theoretical correlation between the <b>Volta</b> <b>Effect</b> and the Peltier Effect. In 1928 he discovered that Enrico Fermi's theory on free electrons {{could be used to}} predict the constants of the photoelectric effect and thermionic effect in Volta's and Peltier's equations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Volta</b> <b>effect</b> (described below) {{corresponds}} to a weak electric potential difference developed by the contact of different metals. Nowadays, this is often known as a contact potential difference. This effect was first discovered by Alessandro Volta, and can be measured using a capacitance electroscope comprising different metals. However, this effect does not, by itself, account for the action of electric batteries.|$|E
5000|$|If two metals having differing work {{functions}} are touched together, one steals electrons from the other, and the opposite net charges grow larger and larger; {{this is the}} <b>Volta</b> <b>effect.</b> The process is halted when the difference in electric potential (electrostatic potential) between the two metals reaches a particular value, namely the difference in work function values - usually less than one volt. At this point, the Fermi levels for the two metals are equal, {{and there is no}} voltage difference between them. there were a voltage difference between them, then a current would flow between them: so [...] "zero current" [...] implies [...] "zero voltage difference".|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a phase plate for {{transmission electron microscopy}} {{taking advantage of a}} hitherto-unknown phenomenon, namely a beam-induced Volta potential on the surface of a continuous thin film. The Volta potential is negative, indicating that it is not caused by beam-induced electrostatic charging. The film must be heated to similar to 200 degrees C to prevent contamination and enable the <b>Volta</b> potential <b>effect.</b> The phase shift is created "on the fly" by the central diffraction beam eliminating the need for precise phase plate alignment. Images acquired with the Volta phase plate (VPP) show higher contrast and unlike Zernike phase plate images no fringing artifacts. Following installation into the microscope, the VPP has an initial settling time of about a week after which the phase shift behavior becomes stable. The VPP has a long service life and has been used for more than 6 mo without noticeable degradation in performance. The mechanism underlying the VPP {{is the same as the}} one responsible for the degradation over time of the performance of thin-film Zernike phase plates, but in the VPP it is used in a constructive way. The exact physics and/or chemistry behind the process causing the Volta potential are not fully understood, but experimental evidence suggests that radiation-induced surface modification combined with a chemical equilibrium between the surface and residual gases in the vacuum play an important role...|$|R
50|$|Gericke {{was born}} in Aachen on 7 May 1909. From 1926 to 1931 he studied physics and {{mathematics}} at the universities of Greifswald, Marburg and Göttingen. In 1931, he obtained his doctorate with a thesis on the <b>Volta</b> <b>effect.</b> In 1934, he was an assistant to Wilhelm Süss in Freiburg. With Süss, he attained his habilitation in pure mathematics in 1941.After 1945, he helped Süss to further develop the Mathematical Research Institute Oberwolfach. His interest {{in the history of}} mathematics was aroused by the work of Joseph Ehrenfried Hofmann, whom he had met in Oberwolfach in 1945 and 1946. In 1947, he began to hold lectures in Freiburg on topics related to the history of mathematics. He also received support from Heinrich Behnke, which enabled him to publish his work.|$|E
50|$|Gaede {{was born}} in Lehe, Bremerhaven, the son of Prussian Colonel Karl Gaede and Amalia, nee Renf. In 1897 he began {{studying}} medicine at the University of Freiburg, but he soon switched {{to the field of}} physics. In 1901 he wrote his doctoral thesis on the change of the specific heat of metals with temperature. Subsequent research on the <b>Volta</b> <b>effect</b> in a vacuum was unsuccessful, as the pump technology of the time could not create sufficient vacuum for the investigations. This prompted Gaede to deal more closely with vacuum technology. He invented the rotating mercury pump for high vacuum, which he presented to his scientific colleagues in 1905 at a congress in Merano. Also in Freiburg im Breisgau, Gaede wrote his habilitation thesis on The external friction of gases in 1909.|$|E
50|$|Contact {{electrification}} was an erroneous scientific theory {{from the}} Enlightenment that attempted {{to account for}} all the sources of electric charge known at the time. It has since been superseded by more modern notions. In the late 18th century, scientists developed sensitive instruments for detecting 'electrification', otherwise known as electrostatic charge imbalance. The phenomenon of electrification by contact, or contact tension, was quickly discovered. When two objects were touched together, sometimes the objects became spontaneously charged. One object developed a net negative charge, while the other developed an equal and opposite positive charge. Then {{it was discovered that}} 'piles' of dissimilar metal disks separated by acid-soaked cloth, Voltaic piles, could also produce charge differences. Although it was later found that these effects were caused by different physical processes - triboelectricity, the <b>Volta</b> <b>effect,</b> differing work functions of metals, and others - at the time they were all thought to be caused by a common 'contact electrification' process.|$|E
