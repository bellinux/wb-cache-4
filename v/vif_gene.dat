Any deletion introduced into the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> resulted in slow and low viral replication and production of virions with an infectious titer lower than that of wild-type viral particles. The wild-type phenotype could be restored by the trans expression of the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> in a complementation assay. Quantitative PCR and reverse transcription-PCR analyses were performed in order to determine which stage of the replicative cycle was impaired by the vif deletion. Our results demonstrated that CAEV Vif did not act at the level of reverse transcription or transcription but rather at the late stage of virus formation and/or release, as lower amounts of virus were produced after a single replicative cycle. The vif-deleted CAEV produced after 24 h of infection was still able to infect GSM cells, indicating that the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> is not essential for virus infectivity but is required for efficient virus production...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The human APOBEC 3 G (A 3 G) protein {{activity}} {{is associated with}} innate immunity against HIV- 1 by inducing high rates of guanosines to adenosines (G-to-A) mutations (viz., hypermutation) in the viral DNA. If hypermutation {{is not enough to}} disrupt the reading frames of viral genes, it may likely increase the HIV- 1 diversity. To counteract host innate immunity HIV- 1 encodes the Vif protein that binds A 3 G protein and form complexes to be degraded by cellular proteolysis. METHODS: Here we studied the pattern of substitutions in the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> and its association with clinical status of HIV- 1 infected individuals. To perform the study, unique <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> sequences were generated from 400 antiretroviral-naïve individuals. RESULTS: The codon pairs: 78 - 154, 85 - 154, 101 - 157, 105 - 157, and 105 - 176 of <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> were associated with CD 4 + T cell count lower than 500 cells per mm(3). Some of these codons were located in the (81) LGQGVSIEW(89) region and within the BC-Box. We also identified codons under positive selection clustered in the N-terminal region of Vif protein, between (21) WKSLVK(26) and (40) YRHHY(44) regions (i. e., 31, 33, 37, 39), within the BC-Box (i. e., 155, 159) and the Cullin 5 -Box (i. e., 168) of <b>vif</b> <b>gene.</b> All these regions are involved in the Vif-induced degradation of A 3 G/F complexes and the N-terminal of Vif protein binds to viral and cellular RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive evolution of <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> was mostly to optimize viral RNA binding and A 3 G/F recognition. Additionally, since there is not a fully resolved structure of the Vif protein, codon pairs associated with CD 4 + T cell count may elucidate key regions that interact with host cell factors. Here we identified and discriminated codons under positive selection and codons under functional constraint in the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> of HIV- 1...|$|E
40|$|Host genomes {{have adopted}} several {{strategies}} {{to curb the}} proliferation of transposable elements and viruses. A recently discovered novel primate defense against retroviral infection involves a single-stranded DNA-editing enzyme, APOBEC 3 G, that causes hypermutation of HIV. The HIV-encoded virion infectivity factor (Vif) protein targets APOBEC 3 G for destruction, setting up a genetic conflict between the APOBEC 3 G and <b>Vif</b> <b>genes.</b> This kind of conflict leads to rapid fixation of mutations that alter amino acids at the protein-protein interface, referred to as positive selection. We show that the APOBEC 3 G gene has been subject to strong positive selection {{throughout the history of}} primate evolution. Unexpectedly, this selection appears more ancient than, and is likely only partially caused by, modern lentiviruses. Furthermore, five additional APOBEC genes in the human genome appear to be engaged in similar genetic conflicts, displaying some of the highest signals for positive selection in the human genome. Despite being only recently discovered, editing of RNA and DNA may thus represent an ancient form of host defense in primate genomes. </p...|$|R

The coding potential of the vif open reading frame directly derived by nested PCR from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA was conserved in all 50 individuals. The nucleotide distances between vif sequences {{were not significantly different}} between LTNP and late progressors, indicating similar selections of viruses within both types of long-term HIV- 1 -infected subjects. However, a statistically significant correlation between an amino acid signature at position 132 of Vif and the viral load was found within LTNP. Namely, amino acid Ser was associated with low viral load and amino acid Arg with high viral load. This signature was also observed when LTNP with low viral load were compared to progressors. The Ser 132 signature was introduced in place of Arg 132 present in the HIV- 1 YU- 2 Vif prototype into chimeric viruses {{to assess the impact of}} Vif signature on the virus.

40|$|The small-ruminant lentiviruses ovine {{maedi-visna}} virus (MVV) and caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) cause encephalitis, progressive pneumonia, arthritis, and mastitis in {{sheep and}} goats. Icelandic MVV strains, which are lytic in tissue culture, {{have a wide}} species distribution of functional receptors, which includes human cells. In contrast, functional receptors for the nonlytic CAEV CO are absent from human cells. To determine if the wide species distribution of functional receptors is a common property of MVV strains or related to cytopathic phenotype, we tested the infectivity of viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of MVV K 1514, CAEV CO, and lytic and nonlytic North American MVV strains to cells of different species. Replication-defective CAEV proviral constructs lacking the env, tat, and <b>vif</b> <b>genes</b> and carrying the neomycin phosphotransferase gene in the vif-tat region were developed for the infectivity assays. Cotransfection of human 293 T cells with these proviral constructs and plasmids expressing CAEV, MVV, or vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoproteins produced infectious pseudotyped virus which induced resistance of infected cells to G 418. Using these pseudotypes, we confirmed the wide species distribution of Icelandic MVV receptors and the narrow host range of CAEV. However, functional receptors for the two North American MVV strains tested, unlike the Icelandic MVV and similar to CAEV, were limited to cells of ruminant species, regardless of cytopathic phenotype. The results indicate a differential receptor recognition by MVV strains which is unrelated to cytopathic phenotype...|$|R

A 375 -bp deletion was introduced into the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> of the wild-type FIV-pPPR infectious molecular clone to produce Vif deletion mutant FIV-pPPRΔvif. This mutant FIV proviral construct expressed FIV proteins p 24 gag and gp 100 env in transfected Crandell feline kidney cells as measured by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis as well as immunocytochemical analysis; these cultures produced very low levels of virus by cocultivation of transfected cells with PBMCs and K- 258 cells, as measured by production of p 24 gag. Replication kinetics of wild-type and vif-deleted virus were compared in PBMCs and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) by infection with cell-free virus preparations. Similar to findings with other lentiviruses, the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> was found to be essential for establishment of productive FIV infection in both PBMCs and MDMs. This study indicates that vif is essential for productive FIV infection of host target cells in vitro and that FIV-pPPRΔvif may be an excellent candidate viral mutant for attenuated virus vaccine studies...|$|E

Plasma samples collected from donors O and P during their pre-seroconversion acute infection stage were used to manufacture clotting factors, including Factor IX, to treat these patients. To assess whether a genetic relationship exists between the viruses infecting HIV- 1 -positive HPs and those infecting plasma donors, we evaluated the nef sequences in 216 individuals. Frozen-stored serum samples obtained 1 – 3 years after the diagnosis of HIV- 1 in the 20 HPs were used for amplification of the nef gene by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, and amplicons were subjected to direct sequencing. Phyloge-netic analysis revealed that the nef sequences from 143 of the samples belonged to the Korean subclade of HIV- 1 subtype B (KSB). Sequences of the nef gene from donors O and P and the 20 HPs comprised two subclusters within KSB together with several local control (LC) sequences. In addition, signature pattern analysis revealed the pres-ence of conserved nucleotides at eight positions in donors O and P compared with LCs (p < 0. 01). These nation-wide and comprehensive nef data support the previous conclusion that HPs were infected with HIV- 1 from the clotting factor, although the stringency of nef is weaker than for the pol and <b>vif</b> <b>genes.</b> Key words: hemophilia; HIV- 1; nef; phylogenetic analysis; signature pattern analysi...|$|R
40|$|The APOBEC 3 H gene is {{polymorphic}} in humans, {{with four}} major population-dependent haplotypes that encode proteins with {{different levels of}} antiviral activity. Haplotype II, present most frequently in African populations, encodes the most stable protein and is most active against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). In contrast to human APOBEC 3 G, which can be completely counteracted by HIV- 1 Vif, the protein encoded by APOBEC 3 H haplotype II is only partially sensitive to Vif, while the protein encoded by APOBEC 3 H haplotype I is completely resistant to HIV- 1 Vif. We mapped a residue on APOBEC 3 H that determines this partial Vif sensitivity. However, {{it is unclear how}} HIV- 1 can replicate in vivo without the ability to neutralize APOBEC 3 H antiviral activity. In order to directly address this question, we cloned <b>vif</b> <b>genes</b> from HIV- 1 -infected individuals with different APOBEC 3 H genotypes and tested them for their ability to inhibit human APOBEC 3 H. We found that while the APOBEC 3 H genotype of infected individuals significantly influences the activity of Vif encoded by their virus, none of the Vif variants tested can completely neutralize APOBEC 3 H as well as they neutralize APOBEC 3 G. Consistent with this genetic result, APOBEC 3 H protein expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was below our limit of detection using newly developed antibodies against the endogenous protein.

40|$|Fitness is a {{parameter}} used {{to quantify}} how well an organism adapts to its environment; {{in the present}} study, fitness {{is a measure of}} how well strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) replicate in tissue culture. When HIV- 1 develops resistance in vitro or in vivo to antiretroviral drugs such as reverse transcriptase or protease inhibitors, its fitness is often impaired. Here, we have investigated whether the development of resistance in vitro to a small molecule CCR 5 inhibitor, AD 101, has an associated fitness cost. To do this, we developed a growth-competition assay involving dual infections with molecularly cloned viruses that are essentially isogenic outside the env genes under study. Real-time TaqMan quantitative PCR (QPCR) was used to quantify each competing virus individually via probes specific to different, phenotypically silent target sequences engineered within their <b>vif</b> <b>genes.</b> Head-to-head competition assays of env clones derived from the AD 101 escape mutant isolate, the inhibitor-sensitive parental virus, and a passage control virus showed that AD 101 resistance was not associated with a fitness loss. This observation is consistent with the retention of the resistant phenotype when the escape mutant was cultured for a total of 20 passages {{in the absence of the}} selecting compound. Amino acid substitutions in the V 3 region of gp 120 that confer complete AD 101 resistance cause a fitness loss when introduced into an AD 101 -sensitive, parental clone; however, in the resistant isolate, changes elsewhere in env that occurred prior to the substitutions within V 3 appear to compensate for the adverse effect of the V 3 changes on replicative capacity.

40|$|Virion {{infectivity}} factor (Vif) is a protein encoded by {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type I (HIV- 1) and is essential for viral replication. It appears that Vif functions in the virus-producing cells and affects viral assembly. Viruses with defects in the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> (vif−) generated from the “nonpermissive cells” {{are not able to}} complete reverse transcription. In previous studies, it was demonstrated that defects in the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> also affect endogenous reverse transcription (ERT) when mild detergents were utilized to permeabilize the viral envelope. In this report, we demonstrate that defects in the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> have much less of an effect on ERT if detergent is not used. When ERT was driven by addition of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) at high concentrations, certain levels of plus-strand viral DNA could also be achieved. Interestingly, if vif− viruses, generated from nonpermissive cells and harboring large quantities of viral DNA generated by ERT, were allowed to infect permissive cells, they could partially bypass the block at intracellular reverse transcription, through which vif− viruses without dNTP treatment could not pass. Consequently, viral infectivity can be partially rescued from the vif− phenotype. Based on our observations, we suggest that vif defects may cause the reverse transcription complex (RT complex) to become sensitive to mild detergent treatments within HIV- 1 virions and become unstable in the target cells, such that the process of reverse transcription cannot be efficiently supported. Further dissection of RT complexes of vif− viruses may be key to uncovering the molecular mechanism(s) of Vif in HIV- 1 pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) regulates {{the expression of}} its genes temporally at the mRNA processing step.

To determine whether intact vif is positively selected during natural HIV- 1 infection and to determine vif sequence variability, we employed PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing to investigate the vif region of replicating virus in short-term-passage HIV- 1 primary isolates from five asymptomatic individuals and from five persons with AIDS. A total of 46 vif clones were obtained and analyzed. Recombinant proviruses were constructed from selected vif clones from one patient and found to be fully infectious. We found that 38 of the 46 clones sequenced carried open vif reading frames {{and that there was}} a low degree of heterogeneity of <b>vif</b> <b>genes</b> within isolates from the same individual and among isolates from different donors.

A phylogenetic tree constructed from all available vif nucleotide sequences resulted in a virus grouping similar to those of gag and env. Direct sequencing of vif amplified by PCR from uncultured lymphocytes of 15 individuals at various stages of progression toward AIDS demonstrated vif open reading frames in 13 of 15 samples tested. There was no obvious correlation between disease status and the presence of an intact vif within this sample group at the time of sample procurement.

To accomplish this, we {{began with an}} infectious molecular clone of SIV, i. e. SIVmac 239, and replaced the deleted segments with three alternate elements: (i) a constitutive transport element (CTE) derived from simian retrovirus type 1 to replace the Rev/Rev-responsive element (RRE) posttranscriptional regulation system, (ii) a chimeric SIV long terminal repeat (LTR) containing a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter to augment transcription and virus production, and (iii) an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of the env gene to ensure expression of envelope proteins. This simplified construct (Δ 6 CCI) efficiently produced all viral structural proteins, and mature virions possessed morphology typical of wild-type virus. It was also observed that deletion of the six accessory genes dramatically affected both the specificity and efficiency of packaging of SIV genomic RNA into virions. However, the presence of both the CTE and the chimeric CMV promoter increased the specificity of viral genomic RNA packaging, while {{the presence of the}} IRES augmented packaging efficiency. The Δ 6 CCI virus was extremely attenuated in replication capacity yet retained infectiousness for CEMx 174 and MT 4 cells. We also generated constructs that retained either the rev gene or both the rev and <b>vif</b> <b>genes</b> and showed that these viruses, when complemented by the CMV promoter, i. e., Δ 5 -CMV and Δ 4 -CMV, were able to replicate in MT 4 cells with moderate and high-level efficiency, respectively.

It had been proposed that permissive cells may contain an unidentified factor that functions like the viral Vif protein. To test this hypothesis, we produced pseudotyped wild-type and vif-deleted HIV gpt virions (which contain the HIV- 1 genome with the bacterial mycophenolic acid resistance gene gpt {{in place of the}} viral env gene) in permissive cells, and we used them to generate nonper-missive H 9 leukemic T cells that express these proviruses. We then fused these H 9 cells with permissive HeLa cells that express the HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein gp 120 -gp 41, and we asked whether the heterokaryons would release infectious HIV gpt virions. The results clearly showed that the vif-deleted virions released by the heterokaryons were noninfectious whereas the wild-type virions were highly infectious.

Many highly pathogenic members of the genus Ranavirus encode a homologue of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α (eIF 2 α). Data in a heterologous vaccinia virus system suggest that the Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV) eIF 2 α homologue (vIF 2 αH; open reading frame [ORF] 57 R) is involved in evading the host innate immune response by degrading the interferon-inducible, dsRNA-activated protein kinase, PKR. To test this hypothesis directly, the ATV <b>vIF</b> 2 αH <b>gene</b> (ORF 57 R) was deleted by homologous recombination, and a selectable marker was inserted in its place. The ATVΔ 57 R virus has a small plaque phenotype and is 8 -fold more sensitive to interferon than wild-type ATV (wtATV). Infection of fish cells with the ATVΔ 57 R virus leads to eIF 2 α phosphorylation, in contrast to infection with wtATV, which actively inhibits eIF 2 α phosphorylation. The inability of ATVΔ 57 R to prevent phosphorylation of eIF 2 α correlates with degradation of fish PKZ, an interferon-inducible enzyme that {{is closely related to}} mammalian PKR.

The coding potential of the vif open reading frame directly derived from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA was maintained {{in most of the}} 78, 912 bp sequenced. We found that 123 of the 137 clones analyzed showed an 89. 8 % frequency of intact vif open reading frames. There was a low degree of heterogeneity of vif genes within mothers, within infants, and between epidemiologically linked mother-infant pairs. The distances between vif sequences were greater in epidemiologically unlinked individuals than in epidemiologically linked mother-infant pairs. Furthermore, the epidemiologically linked mother-infant pair vif sequences displayed similar patterns that were not seen in vif sequences from epidemiologically unlinked individuals. The functional domains, including the two cysteines at positions 114 and 133, a serine phosphorylation site at position 144, and the C-terminal basic amino acids essential for vif protein function, were highly conserved in most of the sequences. Phylogenetic analyses of 137 mother-infant pair vif sequences and 187 other available vif sequences from HIV- 1 databases revealed distinct clusters for vif sequences from each mother-infant pair and for other vif sequences.

Both mutant viruses were unable to replicate in peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells but replicated with wild-type efficiency in certain T-cell lines, such as SupT 1 and MOLT- 4 / 8. These results confirm the importance of vif in the infection of relevant target cells and imply that some cellular factor(s) could compensate for vif function. However, HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 vif mutant viruses also show differential replications in other cell lines, suggesting either different threshold requirements for the same cellular factor(s) or the involvement of different factors to compensate for vif- 1 and vif- 2 functions. By cross complementation experiments, we showed that vif- 1 and vif- 2 have similar functions. Our studies further indicate the existence of two kinds of nonpermissive cells: H 9 is unable to complement HIV- 1 delta vif but is susceptible to a one-round infection with HIV- 1 delta vif produced from permissive cells. In contrast, U 937 is nonpermissive for HIV- 2 delta vif produced from permissive cells but, once infected, is able to complement the delta vif function. In both types of nonpermissive cells, a step prior to proviral DNA synthesis is affected...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe viral {{infectivity}} factor <b>gene</b> (<b>vif)</b> of HIV- 1 increases the infectivity of viral particles by inactivation of cellular anti-viral factors, and supports productive viral replication in primary human CD 4 T cells and in certain non-permissive T cell lines. Here, we demonstrate that Vif {{also contributes to}} the arrest of HIV- 1 infected cells in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle. Viruses deleted in Vif or Vpr induce less cell cycle arrest than wild-type virus, while cells infected with HIV- 1 deleted in both Vif and Vpr have a cell cycle profile equivalent to that of uninfected cells. Furthermore, expression of Vif alone induces accumulation of cells in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle. These data demonstrate a novel role for Vif in cell cycle regulation and suggest that Vif and Vpr independently drive G 2 arrest in HIV- 1 infected cells. Our results may have implications for the actions and interactions of key HIV- 1 accessory proteins in AIDS pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of AIDS cases in children {{occur as a}} result of perinatal transmission of HIV- 1 at an estimated rate of 30 %. However, the molecular mechanisms and viral determinants associated with perinatal transmission are not known, thus making it difficult to develop strategies for prevention and treatment of HIV- 1 infection. In this study, we have investigated the role of HIV- 1 accessory <b>genes</b> <b>vif,</b> vpr and vpu in maternal-fetal transmission and the kinetics of HIV- 1 replication in neonatal blood mononuclear cells. While there was a high degree of conservation of vif, vpr and vpu open reading frames in mother-infant pairs' isolates, the non-transmitting mothers' showed a high frequency of defective vif and vpr open reading frames. The functional domains required for Vif, Vpr and Vpu activity were highly conserved in sequences from transmitting mothers and their infants, but were found to exhibit defects, length polymorphism and substitutions in the conserved motifs of non-transmitting mothers' isolates. There was a low degree of heterogeneity in vif and vpr sequences from transmitting mothers and their infants and non-transmitting mothers. However the non-transmitting mother sequences were less heterogeneous than transmitting mother sequences. The vpu sequences from transmitting mothers and their infants were more heterogeneous than vif and vpr sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of vif, vpr and vpu sequences revealed distinct clusters for each mother-infant pair and non-transmitting mother, indicating that the sequences from same individual or linked individuals were more closer than unrelated individuals. Furthermore, we observed that HIV- 1 replicates more efficiently in immature blood lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages cells compared to mature blood cells, suggesting that increased susceptibility of neonatal cells to productive infection could result in rapid progression to AIDS in children. In addition, there was a difference in the susceptibility of neonatal and adult blood monocytes/macrophages to primary HIV- 1 isolates. Taken together, these findings suggest that accessory <b>genes</b> <b>vif,</b> vpr and vpu may play an essential role in HIV- 1 transmission from mother to infants and susceptibility of neonatal monocytes/macrophages may be critical for establishing productive infection. These findings may be helpful in the developing better strategies for prevention and treatment of HIV- 1 infection in children...|$|R
40|$|The {{productive}} {{infection of}} many susceptible human cells, including lymphocytes and macrophages derived from peripheral blood, by the pathogenic lentivirus {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 requires expression of the virally encoded vif (for virion infectivity factor) gene. Interestingly, this gene {{appears to have been}} conserved among all of the lentiviruses of primates and almost all of the lentiviruses of nonprimates. Using T cells constitutively expressing vif genes derived from diverse sources and virus replication assays, we show that the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> of a second primate lentivirus, simian immunodeficiency virus from macaques, complements vif-defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 but that those of three distinct nonprimate lentiviruses do not. Although the molecular basis for Vif function has yet to be defined, the potential implications of this noted restriction of vif complementarity are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{mechanisms}} of innate immunity that protect organisms from retroviral infections, including HIV, are known. Lentiviruses express viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein {{that has the}} ability to counter antiviral activity exhibited by the recently discovered host cytidine deaminases APOBEC 3 G and 3 F. Although these host factors are present in diverse mammalian species and have been shown to act against various organisms, their importance in HIV infection has been highlighted because of their suggested activities against HIV in vivo and the strong conservation of the HIV <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> encoding the Vif protein capable of countering this innate activity. The main purpose of this review is to provide a detailed overview on HIV-specific interaction of APOBEC 3 subfamily of proteins and discuss its potential role in HIV pathogenesis. Maria E.

40|$|APOBEC 3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing {{catalytic}} polypeptide 3 [A 3]) proteins are {{an element}} of the intrinsic immunity of modern mammalia against retroviruses. The evolution of the A 3 genes is characterized by an adaptive selection and a taxon-specific expansion and/or extinction. All A 3 genes consist either of one zinc (Z) -coordinating domain (Z 1, Z 2 or Z 3) or two Z-domains (Z 2 -Z 1, Z 2 -Z 2, Z 2 -Z 3). While humans carry seven A 3 genes, Equus caballus carries six and Felis catus four A 3 genes. The genome of Equus caballus carries two Z 1, two Z 2 -Z 2, one Z 2 and one Z 3 A 3 gene. Some of the equine A 3 are able to restrict the Equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV). Equine macrophages, which are the natural target cells for EIAV, express only a limited repertoire of the A 3 genes. In addition, the transcriptional level of the anti-EIAV A 3 mRNAs was significantly lower in macrophages than in equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Equine A 3 proteins hyper-mutated EIAV genomes supporting their predicted function. In contrast to all other extant lentiviruses, EIAV does not encode a <b>vif</b> <b>gene.</b> Other EIAV-specific genes as dUTPase and S 2, whose relevance for the viral replication in previous studies was only insufficiently characterized, did not influence the inhibitory effect of the equine A 3 proteins. Thus, EIAV does not have an antagonist against its species-own A 3 proteins. These findings indicate that lentiviral replication can occur independent from a <b>vif</b> <b>gene,</b> which likely developed later {{in the evolution of the}} lentiviruses. Felis catus and of other Felidae encode A 3 genes of the type Z 2 and Z 3. Beside one-domain molecules, also two-domain encoding read-through transcripts with two Vif interaction sites were detectable, that restricted different feline retroviruses. FIV (Feline immunodeficiency virus) encodes a Vif protein that counteracts the inhibitory effect of the feline A 3 proteins. Despite a high genetic diversity in felid A 3 genes, no strong resistance could be shown against the neutralizing activity of Vif of the domestic cat FIV. Non-feline A 3 proteins restricted FIV independently of Vif, which proves that the interaction between A 3 and Vif proteins is species-specific and thus limits interspecies virus transmission. Species-specificity was also demonstrated for the interaction of feline A 3 and the Vif protein of HIV- 1. Feline cells that expressed human entry receptors were permissive for the transduction with a HIV- 1 reporter virus but the virus was not able to spread in these cells. HIV replication in feline cells is strongly inhibited by the feline A 3 proteins. In order to overcome this restriction, the <b>vif</b> <b>gene</b> of HIV- 1 was replaced by vifFIV. This chimeric HIV- 1 showed spreading replication in feline cells expressing human receptors. Altogether, these findings implicate the importance of a novel animal model for HIV- 1 based on Felis catus...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT With HIV {{persisting}} lifelong in infected persons, therapeutic vaccination {{is a novel}} alternative {{concept to}} control virus replication. Even though CD 8 and CD 4 cell responses to such immunizations have been demonstrated, their effects on virus replication are still unclear. In view of this fact, we studied {{the impact of a}} therapeutic vaccination with HIV nef deliv-ered by a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara vector on viral diversity. We investigated HIV sequences de-rived from chronically infected persons before and after therapeutic vaccination. Before immunization the mean SE pairwise variability of patient-derived Nef protein sequences was 0. 1527 0. 0041. After vaccina-tion the respective value was 0. 1249 0. 0042, resulting in a significant (P< 0. 0001) difference between the two time points. The <b>genes</b> <b>vif</b> and 5 gag tested in parallel and nef sequences in control persons yielded a constant amino acid sequence variation. The data presented suggest that Nef immunization induced a selective pressure, limiting HIV sequence variability. To our knowledge this is the first report directly linking thera-peutic HIV vaccination to decreasing diversity in pa-tient-derived virus isolates. —Hoffmann, D., Seebach...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) auxiliary <b>gene</b> <b>vif</b> is essential for virus propagation in peripheral blood lymphocytes, macrophages, and in some T-cell lines. Previously, it was demonstrated that Vif inhibits the autoprocessing of truncated HIV- 1 Gag–Pol polyproteins expressed in bacterial cells, and that purified recombinant Vif and Vif-derived peptides inhibit and bind HIV- 1 protease (PR). Here we show that Vif interacts with the N-terminal region of HIV- 1 PR, and demonstrate that peptide derived from the N-terminal region of PR abrogates Vif function in non-permissive cells. Specifically, we show that (i) Vif protein binds HIV- 1 PR, but not covalently linked tethered PR-PR; (ii) the four amino acids residing at the N terminus of HIV- 1 PR are essential for Vif/PR interaction; (iii) synthetic peptide derived from the N terminus of HIV- 1 PR inhibits Vif/PR binding; and (iv) this peptide inhibits the propagation of HIV- 1 in restrictive cells. Based on these data, we suggest that Vif interacts with the dimerization sites of the viral protease, and that peptide residing at the N terminus of PR abrogates Vif function(s) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} Bayesian {{multiple}} changepoint model to infer spatial phylogenetic variation (SPV) along aligned molecular sequence data. SPV occurs in sequences from organisms that have undergone biological recombination or when evolutionary rates and selective pressures vary along the sequences. This Bayesian approach permits {{estimation of uncertainty}} regarding recombination, the crossing-over locations, and all other model parameters. The model assumes that the sites along the data separate into {{an unknown number of}} contiguous segments, each with possibly different evolutionary relationships between organisms, evolutionary rates, and transition: transversion ratios. We develop a transition kernel, use reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to t our model, and draw inference from both simulated and real data. Through simulation, we examine the minimal length recombinant segment that our model can detect for several levels of evolutionary divergence. We examine the entire genome of a reported human immunode ciency virus (HIV) - 1 isolate, related to a purported recombinant virus thought to be the causative agent of an epidemic outbreak of HIV- 1 infection among intravenous drug users in Russia. We nd that regions of the genome differ in their evolutionary history and selective pressures. There is strong evidence for multiple crossovers along the genome and frequent shifts in selective pressure changes throughout the <b>vif</b> through env <b>genes...</b>|$|R
