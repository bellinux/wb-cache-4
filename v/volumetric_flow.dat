5|$|The {{technology}} {{required for}} blast furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or {{may have been}} an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable. Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high. As the Varangian Rus' people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their Volga trade route, {{it is possible that the}} technology reached Sweden by this means. High quality ores, water power for bellows for blast and wood for charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden. However, since blast furnace has also been invented independently in Africa by the Haya people, it is more likely the process has been invented in Scandinavia independently. The step from bloomery to true blast furnace is not big. Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume of the blast and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures, bloom melting into liquid iron and, cast iron flowing from the smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which greatly increases the <b>volumetric</b> <b>flow</b> of the blast.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a fully automated method for measuring <b>volumetric</b> blood <b>flow</b> with angle-corrected blood velocity from a color Doppler image.

25|$|This whistle has {{dozens of}} popular names. Pipes with {{sinusoidal}} variations of radius are often created to permit bending.

40|$|YesIn {{the drying}} process of a can making industry, the drying {{efficiency}} of a thermal drying oven {{can be improved}} by adjusting the <b>volumetric</b> air <b>flow</b> rate of the blower. To maximize drying efficiency, an optimal flow rate is needed. Consequently, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to provide simulation according to the response of air velocity, air temperature and evaporated solvent concentration with respect to changes in <b>volumetric</b> air <b>flow</b> rate in the drying oven. An experimental study {{has been carried out}} to determine the evaporation rate of the solvent. To validate the models, the process data obtained from the CFD is compared with that obtained from actual data. In the accurate models, the simulation results demonstrate that the decrease in <b>volumetric</b> air <b>flow</b> rate provides no major discrepancy of the air velocity patterns in all dimensions and decreases the maximum temperature in the oven. Consequently, this decrease in <b>volumetric</b> air <b>flow</b> rate rapidly increases the evaporated solvent concentration in the beginning and then gradually decreases over the length of the oven. In addition, further reduction of the flow rate gives lower heat loss of the oven up to 83. 67 %.

25|$|These {{devices have}} been studied, and {{reviewed}} by Raman. Here we look primarily at the Hartmann whistle. The shock {{cells of the}} jet interact with the shock {{in front of the}} cavity (the flow in the cavity being subsonic). Small symmetric disturbances in the jet stream are amplified as they proceed toward the cavity (similar in some respects to the hole tone) causing the shock in front of the cavity to oscillate. The shock front acts much like a piston source of high energy resulting in a monopole-like sound field. Again the <b>volumetric</b> <b>flow</b> is directional unlike the theoretical monopole.|$|E
25|$|Weirs allow hydrologists and {{engineers}} a simple method of measuring the <b>volumetric</b> <b>flow</b> rate in small to medium-sized streams/rivers or in industrial discharge locations. Since {{the geometry of}} the top of the weir is known and all water flows over the weir, the depth of water behind the weir can be converted to a rate of flow. However, this can only be achieved in locations where all water flows {{over the top of the}} weir crest (as opposed to around the sides or through conduits/sluices) and at locations where the water that flows over the crest is carried away from the structure. If these conditions are not met, it can make flow measurement complicated, inaccurate or even impossible.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{characteristic}} speed U and sound speed are essentially the same, {{it can be}} rewritten as the second equation.

A cousin to the Hartmann whistle {{is shown in the}} figure on the right, the Galton whistle. Here the cavity is excited by an annular jet which oscillates symmetrically around the sharp edges of the cavity. It appears to be a circular version of the edge tone (discussed below) in which the symmetry of the otherwise dipole source of the edge tone is converted to a monopole source.|$|E
