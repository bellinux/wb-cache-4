40|$|N the 1980 s <b>vat</b> <b>dyes,</b> bearing {{about 60}} 1 C. I. Names (I), were {{available}} in the U. S. under about 260 different trade names. This collection of dyes has not changed much in recent years. About 60 % of them have C. I. Numbers-i. e., ihe chemical structure of the principle color component is known; 85 % are derivatives of anthraquinone, and of these almost 50 % fall into only five chemical structure subgroups; indigo derivatives and the related thioindigo derivatives account for about 10 % of the list. As a class, <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> are expensive, although they share this characteristic with some fiber reactive dyes. One shouid not overlook the 10 % of so-called sulfurized <b>vat</b> <b>dyes,</b> which are more economical hybrids of sulfur and <b>vat</b> <b>dyes.</b> The practical details of using <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> in both batch and continuous processes are covered in this second and final part of Chapter 3. <b>Vat</b> <b>dyes</b> generally offer superior fastness properties. Potential drawbacks to selecting <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> include a tendency for phototendering and a limited color gamut. Based on the substantivities of leuco-vat anions, the traditional classification system for <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> offers batch dyers a better means for selecting <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> to be used successfully in combination. Leuco-vat dyeing, prepigmentation, semipigmentation and batch aftertreatments are covered. While continuous <b>dyeing</b> with <b>vats</b> offers economic advantages, several precautions are required to ensure a satisfactory result. The chemical structure and commercial forms of <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> are also covered...|$|R
50|$|Many <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> are {{derivatives}} of indigo <b>dye.</b> For example, <b>vat</b> blue 2 and 3 are halogenated or methylated derivatives and so {{are several}} violets. Many other <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> are derivatives of anthroquinones.|$|R
5000|$|Vat Blue 36 is a <b>vat</b> <b>dye</b> that is {{chemically}} {{related to}} indigo. it {{is produced by}} condensation of 4-methyl-5-chloro-7-methoxy-3-indolinone and 5,7-dichloro-3-(2H)-thianaphthenone.|$|E
5000|$|Vat dyes are a {{class of}} dyes that are {{classified}} as such because of the method by which they are applied.

40|$|Background: <b>Vat</b> <b>dyes</b> are {{the class}} of dyes used in textile dyeing in Abeokuta, South Western Nigeria. While some <b>dyes</b> (including <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> intermediates) have been {{associated}} with adverse effects on manufacturer&#x 2032;s health, there is paucity of data on effects of occupational exposure to <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> among end users, such as those involved in textile dyeing and finishing. Aims and Objectives: To investigate the possible effect of occupational exposure to <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> on the functions of the liver. Materials and Methods: Using convenience sampling technique, a cohort of dye workers (n= 117) with a minimum of one year and a maximum of 60 years duration of exposure (mean = 17. 03 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 19 years) were recruited in this study. Sixty traders, matched for age and sex and who had no previous exposure to <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> were selected as controls. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographic, occupational and environmental characteristics of the subjects. Plasma activities of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and plasma concentrations of total protein, albumin and total bilirubin were measured using standard spectrophotometric methods. Statistical analyses: SPSS version 11. 0 was used for statistical analyses. Tests of significance were carried out using Student&#x 2032;s t test, and correlation co-efficient. Results and Conclusion : The activity of ALP and the concentrations of total protein and albumin were significantly lower (P &# 60; 0. 05) in the exposed group. ALT and AST activities were significantly higher (P &# 60; 0. 05) in the exposed group. Occupational exposure to <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> may result in sub-clinical adverse effects on the liver, involving inhibition of its synthetic function...|$|R

50|$|Lumi is a Los Angeles-based company {{founded by}} Jesse Genet and Stephan Ango that {{manufactures}} packaging and branded supplies. The company {{got its start}} developing Inkodye, a photo-reactive <b>vat</b> <b>dye</b> that develops its color through exposure to UV or sunlight.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> {{have high}} color fastness, which is {{uncommon}} in other dye classes. On the other hand, <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> {{tend to have}} poor rubbing fastness, but this can be mitigated with special treatments to the fabric. Indigo is subject to major crocking (i.e., rubbing the dye off onto other items) unless it is applied carefully. This means use a weaker dyebath, and dipping many times, rather than a single strong dipping.|$|R
50|$|During the inter war {{period the}} company {{continued}} {{to invest in}} new plant and products. The Dyestuffs (Import Regulation) Act 1920 had given British dye producers much needed protection from cheap imports and provided an impetus to increasing the range of dyes and intermediates produced at Clayton. In 1930, an additional azo dyes plant (building 187) was completed followed in 1938 by {{the construction of a}} new <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> complex (buildings 188, 189 and 190). The completion of the <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> project was held up by the outbreak of war in 1939.|$|R

50|$|Vat dyes are {{essentially}} {{insoluble in water}} and incapable of dyeing fibers directly. However, reduction in alkaline liquor produces the water-soluble alkali metal salt of the dye, which, in this leuco form, has an affinity for the textile fiber. Subsequent oxidation reforms the original insoluble dye. The color of denim is due to indigo, the original <b>vat</b> <b>dye.</b>|$|E
40|$|Corona tretment {{consists}} on {{the application}} of an electrical discharge of high voltage (around 10. 000 V) through air between two electrodes, using frequencies around 40 kHz, at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, on dry cotton fabric, {{that can be applied}} in textile processing allowing to rationalize water, energy and chemicals that are spent in huge amounts within this industry, fulfilling the requisites of the new world ecological demands imposed by environmental concerns. When Corona plasmatic radiation is applied as a pre-treatment of raw cotton fabric to be <b>dyed</b> with <b>vat</b> <b>dyes,</b> the process becomes shorter than the conventional one, lowering the costs and execution time, reflecting an economical and ecological impact on the textile process. This treatment is responsible by a complete hydrophilization of raw cotton by means of the oxidation of the hydrophobic layer, making cotton materials ready to dye directly skipping the stages of the preparation. The global differences between conventional <b>vat</b> <b>dyeing</b> process and the process with Corona are evaluated. The final treatment of <b>vat</b> <b>dyeing,</b> in which Corona is previously applied, will include an oxidation process to promote simultaneously insolubilization and cleaning of the fabric. The properties of the <b>vat</b> <b>dyeing</b> products in Corona process are maintained regarding the excellence on fastness to washing and rubbing, improving the uniformity in the final article with higher purity and more intensity and more intensity in darker colours...|$|R

50|$|Scholl made a {{name for}} himself in the {{scientific}} community at a young age through publications on the chemistry of fulminic acid, disproving the structures of this molecule proposed by August Kekulé and Edward Divers. He did some research for the Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik (BASF) in the early 1900s, and began doing research on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, especially vat dyes such as indanthrene and flavanthrene, in 1903. Among other things, Scholl developed a method for the synthesis of pyranthron, the first nitrogen- and sulfur-free <b>vat</b> <b>dye.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Inkodye {{is a type}} of <b>vat</b> <b>dye</b> {{that uses}} light rather than oxygen to [...] "fix" [...] the dye, {{with a wide variety of}} {{possible}} effects. These dyes, which are chemically similar to vat dyes, are developed by light instead of being applied in an oxygen-free bath and being developed in the fabric by exposure to oxygen. Inkodyes are true dyes, not fabric paints. A dye itself attaches to the fabric; fabric paint includes a glue-like binder, which imparts a stiffer feeling to the fabric.|$|E
