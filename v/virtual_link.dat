25|$|OSPF {{does not}} use a {{transport}} protocol, such as UDP or TCP, but encapsulates its data directly in IP packets with protocol number 89. This {{is in contrast to}} other routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport layer error detection and correction functions. OSPF uses multicast addressing for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. OSPF reserves the multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 (IPv4) and FF02::5 (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and 224.0.0.6 (IPv4) and FF02::6 (IPv6) for all Designated Routers (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF multicast IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The <b>virtual</b> <b>link</b> feature can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. The OSPF protocols gathers information regarding all link states in the domain in its link state database, and is thus not a link layer protocol itself, but is – based on the purpose of the protocol; to exchange and calculate optimal paths through the network for IP destination addresses – most correctly classified as an Internet layer protocol. The OSPF protocol, when running on IPv4, can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3, running on IPv6, does not support protocol-internal authentication. Instead, it relies on IPv6 protocol security (IPsec).|$|E

50|$|The central {{feature of}} an AFDX network are its virtual links (VL). In one abstraction, it is {{possible}} to visualise the VLs as an ARINC 429 style network each with one source and one or more destinations. Virtual links are unidirectional logic path from the source end-system to all of the destination end-systems. Unlike that of a traditional Ethernet switch which switches frames based on the Ethernet destination or MAC address, AFDX routes packets using a <b>virtual</b> <b>link</b> ID, which is carried in the same position in an AFDX frame as the MAC destination address in an Ethernet frame. However, in the case of AFDX, this <b>virtual</b> <b>link</b> ID identifies the data carried rather than the physical destination. The <b>virtual</b> <b>link</b> ID is a 16-bit unsigned integer value that follows a constant 32-bit field. The switches are designed to route an incoming frame from one, and only one end system to a predetermined set of end systems. There can be one or more receiving end systems connected within each <b>virtual</b> <b>link.</b> Each <b>virtual</b> <b>link</b> is allocated dedicated bandwidth of all VL bandwidth allocation gap (BAG) rates x MTU with the total amount of bandwidth defined by the system integrator. However total bandwidth cannot exceed the maximum available bandwidth on the network. Bi-directional communications must therefore require the specification of a complementary VL.|$|E
