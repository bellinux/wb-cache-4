5000|$|In construction, {{there are}} three main types of compactor: the plate, the [...] "jumping jack" [...] and the road roller. The roller type compactors are used for {{compacting}} crushed rock as the base layer underneath concrete or stone foundations or slabs. The plate compactor (vibratory rammer) has a large <b>vibrating</b> <b>baseplate</b> and is suited for creating a level grade, while the jumping jack compactor has a smaller foot. The jumping jack type is mainly used to compact the backfill in narrow trenches for water or gas supply pipes etc. Road rollers may also have vibrating rollers.|$|E

The dust aggregates consisted of spherical SiO 2 grains with 1. 5 µm diameter and had an initial volume filling factor (the volume fraction of material) of φ 0 = 0. 15. The aggregates were put onto a <b>vibrating</b> <b>baseplate</b> and, thus, performed multiple collisions with the plate at a mean velocity of 0. 2 m s − 1. The dust aggregates were observed by a high-speed camera to measure their size which apparently decreased over time as a measure for their compaction. After 1000 collisions the volume filling factor was increased {{by a factor of}} two, while after ∼ 2000 collisions it converged to an equilibrium of φ ≈ 0. 36. In few experiments the aggregate fragmented, although the collision velocity was well below the canonical fragmentation threshold of ∼ 1 m s − 1. The compaction of the aggregate has an influence on the surface-to-mass ratio and thereby the dynamic behavior and relative velocities of dust aggregates in the protoplanetary nebula. Moreover, macroscopic material parameters, namely the tensile strength, shear strength, and compressive strength, are altered by the compaction of the aggregates, which has an influence on their further collisional behavior. The occurrence of fragmentation requires a reassessment of the fragmentation threshold velocity...|$|E
