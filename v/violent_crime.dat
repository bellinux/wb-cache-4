5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> and property crime. Historically, <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East Palo Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for violent crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also {{the source of the}} most <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East Palo Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, {{which was one of the}} safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City.|$|E
5|$|St. John's has {{traditionally}} {{been one of the}} safest cities in Canada to live; however, in recent years crime in the city has steadily increased. While nationally crime decreased by 4% in 2009, the total crime rate in St. John's saw an increase of 4%. During this same time <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> in the city decreased 6%, compared to a 1% decrease nationally. In 2010 the total crime severity index for the city was 101.9, an increase of 10% from 2009 and 19.2% above the national average. The <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> severity index was 90.1, an increase of 29% from 2009 and 1.2% above the national average. St. John's had the seventh-highest metropolitan crime index and twelfth-highest metropolitan <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> index in the country in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor's {{crime rate}} was below the {{national}} average in 2000. The <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rate was further {{below the national}} average than the property crime rate; the two rates were 48% and 11% lower than the U.S. average, respectively.|$|E
40|$|<b>Violent</b> <b>crimes</b> such as murder, armed robbery, {{kidnapping}} and terrorism {{are the most}} inhumane crimes that continue to plague Nigeria. Lately, kidnappings for ransom and terrorism have taken the centre stage leading to bloodshed and economic set-backs. The causes are not farfetched as studies have associated rising youth unemployment {{to the increase in}} <b>violent</b> <b>crimes.</b> By using the deprivation theory proposed by Ted Gurr, this study has explored the proximate and ultimate causes involving the youths in <b>violent</b> <b>crimes.</b> If factors that create the feeling of deprivation and frustration created by unemployment are addressed, Nigeria‟s youths will not engage in <b>violent</b> <b>crimes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Frequency of <b>violent</b> <b>crimes</b> by {{individuals}} {{was measured in}} a world sample of 102 diverse communities. <b>Violent</b> <b>crimes</b> combine measures of assault and homicide. Frequent <b>violent</b> <b>crimes</b> are as-sociated with high concentration of wealth among a minority of in-dividuals or families. High wealth concentration combines four measures: general polygyny, use of money, gifts or exchanges ac-companying marriage, and domestication of pigs or larger ani-mals. Frequent <b>violent</b> <b>crimes</b> are correlated with high wealth con-centration. Three of the four components of high wealth concentra-tion are prevalent in modern industrialized nations. The exception is general polygyny. In cities, wealth concentration instead of large, dense, and heterogeneous population is probably the cause of frequent <b>violent</b> <b>crimes.</b> A remedy is to shift government revenue from productive activities, such as wages, sales, {{and the value of}} buildings, to owners of land and other natural resources...|$|R

5|$|Crime in Paris {{is similar}} to that in most large cities. <b>Violent</b> <b>crime</b> is {{relatively}} rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E
5|$|<b>Violent</b> <b>crime</b> from 2005 to 2006 {{was mostly}} {{unchanged}} nationwide, but {{increased more than}} 10% in Cleveland.

5|$|Crime in Washington, D.C., is {{concentrated}} in areas associated with poverty, drug abuse, and gangs. A 2010 study found that 5% of city blocks accounted for over one-quarter of the District's total crime.

It was given royal assent in May 1854, and not repealed until 1903. Designed to protect free settlers from <b>violent</b> <b>crimes</b> by escaped convicts, the ordinance permitted capital punishment for offences much less serious than the usual capital crimes of murder, rape and assault with intent to murder.|$|R
