40|$|Mixed {{convection}} heat transfer in horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>ducts</b> with {{flow through the}} duct {{plays an important role}} in the design and operation of several industrial equipment involving heat transfer and fluid flow phenomena. The estimation of heat transfer requires consideration of both free and forced convective heat exchange mechanisms, in addition to surface radiation among the internal walls of the duct. Free convection leads to the onset and growth of secondary flows, which interact with the forced {{convection heat}} transfer rate, and thereby affecting the overall heat removal rates from a duct. Surface radiation in the presence of mixed convection is found to affect both free and forced convection heat transfer rates. Therefore, the combination of the convection (free and forced) and radiation heat transfer modes present an interesting situation. Due to the emissivity of the walls of the duct, surface radiation from the walls of the duct will affect the overall heat transfer phenomena. The present study therefore focuses on the interaction of surface radiation on the free and forced convective heat transfer phenomena occurring in airflow through a duct. Three configurations: mixed convection heat transfer in thermally developing flow in horizontal ducts (CS 1), hydrodynamically developed thermally developing flow in horizontal ducts (CS 2) and thermally developing flow in <b>vertical</b> <b>ducts</b> (CS 3), are analyzed. Experiments are performed to study the mixed convection heat transfer in horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>ducts</b> with two differentially heated isothermal hot and cold walls and two adiabatic walls. Radiative heat transfer is estimated using a numerical scheme, with the help of experimentally obtained temperatures. The experimental work involved fabrication, assembly and instrumentation of test sections on horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>ducts</b> of suitable sizes. The major parameters considered in this work include wall emissivity, Reynolds number, thermal and geometric parameters and aspect ratios. To cover the required range of Reynolds numbers, two test sections were used in this study. In a series of experiments, the Reynolds number was varied from 800 to 2900, and the heat flux was varied from 250 W/m 2 to 870 W/m 2, for 2 aspect ratios of the duct cross section and the emissivity of internal walls were 0. 05 and 0. 85. The heated wall temperature ranged from 55 oC to 100 oC and the cold wall directly opposite to the heated wall was maintained at a uniform temperature. The flow field within the duct was made visible by a suitable smoke flow visualization method. The results showed that the flow conditions and surface radiation significantly affected the total Nusselt number...|$|R

25|$|Helium was {{initially}} {{selected for the}} lifting gas {{because it was the}} safest to use in airships, as it is not flammable. One proposed measure to save helium was to make double-gas cells for 14 of the 16 gas cells; an inner hydrogen cell would be protected by an outer cell filled with helium, with <b>vertical</b> <b>ducting</b> to the dorsal area of the envelope to permit separate filling and venting of the inner hydrogen cells. At the time, however, helium was also relatively rare and extremely expensive as the gas was only available in industrial quantities from distillation plants at certain oil fields in the United States. Hydrogen, by comparison, could be cheaply produced by any industrialized nation and being lighter than helium also provided more lift. Because of its expense and rarity, American rigid airships using helium were forced to conserve the gas at all costs and this hampered their operation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present paper aims at {{improving}} the modeling of turbulence for the upward turbulent bubbly {{flow through the}} use of experimental databases that contain data on small and large <b>vertical</b> <b>ducts.</b> First, the role of bubble-induced turbulence was analyzed, which indicated the dominant role of the bubble-induced turbulence in the duct center for relatively high void fraction cases. Therefore, the turbulence therein was mainly focused on, which indicated that the stronger turbulence could be induced by bubbles in large ducts with similar void fractions as compared to that in small ducts. Next, the turbulence of upward turbulent bubbly flow near the wall is discussed to understand the interaction between the wall-induced and bubble-induced turbulence. It showed that the existence of a wall could suppress the bubble-induced turbulence given the same void fraction, and the existence of bubbles could also suppress the solely wall-induced turbulence as compared to the single-phase turbulent flow, even though the total turbulence is enhanced. The above characteristics indicated that the current turbulence modeling method needs to be modified, especially when the bubble-induced turbulence plays a dominant role...|$|R
40|$|Bridge {{projects}} {{constructed in}} Texas which utilize precast bent caps typically employ grouted <b>vertical</b> <b>ducts</b> in the cap-to-column connections. This {{type of connection}} is preferred due to the simple geometry and because the volume of grout needed to complete the connections is minimized. A number of questions related to {{the sensitivity of the}} behavior of the grouted vertical-duct connectors to design parameters were identified during the design and construction of these bridges. Thirty-two, large-scale pullout tests of connectors grouted in galvanized steel and plastic ducts were conducted to investigate the response of this type of connector. The results indicate that the tensile capacity is sensitive to the type of duct, the embedded length of the connector, the number of connectors tested simultaneously in tension, and the placement of the connector within the duct. However, the results were not sensitive to epoxy coating on the connector or to the presence of spiral transverse reinforcement around the group of connectors. Design equations are proposed for the minimum embedded length of all connectors to satisfy serviceability concerns and for the development length necessary to resist the calculated tensile stresses in the connectors under the design load combinations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) {{simulations}} {{are carried}} out to select a better air intake system for a new fire laboratory, designed for experiments with a maximum fire heat release rate of 7 MW. Two different air intake systems are considered: a louver system around the lower perimeter of the building or a chimney system that employs <b>vertical</b> <b>ducts</b> to bring fresh air down from the roof to {{the lower part of}} the building. The two systems are investigated with different fire sizes and wind speeds. The results show that the chimney system gives a more stable smoke and temperature stratification inside the building and a higher hot smoke layer above the floor. The louver system, on the other hand, gives rise to unsymmetrical air movements inside the building when the wind speed outside is high. The louver system also yields a lower hot smoke layer that can spill smoke through the louvers to the outside of the building, especially for small fires with low exhaust flow rates. The results, therefore, suggest that an evenly distributed chimney system would provide a more stable ventilation environment for conducting fire experiments and would prevent smoke leakage to the outside of the building.

Near wall measurements of mean and fluctuating velocities, as well as local void fraction, are taken in the liquid film, with the highest turbulent fluctuations occurring for the flow condition with the largest pressure drop. A modified law-of-the-wall formulation for wall shear is presented which, using near wall values of mean velocity and kinetic energy, agrees reasonably well with the average stress obtained from direct pressure drop measurements.

Post-tensioned timber beams and frames give opportunities for much greater use of timber and engineered wood products in large buildings, using innovative technologies for creating high quality buildings with large open spaces, excellent living and working environments, and resistance to hazards including earthquakes, fires, and extreme weather events.
