40|$|<b>Vanishing</b> <b>lung</b> {{syndrome}} (VLS) is a {{rare and}} distinct clinical syndrome that usually affects young men. VLS leads to severe progressive dyspnea and is characterized by extensive, asymmetric, peripheral, and predominantly upper lobe giant lung bullae. Case reports have suggested an additive role of marijuana use {{in the development of}} this disease in young male tobacco smokers. We herein report a case of a 65 -year-old Hispanic male previously diagnosed with severe emphysema and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), with a history of intravenous heroin use and active marijuana smoking who presents to the emergency department with severe progressive shortness of breath he was found to have multiple large subpleural bullae occupying {{more than one-third of the}} hemithorax on chest computerized tomography (CT), characteristic of <b>vanishing</b> <b>lung</b> syndrome. The patient was mechanically ventilated and later developed a pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement and referral for surgical bullectomy. Surgical bullectomy has shown high success rates in alleviating the debilitating symptoms and preventing the life threatening complications of this rare syndrome. This case further emphasizes the importance of recognizing VLS in patients with severe emphysema and heavy marijuana smoking...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Rapidly <b>vanishing</b> <b>lung</b> {{pseudotumor}} (phantom tumor) {{refers to}} the transient well-demarcated accumulation of pleural fluid in the interlobar pulmonary fissures. Most frequently their appearance is associated with congestive heart failure, but also other disorders like hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency or pleuritis. Its rapid disappearance {{in response to the}} treatment of the underlying disorder is a classical feature of this clinical entity. Case report. A 47 -yearold woman, chronic smoker with symptoms of shortness of breath, orthopnea, chills, cough, weakness and the temperature of 39. 2 °C was admitted to our hospital. A posteroanterior chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with the cardiothoracic ratio of > 0. 5, blunting of both costophrenic angles and an adjacent 6 x 5 cm well-defined, rounded opacity in the right interlobar fissure. Transthoracic 2 -dimensional echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular hyperthrophy with a systolic ejection fraction of 25 % and moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient’s symptoms resolved rapidly after diuresis, and repeated chest X-ray four days later showed that the right lung opacity and pleural effusions had vanished. Conclusion. The presented case underlines the importance of the possibility of <b>vanishing</b> <b>lung</b> tumor in patients with left ventricular failure and a sharp oval lung mass on the chest X-ray. This is the way to avoid incorrect interpretation of this finding causing additional, unnecessary, costly or invasive imaging, interventions and drugs...|$|E
40|$|Patients with a {{homogeneous}} type of emphysema have been excluded a priori from LVRS in many centers {{because of the}} fear of removing parenchyma, which potentially contributes to gas exchange, and because the observation that heterogeneity of emphysema is a predictor of functional improvement. It is obvious that resection of functionless tissue, such as in heterogeneous emphysema with bullae, can be advised to the patient with a relative low risk. However, as the main positive effect of LVRS is its improvement on respiratory mechanics, {{it is not surprising that}} well-selected patients with homogeneous emphysema also benefit from surgery. Their selection has to be done cautiously. It is crucial to exclude patients with a very low functional reserve, such as with diffusing capacity below 20 % predicted or with pulmonary hypertension, and with extreme parenchymal loss (<b>vanished</b> <b>lungs)</b> on CT from LVRS. Additionally, cofactors which may potentially interfere with a smooth postoperative course, such as previous recurrent infections, extensive scarring of the lungs, or previous surgery, have to be taken into consideration. When respecting these caveats, LVRS in patients with complete homogeneous emphysema provides a comparable symptomatic and almost the same functional improvement as in patients with heterogeneous emphysema. Although the perioperative mortality is low, patients with homogeneous emphysema have a slightly reduced long-term survival without lung transplantation compared with patients with heterogeneous emphysema. Based on our own experience, we conclude that LVRS can be recommended to selected symptomatic patients with advanced homogenous emphysema associated with severe hyperinflation, if diffusing capacity is not below 20 % of predicted values and if the CT scan does not show aspects of <b>vanished</b> <b>lungs...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{land use}} planning {{plays an important role}} towards a better environmental resources development. Land being the vital ingredient in any development needs a better understanding and systematic planning. This closely rooted towards sustainable land use development. Ignorance towards a systematic {{land use planning}} can cause various problems related to the physical environment and to the humans. This can be seen clearly in Penang Island, where land is considered a vital component in developing the Island’s ever growing property sector. As the state push towards fulfilling the demand in the property sector, environmental problems such as slope failure, mud-flood, severe coastal erosion, <b>vanishing</b> green <b>lungs,</b> frequent flash floods, river pollutions, and disruption of coastal process becomes liability to the environmental sustainability of the Island. The three day Star Property Fair 2010 in Penang concluded with RM 50 m worth of property sold in the Penang Island. This is an indication that demand for residential and commercial property in Penang Island is so great exceeding the states’ and the developers’ projections. The social issues such as displacement of traditional villages, disappearing fishing communities, increasing number of vulnerable group and many other related issues due to development. This study will be focusing on the environmental and social issues related to past, present and future land use planning at Tg. Tokong, Penang...|$|R

CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 48 -year-old female nonsmoker was admitted to our hospitalwith a 10 -year history of chronic chest tightness and dysp-nea. Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance to percussion in left lung. Chest x-ray showed a hyperlucent left hemithorax with a severe rightward medias-tinal shift, which was suggestive of tension pneumothorax. But high-resolution computed tomography of the chest revealed that several giant bullae occupying almost the entire left hemithorax with severe mediastinal displacement to the right (Figure 1), which was consistent with <b>vanishing</b> <b>lung</b> syndrome. This patient successfully underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic resection of the left giant bullae and is currently without resid-ual symptoms. <b>Vanishing</b> <b>lung</b> syndrome, also termed idiopathic giant bullous emphysema, is a progressive bullous disease that often occurs in young male smokers. 1 Roberts et al 2 proposed the radiographic criteria that include giant bullae in 1 or both upper lobes occupying at least one-third of the hemithorax and com-pressing the surrounding parenchyma. High-resolution com-puted tomography plays an important role in differentiating giant bullae from tension pneumothorax. Bullectomy is the treatment of choice for patients presenting with dyspnea and giant bullae. We report a successful resection of giant bullae by means of video-assisted thoracic surgery, even when giant bul-lae occupied the entire hemithorax, and residual lung remained a collapsed state for a long period...|$|E

40|$|<b>Vanishing</b> <b>lung</b> {{disease in}} an adult misdiagnosed as {{pneumothorax}} A previously healthy 34 -year-old man attended the medical outpatient ward with a 6 -month history of shortness of breath, which was worse on exertion. The patient was a chronic smoker {{but there was no}} additional history of cough, sputum production, haemoptysis, fever or chest pain. On examination, the patient appeared pallid and had reduced tactile vocal fremitus and breath sounds bilaterally. A plain chest X-ray revealed multiple bullae bilaterally (Fig 1). There was no tracheal or mediastinal displacement. A diagnosis of pneumothorax was considered and a tube thoracostomy was planned. A high resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) scan was organised to confi rm the diagnosis. However, this revealed multiple large bullae in bilateral lung fi elds wit...|$|E
40|$|Persons with HIV {{infection}} have {{a higher}} risk of infectious pulmonary complications, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary fibrosis than individuals not infected with HIV. Herein, we describe the clinical course of a patient with longstanding and well-controlled HIV infection and multiple previous pneumothoraces who presented to medical attention with insidious onset of shortness of breath and was diagnosed with <b>vanishing</b> <b>lung</b> syndrome (VLS). The VLS or giant bullous emphysema is a distinct clinical syndrome characterized by large bullae, predominantly in the upper lobes, occupying at least one third of the hemithorax and compressing surrounding normal lung parenchyma. It is a progressive disorder that typi-cally occurs in young men, the majority of whom are smokers. As people with HIV/AIDS are now surviving well into middle age and beyond, clinicians are more likely to encounter VLS and severe obstructive lung disease, which are potentially fatal but pre-ventable conditions...|$|E
