40|$|Abstract. We propose some global {{constraints}} for lexicographic orderings on <b>vectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables.</b> These constraints {{are very}} useful for breaking {{a certain kind}} of symmetry arising in matrices <b>of</b> decision <b>variables.</b> We show that decomposing such constraints carries a penalty either in the amount or the cost of constraint propagation. We therefore present a global consistency algorithm which enforces a lexicographic ordering between two <b>vectors</b> <b>of</b> n <b>variables</b> and domains <b>of</b> size d in O(nd) time. The algorithm can be modified very slightly to enforce a strict lexicographic ordering. Our experimental results on a number of domains (balanced incomplete block design, social golfer, and sports tournament scheduling) confirm the efficiency and value of these new global constraints. 1 Introduction Global (or non-binary) constraints {{are one of the most}} important and powerful aspects of constraint programming. Specialized propagation algorithms for global constraints are vital for efficient and effective constraint solving. A number of consistency algorithms for global constraints have been developed by several researchers (see [1] for examples). To continue this line of research, we propose a new family of efficient global constraints for lexicographic orderings on <b>vectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables...</b>|$|R

50|$|Constraint {{satisfaction}} as {{the name}} suggests {{is the process of}} finding a solution that conforms to a set of constraints that the variables must satisfy. A solution is therefore a <b>vector</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> that satisfies all constraints. Constraint satisfaction is a difficult problem to solve and hence is not usually properly implemented. All the programs need to satisfy some constraint in some way or the other. There have been many methods like iterative relaxation, genetic algorithms etc. which allow to solve for constraints.|$|E
