40|$|Purpose: In prior work, a {{manually}} derived {{measure of}} vocal fold vibratory phase asymmetry correlated {{to varying degrees}} with visual judgments made from laryngeal high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) recordings. This investigation extended this work by establishing an automated HSV-based framework to quantify 3 categories of vocal fold <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetry.</b> Method: HSV-based analysis provided for cycle-to-cycle estimates of left–right phase asymmetry, left–right amplitude asymmetry, and axis shift during glottal closure for 52 speakers with no vocal pathology producing comfortable and pressed phonation. An initial cross-validation of the automated left–right phase asymmetry measure was performed by correlating the measure with other objective and subjective assessments of phase asymmetry. Results: Vocal fold <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetry</b> was exhibited to a similar extent in both comfortable and pressed phonations. The automated measure of left–right phase asymmetry strongly correlated with manually derived measures and moderately correlated with visual–perceptual ratings. Correlations with the visual–perceptua...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the videostroboscopic finding of <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetry</b> in mobile vocal folds is a reliable predictor of vocal fold paresis. In addition, the ability of experienced reviewers to predict the distribution (left/dght/bilateral) of the paresis was investigated. Methods: This is a retrospective chart review of all patients who presented to our clinic during a 3 -year period with symptoms suggestive of glottal insufficiency (vocal fatigue or reduced vocal projection) accompanied by the videostro-boscopie findings of bilateral normal vocal fold mobility and <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetry.</b> Twenty-three of these patients under-went diagnostic laryngeal electromyography of the thyroarytenoid and crieothyroid muscles to determine the presence of vocal fold paresis. Results: Nineteen of the 23 patients (82. 6 %) were found to have electrophysiological evidence of vocal fold paresis, either unilaterally or bilaterally, when videostroboscopic asymmetry was present in mobile vocal folds. However, the three expert reviewers ' ability to predict the distribution (left/right/bilateral) of the paresis was poor (26. 3 %, 36. 8 %, and 36. 8 %, respectively). Conclusions: The videostroboscopic finding of <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetry</b> in mobile vocal folds is a reliable predictor of vo-cal fold paresis in most cases. However, the ability of expert reviewers to determine the distribution (left/right/bilateral) of the paresis using videostroboscopic findings is poor. This study highlights the value of laryngeal electromyography in arriving at a correct diagnosis in this clinical situation.

40|$|Clinical voice specialists make {{critical}} diagnostic, medical, therapeutic, {{and surgical}} decisions by coupling visual observations of vocal fold tissue motion with auditory-perceptual assessments of voice quality. The {{details of the}} relationship between vocal fold tissue motion and the voice produced are not fully understood, and there is recent evidence that the diagnostic significance of asymmetries during vocal fold vibration may be over-interpreted during clinical voice assessment. An automated system based on high-speed videoendoscopy recordings was developed to objectively quantify vocal fold <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetry</b> with initial validation from manual markings and visualperceptual judgments. Efficient estimation of these measures was possible due to recent technological advances in high-speed imaging of the larynx that enabled the capture and processing of high-resolution video (up to 10, 000 images per second) of rapid vocal fold vibrations (100 - 1000 times per second). Synchronized recordings of the acoustic voice signal were made to explore physiological-acoustic relationships that were not possible using clinical stroboscopic imaging systems. In an initial study of asymmetric vibration in 14 patients treated for laryngeal cancer, perturbations in the voice signal were most associated with asymmetry that changed across vibratory cycles, while the overall level of asymmetry did not contribute to degradations in voice quality measures. (cont.) Thus, since stroboscopic imaging is only able to capture <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetry</b> that occurs periodically, voice clinicians are not able to observe the time-varying nature of asymmetry that presumably affects acoustic perturbations to a higher degree. The impact of asymmetric vibration on spectral characteristics was explored in a computational voice production model and an expanded group of 47 human subjects. Surprisingly, in both model and subject data, measures of vocal fold <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetry</b> did not correlate with spectral tilt measures. In the subject data, left-right phase asymmetry and closing quotient exhibited a mild inverse correlation. This result conflicted with model simulations in which the glottal area waveform exhibited higher closing quotients (less abrupt glottal closure) with increasing levels of phase asymmetry. Results call for further studies into the applicability of traditional spectral tilt measures and the role of asymmetric vocal fold vibration in efficient voice production. by Daryush Dinyar Mehta.

40|$|Asymmetries of {{the vocal}} folds and vocal fold {{vibration}} are key features underlying unilateral vocal fold motion impairment (VFMI). The {{knowledge of what}} particular asymmetries contribute to breathy voice and which asymmetries must be eliminated to re-establish normal voice {{will be important to}} improving evaluation and treatment of VFMI. It was hypothesized that several structural and <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetries</b> should lead to predictable changes in the glottal area, flow, and acoustic waveforms, and subsequently a perceived breathy voice quality. The purpose of this project was threefold: 1) to determine how specific vocal fold structural and <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetries</b> alter vocal function and perceived voice quality, 2) to determine the improvement in vocal function and voice quality in an abnormal voice with elimination of individual asymmetries, and 3) to develop a battery of vocal function measures that vary with dysphonia in a predictable manner. The approach was to use a computational kinematic model of vocal fold vibration that allows for differential left/right control of parameters such as vocal fold adduction, medial surface bulging, vibratory nodal point, phase, amplitude of vibration, and fundamental frequency. The resultant signals were subjected to aerodynamic and acoustic measurement as well as perceptual rating of voice quality. Results revealed that the degree of vocal process separation was the most influential parameter tested, though asymmetry of bulging, nodal point ratio, and starting phase worsened normal voice quality. Conversely, increased symmetry of bulging, nodal point ratio, amplitude of vibration and starting phase improved disordered voice quality. The amount of improvement to disordered voices varied {{based on the number of}} other asymmetries present. None of the six vocal function measures tested were primarily responsive to one particular model parameter, though four measures generally decreased as vocal process separation increased: maximum flow declination rate (MFDR), spectral slope (B 0 -B 2), cepstral peak prominence (CPP), and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). Two of the measures, MFDR and CPP, co-varied with each of the five parameters and robustly correlated with perceived severity...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Although near-normal {{conversational}} voices can {{be achieved}} with the phonosurgical management of early glottic cancer, there are still acoustic and aerodynamic deficits in vocal function that must be better understood to help further optimize phonosurgical interventions. Stroboscopic assessment is inadequate for this purpose. Methods: A newly developed color high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) system that included time-synchronized recordings of the acoustic signal was used to perform a detailed examination of voice production mechanisms in 14 subjects. Digital image processing techniques were used to quantify glottal phonatory function and to delineate relationships between vocal fold vibratory properties and acoustic perturbation measures. Results: The results for multiple measurements of <b>vibratory</b> <b>asymmetry</b> showed that 31 % to 62 % of subjects displayed higher-than-normal average values, whereas the mean values for glottal closure duration (open quotient) and periodicity of vibration fell within normal limits. The average HSV-based measures did not correlate significantly with the acoustic perturbation measures, but moderate correlations were exhibited between the acoustic measures and the SDs of the HSVbased parameters. Conclusions: The use of simultaneous, time-synchronized HSV and acoustic recordings can provide new insights into postoperative voice production mechanisms that cannot be obtained with stroboscopic assessment...|$|E
