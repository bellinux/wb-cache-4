40|$|Stock loans {{have been}} {{recognized}} as a popular financial contract and considered as an alternative for investors to increase liquidity. Consequently, an accurate and efficient <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> loans is necessary. Although there are some existing literatures on the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> loans, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, most are for perpetual loans. In reality, stock loan contracts mostly last for less than 10 years. It is, therefore, important to develop accurate and efficient evaluation methods for stock loans of finite maturity. This thesis explores a semi-analytic method for evaluating American puts in Zhu [2006] and proposes a modified semi-analytic method to evaluate stock loans in finite maturity. Three types of stock loans are formulated and solved as the corresponding American option problems under the Black-Scholes framework. First, finite non-recourse stock loans with three different dividend distributions are formulated as American calls, and solved using Zhu’s semi-analytic method. Our results are compared with those in Dai and Xu [2011]. Then margin call stock loans are formulated as American Down-and-Out call options with rebate, and solved using the semi-analytic method. The dependency of the optimal exit price and the stock loan value on payback amount, and other parameters such as effective interest rate and volatility, are analyzed as well. Finally, Stock loans under a two-state regime switching economy are formulated as the corresponding Regime switching American Call options. A modified semi-analytic method is proposed to find the solutions of the optimal exit prices and stock loan values. Furthermore, fair service fee are calculated as well for different scenarios. The results of thesis could be used for borrowers and lenders to consider their exit policy and decide the service fee fairly...|$|E

40|$|The Black-Scholes {{model is}} widely used in {{practice}} to price options whose underlying follows a stochastic process with constant volatility. However, {{it is well known}} that a financial model based on constant volatility is not consistent with market prices. Recent research shows that models based on stochastic volatility, jump diffusion and regime switching processes produce results that better fit market data. A large number of applications, such as trading strategies, interest rate dynamics, insurance, <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> loans, convertible bond pricing, etc., are modeled using regime switching. These models are intuitively appealing and computationally inexpensive compared to the stochastic volatility and jump diffusion models. In this talk, we consider efficient numerical methods for pricing American options under a regime switching stochastic process. American options can be formulated as Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and HJB-Isaacs (HJBI) partial differential equations (PDEs). A standard method for solving the American options is the policy iteration. However, it may not converge for HJBI equations. An alternative is to use relaxation-type iterative methods, which ar...|$|E
40|$|The <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> {{options and}} {{currency}} options has witnessed {{an explosion of}} new development in the past twenty years. These models, set up either in a partial equilibrium or a general equilibrium framework, have certainly enriched our understanding of option valuation {{in one way or}} the other. However, the main drawback of these models is that stock options and currency options are analyzed in separate contexts. The co-movement of the stock market and the currency market is absent from the option valuation analysis. Such co-movement is extremely important and is best illustrated by the Southeast Asian ¯nancial crisis. To overcome this drawback, this paper uses an equilibrium model to investigate the joint dynamics of the exchange rate and the market portfolio in a small open monetary economy with jump-di®usion money supplies and aggregate dividends. It is shown that the exchange rate and the market portfolio are strongly correlated since both are driven by the same economic fundamentals. Furthermore, options on the exchange rate and the market portfolio are evaluated in the same equilibrium context. The analysis shows that parameters describing the sam...|$|E
40|$|Stock {{loans are}} loans collateralized by stocks. They are modern {{financial}} products designed for investors with large equity positions. Mathematically, stock loans {{can be regarded}} as American call options with a time-dependent strike price. This study is the first in the literature that considers the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> loans in a stochastic interest rate framework. Based on portfolio analysis, a partial differential equation (PDE) governing the value of stock loans is derived. A set of appropriate boundary conditions, particularly in the interest rate direction, are also proposed to close the pricing system. A sound justification is provided for the proposed boundary conditions mathematically as well as financially. To solve the proposed nonlinear PDE system, a predictor-corrector finite difference method is adopted. Moreover, an alternating direction implicit (ADI) method is used to improve the computational efficiency. Numerical results suggest that the current method is reliable and the stochastic interest rate leads to a higher optimal exercise price of the stock loan in comparison with that calculated from the Black-Scholes model...|$|E
