40|$|The pedestrian, bicyclist and {{motorcyclist}} are {{the groups}} of road users that can be categorized as the <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Road</b> <b>User.</b> This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the safety of the <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Road</b> <b>User</b> in the FT 50 blackpots ' area from Batu Pahat to Ayer Hitam. The objectives of this study were to idenfta; the pattern of road accident; the contributing factors of road accident and; the level of the road safety awareness among the <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Road</b> <b>User</b> group at the study area. The quantitative data were collectedfiom the survey by using questionnaire and checklist form. The respondents were randomly selected which consist of 103 Year Five 's students of Sekulah Kebangsaan Pintas Puding and 115 Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia's students. The outcomes of data analysis have revealed that among the <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Road</b> <b>User,</b> the motorcyclist was the highest contribution to the road accident's percentage. Moreover, the main contributing factors in road accidents involving the <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Road</b> <b>User</b> were the human, vehicle and environment factors. The awareness level among the <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Road</b> <b>User</b> was graded as average based on the questionnaire given.

30|$|The {{methodology}} has {{to consider}} all the relevant aspects of comfort. The comfort level of different <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> groups should be assessed and the specifics of each <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> group {{should be taken into}} account appropriately. A combination of qualitative and quantitative instruments was envisaged.|$|E
30|$|The comfort benefits, the {{assessment}} of which was conducted in an experimental manner in this study, form a considerable part of the total <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> benefits for some systems, although safety benefits usually outweigh all other positive impacts [1]. This leads {{to the need for}} a standardised methodology and framework for <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> benefits assessment and especially for {{the assessment}} of comfort benefits. However, the proper application of an overall standardised methodology for benefits assessment requires the collection of harmonised safety and mobility data across EU countries, to be set at a level of detail sufficient to disaggregate system benefits not only to general <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> groups but also per age category.|$|E

40|$|A {{group of}} <b>road</b> <b>users</b> {{can be defined}} as ‘vulnerable’ in a number of ways, such as by the amount of {{protection}} in traffic (e. g. pedestrians and cyclists) or by the amount of task capability (e. g. the young and the elderly). <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> do not usually have a protective 'shell', and also the difference in mass between the colliding opponents is often an important factor. <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> can be spared by limiting the driving speed of motorized vehicles and separating unequal <b>road</b> <b>user</b> types as much as possible. Adapting motor vehicles (e. g. by side-underrun-protection for trucks and collision-friendly car fronts) can lessen the injury severity of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users.</b> In crashes involving only <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> and no other <b>road</b> <b>users,</b> it is mainly the infrastructure that is important for the prevention and limitation of injury...|$|R

30|$|In the VRUITS project, {{the effects}} of {{exposure}} (as part of Mechanism 6) focused on changes in exposure as measured in kilometres of travel for different <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> groups. The estimated effects on <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> exposure were transferred to safety effects of exposure (the same values were used for fatalities and injuries) based on the values found in earlier studies. These studies found a “safety in numbers” effect, where the accident risk per kilometre for <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> modes decreases as <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> travel increases – a likely explanation is that other road users learn to expect vulnerable road users on the road when they become less rare. This means {{that the number of}} fatalities and injuries increases slower than the number of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> kilometres. The studies modelled this with an exponential model: if the exposure increased by a factor of x, then the number of fatalities and injuries increased by a factor xy, for some exponent y less than 1. The exponent y was 0.38 for the pedestrians (based on [12]), 0.4 for cyclists and moped riders (based on [11]) and 0.7 for motorcyclists (based on [17] and previous impact assessment studies). The safety effects of modal change (Mechanism 7) were calculated by using the same formulas as for the change (increase or decrease) in the exposure of vulnerable road users (Mechanism 6). The mechanism-based approach in our safety assessment allowed us to conclude that no double counting of the effects occurred. The effects of the modal shift were only calculated for vulnerable road users; {{the effects of}} the modal change of cars, trucks and public transport were ignored. A small change in the modal share of vulnerable road users corresponds to a significantly smaller change in the modal change of cars, trucks and/or public transport, thus the safety effect of the modal shift to or from cars, trucks and public transport would be negligible. Moreover, the risk per km for cars, trucks and public transport is much smaller than the risk per km for <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> [5]. Thus, calculating the effect of modal change for cars, trucks and/or public transport results in a smaller change in travelled km that would be multiplied by a smaller risk factor per km.|$|E

30|$|The {{method to}} assess the {{mobility}} and comfort impacts of ITS on <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> was developed from the method introduced by Kulmala (2010), initially developed {{for the assessment of}} safety impacts of ITS for cars. The method for mobility and comfort impact assessment followed the steps defined by Kulmala (2010), but when assessing mobility and comfort numbers 1 – 5 (comfort) and 6 – 8 (mobility) were of interest. The method was enhanced and adjusted to take into consideration the mobility and comfort of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> covering: mobility and exposure of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> measured in: trip length, duration and frequency; and comfort of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> measured in: how the users perceive their travel, i.e., change their opinion regarding the comfort of the travel undertaken, and perceived safety in relation to traffic.|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] potential effectiveness of vehicle-based secondary safety systems {{for the protection of}} pedestrians and pedal cyclists is related to the proportion of cases where injury arises by contact with the road or ground rather than with the striking vehicle. A detailed case review of 205 accidents from the UK On-the-Spot study involving vulnerable road users with head injuries or impacts indicated that contact with the road was responsible in 110 cases. The vehicle however was associated with a majority of more serious casualties: 31 (vehicle) compared with 26 (road) at AIS 2 + head injury level and 20 (vehicle) compared with 13 (road) at AIS 3 + level.

30|$|Most {{projects}} {{dealing with}} aspects of walkability, cyclability and the preconditions for Power Two Wheelers usually provide data for general comfort assessment.

40|$|Stress {{can have}} serious {{implications}} on road safety and {{evidence suggests that}} {{it could lead to}} increases in driving errors, lapses, and even crashes. Motorcyclists are a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> group, and lapses in attention and risky behaviours resulting from stress could increase the risk of collision. However, few safety interventions for reducing stress have been developed and evaluated, especially in motorcyclists. The purpose of this research was to develop and pilot a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) course for the treatment of rider stress. Five motorcyclists experiencing a range of life and work stressors completed the CBT course between January and March 2015. Findings from the Driver Stress Inventory and Driver Behaviour Questionnaire showed positive trends in the overall reduction of rider stress traits, such as aggression, thrill seeking, and dislike of riding. Qualitative data showed that participants engaged well with the intervention and believed it had aided them in their riding-related stress. Although these results are promising, the results warrant further investigation in order to validate CBT as a viable means of reducing the collision risk both for this already <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user</b> group and other driver categories...|$|E

40|$|Pedestrian {{fatalities}} in Sri Lanka {{account for}} 40 % of all road deaths. In Colombo district {{this is as}} high as 70 %. Of all casualties of road accidents, pedestrians constitute 39 %. The majority of the victims are in their prime age of between 20 to 35 years. (Police Accident Report, 1996) According to the Ministry of Health, among the leading causes of hospitalization, accident injury is ranked second highest. (Health Bulletin, 1995). A survey conducted at the National Hospital, Colombo, reported that victims of road traffic accident occupied 24 % of the beds in the accident ward. The cost of traffic accidents has been estimated to be 0. 5 to 1 percent of GPD. (Fernando & Fernando, 1994). In industrial countries road traffic accidents have long been recognized as a major cause of death and more emphasis on protecting the most <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>user,</b> particularly the pedestrian. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has followed the pattern of developing countries where resources have been spent on improvements aimed at helping the motorist rather than the pedestrian despite the high involvement of pedestrians in traffic accidents.

30|$|Having fewer cars in {{the buffer}} zone will {{initially}} reduce encounters between <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> (pedestrians and cyclists) and motorized vehicles. Fewer such encounters will also, other things being equal, lead to fewer road accidents between vehicles and pedestrians. If <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> are unwary of motorized vehicles (risk compensation), the advantageous effect (a reduction in road accidents) of fewer cars is reduced. Such risk compensation will, however, probably not entirely eliminate the beneficial effect of decreasing the number of motorized vehicles. An increase of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> in the area, however, can increase conflicts between cyclists and pedestrians, which might in turn cause more accidents between such <b>road</b> <b>users.</b> Fortunately, traffic accidents involving only such users usually result in injuries of a less serious nature; therefore, an increase in such accidents will unlikely {{be large enough to}} remove the positive impact on road safety of reducing the number of cars.|$|R

Memory for road scenes task was designed by the current researchers to investigate if real-life spatial asymmetries in attention and memory manifest in driving context. Based on the activation– orientation hypothesis and leftward bias in mental representations of spatial judgement, the results of the current study did not provide evidence that more attended images were remembered better; however, participants were faster to correctly recognise scenes containing <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> when they appeared on the right compared to when they appeared on the left of the street scene. On the contrary, the participants were faster to recognise scenes containing cars rather <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> when they appeared on the left. The current results lend support to existing literature on the subject of attention in driving behaviour, suggesting that larger hazards present in the medial areas of visual field recruit more attentional resources, leading to the limited perception of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> in the periphery. In light of current results, future research should focus on increased attention allocation to <b>vulnerable</b> <b>road</b> <b>users</b> in real-life driving, which could influence the way novice drivers are educated. This, in turn, would ensure better road safety and decrease the numbers of accidents involving bicycles and motorbikes...|$|R
