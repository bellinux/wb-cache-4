25|$|However, as {{knowledge}} of physiology has {{increased over the}} past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at Indiana University and William Vennard at the University of Southern California, have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice. In particular, the use of the terms chest register and head register have become controversial since vocal registration is more commonly seen today as a product of laryngeal function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to vocal resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms chest voice and head <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including speech pathology, phonetics, and linguistics. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.|$|E
500|$|On October 4, 2015, it was {{confirmed}} through Anime News Network that Chisuga was to <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> character Sylvia Lyyneheym {{for the second}} season of Japanese anime television series, The Asterisk War. However, Chisuga did not comment about a potential theme song recording for the show. Then in February 2016, Chisuga confirmed that a new song, titled [...] "Ai no Uta (Words of Love)", would serve as the show's ending theme song. [...] "Ai no Uta (Words of Love)" [...] was written by Yamada Toshiaki and produced by Swedish electronic dance musician Rasmus Faber. Musically, it is an electronic dance song, influenced by four {{on the floor and}} incorporates [...] "elegant strings" [...] sections, as described by a staff member at CD Journal.|$|E
500|$|... "Dream Scene" [...] is a {{combination}} of segments that Harrison edited together. Along with [...] "Ski-ing", it is the only track on the album that combines Indian and Western music. The song consists of three distinct pieces, the first of which is a meditative section featuring phase-shifted instrumentation such as tabla tarang, harp (swarmandal) and sitar, and singing. The music is delivered via backwards-played tape loops as the vocals pan {{from one side to the}} other across the stereo image. The other two pieces include a section comprising Barham's piano and flutes, followed by a trumpet solo, harmonica interspersed with a police siren, and more backwards tape loops. The song fades out with a slowed-down spoken <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sound of church bells.

500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} and third single, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute For Love" [...] is a downtempo ballad drawing {{influences}} from jungle, drum and bass and trip hop music. The title {{is inspired by}} J.G. Ballard's post-apocalyptic science fiction novel The Drowned World (1962). [...] "Swim", the second song, has a spiritual tone. She sings: [...] "Swim to the ocean floor/So that we can begin again/Wash away all our sins/Crash to the other shore". [...] "Ray of Light", the third track and album's second single, is an up-tempo electronic dance-pop song which contains strong techno tendencies and influences of trance music. A [...] "sonically progressive" [...] track, it also incorporates elements of rock music, with a prominent electric guitar riff. The melody also has several sound effects, including whistles and bleeps. [...] "Candy Perfume Girl" [...] has a grunge intro and continues to pair post-modern beeps and beats with old-fashioned electric guitar flare ups. In the next song, [...] "Skin", Madonna sings [...] "Do I know you from somewhere?" [...] in a yearning <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> beats of an electronic orchestra. The sixth track, [...] "Nothing Really Matters", is an up-tempo dance track which contains influences of techno.|$|E
500|$|In {{his way to}} the Lost Valley {{to learn}} more about the {{expedition}} Yuma sent after the Relic, Ajay's helicopter is shot down by an unknown assailant. Ajay survives the crash, but awakens to discover that the pilot has been abducted and taken deeper into the valley. Ajay follows him intent on rescue, only to discover that the valley is occupied by an aggressive army. Liberating a relay station in a bid to re-establish contact with the Golden Path, he is forced to fight off wave after wave of attackers whilst being taunted by a <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> radio. Investigating further, Ajay discovers the army is calling themselves the Disciples of Yalung, and is a cult worshiping a demon from Kyrati mythology. The Disciples have harnessed an evil that permeates the valley to transform their followers into [...] "Awakened", or yetis, and are amassing their forces to attack Kyrat. Realizing that he cannot return to Kyrat without dealing with the cult, Ajay gradually destroys their ranks before scaling a glacier to find the source of Yalung's influence. After successfully destroying a tree that provides the Disciples with their power, Ajay sees himself as an Awakened, although this is supposedly just a hallucination.|$|E

500|$|Etan Cohen {{created the}} role of Kirk Lazarus {{as a way of}} lampooning the great lengths that some method actors go to depict a role. Downey was {{approached}} by Stiller about the part while on vacation in Hawaii. Downey said on CBS' The Early Show that his first reaction was, [...] "This is the stupidest idea I've ever heard!" [...] and that Stiller responded, [...] "Yeah, I know— isn't it great?" [...] In another interview, Downey said that he accepted the part but, having no idea where or even how to start building the character of Lazarus, eventually settled on a jive-esque speech pattern and a ragged bass voice; he then auditioned Lazarus' <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> phone to Stiller, who approved the characterization immediately. Downey revealed that he modeled the character on actors Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell, and Daniel Day-Lewis. The initial script was written for Downey's character to be Irish, but was altered after Downey stated he could improvise better as an Australian (he had previously played a similar outlandish Australian character in the film Natural Born Killers). Downey's practice of remaining in character between takes and even off the film set was also written into the script for his character to perform. Downey required between one and a half to twohours of make-up application. According to Downey, [...] "One makeup artist would start on one side of my face and a second makeup artist would start on the other side, and then they'd meet in the middle." ...|$|E

[...] Sedaka has taken meticulous care of his <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years and still sings in the original keys recorded in his youth.

A few days later, {{to follow up on}} the Hartford incident, Chappelle stopped in Chicago for a performance where comedy website ComedyHype.Com acquired and released audio of him being heard on stage responding to the heckling in Hartford.

2500|$|A {{large part}} of Mickey's screen persona is his famously shy, falsetto voice. From 1928 onward, Mickey was voiced by Walt Disney himself, a task in which Disney took great {{personal}} pride. However, by 1946, Disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which meant he could not do Mickey's voice anymore. It is also speculated that his cigarette habit had damaged his <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years. [...] After recording [...] the Mickey and the Beanstalk section of Fun and Fancy Free, Mickey's voice was handed over to veteran Disney musician and actor Jimmy MacDonald. MacDonald voiced Mickey {{in the remainder of}} the theatrical shorts, and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in the mid-1970s, although Walt voiced Mickey again for the introductions to the original 1955–1959 run of The Mickey Mouse Club TV series, the [...] "Fourth Anniversary Show" [...] episode of the Disneyland TV series that aired on September 11, 1958, and the Disneyland USA at Radio City Music Hall show from 1962. Composer Carl W. Stalling was the very first person to provide lines for Mickey in the 1929 short The Karnival Kid. Clarence Nash voiced Mickey in the 1934 Disney short, The Dognapper; around the time when it was filmed, Walt was traveling in Europe and was unavailable to record his lines for Mickey for the short. Along with Disney, J. Donald Wilson, Joe Twerp, and John Hiestand provided the voice in 1938 broadcasts of The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air. Stan Freberg voiced Mickey in the Freberg-produced record Mickey Mouse's Birthday Party.

2500|$|The first mastersingers file {{into the}} church, {{including}} Eva's wealthy father Veit Pogner {{and the town}} clerk Beckmesser. Beckmesser, a clever technical singer who was expecting to win the contest without opposition, is distressed to see that Walther is Pogner's guest and intends to enter the contest. Meanwhile, Pogner introduces Walther to the other mastersingers as they arrive. Fritz Kothner the baker, serving as chairman of this meeting, calls the roll. Pogner, addressing the assembly, announces his offer of his daughter's hand for {{the winner of the}} song contest. When Hans Sachs argues that Eva ought to have a say in the matter, Pogner agrees that Eva may refuse the winner of the contest, but she must still marry a mastersinger. Another suggestion by Sachs, that the townspeople, rather than the masters, should be called upon to judge the winner of the contest, is squelched by the other masters. Pogner formally introduces Walther as a candidate for admission into the masterguild. Questioned by Kothner about his background, Walther states that his teacher in poetry was Walther von der Vogelweide whose works he studied in his own private library in Franconia, and his teachers in music were the birds and nature itself. Reluctantly the masters agree to admit him, provided he can perform a master-song of his own composition. Walther chooses love as the topic for his song and therefore is to be judged by Beckmesser alone, the [...] "Marker" [...] of the guild for worldly matters. [...] At the signal to begin (Fanget an!), Walther launches into a novel free-form tune (So rief der Lenz in den Wald), breaking all the mastersingers' rules, and his song is constantly interrupted by the scratch of Beckmesser's chalk on his chalkboard, maliciously noting one violation after another. When Beckmesser has completely covered the slate with symbols of Walther's errors, he interrupts the song and argues that {{there is no point in}} finishing it. Sachs tries to convince the masters to let Walther continue, but Beckmesser sarcastically tells Sachs to stop trying to set policy and instead, to finish making his (Beckmesser's) new shoes, which are overdue. Raising his <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> masters' argument, Walther finishes his song, but the masters reject him and he rushes out of the church.|$|E
