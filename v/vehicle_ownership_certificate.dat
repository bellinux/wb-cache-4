Aunque dentro del Fondo de Empleados se habla de la cultura de servicio que será la diferenciadora de las entidades del sector solidario que son la mayor competencia; entendiendo el servicio tal vez de {{una manera}} equivocada, porque se piensa que el servicio es sólo amabilidad, pero en algunos casos encontramos asociados insatisfechos porque no se le resuelve el inconveniente planteado al Fondo de Empleados catalogándonos de poco flexibles. El punto más neurálgico es en la parte de los créditos donde el Fondo de Empleados cuida los recursos de los asociados y que {{a su vez}} es el capital de trabajo; mediante exigencias restrictivas como codeudores y garantías reales (prenda de vehículo o hipoteca de vivienda), que para algunos asociados no es posible presentar, por esta razón deciden retirarse del Fondo para disponer de sus ahorros, generando con esto una sensación de inconformismo y portadores de una mala imagen, lo más {{conocido}} como el voz a voz. Luego de indagar, identifico que el servicio no es una causa representativa de retiro sino la necesidad de mejorar su flujo de caja pero aún así los asociados no retornan. Para esta elaboración se utilizaron técnicas como la encuesta, la observación, el contacto directo con el asociado y la experiencia, encontrando con ello que los asociados están satisfechos con los servicios pero no fidelizados, además carecen de cultura solidaria donde todos están unidos por el crecimiento y bienestar de quienes pertenecen al Fondo de Empleados, sólo piensan en su beneficio particular, además no pesa sobre ellos el saber que a diferencia de una entidad Bancaria los servicios como ahorro y crédito son retribuidos en las diferentes actividades de Bienestar social, que parte de ellas son extensivas a su grupo familia. La elaboración de este trabajo me ha permitido tener un mejor contacto con el asociado, entender sus necesidades para así buscarle alternativas de solución complementando con lo aprendido en la Especialización Gerencia del Servicio. This work was realized, with the experience that I have gained {{in the time that}} I have been working with UNE Employee Fund, motivated by the desire of knowing all the partners and identifying the causes that lead them to take the decision of withdrawing despite all the benefits and services that the fund offers them. Within the employee fund a lot is said about the service culture which is the fund’s main difference from all the other entities among the solidarity sector which are the greatest competition; although, the service is often misunderstood, because it is believed that the service is only kindness, therefore, we can find partners that feel dissatisfied when their inconveniences are not solved judging the fund of being inflexible. The most neuralgic point in dealing with the credits is the part where the fund takes care of the partners’ resources that are also the working capital; through restrictive requirements such as cosigners and real guarantees (<b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>certificate</b> or home mortgage) that some partners cannot provide, therefore, they decide to withdraw from the fund to use their savings, with this action, they generate a feeling of unpleasantness and then become carriers of a bad image which is best known as the word of mouth. After inquiring, I identify that the service is not a representative retirement cause but the need to improve their cash flow, but still the partners do not return. For this elaboration, I used techniques such as survey, observation, direct contact with the partner and experience, an outcome of this elaboration is that the partners are satisfied with the services indeed but they are not loyal; also, they lack of caring culture where they should be united by the ideals of growth and the common welfare of all of those who belong to the employee fund, they only think about their own benefits, and they are not conscious about knowing that unlike a banking entity the services such as savings and loans are paid back in various social welfare activities, that some of them, are extended to their families. The preparation of this work has allowed me to make better contact with the partner, understanding their needs in order to look for alternative solutions complementing with what I have learned in the Service Management Specialization...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In recent years, {{the number}} of {{registered}} two-wheeled vehicles has been increasing remarkably in the Asian region. This phenomenon is contributing to the worsening transportation problems such as traffic accidents, traffic congestion, and air pollution. Since a two-wheeled vehicle owner tends to shift to a four-wheeled vehicle when economic conditions would permit, these various transportation problems might become worst. However, few researches on two-wheeled <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> in the Asian region have been done. This paper focuses on {{the analysis of the}} characteristics of two-wheeled <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> {{as well as that of}} four-wheeled <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> in the Asia region, especially in the case of Thailand for both the macroscopic and microscopic points of view.

40|$|Abstract Background Neighborhood walkability {{has been}} {{associated}} with physical activity in several studies. However, as environmental correlates of physical activity may be context specific, walkability parameters need to be investigated separately in various countries and contexts. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which walkability affects physical activity have been less investigated. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> is a potential mediator. We investigated the associations between walkability parameters and physical activity, and the mediating and moderating effects of <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> on these associations in a large sample of Swedish adults. Methods Residential density, street connectivity and land use mix were assessed within polygon-based network buffers (using Geographic Information Systems) for 2, 178 men and women. Time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity was assessed by accelerometers, and walking and cycling for transportation were assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Associations were examined by linear regression and adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics. The product of coefficients approach was used to investigate the mediating effect of <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership.</b> Results Residential density and land use mix, but not street connectivity, were significantly associated with time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity and walking for transportation. Cycling for transportation was not associated with any of the walkability parameters. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> mediated a significant proportion of the association between the walkability parameters and physical activity outcomes. For residential density, <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> mediated 25 % of the association with moderate to vigorous physical activity and 20 % of the association with the amount of walking for transportation. For land use mix, the corresponding proportions were 34 % and 14 %. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> did not moderate any of the associations between the walkability parameters and physical activity outcomes. Conclusions Residential density and land use mix were associated with time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity and walking for transportation. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> was a mediator but not a moderator of these associations. The present findings may be useful for policy makers and city planners when designing neighborhoods that promote physical activity. </p...|$|R
40|$|The authors survey past {{trends in}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> and road network {{expansion}} to analyze determinants of their growth {{at the national}} and urban level. Surprisingly, they find that: Nationally, income is {{a major determinant of}} both <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> and road length. Nationally, paved road length and <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> has been increasing about as fast as income, while total road length is increasing less rapidly than income. In urban areas <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> increases as fast as income, while total road length increases very slowly with income. Because national paved road networks are expanding about as fast as national motor vehicle fleets, national congestion is unlikely to be worsening. But because urban road length is growing more slowly than the number of urban motor vehicles, urban congestion is rising with income over time. Increased urban congestion is stimulating decentralized urban growth. Income elasticities are greater than price elasticities in absolute terms, for both <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> and use-an important finding because prices are often used as an instrument to control motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> and use. If price elasticities are half as large as income elasticities, pries would have to grow twice as fast as incomes to stabilize <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership.</b> Breaking the link between income growth, rising congestion, and urban decentralization will be difficult: Restraining auto ownership in urban areas requires high tax rates, and increasing the supply of urban roads is costly. Elasticity estimates vary, but a good point estimate for the income elasticity of fleet growth is 1. This means country motor vehicle fleets grow in proportion to country incomes. More than half the world's annual increase in motor vehicles is likely to occur in high-income countries until 2025 (assuming GNP growth of 3 percent in high-income countries, 5 percent in low- and middle-income countries). The motor vehicle fleet is in low- and middle-income countries is not projected to exceed that in high-income countries until after 2050. Carbon dioxide emissions are likely to be distributed similarly.

40|$|Little {{research}} has focused on how the factors that influence travel behavior change in rapidly developing and increasingly motorized cities. This paper examines household motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> and focuses on potential variations in the preferences revealed through vehicle choice models estimated for Santiago, Chile, in 1991 and 2001 and includes measures of relative location, subway proximity, residential density, and land use mix. The results indicate that preferences changed between 1991 and 2001 and suggest that as incomes rise and <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> becomes increasingly affordable, the apparent influence of demographic, land use, and other contextual variables changes. The results vary across land use and locational variables; most notably, the relationship between <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> and land use mix appears to weaken over time, whereas the effect of the distance to the central business district strengthens, and the effect of residential density varies in the apparent direction of change, depending on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> category. By 2001, proximity to the subway had an apparent effect on the household decision to own three or more vehicles. This research shows that although income and motorization rates rapidly increased in Santiago, certain elements of the built environment influenced household <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership,</b> and these influences changed over time.

However, the limitations and shortcomings of the existing <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> models lead to the low quality forecast in some aspects. Therefore, the thesis surveys the <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> models as well as vehicle fleet models. The research is mainly about the car ownership and fleet model. The currently used car ownership models in Europe are listed and four models are introduced briefly, including their advantages and disadvantages. The relationship between <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> and fleet models are also described. One specific car ownership model is used for numerical test. The tested car ownership model is the sub-model in Sampers’ in Sweden. This model consists of individual entry and exit probability of car ownership. The estimation data {{is the same as}} the data used in Matstoms (2002), which includes the information of the number of cars for different age, gender, income level, and the petrol price, GDP, from 1980 to 1995 in Stockholm, Solna and Sundbyberg. The software used for model estimation is SPSS. The following part is to validate the estimation results and find out the sensitivity of each variable by doing forecasting in Stockholm from 1996 to 2010. The sensitivity analysis shows that the car ownership in Stockholm is most sensitive to petrol price and least sensitive to GDP. We recommend removing the GDP variable and test it by using chi-square test. The chi-square test shows that the GDP variable can be removed from the model.

40|$|Cities {{around the}} world are trying out a wide range of {{transportation}} policy and investment alternatives to reduce car-induced externalities. However, without a solid understanding of how people behave within the constraints from these policies, it is hard to tell which of these policies are really doing the job and which may be inducing unintended problems. The focus of this paper is the determinants of <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> in the motorized city-state context of Singapore. Using survey data from 1997 to 2008, a discrete choice model of <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> suggests that income dominates the household <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> decision. Further modeling, attempting to detect preference change over the years, suggests that the dynamics of income's influence on <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> is changing, perhaps reflecting a combination of the nation's increasingly high ownership costs and expanding transit system. All income groups have become less likely to own cars over time, with households in the lowest income groups apparently being affected the most. For 2008, the distance to rail transit stations had a discernible relationship with households' likelihood of owning more than one car, and accessibility and relative travel costs also influenced <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership.</b> Including these variables, however, had very modest influence on improving model fit. by Yunke Xiang.

The significant evolution of <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> has drawn huge interest of researchers and various methodologies have been applied to study the demand evolution of the automobile market in China, which provide a foundation for further welfare analysis and policy implications. This thesis uses market-level vehicle sales data from 2008 to 2012 in Shanghai, China, together with detailed data on characteristics of the 1, 916 different vehicle models. The models analyzed are Logit Ordinary Least Squares (Logit-OLS), Logit Two-Stage Least Squares (Logit- 2 SLS) and the random-coefficient discrete-choice model of demand [Berry, 1994; Berry et al., 1995]. Results from these three models are compared and discussed. 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between consumer incomes and ages of the durable goods consumed. At the household level, it presents evidence from the Consumer Expenditure Survey of a negative correlation between incomes and ages of the vehicles owned, controlling for {{the size of the}} vehicle stock. At the aggregate level, it constructs a dynamic, heterogeneous agents, discrete choice model with multiple <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership,</b> to study {{the relationship between}} the distribution of consumer incomes and the distribution of vehicle vintages. Two versions of the model are solved, one with the restriction of at most one vehicle per agent and one with multiple <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership.</b> For each version of the model, the parameters are calibrated to match <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> data for 2001. The moments of the income distribution are then varied to generate predictions for mean and median ages of vehicles and the results from the two versions of the model are compared. While these are mostly similar, some of the differences are quite illuminating. ...|$|R
40|$|The fast {{growth of}} vehicle {{population}} in China has caused {{problems such as}} traffic congestion and excessive fuel consumption. There have been demands for policy control on growth in private vehicle travel demand. Beijing and Shanghai are China's first two cities to implement policies on <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> and use. In this paper, we compared policies in the two cities and estimated their impacts on fuel consumption by passenger vehicles. The limitation of vehicle use in Beijing provides limited but immediate reduction in fuel consumption. The limitation of <b>vehicle</b> <b>ownership</b> in Shanghai provides large potential of fuel conservation in a longer term. Under current policy, fuel consumptions by passenger vehicles in Beijing and Shanghai in 2020 were estimated to reach 7. 5 and 3. 9 billion liters, respectively. The experiences of Beijing and Shanghai are highly relevant for cities in China and abroad that are facing the same problems.
