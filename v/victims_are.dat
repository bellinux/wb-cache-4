5|$|At the National September 11 Memorial, {{the names}} of the Pentagon <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> inscribed on the South Pool, on Panels S-1 and S-72 – S-76.|$|E
5|$|The {{canonical}} five Ripper <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Black {{realizes that}} the killer is trying to {{experience}} the sexual encounters he missed out on before his marriage, and that he believes his <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> living the happiest moments of their lives because of his actions. He returns to the Nesbitt home, finding the honeymooning couple locked in a bomb shelter below the house. Black runs upstairs, thinking that Nesbitt will murder his wife, but arrives {{in time to see}} him commit suicide by injection instead.|$|E
25|$|All of Gacy's known murders were {{committed}} inside his Norwood Park ranch house. His <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> typically induced to his address by force or deception, {{and all but}} one of his <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> murdered by either asphyxiation or strangulation with a makeshift tourniquet; his first <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> stabbed to death. Gacy buried 26 of his victims in the crawl space of his home. Three other <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> discarded in the Des Plaines River.|$|R
25|$|Thirteen of the {{nineteen}} <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> teenagers while ten {{out of the}} nineteen <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{women of}} aboriginal descent.|$|R
50|$|<b>Victims</b> <b>were</b> {{taken to}} {{hospitals}} in Moscow, Naro-Fominsk, Odintsovo and Selyatino. Two <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> flown by helicopter to a Moscow hospital.|$|R
5|$|Doggett, {{acting on}} Reyes' insistence that Ed is in danger, stakes out his house. Ed, however, is skinned {{regardless}} of Doggett's attempts to protect him. Reyes admits to Doggett {{that she is}} having flashes of the same premonitions that the <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> experiencing. She tells Doggett that Ed's body was gagged with a rag coated in coal dust from a mine, even though she has never seen his body. Reyes and Doggett head to the mine from which they believe the dust originated. Doggett finds the skeleton of a sheriff who killed himself in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is {{deployed}} to the Westchester County hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, New York, {{which has been}} plagued by a series of brutal slayings in which the <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> found decapitated: Peter Van Garrett (Martin Landau), a wealthy farmer; his son Dirk; and the widow Emily Winship. Crane learns that locals believe the killer is the undead apparition of a headless Hessian mercenary (Christopher Walken) from the American Revolutionary War who rides a black steed in search of his missing head.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious: Merchant of Souls {{documents}} modern human trafficking, specifically sexual slavery. While {{there are}} men and boys who are trafficked around the world, the United States Department of State (DoS) estimates that about 80% of human trafficking <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> female, and the film focuses on them. Information is presented from a Christian worldview—despite the subject matter, there is no profanity or nudity in the film, although there are scenes showing alcohol consumption and women wearing skimpy clothing.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 30,146 {{identified}} and presumed <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{registered in the}} 28 EU Member States in 2010-2012, out of which over a thousand were children trafficked for sexual exploitation. 80 percent of registered <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> female, and 65 percent of registered <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> EU citizens. Of the registered <b>victims</b> who <b>are</b> confirmed as EU citizens, the top 5 countries of citizenship are Bulgaria, Romania, the Netherlands, Hungary and Poland. Over the three years, the top 5 non-EU countries of citizenship of registered <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> Nigeria, Brazil, China, Viet Nam and Russia. There {{has been an increase}} in the number of ¨unknown¨ citizenships from 2010 to 2011. In addition, 71 percent of labor exploitation <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> male in the EU Member States during these three years.|$|R
50|$|Most of the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> over 60 years old, {{though one}} <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a 16-year-old boy. Thirteen {{of those killed}} were women and five <b>were</b> men; all <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> either from Yambol or the nearby villages. More than 15 people were injured; four were {{initially}} in a life-threatening condition due to head trauma.|$|R
50|$|In no {{circumstances}} shall the <b>victim</b> <b>be</b> {{considered to have}} given consent if the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> {{under the age of}} 14 or has a mental disability or illness.|$|R
5|$|The Mittal Steel company {{purchased}} the Omarska mining complex {{and planned to}} resume extraction of iron ore from the site. Mittal Steel announced in Banja Luka on 1 December 2005 that the company would build and finance a memorial in the 'White House' but the project was later abandoned. Many Bosnian Serbs believe {{there should not be}} a memorial, while many Bosniaks believe that construction should be postponed until all the <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> found and only if the entire mine—which is in use—be allocated for the memorial site.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune {{are often}} {{presented}} as tricksters, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud samurai, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. Their <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> usually men; women are possessed instead. For example, kitsune {{are thought to}} employ their kitsunebi to lead travelers astray {{in the manner of}} a will o' the wisp. Another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse its target with illusions or visions. Other common goals of trickster kitsune include seduction, theft of food, humiliation of the prideful, or vengeance for a perceived slight.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious explores how sex {{trafficking}} {{differs from}} country to country, and suggests that all the <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. Nefarious identifies political corruption and difficult socioeconomic situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive {{for more than seven}} years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of Charisma wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.|$|E
50|$|Seven <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{treated at}} the scene. Three <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> wounded by gunfire, {{including}} two TSA officers, identified as 54-year-old James Speer and 36-year-old Tony Grigsby; Grigsby {{was shot in}} the foot. The third shooting <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> 29-year-old Brian Ludmer, a schoolteacher from Lake Forest, Illinois, who {{was shot in the}} leg. Six <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> transported to area hospitals, including three men, two of whom had suffered gunshot wounds, who were treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Some of the injuries were confirmed to have been caused by other factors, not gunshot wounds.|$|R
50|$|The {{bodies of}} the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> taken to the Hamilton County Coroner's Office in Cincinnati, where autopsies found that {{all but one of}} the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> shot {{multiple}} times.|$|R
2500|$|All {{but one of}} his <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> black women. One of his {{suspected}} <b>victims</b> <b>was</b> a black man. Many of his <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> sex workers. One witness {{recalls that}} Franklin frequently brought sex workers into his home. He shot all of his victims with a [...]25 caliber gun. Franklin took many photographs of nude women and kept the records in his garage.|$|R
5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact that, in the United States, the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{debate whether}} Macbeth's vision of Banquo is real or a {{hallucination}}. Macbeth {{had already seen}} a hallucination before murdering Duncan: a knife hovering in the air. Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all, heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad, since the audience cannot see what he claims to see. Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual, ghosts of murdered <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> more believable, having a basis in the audience's superstitions. Spirits in other Shakespeare plays—notably Hamlet and Midsummer Night's Dream—exist in ambiguous forms, occasionally even calling into question their own presence.|$|E
5|$|The worst mining {{disaster}} in the town occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858 when an explosion of firedamp caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives, the youngest victim was 11, and the oldest, 35 years of age. Some of the <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys Colliery cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883, six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson Colliery in Shakerley. On 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and undermanager died at Shakerley Colliery after an explosion of firedamp.|$|E
25|$|Twelve more murders followed, {{often with}} {{multiple}} bodies {{found on the}} same day. In addition to the earlier sprees, two <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> found each day from 14 July to 16. <b>Victims</b> <b>were</b> seemingly selected at random. Many were vulnerable to attack, including children, elderly, vagrants, or people {{under the influence of}} alcohol. Most <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> killed using blunt objects, including hammers and steel construction bars. Blows were often directed at their faces, leaving them unrecognizable. Many <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> also mutilated and tortured; some victims had their eyes gouged out while they were still alive. One pregnant woman had her fetus cut from her womb. No sexual assaults on any <b>victim</b> <b>were</b> reported. Some <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> also robbed of their cell phones and other valuables, their possessions pawned to second-hand shops in the area. However, most victims had their possessions intact. The murders covered a large geographical area. Aside from Dnepropetrovsk, many occurred in outlying areas of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.|$|R
50|$|The <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> casual {{workers and}} either Irish or Romani people. The Romanis were all from one {{extended}} family. The <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> aged between 59 years and 2 years old.|$|R
5000|$|Worker on worker (Type III) - {{both the}} aggressor and the <b>victim</b> <b>are</b> {{employees}} in the same organization. Often, the aggressor is a supervisor, and the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> a subordinate.|$|R
5|$|Two {{memorials}} {{to those}} {{who died in the}} crash were established by the Government of Nova Scotia. One is to the east of the crash site at The Whalesback, a promontory one kilometre (0.6mile) north of Peggy's Cove. The second is a more private, but much larger commemoration located west of the crash site near Bayswater Beach Provincial Park on the Aspotogan Peninsula in Bayswater. Here, the unidentified remains of the <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> interred. A fund was established to fund maintenance of the memorials and the government passed an act to recognize them. Various other charitable funds were also created, including one {{in the name of a}} young victim from Louisiana, Robert Martin Maillet, which provides money for children in need.|$|E
5|$|When a storm begins, {{the crew}} start to set sail. Toby drops a {{polished}} crown while bringing his father a coat. The Siren is summoned and takes Toby. Soon, Rory {{falls into the}} ocean, and the Doctor rationalises that the Siren has shown intelligence and will likely get to Rory before he drowns and convinces her to save him. Believing the <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> not dead, the Doctor convinces Avery and Amy to prick themselves to get the Siren to take them. The Doctor's suspicions are confirmed when the Siren's touch actually teleports them to an alien spaceship, invisible {{in the same spot}} the pirate ship is located.|$|E
5|$|On a {{fence in}} front of the wall, there were {{memorial}} crosses with the names and date of death on them. However, since the government moved to Berlin, the white crosses had to be relocated in 1995 from {{the eastern side of the}} Reichstag. The new location is on the west side of the building at a fence of the Tiergarten. 2003, Wolfgang Thierse inaugurated a new memorial designed by Jan Wehberg with the same name as the one on Reichstagufer. On seven both-sided inscribed crosses are the names of the 13 deaths. Another memorial of the Civil Association was in Bernauer Straße. Other <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> remembered through commemorative plates embedded in sidewalks and other installations which are nearby their death spot. On October 2004, the Working Group 13 August built the Freedom Memorial at Checkpoint Charlie. It reminds people of the victims of the Berlin Wall and the inner German border with 1067 crosses. The memorial had to be removed after about half a year because the landowners terminated the lease with the working group.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{abuse in}} the first degree is a Class D felony if the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> 12 to 17 years old, and a Class C felony if the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> under 12.|$|R
5000|$|Corll's <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{typically}} {{lured to}} {{a succession of}} addresses in which he resided between 1970 and 1973 with an offer of a party or a lift. They would then be restrained by either force or deception, and all were killed by either strangulation or shooting with a [...]22-caliber pistol. Corll and his accomplices buried 17 of their victims in a rented boat shed; four other <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> buried in woodland near Lake Sam Rayburn; one further <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> buried {{on a beach in}} Jefferson County; and at least six <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> buried on a beach on the Bolivar Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, from 1980 to 2008, 84% {{of white}} {{homicide}} <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> killed by white offenders and 93% of black homicide <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> killed by black offenders.|$|R
5|$|Peter {{brings the}} fat men {{back to his}} home to protect them, but after {{learning}} from Brian that Patrick is the killer, a chase between the fat men and Patrick ensues. Brian, still at the house, shows Patrick's room to Lois, where several of his <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> either deceased or had been left for dead, and photographic evidence of Patrick killing them. Lois continues to make crazy excuses, still wanting to believe her brother is a sane person, but ultimately she snaps out of her denial and realizes that Patrick is dangerous. Lois and Brian pursue Patrick and Peter into the woods, where Patrick is strangling Peter. Patrick quickly releases Peter after Lois threatens to stab Marion, his imaginary wife. Patrick apologizes, telling Lois that he never meant to hurt her, and the two agree he should be sent back to the mental hospital, where Lois and the family plan to visit him once a month.|$|E
5|$|The <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> {{informed}} by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; {{one is in}} the room's safe, and a cryptic clue is provided. Xavier ignores a warning note and uses a key on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole and Gus' eye, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets them out, with no success: Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside, but inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes; In the next room, Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe-filled pit intended for himself, and though {{she is able to}} retrieve the key, he is unable to unlock the steel door behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires and he leaves out of frustration. Throughout the game, they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; the sole exception is Daniel, who has nonetheless been arrested before.|$|E
25|$|Dark-skinned <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> clearly overrepresented.|$|E
50|$|The age {{of consent}} in Grenada is 16.Penalties are 30 years' {{imprisonment}} if the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> less than 14, and 15 years' imprisonment if the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> 14 to 16 years of age.|$|R
50|$|When <b>Victim</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on VHS in the U.S. in 1986, it received the PG-13 rating. When <b>Victim</b> <b>was</b> re-released in the United Kingdom, it was reclassified with the much milder PG/12 rating.|$|R
50|$|The {{identifiable}} <b>victim</b> {{effect has}} <b>been</b> contested in academia. Critics argue that, when a <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> identified, {{information such as}} age and gender of the <b>victim</b> <b>are</b> revealed and people are especially sympathetic {{in response to that}} information rather than to identifiability per se.|$|R
