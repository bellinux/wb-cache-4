Host range, transmission of virus, helper functions, interference properties, and specific neutralization showed that the CCC and the RD- 114 isolates as well as their respective MSV pseudotypes are closely similar if not identical. Parental, virus-negative cells frozen before the existence of RD- 114 were chemically induced to yield CCC-like virus de novo.

Sera derived from chimpanzees immunized with homologous HCV glycoproteins neutralized <b>pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> infectivity (L. M. Lagging et al., J. Virol. 72, 3539 – 3546, 1998). We have now extended this study to further understand the role of HCV glycoproteins in <b>pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> entry. Although a number of mammalian epithelial cells were susceptible to VSV/HCV <b>pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> infection, plaquing efficiency was different among host cell lines. <b>Pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> adsorption at low temperature decreased plaque numbers. Treatment of E 1 or E 2 <b>pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> in media between pH 5 and 8 before adsorption on cells did not significantly reduce plaque numbers. On the other hand, treatment of cells with lysosomotropic agents or inhibitors of vacuolar H+ ATPases had an inhibitory role on virus entry. Concanavalin A, a plant lectin, exhibited neutralization of both HCV E 1 and E 2 <b>pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> infectivity. However, mannose binding protein, a C-type mammalian lectin, did not neutralize virus in the absence or presence of serum complement. <b>Pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> infectivity was only partially inhibited by heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, in a saturable manner. Additional studies suggested that low-density lipoprotein receptor related molecules partially inhibit E 1 <b>pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> infectivity, while CD 81 related molecules interfere with E 2 <b>pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> infectivity.

40|$|Through an {{extensive}} high-throughput screening campaign, a rigorous chemistry program, and molecular modeling, {{we have developed}} a novel small molecule inhibitor for the cysteine protease human cathepsin L that exhibits strong potencies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>pseudotype</b> infections. Following a 57, 821 compound high-throughput screen of the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository, a unique thiocarbazate chemotype for cathepsin L inhibition was identified through chemical synthesis and structure elucidation. Kinetic analysis of this compound, PubChem substance identifier (SID) 26681509, reveals it is a competitive, slow-binding, slowly reversible, and selective inhibitor of human cathepsin L with Ki = 890 pM. Synthesis of analogs to this thiocarbazate probe established structure-activity relationships that resulted in synthesis of SID 46493575. SID 46493575 exhibits similar slow-binding inhibition behavior as its precursor with Ki = 150 pM. In SID 46493575, the thiocarbazate sulfur of SID 26681509 was replaced by oxygen and the hydrophobicity of the P 12 ̆ 7 substructure was improved from 2 -ethylphenyl anilide to tetrahydroquinoline anilide. Molecular docking studies demonstrate both compounds form hydrophobic interactions within the S 2 and S 12 ̆ 7 subsites as well as hydrogen bonding interactions with five key residues (Gln 19, Cys 25, Gly 66, Asp 158, and Trp 177) in the active site of papain. SID 46493575 forms an additional hydrogen bond with His 159, which could explain its increased biological potency. Both molecules were non-toxic to human aortic endothelial cells and zebrafish. Tetrahydroquinoline probe SID 46493575 prevented SARS-CoV pseudotype entry with IC 50 = 273 nM and Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>pseudotype</b> entry with IC 50 = 193 nM.

This protein, p 20, was originally identified in preparations of a defective woolly monkey leukemia <b>virus</b> <b>pseudotype</b> of Kirsten sarcoma virus.

However, the proteins were not identical, because their tryptic maps differed. Using a competition radioimmunoassay, we have measured the concentration of p 20 in cells, viruses, and rat tissues: p 20 was not encoded by rat sarcoma viruses because it was increased only slightly after Kirsten sarcoma virus transformation of rat cells and was not increased in nonrat cells transformed by the Kirsten or Harvey sarcoma virus.

Competition studies of consensus V 3 peptides demonstrated {{that the majority of}} the cross-reactive Cameroonian sera contained cross-reactive antibodies that reacted strongly with both V 3 sequences. V 3 -specific antibodies purified from all six cross-reactive sera examined had potent neutralizing activity for <b>virus</b> <b>pseudotyped</b> with envelope proteins (Env) from SF 162, a neutralization-sensitive clade B primary isolate. For four of these samples, neutralization of SF 162 pseudotypes was blocked by both the clade A and clade B V 3 fusion proteins, indicating that this activity was mediated by cross-reactive antibodies.

We observed {{that the amount of}} viral antigen from VSV-G <b>pseudotyped</b> human immunodeficiency <b>virus</b> type 1 (HIV- 1) producing cells was much higher than that from their non-pseudotyped counterparts. This enhanced viral antigen production was not observed when we used HIV- 1 pol mutant, viral enzyme inhibitors, HIV Env protein, or VSV-G fusion defective mutants. The transfection experiment using GFP-expressing virus showed time-dependent expansion of GFP-positive cells and viral DNA integration. These results suggested that the increase in viral antigen yield was caused by the release of a progeny virus following retro-transduction by the <b>pseudotyped</b> <b>virus</b> of the cells within the transfected cell culture. The infectivity as well as the amount of VSV-G on virus particles per unit of viral antigen was significantly different before and after the onset of the yield enhancement. This suggests that results of infection assays of the <b>virus</b> <b>pseudotyped</b> with VSV-G may be affected by the occurrence of such enhancement. This means that, while pseudotyping with VSV-G is a simple and effective method, this procedure should be carefully considered when the virus is produced for infectivity assays...|$|R

Absence of antiviral antibodies was noted in those animals whose tissues contained replicating virus. These studies confirm the observations with X-tropic virus in tissue culture.

Various chimeric transmembrane proteins possessing the V domain of human SLAM were able to act as MV receptors, whereas a chimera consisting of human SLAM containing the mouse V domain instead of the human V domain no longer acted as a receptor. To examine the interaction between SLAM and MV envelope proteins, recombinant soluble forms of SLAM were produced. The soluble molecules possessing the V domain of human SLAM were shown to bind to cells expressing the MV hemagglutinin (H) protein but not to cells expressing the MV fusion protein or irrelevant envelope proteins.

Results: <b>Pseudotyped</b> <b>virus</b> could be neutralized by specific 2 B 4 monoclonal antibody at doses of 50 μL (500 μg), 25 μL (250 μg) and 12. 5 μL (125 μg), which showed {{that it was a}} feasible assay to screen drugs.

This pseudotype system will facilitate the detection of neutralizing antibodies against virulent influenza viruses, circumventing the need for high-level biosafety containment...|$|R
40|$|The pP 60 gag polyprotein of the feline leukemia <b>virus</b> <b>pseudotype</b> of m 1 Moloney murine sarcoma virus [m 1 MSV(FeLV) ] was {{previously}} {{shown to be}} MSV specific and to contain murine p 30 and smaller structural polypeptides. This protein was detected in m 1 MSV-transformed cells, and in pulse-chase studies it {{was found to be}} stable. In this study virion P 60 was shown to contain murine pp 12, to be phosphorylated, and to bind to nucleic acids. 32 P-labeled m 1 MSV[FeLV) was fractionated by guanidine agarose chromatography and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Both P 60 and pp 12 were found to be the major phosphoproteins, phosphorylated in both serine and threonine residues. Virion P 60 bound preferentially to single-stranded DNA and RNA in a competition filter binding assay, using 125 I-labeled single-stranded calf thymus DNA and various unlabeled nucleic acids. Similar phosphorylation and DNA binding properties were demonstrated for cellular P 60. Thus, immunoprecipitation of cellular extracts showed that P 60 was phosphorylated in both producer and nonproducer transformed cells, indicating that phosphorylation occurs independently of virus assembly. Moreover, P 60 from cytoplasmic extracts was retained on single-stranded DNA-Sepharose columns, demonstrating that cellular P 60 binds to DNA...|$|E
40|$|Feline leukaemia {{virus and}} the feline leukaemia <b>virus</b> <b>pseudotype</b> of murine sarcoma (MSV(FeLV)) readily {{propagate}} in cat embryo cells. Feline leukaemia virus will rapidly attain high titres even if minimal virus inocula are used initially, and undiminished virus production will be maintained in the chronically infected cells. Feline leukaemia virus, which was previously quantitated as helper activity for defective MSV (FeLV), {{has now been}} related {{to the amount of}} autonomously repli-cating feline leukaemia virus. Rapid growth ofMSV (FeLV) to high titre is obtained only if each sarcoma infected cell also becomes the recipient of a replicating unit of feline leukaemia virus. Conditions approximating one-step growth curves for both feline leukaemia virus alone and MSV (FeLV) -feline leukaemia virus complex can be achieved and show that first cycles of growth are completed within about 4 o and 3 o hr, respectively. The rate of growth of the sarcoma-leukaemia v rus complex is somewhat faster than that of leukaemia virus by itself, which can result in ratios of replicating leukaemia to sarcoma viruses of less than unity. Inhibition of DNA synthesis during the first 12 hr after infection with either virus prevents virus replica-tion. The requirement for DNA synthesis is not seen beyond the first I 2 hr after infection. No stimulation of DNA synthesis is discernible after either feline leukaemia virus or MSV (FeLV) inoculation at ny time after infection...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, high {{pathogenicity}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) virus, H 5 N 1, low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus, H 9 N 2, and both HPAI and LPAI H 7 viruses have proved devastating for the affected economies reliant on poultry industry, and have posed serious public health concerns. These viruses have repeatedly caused zoonotic disease in humans, raising concerns {{of a potential}} influenza pandemic. Despite {{the focus on the}} HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreak in 1997 some H 7 strains have also shown to be occasionally adaptable to infecting humans. Therefore, applying knowledge of the H 5 virus evolution and spread to the development of sensitive serological methods is likely to improve our ability to understand and respond to the emergence of other HPAI and LPAI viruses, present within the avian populations, with the potential to infect humans and other species. In the present study we describe the construction and production of lentiviral pseudotypes bearing envelope glycoproteins of LPAI and HPAI H 7 avian influenza viruses, which have been responsible for several outbreaks in the past decade. The H 7 pseudotypes were evaluated in pseudotype-based neutralization (pp-NT) assays in order to detect and quantify the presence of neutralizing antibodies in avian sera, which were confirmed H 7 positive by inhibition of haemagglutination (HI) test. Overall, our results substantiate influenza <b>virus</b> <b>pseudotype</b> neutralization as a robust tool for influenza sero-surveillance...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a system for producing murine leukemia <b>virus</b> (MLV) <b>pseudotyped</b> with human hepatitis B virus (HBV) large (L) and small (S) surface antigens (HBsAg) for targeting primary human hepatocytes. Using the MLV(HBV) <b>pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> containing a β-galactosidase reporter gene, we demonstrated that this <b>pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> exhibits strict tropism for primary human hepatocytes, similar to the natural target cell specificity of HBV. It does not infect any of the established tissue culture cell lines, including human hepatoma cell lines (HepG 2 and Huh- 7), or rat primary hepatocytes. The infectivity of MLV(HBV) for human hepatocytes was inhibited by anti-HBs antibody. The L form of HBsAg was both necessary and sufficient for virus infectivity, but the presence of both L and S forms enhanced the surface expression of HBsAg and thus increased virus production. The middle form of HBsAg was not necessary. This <b>pseudotype</b> <b>virus</b> bypasses the requirement for the liver-specific transcription factors for HBV replication, enabling direct study of HBV tissue tropism conferred by the viral envelope proteins. This virus also offers a potential liver-specific targeting system for gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|As {{noted in}} other flaviviruses, the {{envelope}} (E) protein of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) interacts with a cellular receptor and mediates membrane fusion to allow viral entry into target cells, thus eliciting neutralizing antibody response. The {{formation of the}} flavivirus prM/E complex {{is followed by the}} cleavage of precursor membrane (prM) and membrane (M) protein by a cellular signalase. To test the effect of prM in JEV biology, we constucted JEV-MuLV <b>pseudotyped</b> <b>viruses</b> that express the prM/E protein or E only. The infectivity and titers of JEV <b>pseudotyped</b> <b>viruses</b> were examined in several cell lines. We also analyzed the neutralizing capacities with anti-JEV sera from JEV-immunized mice. Even though prM is crucial for multiple stages of JEV biology, the JEV-pseudotyped viruses produced with prM/E or with E only showed similar infectivity and titers in several cell lines and similar neutralizing sensitivity. These results showed that JEV-MuLV <b>pseudotyped</b> <b>viruses</b> did not require prM for production of infectious <b>pseudotyped</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractClassical {{swine fever}} virus (CSFV) is the causative agent of {{classical}} swine fever. Its envelope comprises glycoproteins Erns, E 1, and E 2. In this study, we showed that the unmodified CSFV glycoproteins could incorporate into the HIV core to generate an infectious CSFV <b>pseudotyped</b> <b>virus.</b> The infection was specific to several porcine cell lines, and could be neutralized by anti-E 2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) completely and by anti-Erns mAbs partially, indicating that this <b>pseudotyped</b> <b>virus</b> can mimic the early infection steps of parental CSFV. To investigate the specific role of each envelope protein involved in viral entry, a series of <b>pseudotyped</b> <b>viruses</b> were generated bearing CSFV glycoproteins in various combinations. It was found that specific infectivity was also achieved with non-Erns <b>pseudotyped</b> <b>virus</b> carrying E 1 and E 2 glycoproteins. This indicated that E 1 and E 2 are sufficient to mediate CSFV entry, and Erns is not indispensable in this process...|$|R
