5000|$|Employee silence {{can occur}} in any organization, most often in {{organizations}} where communication is suffering. Employee silence causes the most damage when employees and supervisors do not meet on a regular basis. In a <b>virtual</b> <b>workplace</b> this is also true. In a <b>virtual</b> <b>workplace</b> the only in-person communication is in small discussion groups. This kind of organization is very susceptible to employee silence because {{there is almost no}} person-to-person communication, and it is very easy to ignore or misinterpret things like email. Employee silence is a problem for more than just virtual organizations. Within the past few years employee silence has been happening more often in non-virtual organizations. [...] Organizations where considerable risk is involved such as airports and “hospitals; should be especially mindful of” employee silence. This is because mistakes caused by employee silence in these organizations can lead to the loss of life or serious damage costs to the organization.|$|E

40|$|In a {{time when}} {{technology}} {{is an integral part}} of life, <b>virtual</b> <b>workplaces</b> are becoming more of a staple in organizations and will likely continue to do so as technology use increases (Cascio, 2000). Due to the rise in <b>virtual</b> <b>workplaces,</b> employees are interacting face-to-face less, and organizations are requiring more from them. Employees must perform behaviors that are outside of their formal job description. These positive behaviors are considered to be organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), which are employee behaviors that promote organizational effectiveness that are not part of an employee’s formal job description and are therefore not formally recognized by the organization’s reward system (Organ 1988, 1997). No research to date has examined whether employees can engage in OCBs through a virtual medium. This study worked to develop a model for assessing virtual OCBs using a four-factor traditional face-to-face measure as a starting point. Items were generated, categorized, and then analyzed using a confirmatory factor analysis. A three-factor model demonstrated the best fit, but because the items in the fourth factor demonstrated content validity, recommendations regarding model revisions are provided...|$|R

This new focus on knowledge and information within organizations has changed the way they function {{on a daily basis}} and has made it apparent that [...] "as knowledge-intensive work gradually becomes the cornerstone of this economy, understanding its control practices is consequential to organizational effectiveness, worker satisfaction and ethical conditions of organizational governance". With this [...] "knowledge intensive work" [...] at the forefront of most organizations, the efficient transmission of this knowledge and information now becomes a major priority to be carried out in the workplace. The introduction of the Internet in the workplace allowed employees to transmit information electronically not only to others in their own office but those in other countries as well. Technology began to facilitate the rapid exchange of information for these organizations and thus contributed to a structural change in how they operate. These changes prompted researchers to delve deeper into the issues surrounding organizational technoethics in how technology was shaping the workplace, whether positively or negatively, and the ethical issues that may arise.The use of ICTs within organizations have given way to a new kind of office setting where physically being in the office is not mandatory to get the job done. This recent trend coined by many as the <b>virtual</b> <b>workplace</b> involves several workplaces that are connected through technology and are not hindered by physical restraints. Telecommuting, the hot desk, and virtual teams are the three major types of virtual workplaces that have been made possible through the use of technology and have changed the way many organizations communicate and transmit information.|$|E

The phases, although prevalent in different stages in different countries, have been characterised by various technological developments. The <b>virtual</b> <b>workplace</b> evolved {{as part of}} the Information Age or Fifth Wave, bringing with it its own unique characteristics and requirements. These unique characteristics, such as the speed at which information is communicated, crossing of time and space boundaries, social networks and requirements, such as sustainable high speed internet connectivity, are evident in the relationship between people, processes and the <b>virtual</b> <b>workplace.</b> This study explored the manner in which virtual workers executed their activities through the use of technology, the type of business processes supporting them and the challenges experienced by them. The proposed framework for the management of people, processes and places in the <b>virtual</b> <b>workplace</b> was subsequently derived.

The purpose of the research is to determine if there are specific mindsets required to make the implementation of a <b>virtual</b> <b>workplace</b> more successful, with the aim of making recommendations to organisations, managers, teams and individuals for improved implementation strategies. The research defined the target population as a large South African Information and Communication Technology (ICT) company, and its customers. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used. Data relating to needs, perceptions, practicality and readiness concerning the <b>virtual</b> <b>workplace</b> was collected on three levels, namely individual, team and organisational level. The quantitative research covered the objectives relating to the individual level through questionnaires which were sent out in the form of online surveys. The qualitative research covered the organisational level research through individual interviews with the IT/HR managers, while the team level research was covered through focus group interviews. The study found that various mindsets and needs do exist, and on an individual level the mindsets and needs are not restricted to specific generations. This could be of significance to HR and IT managers in general, who may need to take a wider target group into consideration when designing policies and standards for the organisation. Secondly the organisation itself emerged as an entity with a mindset or culture that transcends the individuals working for the organisation. To implement a <b>virtual</b> <b>workplace</b> would, therefore, require an overarching strategy and organisational change interventions to ensure that all the facets of a <b>virtual</b> <b>workplace</b> are addressed in a balanced way.
