25|$|When {{a feature}} has both artistic (copyrightable) and {{functional}} (patentable) merits, {{when the question}} has appeared in US court, the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can {{be separated from the}} functional aspects of the item. In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing, for example, the design of a useful device to be registered (as a whole) as an industrial design on the understanding that, in case of unauthorized copying, only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a <b>valid</b> <b>patent.</b>|$|E
500|$|Unaware that Welburn had seated the land, the {{authorities}} declared Chincoteague Island abandoned and issued another patent {{for the land}} in December 1684 to John Clayton, who conveyed it to Colonel William [...] Kendall of Northampton. [...] When Welburn learned that Kendall was planning to seat the land himself, he threatened to shoot trespassers on the island. [...] Instead, Welburn sued, and the case dragged on in the Accomack County courts until the local justices transferred it to the General Court {{in the capital of}} Williamsburg. [...] Welburn lost the case, as the General Court ruled in 1691 that as Jenifer had never lived on the island, he had not conveyed a <b>valid</b> <b>patent</b> to Welburn. [...] Fresh patents were then issued, dividing the island between Kendall and another prominent citizen of Northampton, Major John Robins, with the dividing line near present-day Church Street.|$|E
60|$|Suppose that by a {{subscription}} {{of the rich}} the eighteen pence a day which men earn now was made up five shillings, it might be imagined, perhaps, that they would {{then be able to}} live comfortably and have a piece of meat every day for their dinners. But this would be a very false conclusion. The transfer of three shillings and sixpence a day to every labourer would not increase the quantity of meat in the country. There is not at present enough for all to have a decent share. What would then be the consequence? The competition among the buyers in the market of meat would rapidly raise the price from sixpence or sevenpence, to two or three shillings in the pound, and the commodity would not be divided among many more than it is at present. When an article is scarce, and cannot be distributed to all, he that can shew the most <b>valid</b> <b>patent,</b> that is, he that offers most money, becomes the possessor. If we can suppose the competition among the buyers of meat to continue long enough for a greater number of cattle to be reared annually, this could only be done {{at the expense of the}} corn, which would be a very disadvantagous exchange, for it is well known that the country could not then support the same population, and when subsistence is scarce in proportion to the number of people, it is of little consequence whether the lowest members of the society possess eighteen pence or five shillings. They must at all events be reduced to live upon the hardest fare and in the smallest quantity.|$|E

40|$|Patents fuel {{innovation}} and are becoming an ever-more important form of protection in this technological age. Society {{also has a}} vested interest in only <b>valid</b> <b>patents</b> being issued and enforced. <b>Patents</b> are presumed <b>valid</b> once they are issued and also currently enjoy the application of a heavy burden of proof—clear and convincing evidence—to overcome that presumption when their validity is questioned at trial. This burden has started to be questioned as the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office becomes more taxed by the increasing influx of patent applications. Current precedent conflicts with past precedent and with general principles of administrative law. This Note argues that the application of a clear and convincing burden of proof should be revisited and ultimately lowered to a preponderance of the evidence standard in order to only enforce <b>valid</b> <b>patents...</b>|$|R

In the US, for example, an inventor must budget $1 million or more in order to initiate patent litigation. They say that patent pirates also take advantage of countries where patent rights are difficult to enforce and willfully infringe in those countries.|$|R
40|$|Courts have {{traditionally}} granted injunctive relief 'automatically' upon finding infringement of <b>valid</b> <b>patents</b> {{on the basis}} that it is the essence of the patent right to exclude others. But the U. S. Supreme Court signalled a change in 2006 when they vacated the Federal Court's order granting injunction against eBay for willfully infringing <b>valid</b> <b>patents</b> of MercExchange. The ruling {{comes at a time when}} the debate on what have pejoratively been called 'patent trolls' have taken centre stage. This paper examines the issues connected to patent trolls and analyses cases post-eBay to study the effect that eBay has had on patent infringement litigation. The analysis shows that the economic status of the patentee and the nature of the patent itself can adversely affect the exclusive rights granted by the patent. This is because non-competing patentees and a patent which covers only a small component of the overall product are less likely to obtain an injunctive relief. Denial of injunctive relief results in judicially-instituted compulsory licensing of patents which dramatically scales down the bargaining power of the patentee during licensing fee negotiations. Wrongly being adjudged a 'troll' can have dramatic effects on the incentive for investment and innovation. Consequently, the paper argues that acceptance of the concept of patent 'troll' is likely to result in more harm to innovation that otherwise. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Einstein and Szilárd proposed that a device without moving parts would eliminate the potential for seal failure, and explored practical applications for different refrigeration cycles.

40|$|In recent years, patent {{protection}} has extended into new areas, {{giving rise to}} serious concern {{about the lack of}} clear guidelines for patentability. We analyze the effect of introducing a patent opposition process that would allow patent validity to be challenged directly after a patent is granted. In many cases, such a system would avoid costly litigation at a later date. In other cases, the opposition process would increase the cost of conflict resolution, but would also reward holders of <b>valid</b> <b>patents</b> and limit the rewards to invalid patents. Our analysis suggests significant positive welfare gains from the introduction of a patent opposition process. ...|$|R
