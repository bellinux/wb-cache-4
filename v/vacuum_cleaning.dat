40|$|The {{preparation}} of composites in space {{depends on the}} immersion of reinforcements in a liquid-metal matrix and their uniform, stable dispersion in the bulk products until solidification occurs.

Experiment then confirmed that the use of a <b>vacuum</b> environment, <b>cleaning</b> of all surfaces, elevated temperature, ion bombardment, and vigorous mechanical agitation enabled the immersion and dispersion of candidate reinforcements.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that surface {{contaminants}} on semiconductors can be removed when samples are exposed to atomic hydrogen. Atomic H reacts with oxides and carbides on the surface, forming compounds that are liberated and subsequently pumped away. Experiments at Jefferson lab with bulk GaAs in a low-voltage ultra-high <b>vacuum</b> H <b>cleaning</b> chamber have resulted in the production of photocathodes with high photoelectron yield (i. e., quantum efficiency) and long lifetime. A small, portable H cleaning apparatus also has been constructed to successfully clean GaAs samples that are later removed from the vacuum apparatus, transported through air and installed in a high-voltage laser-driven spin-polarized electron source. These results indicate that this method is a versatile and robust alternative to conventional wet chemical etching procedures usually employed to clean bulk GaAs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} the process requirements and the electrical design topology being developed to facilitate large scale production of amorphous diamond films on aluminum. The patented recipe, that includes other surface modification processes, requires various operational voltages, duty cycles, and current load regimes {{to ensure a}} high quality film.

Unfortunately, process requirements are in a regime that is not easily achievable by solid state or very efficiently by vacuum tube devices.

5000|$|Booth {{is known}} for {{introducing}} {{one of the first}} powered vacuum cleaners. Before Booth introduced his version of the <b>vacuum</b> cleaner, <b>cleaning</b> machines blew or brushed dirt away, instead of sucking it up. As Booth recalled decades later, in 1901 he attended [...] "a demonstration of an American machine by its inventor" [...] at the Empire Music Hall in London. The inventor is not named, but Booth's description of the machine conforms fairly closely to American inventor John S. Thurman blown air design. Booth watched a demonstration of the device, which blew dust off the chairs, and thought that [...] "...if the system could be reversed, and a filter inserted between the suction apparatus and the outside air, whereby the dust would be retained in a receptacle, the real solution of the hygienic removal of dust would be obtained." [...] He tested the idea by laying a handkerchief on the seat of a restaurant chair, putting his mouth to the handkerchief, and then trying to suck up as much dust as he could onto the handkerchief. Upon seeing the dust and dirt collected {{on the underside of the}} handkerchief, he realized the idea could work.|$|R
