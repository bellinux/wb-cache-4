Many wooded tree lines and hedgerows follow field lines depicted on old Civil War-era map sketches. The remnants of many old roadways also remain, evidenced by stonework, fences, tree lines, and bridge abutments. The field lines include numerous large black walnut, hackberry, black locust, honey locust, chinquapin oak, and eastern redcedar trees. The western side of the {{property is}} a steep hill which old photos from the 1930s show as farmed but which are now wooded. A well-preserved abandoned roadway follows a sunken course along the western perimeter of the property. A few osage orange trees remain near the roadway and drop their large green tennis ball sized fruits on the ground. The eastern part of the property is a roughly 30-acre tract of pasture land that contains multiple scattered small woodlots, most of which surround abrupt rock outcrops of 20 feet or more. These woodlots, which also show up on 1930s-era aerial photos, are dominated by very large red and white oaks, hickories, and other deciduous trees that may be remnants of <b>virgin</b> <b>tree</b> cover. Several other areas of rock outcroppings support dense patches of eastern redcedar. The Doub Farm pastures, combined with the similar pastures on the adjoining Baker Farm, provide some of the best remaining grassland bird habitat in a region where much of that habitat has been lost to plowing, urbanization, and forest succession.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The major {{economic}} product of Hevea brasiliensis is a rubber-containing cytoplasm (latex), which flows out of laticifers (latex cells) when the bark is tapped. The latex yield is stimulated by ethylene. Sucrose, the unique precursor of rubber synthesis, must cross the plasma membrane through specific sucrose transporters before being metabolized in the laticifers. The {{relative importance of}} sucrose transporters in determining latex yield is unknown. Here, the effects of ethylene (by application of Ethrel on sucrose transporter gene expression in the inner bark tissues and latex cells of H. brasiliensis are described. METHODS: Experiments, including cloning sucrose transporters, real time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, were carried out on <b>virgin</b> (untapped) <b>trees,</b> treated or untreated with the latex yield stimulant Ethrel. KEY RESULTS: Seven putative full-length cDNAs of sucrose transporters were cloned from a latex-specific cDNA library. These transporters belong to all SUT (sucrose transporter) groups and differ by their basal gene expression in latex and inner soft bark, with a predominance of HbSUT 1 A and HbSUT 1 B. Of these sucrose transporters, only HbSUT 1 A and HbSUT 2 A were distinctly increased by ethylene. Moreover, this increase was shown to be specific to laticifers and to ethylene application. CONCLUSION: The data and all previous information on sucrose transport show that HbSUT 1 A and HbSUT 2 A {{are related to the}} increase in sucrose import into laticifers, required for the stimulation of latex yield by ethylene in <b>virgin</b> <b>trees...</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} and middle 18th century the {{construction}} of forts all along the Old Mine Road (today US 209) was necessary to protect the settlers from hostile Indians. There were three forts built in Mamakating. Fort Westbrookville was built in 1750 on {{what is now the}} Sullivan and Orange county border and until several years ago it was a restaurant. In 1757 a fort was built north of the village of Wurtsboro and it was called Fort Devans. A building was later added to make it larger and it is now owned by the operators of Wurtsboro Airport. Another fort was built {{on the east side of}} the Bloomingburgh Mountain. It was called Fort Roosa and was built in 1731. It is still standing and is considered the oldest building in Sullivan County. Many people traveling the old mine road from Kingston found land that was good for planting crops, plenty of game to hunt, streams filled with fish, and <b>virgin</b> <b>trees</b> to build homes.

The molecular weight (MW) and molecular weight distribution (MWD) of rubber molecules were measured using a gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). It was found that variation in MW and MWD of natural rubber depended on the age and clone of rubber tree. An increased age of rubber clone BPM 24 (3, 5 and 8 years) and KRS 156 (1, 15 and 25 years) also increased the MW and MWD of rubber.

40|$|The latex of Hevea brasiliensis, {{expelled}} upon bark tapping, is the cytoplasm of anastomosed latex {{cells in}} the inner bark of the rubber tree. Latex regeneration between two tappings {{is one of the}} major limiting factors of rubber yield. Hevea species contain high amounts of cyanogenic glucosides from which cyanide is released when the plant is damaged providing an efficient defense mechanism against herbivores. In H. brasiliensis, the cyanogenic glucosides mainly consist of the monoglucoside linamarin (synthesized in the leaves), and its diglucoside transport-form, linustatin. Variations in leaf cyanide potential (CNp) were studied using various parameters. Results showed that the younger the leaf, the higher the CNp. Leaf CNp greatly decreased when leaves were directly exposed to sunlight. These results allowed us to determine the best leaf sampling conditions for the comparison of leaf CNp. Under these conditions, leaf CNp was found to vary from less than 25 mM to more than 60 mM. The rubber clones containing the highest leaf CNp were those with the highest yield potential. In mature <b>virgin</b> <b>trees,</b> the CNp of the trunk inner bark was shown to be proportional to leaf CNp and to decrease on tapping. However, the latex itself exhibited very low (if any) CNp, while harboring all the enzymes (beta-D-diglucosidase, linamarase and beta-cyanoalanine synthase) necessary to metabolize cyanogenic glucosides to generate non-cyanogenic compounds, such as asparagine. This suggests that in the rubber tree bark, cyanogenic glucosides may be a source of buffering nitrogen and glucose, thereby contributing to latex regeneration/production...|$|R

40|$|Ethylene is {{commonly}} used as a latex stimulant of Hevea brasiliensis by application of ethephon (chloro- 2 -ethylphosphonic acid); however, the molecular mechanism by which ethylene increases latex production is not clear. To better understand the effects of ethylene stimulation on the laticiferous cells of rubber trees, a latex expressed sequence tag (EST) -based complementary DNA microarray containing 2, 973 unique genes (probes) was first developed and {{used to analyze the}} gene expression changes in the latex of the mature <b>virgin</b> rubber <b>trees</b> after ethephon treatment at three different time-points: 8, 24 and 48 h. Transcript levels of 163 genes were significantly altered with fold-change values ≥ 2 or ≤ - 2 (q-value < 0. 05) in ethephon-treated rubber trees compared with control trees. Of the 163 genes, 92 were up-regulated and 71 down-regulated. The microarray results were further confirmed using real-time quantitative reverse transcript-PCR for 20 selected genes. The 163 ethylene-responsive genes were involved in several biological processes including organic substance metabolism, cellular metabolism, primary metabolism, biosynthetic process, cellular response to stimulus and stress. The presented data suggest that the laticifer water circulation, production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species, sugar metabolism, and assembly and depolymerization of the latex actin cytoskeleton might play important roles in ethylene-induced increase of latex production. The results may provide useful insights into understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of ethylene on latex metabolism of H. brasiliensis...|$|R

However, introduced ship rats (Rattus rattus) undermine its conservation value. Three unsuccessful eradication attempts have been conducted since 1990, with the latest in 2006; rats were trapped 1. 5 years later. We examined microsatellite DNA and mitochondrial DNA sequences of ship rats from Congo Cay and three other nearby cays to determine if rats found after the most recent eradication effort were surviving individuals or reinvaders from neighboring cays; we had no pre-eradication samples. Only one mitochondrial haplotype was present, implying that historically there was a single invasion or if multiple invasions, rats came from a single source with limited haplotype diversity. Low genetic variation on Congo Cay suggested either a population bottleneck resulting from survivors or a founder event resulting from invaders. FST estimates, cluster distances, migrant detections, and factorial correspondence analysis indicated low but meaningful levels of gene flow between Congo and Lovango Cays and between Mingo and Grass Cays. Except for two alleles, all other alleles found on Congo were also present on Lovango. Without pre-eradication samples we could not eliminate the possibility of survivors from a failed eradication. However, our data suggest reinvasion from Lovango Cay was likely and that future eradication efforts should consider both pairs of cays as eradication units.

40|$|Natural rubber is {{synthesized}} in specialized articulated cells (laticifers) {{located in}} the inner liber of Hevea brasiliensis. Upon bark tapping, the laticifer cytoplasm (latex) is expelled due to liber tissue turgor pressure. In mature <b>virgin</b> (untapped) <b>trees,</b> short-term kinetic studies confirmed that ethylene, the rubber yield stimulant used worldwide, increased latex yield, with a concomitant decrease in latex total solid content, probably through water influx in the laticifers. As the mature laticifers are devoid of plasmodesmata, the rapid water exchanges with surrounding liber cells probably occur via the aquaporin pathway. Two full-length aquaporin cDNAs (HbPIP 2; 1 and HbTIP 1; 1, for plasma membrane intrinsic protein and tonoplast intrinsic protein, respectively) were cloned and characterized. The higher efficiency of HbPIP 2; 1 than HbTIP 1; 1 in increasing plasmalemma water conductance was verified in Xenopus laevis oocytes. HbPIP 2; 1 was insensitive to HgCl 2. In situ hybridization demonstrated that HbPIP 2; 1 was expressed in all liber tissues in the young stem, including the laticifers. HbPIP 2; 1 was up-regulated in both liber tissues and laticifers, whereas HbTIP 1; 1 was down-regulated in liber tissues but up-regulated in laticifers in response to bark Ethrel treatment. Ethylene-induced HbPIP 2; 1 up-regulation was confirmed by western-blot analysis. The promoter sequences of both genes were cloned and found to harbor, among many others, ethylene-responsive and other chemical-responsive (auxin, copper, and sulfur) elements known to increase latex yield. Increase in latex yield in response to ethylene was emphasized to be linked with water circulation between the laticifers and their surrounding tissues {{as well as with}} the probable maintenance of liber tissue turgor, which together favor prolongation of latex flow...|$|R

By exploiting an intraductal retrovirus (RCAS) -mediated gene delivery method to introduce a marker gene, we found that ductal epithelial cells are turned over with a half time of approximately 1 month in adult virgin mice. However, following RCAS-mediated introduction of a constitutively activated STAT 5 a (caSTAT 5 a), caSTAT 5 a-activated ductal epithelial cells expand and replace other cells in the epithelium, eventually forming a mammary gland resembling that in a late pregnant mouse, suggesting that STAT 5 a activation alone is sufficient to mediate pregnancy-induced mammary cell expansion, alveolar cell fate commitment, and lactogenesis. Furthermore, such caSTAT 5 a-induced alveolar differentiation does not require ovarian functions, although caSTAT 5 a-induced cell proliferation is partly reduced in ovariectomized mice.

This production characteristic was lower in virgin forest Dobroč (686. 5 m 3. ha - 1). The reason for higher average volume of trees over 8 cm dbh in Čorkova Uvala is significantly higher annual precipitation and more favourable texture of virgin forest with a higher proportion of optimum stage. Regarding the production ability of tree species, higher maximum heights and diameters for all tree species were recorded in virgin forest Dobroč.
