5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure <b>vent</b> <b>valve,</b> after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E
25|$|On early flights, {{the liquid}} oxygen tank {{contained}} a separate, pyrotechnically operated, propulsive tumble <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> at its forward end. At separation, the liquid oxygen tumble <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> was opened, providing impulse {{to assist in}} the separation maneuver and more positive control of the entry aerodynamics of the ET. The last flight with the tumble valve active was STS-36.|$|E
500|$|The inner {{hatch cover}} used a plug door design, sealed by higher {{pressure}} inside the cabin than outside. The normal pressure level used for launch ( [...] above ambient) created sufficient force to prevent removing the cover until the excess pressure was vented. Emergency procedure called for Grissom {{to open the}} cabin <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> first, allowing White to remove the cover, but Grissom was prevented from doing this because the valve was located to the left, behind the initial wall of flames. Also, while the system could easily vent the normal pressure, its flow capacity was utterly incapable of handling the rapid increase to [...] absolute caused by the intense heat of the fire.|$|E

500|$|Built by the Kawasaki Dockyard Co. {{at their}} {{shipyard}} in Kobe, I-179 was laid down on 21 August 1941 {{under the name}} of Submarine No. 157 and renamed I-179 on 1 November 1941. The boat was launched on 16 July 1942 and completed on 18 June 1943. While conducting her sea trials in the Inland Sea on 14 July, she sank with the loss of all 85 officers and crewmen. Her wreck was located four days later at a depth of [...] at [...] with several hatches and her bow buoyancy tank <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> open. I-179 was struck from the Navy List on 15 April 1944. Her wreck was salvaged from April 1956 to 1 March 1957 and scrapped at Kure.|$|E

2500|$|On 5 November 2010, Discoverys launch attempt, a {{hydrogen}} leak was detected at the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUCP) during the fueling process. The plate was an attachment point between the external tank and a 17-inch pipe that carried gaseous hydrogen safely {{away from the}} tank to the flare stack, where it was burned off. All had been proceeding to plan with the tank [...] "fast filled" [...] during tanking, until the first leak indication was revealed. Firstly, a 33,000 ppm leak then reduced to a level below 20,000 ppm was recorded. The Launch Commit Criteria limit was 40â€“44,000 ppm. The leak was only being observed during the cycling of the <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> to [...] "open" [...] to release the gaseous hydrogen from the tank to the flare stack. Controllers decided to stop valve cycling {{in order to increase}} the pressure and attempt to force a seal before attempting to complete the fast fill process. At this stage, the leak spiked and remained at the highest 60,000 ppm level (likely even at a higher value), indicating a serious problem with the GUCP's seal.|$|E
25|$|On January 7, 2010, NRC {{inspectors}} {{reported that}} an estimated 600,000 gallons of mildly radioactive steam was intentionally vented {{to the atmosphere}} after an automatic shutdown of Unit 2. After the vent, one of the <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> unintentionally remained slightly open for two days. The levels of tritium in the steam were within the allowable safety limits defined in NRC standards.|$|R
50|$|On Flight Day 3, Currie used Canadarm {{to grapple}} and place Unity onto the Orbiter Docking System at 6:45 pm EST. The crew {{pressurized}} PMA-2 and entered it. They put several caps over <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> {{to prepare for}} the entrance into Unity later in the week. Commander Bob Cabana performed a debris avoidance maneuver to move Endeavour {{out of the way of}} a casing from a Delta II rocket that launched on 6 November from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{operating}} pressure was maintained by an automatically controlled bleed valve once the plant had reached steady state, the valve {{could not be used}} during start-up, when there was no air feed, the plant being pressurised with nitrogen. During start-up the bleed valve was normally isolated and there was no route for excess pressure to escape; pressure was kept within acceptable limits (slightly wider that those achieved under automatic control) by operator intervention (manual operation of <b>vent</b> <b>valves).</b> A pressure-relief valve acting at 11 kg/cm2 (156 psi) gauge was also fitted.|$|R
2500|$|The {{second of}} three spacewalks was {{completed}} on flight day 7. Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick {{were able to}} complete all their planned tasks in 5 hours and 54 minutes. The tasks included installing ammonia coolant loops, thermal blankets to protect the ammonia hoses, outfitting the earth facing port of Tranquility for the Cupola, install handrails and a non-propulsive <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> (NPV). During the connection {{of one of the}} ammonia hoses, a small amount of ammonia leaked out of a quick disconnect valve and floated towards Nick Patrick. Procedures called for a [...] "bake-out" [...] while Patrick worked during the sunlit portion of the orbit, and a contamination test in the airlock. The bake-out happened {{at the end of the}} spacewalk. While the spacewalk was happening, Terry Virts and Kay Hire along with ISS commander Jeff Williams, Soichi Noguchi and T.J. Creamer, continued outfitting the Tranquility module. This included setting up the ventilation system, connecting electrical and computer cables and configuring racks. They confirmed lights and computers were on in the node once the ammonia cooling system had been activated. The crew also received word the mission had been extended by one day in the morning.|$|E

5000|$|A {{steam heating}} system takes {{advantage}} of the high latent heat which is given off when steam condenses to liquid water. In a steam heating system, each room is equipped with a so-called [...] "radiator" [...] which is connected to a source of low-pressure steam (a boiler). Steam entering the radiator condenses and gives up its latent heat, returning to liquid water. The radiator in turn heats the air of the room, and provides some direct radiant heat. The condensate water returns to the boiler either by gravity or with the assistance of a pump. Some systems use only a single pipe for combined steam and condensate return. Since trapped air prevents proper circulation, such systems have <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> to allow air to be purged. In domestic and small commercial buildings, the steam is generated at relatively low pressure, less than 15 psig (200 kPa).|$|R
40|$|Solid rocket {{propellant}} and {{rocket motor}} components were aged in a vented container {{on the interior}} of the LDEF. This paper will present the results of aging the Improved Performance Space Motor-II/Payload Assist Module-Delta II (IPSM-II/PAM-DII) space motor components. Ballistic and mechanical properties of the space aged main propellant, igniter propellant, and ignition system were compared with similar data from preflight and ground aged samples. Mechanical properties of the composite materials and bonded joints used in the motor case, insulation, liner, nozzle, exit cone, and skirt were similarly evaluated. The space aging results will be compared to data collected in a ground based vacuum aging program on similar components. The operation of the vacuum actuated <b>venting</b> <b>valve</b> and pressure actuated resealing of the container will also be addressed. The materials tested showed no significant changes due to space aging. These results indicate that properly designed solid rocket motors can be expected to perform reliably after extended periods of exposure to a space environment...|$|R

50|$|The steam strips the {{dissolved}} {{gas from the}} boiler feedwater and exits via the <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> {{at the top of}} the domed section. Should this <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> not be opened sufficiently the deaerator will not work properly, causing high oxygen content in the feed water going to the boilers. Should the boiler not have an oxygen-content analyser, a high level in the boiler chlorides may indicate the <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> not being far enough open. Some designs may include a vent condenser to trap and recover any water entrained in the vented gas. The vent line usually includes a valve and just enough steam is allowed to escape with the vented gases to provide a small visible telltale plume of steam.|$|E

40|$|Industrial alloys are {{generally}} multi-component systems with volatile and highly reactive components. Consequently, their processing in {{the liquid state}} requires special precautions. Therefore, an existing electromagnetic-levitation device with a high-vacuum chamber, designed for surface tension measurements was modified and improved. Due to the necessity of an extremely pure experiment-environment the equipment was constructed with special consideration of very low oxygen concentration in the processing atmosphere: Only high-purity helium-hydrogen was used and special care was taken to avoid back-diffusion of air through <b>venting</b> <b>valves.</b> For the measurements of the surface tensions {{with the help of}} the oscillating drop technique the temperatures and the video sequences of the levitated, molten alloy were recorded without contact by pyrometer and by high-speed camera, respectively. This method yields the frequencies of the surface oscillations of the sample around the equilibrium shape and - using the modified Rayleigh law - eventually the values of the surface tension. With the help of this method some commercial industrial alloys were processed in the new EML-apparatus for ESA`s Thermolab project. The results of these measurements shall be presented and discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The NASA {{space shuttle}} flight STS- 26 R, {{launched}} at 11 : 37. 00. 009 a. m. EDT on 29 Sep. 1988, used the redesigned solid rocket motors (RSRM) 360 LOO 1 A and 360 LOO 1 B. Evaluation {{of the ground}} environment instrumentation (GEI) data recorded prior to flight showed: (1) no launch commit criteria violations, (2) that the field joint heater and aft skirt thermal conditioning systems performed adequately, and (3) that the GEI data showed good agreement with thermal model predictions. Evaluation of the developmental flight instrumentation (DFI) revealed excellent agreement with both the predicted and required ballistic specifications. All parameters were well within the CEI specification requirements including propellant burn rates, specific impulse values, and thrust imbalance. Recorded strain values also indicated satisfactory radial growth and stress levels, as well as verification of adequate safety factors. Postflight inspection of the insulation, seals, case, and nozzles showed overall excellent performance. Some thermal DFI protective cork was missing, and inoperative field joint <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> on the thermal protection cork allowed water entry into the field joints upon splashdown. Evaluation of these anomalies, as well as complete evaluation of all RSRM components, is presented...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{the study}} of the {{potential}} use of blowing and venting operations of ballast tanks in manned submarines as a complementary or alternative control system for manoeuvring, we first propose a mathematical model for these operations. Then we consider the coupling of blowing and venting with the Feldman, variable mass, coefficient based hydrodynamic model for the equations of motion. The final complete model is composed of a system of twenty-four nonlinear ordinary differential equations. In a second part, we carry out a rigorous mathematical analysis of the model: existence of a solution is proved. As one of the possible applications of this model in naval engineering problems, we consider the problem of roll control in an emergency rising manoeuvre by using only blowing and venting. To this end, we formulate a suitable constrained, nonlinear, optimal control problem where controls are linked to the variable aperture of blowing and <b>venting</b> <b>valves</b> of each of the tanks. Existence of a solution for this problem is also proved. Finally, we address the numerical resolution of the control problem by using a descent algorithm. Numerical experiments seem to indicate that, indeed, an appropriate use of blowing and venting operations may help in the control of this emergency manoeuvre.

5000|$|An {{emergency}} backup {{was provided}} {{in case the}} main system failed, by a separate unit called the Oxygen Purge System (OPS), mounted {{on top of the}} PLSS, immediately behind the astronaut's helmet.The OPS maintained suit pressure and removed carbon dioxide, heat and water vapor through a continuous, one-way air flow vented to space. When activated, the OPS provided oxygen to a separate inlet on the pressure suit, once a <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> on a separate suit outlet was manually opened. The OPS provided a maximum of about 30 minutes of emergency oxygen for breathing and cooling. This could be extended to 75 to 90 minutes with a [...] "buddy system" [...] hose that used the other astronaut's functional PLSS for cooling (only).

50|$|The Atlas rocket {{suffered}} a structural failure 58 seconds after launch. The vehicle {{at that time}} was at approximately an altitude of 30,000 feet (9.1 km) and 11,000 feet (3.4 km) down range when it was passing through Max Q and all telemetry signals suddenly ceased. Because the day was rainy and overcast with thick clouds, the booster had been out of sight from T+26 seconds and it was impossible to see what happened. A number of Mercury engineers had voiced their objection to launching on July 29 because of the weather precluding visual coverage of the flight. Some observers claim to have heard an explosion, but this could not be verified. The capsule continued transmitting until it impacted the ocean, approximately 6 miles downrange. Subsequent salvage attempts dredged it and the Atlas's booster engines and LOX <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> from the ocean floor. The booster engines showed no sign of damage except some deformation from impact with the ocean, but the <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> and a still-attached segment of piping had noticeable fatigue cracks.|$|E
