The mostcommon means of fighting wear is lubrication. When conventional lubrication cannot be used because of the environment, special purpose, wear-resistant, low-friction coatings can be applied on the functional surfaces. The coatings which are considered, are of the hard type like TiC, TiN and Ti(C,N), and of the soft, self-lubricating type like MoS 2; the coating thicknesses are typically between 0. 3 and 5 µm.

Furthermore, the effect of oxide debris present in the <b>vibrating</b> <b>contact</b> on the velocity accommodation and, consequently, on the coefficient of friction is discussed. The hardness {{of some of the}} ASP 23 tool steel substrates was increased with a plasma nitriding treatment prior to the coating deposition.

40|$|Light {{touch of}} a {{fingertip}} on an external stable surface greatly improves the postural stability of standing subjects. The hypothesis of the present work was that a vibrating surface could increase the effectiveness of fingertip signaling to {{the central nervous system}} (e. g., by a stochastic resonance mechanism) and hence improve postural stability beyond that achieved by light touch. Subjects stood quietly over a force plate while touching with their right index fingertip a surface that could be either quiescent or randomly vibrated at two low-level noise intensities. The vibratory noise of the contact surface caused a significant decrease in postural sway, as assessed by center of pressure measures in both time and frequency domains. Complementary experiments were designed to test whether postural control improvements were associated with a stochastic resonance mechanism or whether attentional mechanisms could be contributing. A full curve relating body sway parameters and different levels of vibratory noise resulted in a U-like function, suggesting that the improvement in sway relied on a stochastic resonance mechanism. Additionally, no decrease in postural sway was observed when the <b>vibrating</b> <b>contact</b> surface was attached to the subject`s body, suggesting that no attentional mechanisms were involved. These results indicate that sensory cues obtained from the fingertip need not necessarily be associated with static contact surfaces to cause improvement in postural stability. A low-level noisy vibration applied to the contact surface could lead to a better performance of the postural control system. CNPqFAPESP[2007 / 03608 - 9...|$|R

40|$|For many {{technical}} applications {{friction and}} wear are critical issues. Reinforced polymer-matrix composites {{are widely used}} under <b>vibrating</b> <b>contact</b> condition in various automotive and aerospace applications {{as well as in}} structural engineering. In this paper, the friction and wear of bulk epoxy and unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite have been investigated under reciprocating sliding against either alumina or stainless steel balls in ambient air. The effect of sliding direction with respect to the long and unidirectional carbon fibers has been studied. We demonstrate that the carbon fiber reinforcement greatly improves the tribological properties of the thermoset epoxy: it reduces the coefficient of friction and the debris formation. It was found that on sliding in the anti-parallel direction a more significant degradation takes place than in the parallel direction. The coefficient of friction measured on bulk epoxy sliding against either stainless steel or alumina is around 0. 65, whereas the coefficient of friction measured on epoxy reinforced with carbon fibers is significantly lower, namely down to 0. 11. It was found that sliding with a stainless steel ball in a direction parallel to the fiber orientation results in a lower coefficient of friction than sliding in anti-parallel direction. The reduced coefficient of friction is largely influenced by the carbon fiber reinforcement due to the auto-protecting film formed as a paste in the contact area and along the wear track edges. The relationship between friction and degradation of the composite material including surface wear and debris formation are discussed based on an in-depth analysis of the worn surfaces by optical and scanning electron microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and white light interferometry.

Additionally, such high frequencies virtually eliminates the stroboscopic effect which is very noticeable in those cases when tubes are powered by means of low frequency alternating or pulsating currents as happens when regular 50 or 60 Hz AC mains are used as power source. Transistorized devices are also silent, unlike true Ruhmkorff coils, which make its characteristic buzzing noises when in action, even if they are contained in closed casings or boxes.

5000|$|Practical {{electronic}} converters use switching techniques. Switched-mode DC-to-DC converters convert one DC {{voltage level}} to another, {{which may be}} higher or lower, by storing the input energy temporarily and then releasing that energy to the output at a different voltage. The storage may be in either magnetic field storage components (inductors, transformers) or electric field storage components (capacitors). This conversion method can increase or decrease voltage. Switching conversion is more power efficient (often 75% to 98%) than linear voltage regulation, which dissipates unwanted power as heat. Fast semiconductor device rise and fall times are required for efficiency; however, these fast transitions combine with layout parasitic effects to make circuit design challenging. The higher efficiency of a switched-mode converter reduces the heatsinking needed, and increases battery endurance of portable equipment. Efficiency has improved since the late 1980s due {{to the use of}} power FETs, which are able to switch more efficiently with lower switching losses at higher frequencies than power bipolar transistors, and use less complex drive circuitry.Another important improvement in DC-DC converters is replacing the flywheel diode by synchronous rectification using a power FET, whose [...] "on resistance" [...] is much lower, reducing switching losses.

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} rock-abrasion tool (URAT) {{was developed}} {{using the same}} principle of ultrasonic/sonic actuation {{as that of the}} tools described in two prior NASA Tech Briefs articles: Ultrasonic/ Sonic Drill/Corers With Integrated Sensors (NPO- 20856), Vol. 25, No. 1 (January 2001), page 38 and Ultrasonic/ Sonic Mechanisms for Drilling and Coring (NPO- 30291), Vol. 27, No. 9 (September 2003), page 65. Hence, like those tools, the URAT offers the same advantages of low power demand, mechanical simplicity, compactness, and ability to function with very small axial loading (very small contact force between tool and rock). Like a tool described in the second of the cited previous articles, a URAT includes (1) a drive mechanism that comprises a piezoelectric ultrasonic actuator, an amplification horn, and a mass that is free to move axially over a limited range and (2) an abrasion tool bit. A URAT tool bit is a disk that has been machined or otherwise formed to have a large number of teeth and an overall shape chosen to impart the desired shape (which could be flat or curved) to the rock surface to be abraded. In operation, the disk and thus the teeth are <b>vibrated</b> in <b>contact</b> with the rock surface. The concentrated stresses at the tips of the impinging teeth repeatedly induce microfractures and thereby abrade the rock. The motion of the tool induces an ultrasonic transport effect that displaces the cuttings from the abraded area. The figure shows a prototype URAT. A piezoelectric-stack/horn actuator is housed in a cylindrical container. The movement of the actuator and bit with respect to the housing is aided by use of mechanical sliders. A set of springs accommodates the motion of the actuator and bit into or out of the housing through an axial range between 5 and 7 mm. The springs impose an approximately constant force of contact between the tool bit and the rock to be abraded. A dust shield surrounds the bit, serving as a barrier to reduce the migration of rock debris to sensitive instrumentation or mechanisms in the vicinity.

30|$|Recently, a {{new family}} of {{scanning}} probe microscopy (SPM) techniques based {{on the use of}} atomic force microscopy (AFM) with ultrasound excitation has been proposed [13, 14]. It has been demonstrated that these procedures provide a valuable means for the characterization of dynamic elastic, viscoelastic and adhesive material properties, and permit to obtain subsurface information. Among them, the technique of ultrasonic force microscopy (UFM) [15 – 18] relies in the so-called “mechanical-diode” effect, in which a cantilever tip is in contact with the sample surface, and normal ultrasonic vibration is excited at the tip-sample contact. If the excitation frequency is high enough, or is not coincident with a high-order cantilever contact resonance, the cantilever {{will not be able to}} linearly follow the surface vibration due to its inertia. Nevertheless, if the ultrasonic excitation amplitude is sufficiently high that the tip-sample distance is modulated within the nonlinear tip-sample force interaction regime, the cantilever experiences a static force during the time that the ultrasonic excitation is acting. This force is called “the ultrasonic force”, and it can be understood as the net force that acts upon the cantilever during a complete ultrasonic cycle, due to the nonlinearity of the tip-sample interaction force. The cantilever behaves then as a mechanical diode, and it deflects when the tip-sample <b>contact</b> <b>vibrates</b> at ultrasonic frequencies of sufficiently high amplitude. The magnitude of the ultrasonic force, or of the ultrasonic-force-induced additional cantilever deflection (UFM signal), is dependent on the details of the tip-sample interaction force, and hence on material properties such as elasticity and adhesion. In this way, surface and/or subsurface nanoscale elastic discontinuities and stress fields can be easily detected with UFM.|$|R

This effect is critical in the study of composites for marine applications since the densities of the composites and water are relatively close to one another. In this study, experimental testing was conducted to compare the free vibration response of composite beams in air with those in FSI immersed in water. Composite beams with six layers of non-biased, plain weave, 6 oz E-glass were used with two different layer orientations and boundary conditions. Five samples were layered at the 0 and 90 degree orientations and five samples were layered at the plus and minus 45 degree orientation. The Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique was used to test each of the ten samples in a cantilever boundary condition with an initial displacement to induce a free vibration response both in air and immerse in water. A High Speed Camera (HSC) was also used to gain further frequency information during each of these tests. A second set of two composite beams were constructed with 16 layers at both of the described orientations. These were instrumented with accelerometers to conduct a modal analysis from an impact hammer test. These tests were conducted with the beams in a free-free boundary condition while in air and immersed in water. Prior to conducting these tests, an aluminum beam was tested with the same conditions to verify the waterproofing of the accelerometers and to ensure valid data was collected.

40|$|AbstractIn case of KAPS and KGS, {{different}} ingots {{were used}} for manufacturing the coolant channels. Due to difference in the creep related material properties of different ingots, the coolant channels in these reactors experienced different creep rate. Due to the differential creep rates, especially in the neighboring channels, the coolant channels {{came into contact with}} each other. This is a serious deviation from as installed conditions wherein the gaps and spacing between closely assembled coolant channel components are decided based on accurate assessment of known loads and forces. Differential creep results in closing of gaps between neighboring feeder pipes or between feeder pipe and gray-loc clamp. Depending on the orientation of the clamp and direction of the feeder pipe at that location, worst contact could be between the first elbow of feeder pipe and the sharp edge of the crown nut on clamp. Several such contacts have been detected in KAPS and KGS. Seriousness of the contact emerges {{from the fact that the}} coolant channel and the feeder pipes vibrate due to coolant flow with high velocity. With time the contact conditions like the contact force and location(s) of contact change and this has significant influence on the life and performance of the coolant channel as a whole. Since feeder pipes are constantly <b>vibrating,</b> the <b>contacting</b> locations are likely to be dented or damaged. Whenever and wherever possible, NPCIL has tried to remove the contact locally. Since the process of creep is ongoing, more and more feeder pipes are likely to come in contact and those in which the local corrections for removing the contact are made could also need correction as the time progresses. In order to assess the severity of damage, a full scale setup was erected. Contact was established between feeder pipe and the hard locking nut of gray-loc clamp. Based on previous vibration data collected from feeder pipes and end fittings, and the ASME‘s O&M guidelines on acceptable level of piping vibration in nuclear piping, vibration was induced in the contacting feeder pipes. The test was continued for more than 1007 cycles. On the basis of damage seen on the feeder pipe due to contact, R 6 method has been employed to determine the critical crack size in the feeder pipe with a postulated axial part-through semi-elliptical crack. The failure assessment diagram was constructed in the K-L plane. The lowest critical crack depth was calculated as 4. 67 mm as against observed depth of dent of 1. 1 mm.
