Revenge began making her way towards the gate, which opened at 1826. However, before arriving at the gate, the battleship stopped inside the harbour, closer to the gate.

50|$|In {{the wake}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks, there have been {{concerns}} about the security of LNG shipments within Boston Harbor, and increased fear of terrorism. Because of the location of the LNG terminal in the Mystic River, tankers traveling to and from the facility are forced to pass directly offshore of downtown Boston. During their voyage through the harbor, they are protected by a security zone that extends 2 mi in front of the <b>vessel,</b> <b>1</b> mi behind it, and more than half a mile on either side. This zone is enforced by escort vessels provided by the Coast Guard and State Police.

5000|$|While one {{separatory}} funnel {{is useful in}} separating certain compound mixtures with a carefully formulated biphasic solvent system, a series of {{separatory funnel}}s may be employed to separate compounds that have different partition coefficients. Countercurrent distribution, therefore, is a method of using a series of vessels (separatory funnels) to separation compounds by a sequence of liquid-liquid extraction operations. Contrary to liquid-liquid extraction, in the CCD instruments the upper phase is decanted from the lower phase once the phases have settled. First, a mixture is introduced to <b>vessel</b> <b>1</b> (V1) charged with both phases and the liquid-liquid extraction process is performed. The upper phase is added to a second vessel (V2) which already holds fresh lower phase. Fresh upper phase is added to V1. Both vessels are shaken and allowed to settle. upper phase from V1 is transferred to V2 {{at the same time}} the upper phase from V2 is transferred to V3 which already holds fresh lower phase. Fresh upper phase is added to V1, all three vessels are shaken and settled and the process continues. Compounds that are more soluble in the upper phase than lower phase faster and farther down the series of vessels (the [...] "train") while those compounds which are more soluble in the lower phase than the upper phase tend to lag behind. A compound insoluble in the upper phase will remain in V1 while a compound insoluble in the lower phase will stay in the lead vessel.|$|E
