40|$|A {{theory of}} gastric acid {{production}} and self-protection is formulated mathematically and examined for clinical and experimental correlations, implications, and predictions using analytic and numerical techniques. In our model, gastric acid secretion in the stomach, {{as represented by}} an archetypal gastron, consists of two chambers, circulatory and luminal, connected by two different regions of ion exchange. The capillary circulation of the gastric mucosa is arranged in arterial-venous arcades which pass from the gastric glands {{up to the surface}} epithelial lining of the lumen; therefore the upstream region of the capillary chamber communicates with oxyntic cells, while the downstream region communicates with epithelial cells. Both cell types abut the gastric lumen. Ion currents across the upstream region are calculated from a steady-state oxyntic cell model with active ion transport, while the downstream ion fluxes are (facilitated) diffusion driven or secondarily active. Water transport is considered iso-osmotic. The steady-state model is solved in closed form for low gastric lumen pH. A wide variety of previously performed static and dynamic experiments on ion and CO 2 transport in the gastric lumen and gastric blood supply are for the first time correlated with each other for an (at least) semiquantitative test of current concepts of gastric acid secretion and for the purpose of model <b>verification.</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the data is reported with a few outstanding and instructive exceptions.

40|$|Although the KFA-Jülich {{has been}} subject to {{international}} inspection under the Euratom Treaty from the outset, safeguards measures for special nuclear material are currently being re-negotiated and reorganized to correspond to the new and more stringent requirements laid down in the <b>Verification</b> <b>Agreement</b> pursuant to the Nuclear Weapons Nah-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Nuclear research centres in general pose special problems for international nuclear material control. The total amount of material present isusually distributed over a multitude of individual items and batches. The classical IAEA safeguards measure of periodic MUF (material unaccounted for) determination is impractical. A viable alternative approach is to focus attention only an those few classes of physical inventory which contain {{the bulk of the}} fissile material. Such classes at the KFA Jülich comprise the frech and irradiated fuel assemblies for the two research reactors FRJ- 1 and FRJ- 2, fuel pebbles for the KAHTER critical assembly and stored spent AVR fuel. We will be concerned in the present investigation with developing a safeguards concept for the spent AVR fuel. A large fraction of the total inventory of fissile material at the KFA-Jülich {{is in the form of}} irradiated fuel from the AVR high temperature reactor. This material is accessible to measurement for verification purposes only with considerable difficulty and therefore poses serious technical problems from a safeguards standpoint. With the continuing operation of the AVR, coupled with still unresolved problems of final disposal, theamount of material in this category is increasing steadily. Moreover it is expected that the AVR pebbles will merge with irradiated fuel from the THTR- 3 oo in a large HTR away-fromareactor dry storage installation, also located at the KFA, thus becoming part of a much larger inventory of fissile material. With the gradual decay of short-lived fission products, its potential strategic value will increase steadily, rendering adequate safeguards measures indispensable.

40|$|Pursuant to the Trilateral Initiative, {{the three}} parties (The Russian Federation, the United States, and the International Atomic Energy Agency) {{have been engaged}} in discussions {{concerning}} the structure of reliable monitoring systems for storage facilities having large inventories. The intent of these monitoring systems is to provide the capability for the IAEA to maintain continuity of knowledge in a sufficiently reliable manner that should there be equipment failure, loss of continuity of knowledge would be restricted to a small population of the inventory, and thus reinventory of the stored items would be minimized These facility-specific monitoring systems, referred to as Inventory Monitoring Systems (IMS) are to provide the principal means for the M A to assure that the containers of fissile material remain accounted under the <b>Verification</b> <b>Agreements</b> which are to be concluded between the IAEA and the Russian Federation and the lAEA and the United States for the verification of weapon-origin and other fissile material specified by each State as released from its defense programs.

40|$|An {{inspection}} game is {{a mathematical}} model of {{a situation in which}} an inspector verifies the adherence of an inspectee to some legal obligation, such as an arms control treaty, where the inspectee may have an interest in violating that obligation. The mathematical analysis seeks to determine an optimal inspection scheme, ideally one which will induce legal behavior, under the assumption that the potential illegal action is carried out strategically; thus a non-cooperative game with two players, inspector and inspectee, is defined. Three phases of development in the application of such models to arms control and disarmament may be identified. In the first of these, roughly from 1961 through 1968, studies that focused on inspecting a nuclear test ban treaty emphasized game theory, with less consideration given to statistical aspects associated with data acquisition and measurement uncertainty. The second phase, from 1968 to about 1985, involves work stimulated by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Here, the verification principle of material accountancy came to the fore, along with the need to include the formalism of statistical decision theory within the inspection models. The third phase, 1985 to the present, has been dominated by challenges posed by such far-reaching <b>verification</b> <b>agreements</b> as the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Agreement (1 NF), the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), as well as perceived failures of the NPT system in Iraq and North Korea.

40|$|A {{systematic}} approach for encoding Korean addresses to the finest depth of sort {{is presented in}} this paper. The implementation is focused on producing the final delivery point code for various types of address recognized in an efficient manner. There are two stages in the address interpretation: 1) <b>agreement</b> <b>verification</b> between the recognized postal code and {{upper part of the}} address and 2) analysis of lower part of the address which is important for the encoding. In the <b>agreement</b> <b>verification</b> procedure, the recognized postal code is used as a key to access the address dictionary and each of the retrieved addresses is compared with the words in the recognized address. As a result, the boundary between the upper part and the lower part is located. The confusion matrices are introduced to improve performance of the process by correcting misrecognized characters. In the procedure of interpreting the lower address part, a delivery point code is derived using the house number and/or the building name. Several rules for the interpretation have been developed based on the analysis of real addresses collected. Experiments have been performed to evaluate the proposed approach using addresses collected from two metropolitan cities in Korea. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{cessation}} of hostilities between India and Pakistan is an immediate need and of global concern, as these countries have tested nuclear devices, and {{have the capability to}} deploy nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Cooperative monitoring projects among neighboring countries in South Asia could build regional confidence, and, through gradual improvements in relations, reduce the threat of war and the {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction. This paper discusses monitoring the trans-border movement of flow and sediment in the Indian and Pakistani coastal areas. Through such a project, India and Pakistan could initiate greater cooperation, and engender movement towards the resolution of the Sir Creek territorial dispute in their coastal region. The Joint Working Groups dialogue being conducted by India and Pakistan provides a mechanism for promoting such a project. The proposed project also falls within a regional framework of cooperation agreed to by several South Asian countries. This framework has been codified in the South Asian Seas Action Plan, developed by Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. This framework provides a useful starting point for Indian and Pakistani cooperative monitoring in their trans-border coastal area. The project discussed in this paper involves computer modeling, the placement of in situ sensors for remote data acquisition, and the development of joint reports. Preliminary computer modeling studies are presented in the paper. These results illustrate the cross-flow connections between Indian and Pakistani coastal regions and strengthen the argument for cooperation. Technologies and actions similar to those suggested for the coastal project are likely to be applied in future arms control and treaty <b>verification</b> <b>agreements.</b> The project, therefore, serves as a demonstration of cooperative monitoring technologies. The project will also increase people-to-people contacts among Indian and Pakistani policy makers and scientists. In the perceptions of the general public, the project will crystallize the idea that the two countries share ecosystems and natural resources, and have a vested interest in increased collaboration...|$|R
