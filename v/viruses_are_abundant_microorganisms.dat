Here, we present a robust, routinely usable approach to identify viruses from two freshwater lakes of the lower Great Lakes region, Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. We collected water samples from six different beaches of these two lakes during the summer period of 2012 and 2013, and separated into three distinct fractions, namely a bacterial fraction, a virus like particle (VLP) fraction and a fraction of eDNA (environmental DNA). DNA extracted from all three fractions was sequenced and bioinformatic analyses of sequences revealed the presence of viruses from major viral families. The analyzed viral sequences were dominated by bacteriophage sequences, but also contained many plant and animal viruses. Within {{the context of this}} study, geographic location {{does not appear to have}} a major impact on viral abundance and diversity since virome composition of both lakes were similar. Comparative analyses between eDNA and viral fractions showed that eDNA can be used in combination with VLP fractions to identify viruses from the environment...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{hypothesis}} {{considers that}} many coral pathologies {{are the result}} of a sudden structural alteration of the epibiotic bacterial communities in response to environmental disturbances. However, the ecological mechanisms that lead to shifts in their composition are still unclear.

In this opinion letter, we are putting forward the hypothesis that coral-associated viruses (mostly bacterial and algal viruses), depending on the environmental conditions might either reinforce coral stability or conversely fasten their decline.

This conclusion is a departure from the prevailing view of viruses in the ocean, but is consistent with earlier theoretical predictions...|$|R

Antarctic lakes are microbially dominated ecosystems supporting truncated food webs in which viruses exert {{a major influence on}} the microbial loop. Here we report the discovery of a virophage (relative of the recently described Sputnik virophage) that preys on phycodnaviruses that infect prasinophytes (phototrophic algae). By performing metaproteogenomic analysis on samples from Organic Lake, a hypersaline meromictic lake in Antarctica, complete virophage and near-complete phycodnavirus genomes were obtained. By introducing the virophage as an additional predator of a predator–prey dynamic model we determined that the virophage stimulates secondary production through the microbial loop by reducing overall mortality of the host and increasing the frequency of blooms during polar summer light periods. Virophages remained abundant in the lake 2 y later and were represented by populations {{with a high level of}} major capsid protein sequence variation (25 – 100 % identity). Virophage signatures were also found in neighboring Ace Lake (in abundance) and in two tropical lakes (hypersaline and fresh), an estuary, and an ocean upwelling site.

This work sheds new light on the virus diversity in I. ricinus, expands our knowledge of potential host/vector-associations and tick-transmitted viruses within several viral groups, and pushes the latitudinal limit where it is likely to find tick-associated viruses.

40|$|To gain {{further insight}} into the {{pathogenesis}} of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, lymph nodes from seven asymptomatic HIV+ subjects were analyzed during the latent phase of disease. Both ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that, {{in all of the}} cases, plasma cells producing IgM/gamma were present in germinal centers. Secreted immunoglobulins formed extracellular deposits mimicking the follicular dendritic cell network. Immunoglobulin produced by germinal center plasma cells are specific for HIV because they bind the HIV env protein gp 120. Plasma cells producing antibodies with the same specificity <b>were</b> also <b>abundant</b> in the extrafollicular regions of lymph nodes. During the latent phase of infection, the virus largely accumulates within the germinal centers. Therefore, extracellular immunoglobulin may form immune complexes, as shown by the presence of HIV-specific antibodies, HIV particles, and complement components C 3 c, C 3 d, and C 1 q in the interdendritic spaces. When the ultrastructural localization of HIV in germinal centers <b>was</b> analyzed, <b>abundant</b> <b>virus</b> particles <b>were</b> found in the interdendritic spaces. In addition to this extracellular localization of HIV, receptor-mediated endocytosis of viral particles by follicular dendritic cells was observed. Complete HIV particles were found within the endosomal compartment of the follicular dendritic cells and, as complete viral particles, free in the cytoplasm, indicating that the virus may escape from the endocytic compartment. As the <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> <b>abundant</b> in the cytoplasm, this event leads to formation of a hidden reservoir within follicular dendritic cells.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, viruses in aquatic systems have been {{observed}} to modify, influence and control aquatic systems. Since the determination decades ago that <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> <b>abundant</b> in aquatic ecosystems, researchers have demonstrated that <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> pervasive and dynamic across the expanse and depth of all aquatic systems {{as well as at}} the water-sediment interface. There have been a wide range of methodological advancements during this time. To date, aquatic <b>viruses</b> have <b>been</b> suggested to play vital roles in global and small-scale biogeochemical cycling, community structure, algal bloom termination, gene transfer, and evolution of aquatic organisms. Even in harsh and difficult to study environments, aquatic and benthic <b>viruses</b> have <b>been</b> demonstrated to be major players in carbon cycling and recycling of nutrients from organic material. Taxonomic and metagenomic research has shown us that there are major globally-distributed groups, but that their genomes are filled with sequence information that has no similarity to sequences in existing bioinformatic databases. And while the field of viral ecology has expanded exponentially since the late 1980 s, there is much that we do not yet understand about virusmediated processes in aquatic systems. Important near-term steps include the combination of advanced metagenomic techniques with studies of function and population control, standardization of methodological approaches to facilitate global data acquisition without concern over methods-based artefacts, understanding of viral life strategies and their triggers, and the role of viruses in the transformation of organic matter.

40|$|Glacial ice {{surfaces}} {{represent a}} seasonally-evolving three-dimensional photic zone which accumulates microbial biomass and potentiates positive feedbacks in ice melt. Since <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> in glacial systems and may exert controls on supraglacial bacterial production, we examined whether changes in resource availability would promote {{changes in the}} bacterial community and the dynamics between viruses and bacteria of meltwater from the photic zone of a Svalbard glacier. Our results indicated that, under ambient nutrient conditions, low estimated viral decay rates account for a strong viral control of bacterial productivity, incurring a potent viral shunt of a third of bacterial carbon in the supraglacial microbial loop. Moreover, it appears that <b>virus</b> particles <b>are</b> very stable in supraglacial meltwater, raising the prospect that viruses liberated in melt are viable downstream. However, manipulating resource availability as dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosporous in experimental microcosms demonstrates that the photic zone bacterial communities can escape viral control. This is evidenced by a marked decline in virus-to-bacterium ratio concomitant with increased bacterial productivity and number. Pyrosequencing shows a few bacterial taxa, principally Janthinobacterium sp., dominate both the source meltwater and microcosm communities. Combined, our results suggest that viruses maintain high virus-to-bacterium ratios to promote contact with low-density hosts, by the manufacture of robust particles, but that this necessitates a trade-off which limits viral production. Consequently, dominant bacterial taxa appear to access resources to evade viral control. We propose that a delicate interplay of bacterial and viral strategies affects biogeochemical cycling upon glaciers and, ultimately, downstream ecosystems. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{discovery}} of an abundant and diverse virus community in oceans and lakes has profoundly reshaped ideas about global carbon and nutrient fluxes, food web dynamics, {{and maintenance of}} microbial biodiversity. These roles are exerted through massive viral impact on the population dynamics of heterotrophic bacterioplankton and primary producers. We took advantage of a shallow wetland system with contrasting microhabitats {{in close proximity to}} demonstrate that in marked contrast to pelagic systems, viral infection, determined directly by transmission electron microscopy, and consequently mortality of prokaryotes were surprisingly low in benthic habitats in all seasons. This was true even though free <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> <b>abundant</b> throughout the year and bacterial infection and mortality rates were high in surrounding water. The habitats in which we found this pattern include sediment, decomposing plant litter, and biofilms on aquatic vegetation. Overall, we detected viruses in only 4 of a total of approximately 15, 000 bacterial cells inspected in these three habitats; for comparison, nearly 300 of approximately 5, 000 cells suspended in the water column were infected. The strikingly low incidence of impact of phages in the benthos may have important implications, since a major portion of microbial biodiversity and global carbon and nutrient turnover are associated with surfaces. Therefore, if failure to infect benthic bacteria is a widespread phenomenon, then the global role of viruses in controlling microbial diversity, food web dynamics, and biogeochemical cycles would be greatly diminished compared to predictions based on data from planktonic environments...|$|R

Mitomycin C, UV radiation, sunlight, temperature and pressure were used to induce prophage in lysogenic bacteria from estuarine, coastal and oligotrophic offshore environments. To determine if hydrocarbon pollutants may cause the induction of marine lysogens, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons (including Bunker C # 6 fuel oil, phenanthrene, naphthalene, pyrene, and trichloroethylene) were also used as inducing agents. Induction was most often found in estuarine environments, where viral direct counts increased from 128. 8 to 345 % of the uninduced control, resulting in mortality of 10. 5 to 67. 3 % (average 34 %) of the bacterial population. Up to 38 % of the bacterial population was lysogenized in estuarine environments, as calculated from an average burst size. Microbial populations from oligotrophic offshore environments were inducible at 3 of 11 stations sampled. Eight of the 11 samples (73 %) treated with polyaromatic hydrocarbons resulted in prophage induction in natural populations. Time series analysis was also conducted in 2 samples induced by mitomycin C from the Atlantic Ocean near the coast of North Carolina, USA. For both samples, significant decreases in bacterial numbers were detected in treated samples after 8 h of incubation. A significant increase of <b>viruses</b> <b>was</b> detected at 8 h at one station and at 24 h at the other station after induction. This study indicates that natural lysogenic populations are sensitive to a variety of inducing agents, and induction occurs more frequently in coastal and estuarine environments than offshore environments...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> an <b>abundant</b> component of marine ecosystems {{and they are}} being increasingly recognised and accepted as important contributors to element cycling within the microbial loop. However, {{some of the key}} questions regarding the ecological significance of viruses in the marine environment still remain largely unanswered. Thus, particular interest is currently focused {{on the extent to which}} lyric production or lysogeny predominates and the nature of factors in the marine environment, particularly nutrient availability and multiplicity of infection (MOI), which might influence the lysis/lysogeny 'decision'. The present evidence is still insufficient to unambiguously assess the relative ecological significance of lysogeny versus lysis and progress in this area will rely on the development and application of new techniques. This review attempts to collect recent information relating to this central question, focusing particularly on those viruses which infect the bacterioplankton and nano- and picophytoplankton...|$|R
40|$|<b>Viruses</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} <b>abundant</b> life form and infect {{practically}} all organisms. Consequently, these obligate parasites {{are a major}} cause of human suffering and economic loss. The organization and origins of this enormous virosphere are profound open questions in biology. It has generally <b>been</b> considered that <b>viruses</b> infecting evolutionally widely separated organisms (e. g. bacteria and humans) are also distinct. However, recent research contradicts this picture. Structural analyses of virion architecture and coat protein topology have revealed unexpected similarities, not visible in sequence comparisons, suggesting a common origin for viruses that infect hosts residing in different domains of life (bacteria, archaea and eukarya) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of viral and microbial abundance in the Key Largo, Fla., reef environment was measured. Viral abundance {{was measured by}} transmission electron microscope direct counts and plaque titer on specific bacterial hosts in water and sediment samples from Florida Bay (Blackwater Sound) and along a transect from Key Largo to {{the outer edge of}} the reef tract in Key Largo Sanctuary. Water column viral direct counts were highest in Blackwater Sound of Florida Bay (1. 2 x 10 (7) viruses per ml), decreased to the shelf break (1. 7 x 10 (6) viruses per ml), and were inversely correlated with salinity (r = - 0. 97). Viral direct counts in sediment samples ranged from 1. 35 x 10 (8) to 5. 3 x 10 (8) /cm(3) of sediment and averaged nearly 2 orders of magnitude greater than counts in the water column. Viral direct counts (both sediment and water column measurements) exceeded plaque titers on marine bacterial hosts (Vibrio natriegens and others) by 7 to 8 orders of magnitude. Water column viral abundance did not correlate with bacterial direct counts or chlorophyll a measurements, and sediment viral parameters did not correlate with water column microbial, viral, or salinity data. Coliphage, which are indicators of fecal pollution, were detected in two water column samples and most sediment samples, yet their concentrations were relatively low (< 2 to 15 /liter for water column samples, and < 2 to 108 /cm(3) of sediment). Our findings indicate that <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> <b>abundant</b> in the Key Largo environment, particularly on the Florida Bay side of Key Largo, and that processes governing their distribution in the water column (i. e., salinity and freshwater input) are independent of those governing their distribution in the sediment environment...|$|R
