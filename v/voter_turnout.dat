5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> in states without close races. Voters living outside the swing {{states have a}} greater certainty of which candidate is likely to win their state. This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote. A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> in competitive swing states grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states. A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% {{in the rest of}} the country—a 17% gap.|$|E
5|$|Having secured his party's nomination, Tydings {{moved forward}} to face Beall {{in the general}} {{election}}. The final election results gave Tydings nearly 63% of 1,081,042 votes cast. His large margin of victory was due {{at least in part}} to the landslide win by fellow Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson for President in the same election, which likely increased <b>voter</b> <b>turnout.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low <b>voter</b> <b>turnout.</b> Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed <b>voter</b> <b>turnout.</b> The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush {{in the presidential election}} against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E

The expatriate <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> in 91 countries rose by 2.2% to a record-high 10.7%, with 35,000 people casting their votes. In addition, 400 Finns voted on ships at sea.|$|E
5|$|During {{the postwar}} era, Indiana became a {{critical}} swing state that often helped decide which party controlled the presidency. Elections were very close, {{and became the}} center of frenzied attention with many parades, speeches and rallies as election day approached; <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> ranging over 90% to near 100% in such elections as 1888 and 1896. In remote areas, both sides paid their supporters to vote, and occasionally paid supporters of the opposition not to vote. Despite allegations, historians have found very little fraud in national elections.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Thio's {{point on the}} views of the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission, Shanmugam said that at the time the report was rendered the electorate was immature and unfamiliar with the importance of voting, a result of the country's history of colonial rule. In contrast, the high <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for a {{politically}} active citizenry, and populism has been a longstanding force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> (due in part to its liberal voter registration laws) with virtually no evidence of unlawful voting. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2 percent of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus {{the national average of}} 61.2 percent. Previously unregistered voters can register on election day at their polls with evidence of residency.|$|E

Negotiations between Greece and other Eurozone members will continue in the following days to procure funds from the European Central Bank in order to prevent an economic collapse in the country.|$|E
5|$|Political {{analysts have}} {{suggested}} {{several reasons for}} this victory, including the popularity of Modi, {{and the loss of}} support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term. The BJP was also able to expand its traditionally upper-caste, upper-class support base and received significant support from middle-class and Dalit people, as well as among Other Backward Classes. Its support among Muslims remained low; only 8% of Muslim voters voted for the BJP. The BJP was also very successful at mobilising its supporters, and raising <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> among them.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} as governor, Brown again {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing to Republican Walter Evans. He would later claim that he had only run {{in order to improve}} Democratic <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> for William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential bid. Prior to the 1899 Democratic nominating convention, Brown was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial nominee, but he declined to become a candidate. When the convention began, he was mentioned as a candidate for convention chairman, but he also refused to serve in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|By October 1988, the {{campaign}} had secured ballot access in 46 {{states and the}} District of Columbia, and newspapers across the nation began running editorials and letters supporting Paul's run, and criticizing the low volume of media coverage.

Paul had spent $40,000 a month on traveling expenses. Just prior to Election Day, Paul predicted a low <b>voter</b> <b>turnout.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{two state}} {{elections}} were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in <b>voter</b> <b>turnout</b> from 51% to 89%. Again Playford won with a one-seat LCL majority, hanging on {{with the help of the}} malapportioned electoral system.|$|E

Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning to the legal profession, Mikan was frustrated, after hoping for an influx of work. For six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him {{to cash in on}} his life insurance.|$|E
