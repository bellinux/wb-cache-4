40|$|A common {{perception}} is that the value <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> corn arises from two components-Bt corn increases expected profit and reduces profit variability. This perception encourages farmers and the policy makers to add a risk benefit to estimates of the value <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> corn {{to account for the}} variability reduction. However, a conceptual model generates a useful decomposition of the value <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> corn and a condition determining the impact <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> corn on profit variability. An empirical model finds that Bt corn increases profit variability and thus decreases the value <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> corn by 10 - 25 % depending on risk preferences. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the consequences}} that a specific new market for non-GM (genetically modified) compound feed {{would have on}} the relative profitability <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> and conventional maize in the middle Ebro Valley (Spain). The study uses information obtained through a survey amongst maize farmers for the year 2009. This paper evaluates the current profitability <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> maize relative to the profitability of conventional maize showing that at present the probability <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> maize being more profitable than conventional maize is 100 %, mainly due the significantly higher yields <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> maize. In addition the future <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> maize is analysed in the event that a specific demand for non-GM maize for feed emerges. Simulations of price premium for conventional maize and their impact on the profitability <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> maize in the region are described. To reduce to 50 % the probability <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> maize being more profitable than conventional maize a price premium of € 17 ton- 1 for non-GM maize would be necessary. JRC.

40|$|Based on {{farm field}} plot level survey data and {{laboratory}} test, {{we examine the}} determinants of the expression <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> toxin in China's Bt cotton production.

Even for the same variety the expression <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> toxin also varies substantially among villages and among farmers in the same village. Econometric analyses show that after controlling for the effects of varieties and locations (or villages), farm management, particular applications of phosphate and potash fertilizers, and manure, has significant positive effects on Bt toxin expression in farmer's fields. In contrast to previous studies which showed that nitrogen fertilizer has a positive impact on expression <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> toxin, this study shows that nitrogen fertilizer has no significant impact on expression <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> toxin in farmer's fields. On the other hand, the expression <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> toxin has a positive relationship with phosphate fertilizer, potash fertilizer and manure application...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} adoption <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> cotton, farmers still spray excessive pesticides in their cotton fields. In contrast to scientists who always use high quality {{seeds in the}} laboratory and/or experimental fields, farmers may plant low quality seeds with a low expression <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> toxin. How does the expression <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> toxin influence farmers' pesticide use? On {{the basis of a}} plot-level survey and laboratory test data, this study shows that pesticide use on one cotton plot is influenced not only by the expression <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> crops in this plot, but also by the average expression in the village in the early stage of the cotton growing season. In other words, high expression <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> toxin benefits not only the farmers who plant the varieties but also all the other villagers...|$|R

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops, genetically {{modified}} to express insecticidal toxins that target key pests of corn, cotton, rice, potato, and other crops, have been rapidly adopted {{and have become}} dominant fixtures in agroecosystems throughout the world. Due to the constitutive nature <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> toxin expression, insecticidal proteins {{may be found in}} nearly all plant tissues, presenting multiple sources for Bt toxins to enter the environment, thus creating complex direct and indirect pathways for non-target organisms to be exposed to insecticidal proteins. The environmental impacts <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> crops have been widely debated, although both benefits and risks do exist. Benefits <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> crop adoption include reduced risks to non-target organisms when compared with conventional spray applications of insecticides, as well as economic savings to growers and increased global food security. Conversely, impacts on non-target organisms, presence in the human food supply, pleiotropic effects of genetic transformation, and gene escape to wild plant populations are all considered as viable risks <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> technology. To address the potential risks <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> crop technology, proposed approaches to the environmental management <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> crops are discussed, including within-plant modifications, reduction in Bt toxin and transgene escape, and large-scale integration into integrated pest and resistance management programs. Additionally, continued study of the effects <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> toxins on non-target organisms at multiple tiers is necessary for intelligent use of this valuable pest management tool. The global area planted to Bt crops is expanding, and new Bt products and combinations are in various stages <b>of</b> development. Although <b>Bt</b> technology may offer an environmentally superior alternative to many insecticide applications, further risk assessment research addressing the impacts <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> crops on agroecosystem function are needed to promote environmental safety...|$|R

40|$|Banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> {{goodwill}} {{has been}} questioned by analysts and the media. Analysts suggest that bank management as of {{the inception of the}} financial crisis have exploited the unverifiable fair value goodwill accounting opportunistically. This suggestion implicitly implies that bank management was more likely than management of other industries to exploit goodwill accounting during the financial turmoil. In this thesis, I test whether the value relevance <b>of</b> banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was affected differently than other industries during the financial turmoil. To do so, I use the value relevance of the pharmaceutical industry’s <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill as a control group for banks. Further, I hypothesize that (1) banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was value irrelevant since investors should have impounded the information of the analysts in the stock price; (2) pharmaceutical industry’s <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was value relevant since the financial turmoil did not severely affect its core business.

Moreover, the empirical result indicates that banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was not less value relevant than the pharmaceuticals’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill. In summary, banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill seems to have been value relevant during the financial turmoil. MSc in Accountin...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a study designed to consider the impact of the adoption <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> cotton on markets, businesses, and institutional arrangements in India. Given that evidence to date suggests that widespread adoption <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> cotton by farmers is likely to increase production, this study aims to assess possible implications for markets (access to inputs, prices of inputs and outputs, etc.) and local industries and to identify potential winners and losers. The results suggest that there are impacts on the cotton industry following from the release <b>of</b> <b>Bt</b> hybrids, and so far the impacts are most noticeable "upstream" (i. e., the input suppliers), where companies are rapidly moving away from the sale of bollworm insecticide and attempting to sell Bt seeds. Seed companies are looking for partnerships with Monsanto, the owner <b>of</b> the <b>Bt</b> gene. One reason that companies are keen to move away from insecticide is so they can avoid the need for credit supply to their customers. Seed purchase is not normally through credit, whereas insecticide purchase is.
