However, UP President Salvador P. Lopez strongly opposed the idea. A survey {{found that there was}} very little support for complete independence at UPCA. As a compromise, Lopez proposed the transformation of UP into a system of autonomous constituent universities. Finally, on 20 November 1972, Presidential Decree No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP's first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of Forestry, Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units.

5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the injection site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicine</b> due to its water solubility.|$|E

5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints.

Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics.

The same year the Board voted to allow any woman, not just those connected to students and professors, to attend the university. The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted any woman who met the academic requirements. During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L. Courtney of Dallas became the first African American to receive an undergraduate degree from Texas A University.

40|$|Animal manure from {{intensive}} {{livestock farming}} is spread on arable fields and grassland {{on a large scale}} in the Netherlands.

Several key questions will be addressed in this article. What other <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicines</b> might be in the environment, and should we be concerned about these? How do these substances behave in the environment, and do they differ from other chemical classes (e. g., pesticides) ? What are the effects of long-term, low-level exposure to these medicines? Do their degradation products present environmental risks? What subtle human and environmental effects may be elicited by these drugs? Do medicines in the environment play a role in antibacterial resistance? How do these substances interact in the environment with other <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicines</b> and other contaminants...|$|R

5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri was {{discovered}} during {{a survey of}} the endoparasites of Florida marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) by John Kinsella from 1970 to 1972, and is one of several new parasite species in this study, which was done because there were no previous comprehensive studies of the endoparasites of the species. Together with Danny Pence, Kinsella described the worm in a 1987 paper as Capillaria forresteri; the specific name honors Donald J. Forrester of the College of <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Medicine,</b> University of Florida. Kinsella and Pence described it as one of many species of Capillaria, a large and taxonomically difficult genus. They suggested that it may be closest to some other small species that live in the digestive systems of mammals, such as the very similar C.putorii, which is found in a variety of carnivorans in North America and Europe. In 1982, Moravec had placed Capillaria putorii and a number of related species in a separate genus, Aonchotheca, and in 1999 Pisanu and Bain transferred Capillaria forresteri and various other species to that genus from Capillaria. Thus, the species is now known as Aonchotheca forresteri.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicine,</b> and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E

40|$|Fish from Nordic {{fish farms}} {{have been criticized}} for {{containing}} "too high" concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) among others dioxin and PCB. These allegations have caused debate and may {{have a negative effect on}} the sale of products from Nordic fish farms in addition to giving a generally bad reputation that affects more or less all Nordic fish farms. It is generally agreed that the relatively high concentrations of POPs detected in fish from Nordic fish farms are caused by the high concentrations of POPs in the fish feed produced and used in the Nordic countries. Beside potential health effects caused by high POP contents in the fish fillet, the surrounding environment may be impacted as well, not only by excreted POPs but also by <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicines</b> used in the fish farms. In Nordic fish farms, <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicines</b> are mainly used therapeutically against different infectious diseases.
