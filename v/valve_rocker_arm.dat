The system provides two-stage variable valve lift in addition to continuous variable timing. Continuously commanded by engine control unit, the <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> switches between high-lift and low-lift profiles on the camshaft, actuated by an oil control valve through a two-feed stationary hydraulic lash adjuster, allowing for either 4.0 or 10.5 mm lift.|$|E

50|$|The {{valve train}} {{consists}} of <b>valves,</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> pushrods, lifters, and camshaft(s). Valve train opening/closing and duration, {{as well as}} the geometry of the valve train, controls the amount of air and fuel entering the combustion chamber at any given point in time. Timing for open/close/duration is controlled by the camshaft that is synchronized to the crankshaft by a chain, belt, or gear.|$|R

50|$|There are {{currently}} two main types of cylinder deactivation used today, {{depending on the}} type of engine. The first is for the pushrod design which uses solenoids to alter the oil pressure delivered to the lifters. In their collapsed state, the lifters are unable to elevate their companion pushrods under the <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> resulting in <b>valves</b> that cannot be actuated and remain closed. The second is used for overhead cam engines, and uses a pair of locked-together <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> that are employed for each <b>valve.</b> One <b>rocker</b> follows the cam profile, while the other actuates the valve. When a cylinder is deactivated, solenoid-controlled oil pressure releases a locking pin between the two <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> While one arm still follows the camshaft, the unlocked arm remains motionless and unable to activate the valve.|$|R
50|$|The {{multivalve}} Sprint {{version of}} the Triumph Slant-4 engine used a system where the camshaft was placed directly over the inlet valves, with the same cams that opened the intake valves directly also opening the exhaust <b>valves</b> through <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The VR {{followed}} in March 1994, mirroring the model {{change of the}} standard VR Commodore, incorporating engineering improvements as well as sheet metal changes. The updated running gear included a new electronically controlled version of the GM 4L60-E automatic transmission, and the latest revision of the Buick 3.8-litre V6 engine. The engine now featured rolling-element bearings in the <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> increasing compression ratios from the VQ II series engine. These changes combined to deliver an increase in power to [...] and further improvement in noise, vibration, and harshness levels. In terms of equipment, a driver's airbag became standard on both the Statesman and Caprice.|$|R
5000|$|All 645 {{engines are}} {{two-stroke}} 45-degree V-engines. Each cylinder is of 645 cuin L displacement, hence the name; with a bore of 9+1/16 in, {{a stroke of}} 10 in and a compression ratio of 14.5:1. The engine is a uniflow design with four poppet-type exhaust valves in the cylinder head and charge air scavenging ports within {{the sides of the}} cylinders. All engines use a single overhead camshaft per bank, with exhaust valves operated by two cam lobes (each of which operates two exhaust valves through a [...] "bridge") and one cam lobe to operate the Unit injector which is {{in the center of the}} four exhaust <b>valves.</b> <b>Rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are roller-equipped to eliminate friction while hydraulic valve actuators are used to eliminate valve lash. Post-1995 710 engines employ Electronic Unit injectors, however these injectors still utilize a camshaft-actuated piston pump, as on non-EFI injectors.|$|R
50|$|The oil {{and water}} pumps are located {{at the rear of}} the engine and the {{lubrication}} system uses a dry sump. Titanium is used for the <b>valves</b> and the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> have a diamond-like coating. Each cylinder has an independent, electronically controlled throttle body.|$|R
50|$|A top {{overhaul}} only covers {{the replacement of}} components inside the cylinder head without removing the engine from the vehicle, such as <b>valve</b> and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> replacement. It {{may or may not}} include a valve job. A major overhaul however covers the whole engine assembly, which requires the engine to be removed from the vehicle and transferred to an engine stand. An overhauled engine refers to a major overhaul. By comparison, a major overhaul costs more than a {{top overhaul}}.|$|R
50|$|A direct-injection turbo version (101 bhp) {{with four}} valves per cylinder, called the DiTD was {{introduced}} in the June 1998 Mazda 626 Wagon 2.0 DiTD. Engine has SOHC <b>valve</b> train with <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and mechanically adjusted screws (no hydraulic valve lifters), with Denso V5 rotary injection pump and Denso PCM.|$|R
50|$|At low speeds, The T-lever's wing section floats freely, {{enabling}} the low-lift cams {{to operate the}} <b>valves.</b> The intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> contain internal pistons, which are retained by springs in a lowered position while the engine speed is below the MIVEC switchover point, to avoid contacting the high-lift T-shaped levers. At high speeds, hydraulic pressure elevates the hydraulic pistons, causing the T-lever to push against the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> which in turn makes the high-lift cam operate the valves.|$|R
50|$|In the {{overhead}} camshaft (OHC) design, the cylinder head contains the valves, spark plugs and inlet/exhaust tracts {{just like the}} OHV engine, but the camshaft is now also contained within the cylinder head. The camshaft may be seated centrally between each offset row of inlet and exhaust valves, and still also utilizing <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> (but without any pushrods), or the camshaft may be seated directly above the <b>valves</b> eliminating the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and utilizing 'bucket' tappets.|$|R
50|$|Increased Valvetrain Friction and Wear: Because OHV engines {{generally}} {{use only}} a single intake and exhaust valve, the valves are larger and heavier than those used in multivalve OHC engines. Furthermore, when the valve is closed, the spring must accelerate not only the <b>valve</b> and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> but also the pushrod and lifter. Therefore, OHV engines must use heavier valve springs than OHC engines (multivalve or otherwise). As a result, valvetrain friction and wear is increased. This is especially true with high performance OHV engines utilizing high lift/duration/ramp rate cams with heavier than stock valve springs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} built on 5/8 in thick plate frames, {{arranged}} outside the coupled wheels. It had a boiler with an inside diameter of 2 ft, set at an operating pressure of [...] Its inclined cylinders were arranged outside the plate frames and had a bore of 6 in and a 10 in stroke. It used Murdoch's D type slide valves, actuated by Stephenson <b>valve</b> gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Production of improved, {{cleaner and}} more {{powerful}} common rail direct-injection turbocharged version of Mazda RF engine was started with July 2005 Mazda 6 facelift. This drivetrain still has most of typical features of its predecessor including belt-driven SOHC <b>valve</b> train with <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and mechanically adjusted screws (in contrast to frequently mismatched, absolutely different Ford Duratorq ZSD or PSA DW10 engines).

5000|$|The {{original}} Porsche-designed V16 {{was modified}} as a V12 when in 1938 the Grand Prix regulations {{set a limit}} of 3 litres on supercharged engines. Originally designed as a 6-litre, the first Auto Union engines displaced 4,360 cc and developed [...] They had two cylinder blocks, inclined at an angle of 45 degrees, with a single overhead camshaft to operate all 32 valves. The intake valves in the hemispherical cylinder heads were connected to the camshaft by <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> while for the exhaust <b>valves</b> the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> were connected to the camshaft by pushrods that passed through tubes situated above the spark plugs; thus the engine had three valve covers. The engine provided optimum torque at low engine speeds, and Bernd Rosemeyer later drove an Auto Union around the NÃ¼rburgring in a single gear to prove the engine's flexibility.|$|R
50|$|With the Class 16A, Hendrie {{experimented with}} four-cylinder simple {{expansion}} (simplex) steam power. All four cylinders were arranged in line below the smokebox. The Walschaerts <b>valve</b> gear had <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> {{attached to the}} tail ends of the outer piston valves which passed through the frames and then actuated the adjacent inner piston's valves. It operated in the simplex configuration, whereby steam is fed directly to all four cylinders and spent steam is exhausted by all cylinders directly through the smokebox and up the chimney.|$|R
50|$|Opel had {{introduced}} {{a new generation of}} petrol/gasoline engines in 1966 with the Rekord B and these were the engines that reappeared in the Rekord E in 1977. As before, the stroke length was fixed at 69.8 mm: differences in engine size were achieved by varying the cylinder bore. The engine featured an unusual Camshaft in Head (CIH) configuration. The chain-driven camshaft was positioned directly above the cylinders but this was not a conventional ohc design. The camshaft operated the <b>valves</b> using <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> because the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves ends. One reason for this may have been cosmetic. Opel's so-called (CIH) engine configuration allowed the Rekord to incorporate the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments called for.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{the design}} {{aspects of the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> {{geometry}} has been studied and changed to maximize the cam information exchange to the <b>valve</b> which the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> imposes, as set forth by the Miller US Patent, #4,365,785, issued to James Miller on December 28, 1982, {{often referred to as}} the MID-LIFT Patent. Previously, the specific pivot points with <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> design was based on older and less efficient theories of over-arcing motion which increased wear on valve tips, valve guides and other valve train components, besides diluting the effective cam lobe information as it was transferred through the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> motion to the valve. Jim Miller's MID-LIFT Patent set a new standard of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> geometrical precision which defined and duplicated each engine's specific push-rod to valve attack angles, then designing the rocker's pivot points so that an exact perpendicular relationship on both sides of the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> was attained: with the valve and the pushrod, when the valve was at its [...] "mid-lift" [...] point of motion.|$|R
50|$|Opel had {{introduced}} {{a new generation of}} engines a year earlier with the Rekord B and these were the engines that reappeared in the Rekord C. The engine featured an unusual Camshaft in Head (CIH) engine configuration. The chain-driven camshaft was positioned directly above the cylinders but this was not a conventional ohc design. The camshaft operated the <b>valves</b> using <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> because the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves heads. One reason for this may have been cosmetic. Other automakers such as BMW with their 1500 launched in 1962 and Volkswagen with their NSU designed K70, which finally made it to the showrooms in 1970, squeezed vital centimeters off the height of the engine unit by canting it over at an eccentric angle in the engine bay. Opel's so-called (CIH) engine configuration similarly enabled the Rekord to incorporate the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments demanded.|$|R
5000|$|Honda's {{advanced}} VTEC technology departs {{greatly from}} its previous incarnations by no longer relying on switching between {{two sets of}} lobes on a given camshaft. It instead uses a single cam lobe per <b>valve,</b> and two <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> per <b>valve</b> whereby the second <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> has a movable pivot point, there by provide the varying cam lift. Advanced VTEC motors still use the now standard oil pressure controlled variable cam gear angle mechanism. With these two technologies combined Honda has developed an infinitely variable valve timing and lift system ("VVTL"). Previous versions of VTEC included only staged VVTL i.e. High-Low. With the introduction of i-VTEC the systems gained infinitely variable valve timing but still only staged lift i.e. High-Low. The [...] "infinitely variable" [...] portion of the A-VTEC {{is what makes it}} stand out as a serious evolutionary step in the world of VTEC.|$|R
40|$|Maintenance, when optimized, {{has become}} {{in recent years}} {{one of the most}} {{important}} functions contributing to profitability. As a significant component in the overall cost budget, maintenance optimization can lead to benefits in terms of important reductions in operating costs. Therefore any model that contributes to improving the prediction procedures of the equipment condition is a tool of the upmost importance. In fact, by predicting the state of equipment it is possible to forecast its ability to produce in conformity with quality norms and requirements. Reliability models are a tool serving Maintenance in the achievement of this aim. Among the range of options available, non parametric models enable us to avoid establishing at the outset defined hazard or reliability functions; within the non parametric range the proportional hazards model allows simultaneous evaluation of the various factors involved in failure modes. In this work the proportional hazard model is applied to two complex types of equipment for which maintenance costs assume significant values, a mineral mill and four grinding machines for automobile engine parts. The proportional hazard model, which implies that hazards are proportional to each other within each given group of co variables that affect the occurrence of failures, and the relative influence of each factor within the group, provides a forecast of the future reliability of the equipment to which it is applied. The Maintenance Manager is able, on the basis of this data, to define the optimal maintenance to carry out on the equipment during the period covered by the forecast. In the case of the four grinders, the proportional hazard model with time dependent co variates is applied to two machines, both producing the same type of component - <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> A relation is established between the condition and quality co variates. In conclusion the advantages and disadvantages of the model, from the phase of defining co variates and failure modes through to results analysis are summarizedAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

50|$|From September 1965 Opel fitted a newly {{developed}} 2,784 cc straight six Camshaft in Head (CIH) of , that enabled {{the car to}} reach {{a top speed of}} 170 km/h. This unit was developed in parallel with a four-cylinder CIH which debuted in an upgraded Opel Rekord at the same time. Several manufacturers replaced pre-war side-valve engines with new overhead camshaft power-plants during this decade; the new Opel also carried its camshaft directly above the cylinders. The chain-driven camshaft still operated the <b>valves</b> using <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> because the camshaft itself was not positioned a sufficient distance above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves.

5000|$|A {{formal letter}} sent to Porsche {{from members of}} the US-based Rennlist.com [...] "991.1 GT3 Concerned Owners Group" [...] about {{additional}} engine durability issues lead to a meeting between representatives of the owners group and Porsche, including head of Porsche Motorsport Dr. Frank-Steffen Walliser, on 3 August 2017 at the Porsche North America Atlanta headquarters. According to Dr. Walliser the concerning high-RPM misfire issue could be traced primarily to a metallurgical defect in certain batches of [...] "finger followers" [...] (<b>valve</b> train <b>rocker</b> <b>arms)</b> and secondarily to individual driving patterns and engine variations - such as temperature, oil quality, oil viscosity and parts tolerances - that lead to increased wear of the specific parts. In response to the issue and after implementing new engine tests to trace down the issue Porsche had developed revised camshafts and finger followers and offers a fully transferable 10-year, 120,000 mile extended engine warranty to all 991.1 generation GT3 owners world-wide that covers the replacement of the defective engine with a new engine with the revised parts if failure {{is a direct result of}} the finger-follower issue. The base bumper-to-bumper warranty and all other warranty terms and conditions remain unchanged.

50|$|For the Rekord B the {{manufacturer}} {{introduced a new}} generation of four cylinder engines to replace the robust but by now technically outdated engine first seen in the 1937 Opel Olympia. Several manufacturers replaced pre-war side-valve engines with new overhead camshaft engines during this decade, and the new Opel also carried its camshaft directly above the cylinders. This did away with the old rods and rocker linkage that had been a feature of the old engines. However, instead of operating directly on the cylinder valves, the camshaft still operated the <b>valves</b> using <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> because the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves. One reason for this may have been cosmetic.

Opel's so-called Camshaft in Head (CIH) engine configuration similarly enabled a succession of Opels to feature the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments favoured. The camshaft on the new Opel engine was chain driven, which also represented a change from the 1930s design philosophy implicit in the directly cogwheel driven camshaft included in earlier generations of Opel Rekord.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difficulty}} of incorporating VTEC {{for both the}} intake and exhaust valves in a SOHC engine has been removed on the J37A4 by a novel design of the intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Each exhaust <b>valve</b> on the J37A4 corresponds to one primary and one secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Therefore, there are a total of twelve primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and twelve secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> However, each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> is shaped similar to a [...] "Y" [...] which allows it to contact two intake valves at once. One primary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> corresponds to each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> As {{a result of this}} design, there are only six primary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and six secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R

50|$|The primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> {{contacts}} a low-profile camshaft lobe during low-RPM engine operation. Once VTEC engagement occurs, the {{oil pressure}} {{flowing from the}} exhaust rocker shaft into the primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> forces the VTEC switching piston into the secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> thereby locking both exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> together. The high-profile camshaft lobe which normally contacts the secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> alone during low-RPM engine operation is able to move both exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> together which are locked as a unit. The same occurs for the intake rocker shaft, except that the high-profile camshaft lobe operates the primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... {{the intake}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are marked {{so they are}} {{correctly}} placed on the rocker shaft when servicing. An IN1 or IN2 will be embossed on each <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> As viewed {{from the front of}} the engine the Number 1 intake valve of each cylinder and the number 2 intake valve have an IN1 marked and IN2 marked <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> that mates with it. New IN1 <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> can also be identified by a Green painted mark on the top of the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> The IN2 <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> have a white mark.

50|$|The {{camshaft}} is billet steel, {{made from}} 8620 carbon or S7 through-hardened tool steel or similar. It runs in five oil pressure lubricated bearing shells and {{is driven by}} gears {{in the front of}} the engine. Mechanical roller lifters (cam followers) ride atop the cam lobes and drive the steel push rods up into the steel <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> that actuate the <b>valves.</b> The <b>rockers</b> are of roller tip type on the intake and exhaust sides. Like the cam follower rollers, the steel tip roller rotates on a steel roller bearing and the steel <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> rotate on a pair of through-hardened tool steel shafts within bronze bushings. Intake and exhaust rockers are billet. The dual valve springs are of coaxial type and made out of titanium. Valve retainers are also made of titanium, as are the rocker covers.|$|R

50|$|For {{car engines}} the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are {{generally}} steel stampings, providing a reasonable balance of strength, weight and economical cost. Because the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are, in part, reciprocating weight, excessive mass {{especially at the}} lever ends limits the engine's ability to reach high operating speeds. For this reason, aluminum is often used for high performance, aftermarket <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> for pushrod engines {{as well as many}} OEM <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> on OHC engines. Aluminum rockers on OHC engines often have a steel pad or roller where the cam contacts the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> in order to reduce wear. Truck engines (mostly diesel) use stronger and stiffer <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> made of cast iron (usually ductile), or forged carbon steel.|$|R
50|$|Advanced VTEC has a {{standard}} camshaft and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> attached as they normally are with camshaft overhead, and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> pushing {{down on the}} poppet valves. The camshaft {{is surrounded by a}} partially open drum which has secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> attached to it via a pivoting point. These secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> which have a varying depth profile (similar to cams), are directly actuated by the camshaft, in a scissor-like manner. The primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are actuated by the secondary (drum attached) <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> The drum will only rotate to advance or retard the position of the secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> to take advantage of their varying profiles. Thus, through varying the position of the drum about its axis, each cam profile is changed to an optimal height for maximum engine performance without sacrificing fuel efficiency at lower speeds.|$|R
