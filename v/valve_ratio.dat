This paper {{presents}} the modified quadruple-tanks process, a flexible laboratory process with an adjustable Simulink block, which is multivariable system consisting of four interconnected water tanks included with lower interacting valve. The new general form of modified quadruple-tanks mathematic model and Simulink block is {{developed for the}} advantage of control system analysis and design which can make practical use for many styles of multivariable process by adjusting the value of connected valve resistance, inlet and outlet <b>valve</b> <b>ratio.</b> In this paper described clearly about physical properties of modified quadruple-tanks process, mathematical modeling, transformation of modified quadruple-tanks process, analysis of right half-plane zeros characteristic and controller design for multivariable system.

40|$|Water {{distribution}} networks (WDNs) {{represent a}} class of critical infrastructure networks. When a disaster occurs, component failures in a WDN may trigger system failures that result in larger-scale reactions. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the evolution of system reliability and failure propagation time for a WDN experiencing cascading failures, and find the critical pipes which may reduce system reliability dramatically. Multiple factors are considered in the method such as network topology, the balance of water supply and demand, demand multiplier, and pipe break isolation. The pipe-based attack with multiple failure scenarios is simulated in the paper. A case WDN is used to illustrate the method. The {{results show that the}} lowest capacity gets stronger when a WDN is short of supply, becoming the dominant factor that decides the evolution of system reliability and failure propagation time. The <b>valve</b> <b>ratio</b> (VR) and system reliability present a flattened S curve relationship, and there are two turning points in VR. The critical pipes can be identified. With the fixed 5 % valves, a WDN can improve system reliability and resist cascading failures effectively. The findings provide insights into the system reliability and failure propagation time for WDNs experiencing cascading failures. It is proven to be useful in future studies focused on the operation and management of water services...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{benefits}} and limitations of repeated bedside echocardiographic examinations in children during mechanical ventilation. For the purposes of this study, we selected the data of over a time period from 2006 to 2010. Methods A total of 235 children, average age 3. 21 (SD 1. 32) years were included into the study and divided into etiopathogenic groups. High-risk groups comprised: Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), return of spontaneous circulation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ROSC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), cardiomyopathy (CMP) and cardiopulmonary disease (CPD). Transthoracic echocardiography was carried out during mechanical ventilation. The following data were collated for statistical evaluation: right and left ventricle myocardial performance indices (RV MPI; LV MPI), left ventricle shortening fraction (SF), cardiac output (CO), and the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>ratio</b> of peak velocity of early wave (E) to the peak velocity of active wave (A) as E/A ratio. The data was processed after a period of recovery, i. e. one hour after the introduction of invasive lines (time- 1) and after 72 hours of comprehensive treatment (time- 2). The overall development of parameters over time was compared within groups and between groups using the distribution-free Wilcoxons and two-way ANOVA tests. Results A total of 870 echocardiographic examinations were performed.

40|$|The use of {{intracardiac}} assist devices is expanding, {{and correct}} position {{of these devices}} is required for optimal functioning. The aortic valve is an important landmark for positioning of those devices. It would be of great value if the device position could be easily monitored on plain supine chest radiograph in the ICU. We introduce a ratio-based tool for determination of the aortic valve location on plain supine chest radiograph images, {{which can be used}} to evaluate intracardiac device position. Retrospective observational study. Large academic medical center. Patients admitted to the ICU and supported by an intracardiac assist device. We developed a ratio to determine the aortic valve location on supine chest radiograph images. This ratio is used to assess the position of a cardiac assist device and is compared with echocardiographic findings. Supine anterior-posterior chest radiographs of patients with an aortic valve prosthesis (n = 473) were analyzed to determine the location of the aortic valve. We calculated several ratios with the potential to determine the position of the aortic valve. The aortic <b>valve</b> location <b>ratio,</b> defined as the distance between the carina and the aortic valve, divided by the thoracic width, was found to be the best performing <b>ratio.</b> The aortic <b>valve</b> location <b>ratio</b> determines the location of the aortic valve caudal to the carina, at a distance of 0. 25 [*]±[*] 0. 05 times the thoracic width for male patients and 0. 28 [*]±[*] 0. 05 times the thoracic width for female patients.

40|$|ObjectivesOur {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} feasibility and early to medium-term outcome of stenting the patent ductus arteriosus at the time of radiofrequency valvotomy in the subgroup of patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and intermediate right ventricle. BackgroundStenting of the patent ductus arteriosus and radiofrequency valvotomy have been proposed as the initial intervention for patients with intermediate right ventricle inasmuch as the sustainability for biventricular circulation or 1 ½-ventricle repair is unclear in the early period. MethodsBetween January 2001 and April 2009, of 143 patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, 37 who had bipartite right ventricle underwent radiofrequency valvotomy and stenting of the patent ductus arteriosus as the initial procedure. The mean tricuspid valve z-score was − 3. 8 ± 2. 2 and the mean tricuspid valve/mitral <b>valve</b> <b>ratio</b> was 0. 62 ± 0. 16. ResultsMedian age was 10 days (3 – 65 days) and median weight 3. 1 kg (2. 4 – 4. 9 kg). There was no procedural mortality. Acute stent thrombosis developed in 1 patient and necessitated emergency systemic–pulmonary shunt. There were 2 early in-hospital deaths owing to low cardiac output syndrome. One late death occurred owing to right ventricular failure after the operation. Survival after the initial procedure was 94 % at 6 months and 91 % at 5 years. At a median follow-up of 4 years (6 months to 8 years), 17 (48 %) attained biventricular circulation with or without other interventions and 9 (26 %) achieved 1 ½-ventricle repair. The freedom from reintervention was 80 %, 68 %, 58 %, and 40 % at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. ConclusionsConcomitant stenting of the patent ductus arteriosus at the time of radiofrequency valvotomy in patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and intermediate right ventricle is feasible and safe with encouraging medium-term outcome...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{semi-active}} magnetorheological (MR) and electrorheological (ER) fluid technology based {{devices and}} {{systems have been}} developed and successfully utilized in many applications as valves, shock absorbers, dampers and clutch/brake systems. These promising devices have the adaptivity of the fully active systems to accommodate varying external excitations while maintaining the reliability and fail-safe features of the passive systems. Compared with ER based devices or systems, MR based devices have recently received special attention due to their high performance with minimal power requirements. Moreover MR fluids have significantly higher yield strength and are less sensitive to contaminants and temperature compared with the ER fluids. The geometric optimal design of MR valves/dampers {{is an important issue}} to improve the damper performance, such as damping force, <b>valve</b> <b>ratio</b> and inductive time constant. Considering this, the primary {{purpose of this study is}} to establish a general design optimization methodology to optimally design single–coil annular MR valves constrained in a specific volume in MR damper. To accomplish this, first the damping force of MR damper has been modeled using Bingham plastic model. The magnetic circuit of MR damper has been analyzed using finite element method in ANSYS environment to obtain magnetic field intensity which can be subsequently used to obtain the yield stress of the MR fluid in the active volume where the magnetic flux crosses. Then the developed finite element model of the MR valve is effectively used to construct an approximate response function relating the magnetic field intensity to the identified design parameters in the selected design space using response surface method and design of experiment methodology. Using the derived approximate relation for the magnetic field intensity in the MR damper model, the design optimization problem has been formulated using gradient based nonlinear mathematical programming technique based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) technique and also stochastic optimization technique based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find optimal geometrical parameters of the MR valve in order to maximize the damping performance under given constrained volume. Finally a PID controller has been designed to evaluate the close-loop performance of the optimally designed MR damper in a quarter-car suspension model. ...|$|E
40|$|Carbonate {{production}} by brachiopods in shallow-water habitats is generally {{expected to be}} not sufficiently high and temporally persistent {{to allow them to}} form very thick and densely packed shell concentrations. The formation of thick brachiopod concentrations requires long-term persistence of populations with high density of individuals, and such circumstances are assumed to be rare especially during the Cenozoic. However, here we show that the large-sized brachiopod Terebratula terebratula, the most common species in benthic assemblages with epifaunal bivalves and irregular echinoids, formed several decameter- to meter-thick, densely packed concentrations in shallow siliciclastic, high-energy environments, in a seaway connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the Mediterranean Sea during the Latest Tortonian (Late Miocene, Guadix Basin, southern Spain). This brachiopod formed (1) meter-scale, thick, parautochthonous concentrations in a prodelta setting and (2) thin, mainly allochthonous, tide- and storm-reworked concentrations in megaripples and dunes. The abundance of brachiopods at the spatial scale of the Guadix Basin seems to be mainly related to intermediate levels of sedimentation rate and current velocity because abundance and thickness of shell concentrations decline both (1) in onshore direction towards delta foresets with high sedimentation rate generated by debris flows and (2) in offshore direction with increasing levels of tide- and storm-induced substrate instability. Although brachiopods in dune and megaripple deposits are more fragmented, disarticulated, and sorted, and have a higher pedicle/brachial <b>valve</b> <b>ratio</b> than in prodelta deposits, taphonomic damage is still relatively high in prodelta deposits. Terebratula terebratula thus formed thick concentrations in spite of that disintegration processes were relatively intense along the whole depositional gradient. Therefore, population dynamic of this species was probably characterized by production maxima that were comparable to some Cenozoic molluscs in terms of their productivity potential to form thick shell concentrations in shallow subtidal environments. We suggest that temporal changes in brachiopod carbonate production have a significant spatial and phylogenetic component because multiple large-sized species of the family Terebratulidae, which underwent radiation during the Cenozoic, attained high abundances and formed shell concentrations in temperate regions.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the changes in}} cell morphology and elemental composition with varying iron nutritional status in four oceanic and two coastal isolates of the marine pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia. When iron-deficient, most isolates exhibited slower specific growth rates (m), reduced maximum photochemical yields (Phi(M)), and lower chlorophyll a (Chl a) contents than iron-replete cultures. Iron-deficient cells exhibited reduced cell volumes, primarily {{as the result of}} decreased valve transapical widths, which increased the <b>valve</b> aspect <b>ratios.</b> The increase in aspect ratios varied among isolates and was not correlated with the degree of growth limitation due to iron-deficiency. In all Pseudo-nitzschia isolates, the mean carbon (C-cell), nitrogen (N-cell), and silicon (Si-cell) cell quotas of iron-deficient cells decreased when compared to iron-replete cells. Similarly, in five out of the six isolates, the mean C and N quotas normalized per unit cell volume (C-vol and N-vol) of iron-deficient cells also decreased, but by a lesser extent. In contrast, there were no clear differences in the changes in the mean Si quotas normalized per unit cell surface area (Si-sa). The Si-cell: N-cell and Si-cell : C-cell ratios (quotas normalized per cell) of iron-deficient cells increased compared to iron-replete conditions due to greater reductions in C and N cell quotas compared to Si-cell quotas. This increase in the Si-cell: N-cell ratio was proportional to the changes in the <b>valve</b> aspect <b>ratios.</b> Our results show that iron-deficient Pseudo-nitzschia cells acclimate to low iron concentrations by increasing their <b>valve</b> aspect <b>ratios,</b> thus reducing their cell volumes and increasing their surface area-to-volume (SA : V) ratios. These changes in cell morphology increase the Si-containing valve surface area relative to the volume of the internal components, which may then influence the cellular elemental composition, in particular, the Si : N and Si : C ratios...|$|R

This {{should not be}} confused with the volumetric efficiency, which relates the volume of water delivered to total water taken from the source. The portion of water available at the delivery pipe will be reduced by the ratio of the delivery head to the supply head.

Vilenus [18] applied trajectory {{sensitivity analysis}} to the valve-controlled cylinder system of the logging machine and the mathematical model of this system was simplified to fifth order model where the servo valve flow-pressure nonlinearity and dead zone nonlinearity were taken into consideration. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of ten main parameters containing viscous damping coefficient, conversion mass, internal leakage coefficient of servo cylinder, effective piston area of servo cylinder, effective bulk modulus, servo valve gain, nature frequency of servo <b>valve,</b> damping <b>ratio</b> of servo <b>valve,</b> conversion coefficient and system supply oil pressure is obtained with parameters change 1 % under single working condition.

Furthermore, Farasat et al. [19] founded the fourth order linear mathematical model of the valve-controlled cylinder position control system where the servo valve flow-pressure nonlinearity is linearized partially. The sensitivity of other parameters, such as servo valve torque motor constant, servo valve area constant, orifice opening of metering valve, system return oil pressure, supply oil volume, return oil volume and input signal voltage, is given with parameters change 1 % under single working condition by four sensitivity evaluation methods including VILENUS method, revised VILENUS method, Entirety index method and Individual characteristics method. The analysis results indicated that the sensitivity of effective piston area of servo cylinder, flow coefficient, conversion mass and input signal voltage is relatively small. Kong et al. [20 – 22] first established the fifth linear order mathematical model for the hydraulic drive unit of quadruped robot and derived the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Aimed at the imprecise conclusion of sensitivity analysis obtained from the linear model, some nonlinear models are also established. Besides, the sensitivity mathematical expressions with nonlinear and time-varied parameters are derived under the trotting gait working conditions. Kong et al. [23] derived the mathematical model of the second order trajectory sensitivity analysis based on the mathematical model of the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Therefore, the situation where the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis accuracy of some parameters is not high is improved. Then the experimental verification is conducted.|$|R
40|$|Objectives Programming is the {{phenomenon}} whereby the body's structures and functions are permanently set by nutrition and other influences during early development. There is increasing evidence that programming in utero initiates cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that susceptibility to developing chronic {{rheumatic heart disease}} on exposure to Streptococcus pyogenes is programmed. Methods We studied hospital admissions and deaths from chronic rheumatic heart disease in 20, 431 people born in Helsinki, Finland, during 1924 – 1944. One hundred and one people, 56 men, and 45 women, had chronic rheumatic heart disease. Results The disease {{was not associated with}} body or placental size at birth. It was, however, associated with a long umbilical cord so that the hazard ratio for the disease was 1. 23 (95 % CI 1. 04 – 1. 45, P?=? 0. 02) for every 10 cm increase in cord length. This association was present in people with mitral <b>valve</b> disease, hazard <b>ratio</b> 1. 5 (1. 20 – 1. 89, P?<? 0. 0001), but not in people with aortic <b>valve</b> disease, hazard <b>ratio</b> 1. 0 (0. 76 – 1. 33, P?=? 0. 97). Growing up in large households increased the risk of rheumatic heart disease. Conclusion Longer umbilical cords have more spirals and a greater density of spirals per unit of length. Increased spiraling will increase the resistance to flow and the pressure load on the fetal heart. This could affect the development of the heart's valves and make them more vulnerable to the autoimmune process initiated by Streptococcus pyogenes. The mitral valve may be more vulnerable than the aortic valve because the valve leaflets are larger and therefore have greater wall stress. <br/...|$|R
40|$|A four-cylinder, four-stroke, {{gasoline}} engine with direct injection fuel was commissioned {{and used to}} achieve CAI combustion. CAI combustion was achieved by employing short-duration, low-lift camshafts and early exhaust valve closure. Trapping sufficient volumes of exhaust residual provided the necessary thermal energy needed to initiate auto-ignition. The effects of valve opening durations on the CAI operation range were investigated at different air/fuel <b>ratios,</b> <b>valve</b> timings and injection timings. Furthermore the effect on engine performance, exhaust emissions, fuel consumption and combustion characteristics were also investigated. Methods {{which could be used}} for CAI combustion region enlargement were also studied. These included spark-assisted CAI at different EVC timings and valve durations, CAI operation at 2000 rpm and CAI combustion at late fuel injection timingsEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} of the interpretation by two individuals of a combined echocardiographic and Doppler method of calculating output was studied in 30 normal adults. In each subject three separate cardiac cycles were recorded to calculate maximal mitral <b>valve</b> orifice, the <b>ratio</b> of mean to maximal mitral valve leaflet separation, {{and the mean}} flow velocity through the mitral valve. The recordings were digitised twice by two independent observers. Estimates of cardiac output ranged from 3. 2 to 8. 11 1 /min. Analysis of variance showed that interobserver and intraobserver variability for these measurements was 5. 8 % and 6. 1 % respectively. It is concluded that the reproducibility for interpreting this non-invasive method is adequate for clinical use in adults with cardiac outputs within the normal range...|$|R
40|$|The {{adherence}} of 18 {{strains of}} streptococci to sections of normal canine and human aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves and to canine interatrial septum was compared in an in vitro system. Quantitative measurements of adherence ratios were performed by two independent methods. Adherence ratios for Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. bovis, and Group D streptococci were higher (0. 0058 - 0. 0101) {{than for the}} other streptococcal strains studied (0. 0025 - 0. 0041). With the exception of Group D streptococci, adherence ratios for each bacterial strain were similar with the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid <b>valve</b> sections. Adherence <b>ratios</b> with normal human and canine valve leaflets were similar, but adherence ratios with interatrial septum were lower than with normal valve sections...|$|R
40|$|Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT) are a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} in children. We measured the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease in 312 patients with CAKUT preselected for the presence of anomalies in kidney number or size. A model of dialysis-free survival from birth was established {{as a function of the}} renal CAKUT categories of solitary kidney; unilateral and bilateral hypodysplasia; renal hypodysplasia associated with posterior urethral valves; and multicystic and horseshoe kidney. Cox regression analysis took into account the concomitant presence of vesicoureteral reflux, year of diagnosis, and time-varying values of serum creatinine, proteinuria, and hypertension. By 30 years of age, 58 patients had started dialysis, giving a yearly incidence of 0. 023 over a combined 2474 patient risk years. The risk for dialysis was significantly higher for patients with a solitary kidney or with renal hypodysplasia associated with posterior urethral <b>valves</b> (hazard <b>ratios</b> of 2. 43 and 5. 1, respectively) compared to patients with unilateral or bilateral renal hypodysplasia, or multicystic or horseshoe kidney, and was independent of other prognostic factors. Our study shows that sub-clinical defects of the solitary kidney may be responsible for a poorer prognosis compared to more benign forms of CAKUT. Prospective studies are needed to validate these results...|$|R
