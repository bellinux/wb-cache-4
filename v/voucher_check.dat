Till 2014, the bank Disbursed 471618 loans which amount is Tk 291871 million. The success of SME will largely depends on the selection of a business and man behind the business. BRAC Bank provides this facility to those whose business operation is minimum one year and environment friendly business. It provides no loan facility to tobacco business.

BRAC Bank gives equally important to the guarantor to getting the SME facility. The guarantor must have the ability to repay the entire loan and is economically solvent. The guarantor should know the entrepreneur reasonable well and should preferable live in the same community. SME loan can be repaid in two ways, 1) in equal monthly loan installment with monthly interest payment. 2) By one single payment at maturity, with interest repayable a quarter ends residual on maturity. Customer relation officers search new potential customer by providing door-to-door service. They talk with clients and monitor their manners, activities of their business and provide the loan to the potential customers. SME, BRAC Bank may provide 100 % of net required working capital but not exceeding 75 % of the aggregate value of the inventory and account receivable. Normally, organizations meet their working capital from over draft loan but BRAC Bank designed the loan to meet working capital but as term loan which is repaid in installment. The customer relation officers also monitor the borrowers’ activities after the loan disbursement. Monitoring also facilitates the buildup of an information base for future reference. Asset Operation Department acts as the last line defense of the bank. This division is responsible for the complete disbursement, recovery and closing procedures. The procedures start from the sanction of the SME loan. The respective select potential enterprise, collect confidential information about the enterprise, open clients account is the respective bank where BRAC Bank has its own account, filled up CIB form and send it to the Asset Operation Department. Then the Asset Operation Department starts its activities. The Asset Operation Department sends the CIB form to the Bangladesh Bank to know the CIB status of the applicant. If the report found clean then it send back to the unit office for send proposal for the loan. Then the unit office sanction loan and send it again in Asset Operation Department for disbursement. The Asset Operation Department then prepare a loan file and checks all necessary documents, prepare a list and disburse it.
