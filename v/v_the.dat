50|$|Selig's {{experiment}} was highly successful - those nine games drew 264,297 fans. Those games {{took place on}} May 15 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> California Angels, May 28 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Baltimore Orioles, June 17 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland Indians, June 24 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Minnesota Twins, July 11 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> New York Yankees, July 22 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Oakland A's, August 2 vs. Washington Senators, August 8 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Boston Red Sox, and August 26 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Detroit Tigers. In Chicago that season, the Sox drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 58 home dates. In {{just a handful of}} games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted for nearly one-third of the total attendance at White Sox games. In light of this success, Selig and Allyn agreed that County Stadium would host Sox home games again the next season.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, the Sox {{schedule}} in Milwaukee was {{expanded to include}} 11 home games (one against every other franchise in the American League at the time). Although those games were attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, {{for an average of}} 18,019) they represented a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous year - over one-third of the fans who went to Sox home games in 1969 did so at County Stadium (in the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago, the Sox drew 391,335 for an average of 6,632 per game). Those games took place on April 23 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> California Angels, May 22 vs. Detroit Tigers, May 28 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> New York Yankees, June 11 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland Indians, June 16 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Seattle Pilots (who eventually became the Brewers the next season), July 2 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Minnesota Twins, July 7 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Oakland A's, August 6 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Washington Senators, August 13 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Boston Red Sox, September 1 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Baltimore Orioles, and September 26 <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> Kansas City Royals.|$|R
5|$|An {{alliance}} between Przemysł II and Henry IV placed Bolesław the Pious {{in a very}} uncomfortable situation, because he {{being a member of}} Pro-Hungarian coalition of Polish princes (in addition to him, it included Bolesław <b>V</b> <b>the</b> Chaste, Leszek II the Black and Konrad II of Masovia) could not remain indifferent to this close cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, which was the leader of the Pro-bohemian coalition (where other Silesian princes also belonged).|$|E
5|$|Another {{proof of}} the close {{cooperation}} between uncle and nephew {{in the last years}} of Bolesław the Pious' life is in the events that taken place in mid-1278 (probably in August): Bolesław, using the weakeness of the Margraviate of Brandenburg during the fight between Ottokar II and Rudolph I, in only eight days attacked Neumark and advanced until Myślibórz, where his troops defeated Margrave Otto <b>V</b> <b>the</b> Long.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Court held that, {{due to the}} Eleventh Amendment, {{federal courts}} could not {{exercise}} ancillary jurisdiction over cross-claims by counties against states. Although only two other justices agreed with the entirety of Justice Powell's majority opinion, Brennan and Marshall agreed with Parts I-IV and VI (the Oneida's claims against the counties) and Burger, White, and Rehnquist agreed with Part <b>V</b> (<b>the</b> counties claims against the state), thus forging separate majorities.|$|E

5|$|In 1514, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus (1490–1557) married James IV's widow Margaret Tudor, {{daughter}} of Henry VII, and Regent of Scotland for her infant son James <b>V.</b> <b>The</b> couple unsuccessfully conspired {{to take the}} young King to England, sparking off civil war. The Regency was handed to John Stewart, Duke of Albany, who seized Tantallon in 1515, although it was returned the following year when Angus made his peace.|$|E
5|$|In 1533, Henry {{broke with}} Pope Paul III {{in order to}} annul the long-standing {{marriage}} to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles <b>V,</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Emperor, {{and he took the}} annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England now appeared certain.|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} 2002 in Langkat, North Sumatra, {{to determine the effects}} of glyphosate application timing on the growth and grain yield of glyphosate-resistant corn. Glyphosate at 1, 500 g ha - 1 was applied at twelve different treatments namely at <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 3 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 4 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 5 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 6 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 7 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 8 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 9 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 10 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 12 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 3 stage followed by at <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 7 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 3 stage followed by at V 12 stage and <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 4 stage followed by at V 8 stage of glyphosate-resistant corn growth. In addition to the twelve treatments, two other treatments (maintained weed free all season and weed infested all season) were provided for comparison. Competition between corn and weed at the beginning of growth prior to glyphosate application affected growth and yield of corn more than that of post application. Compared to yield resulted from weed-free plot all season, no significant grain yield were found when glyphosate was applied at <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 3 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 4 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 3 and <b>V</b> 7 stage, <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 3 and V 12 stage and <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 4 and V 8 stage. Single application of glyphosate at <b>the</b> <b>V</b> 3 corn growth was found to be the best timing of glyphosate application for weed control in Langkat, North Sumatra conditions...|$|R
5|$|In 2006, in {{the case}} of Dung Thi Thuy Nguyen <b>v.</b> <b>The</b> Netherlands, the Committee {{expressed}} concerns about aspects of parental leave provisions in The Netherlands.

5|$|In September 1277 King Ottokar II held in {{the border}} city of Opava a meeting of Polish princes. Sources doesn't specify either the exact date or the participants. Historians {{speculate}} only that they could be: Henryk IV Probus, Bolesław <b>V</b> <b>the</b> Chaste, Leszek II the Black, Władysław of Opole with his sons, Henry III of Głogów and Przemysł II.

5|$|The Duke of Greater Poland felt quite safe when he {{was invited}} to a meeting {{organized}} by Henry IV Probus. The meeting took place probably on 9 February 1281 in one of the Silesian villages; however, the Duke of Wrocław had another plan – he broke all the rules of hospitality, imprisoned the three princes who where invited (Przemysł II, Henry <b>V</b> <b>the</b> Fat of Legnica, and Henry III of Głogów), and forced them to make political concessions. This action was made even more outrageous by the fact that only four years earlier Przemysł II and Henry III risked their lives and armies to save Henry IV Probus in the Battle of Stolec, which ended with victory of Henry <b>V</b> <b>the</b> Fat, the third guest of this meeting. Historians speculate that the reason for the Duke of Wrocław to make this radical move was probably his desire to increase his influence over the neighboring principalities as part of his own plans for a royal coronation.|$|E
