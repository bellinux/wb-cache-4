500|$|The game {{revolves}} around <b>vehicle</b> <b>construction,</b> {{in which the}} player must design their own vehicles ranging from automobiles, motorbikes, boats and aeroplanes. Gameplay itself is centred on completing a series of challenges depending on the specific vehicle, although {{some parts of the}} game retain platforming traits. Development of the game first began as a remake of the original Banjo-Kazooie, although a game which involved [...] "more traditional platforming" [...] was conceptualised. Eventually, the project evolved into a construction-oriented game which was inspired by connecting Lego blocks.|$|E
500|$|Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb {{praised the}} driving {{mechanics}} and <b>vehicle</b> <b>construction,</b> despite initially being {{frustrated with the}} game's controls. Shoemaker praised the innovation the game offered; stating that the vehicle-building and enormous variety of mission types would attract all audiences. A reviewer of GamesRadar heavily criticised the overall mechanics and vehicular gameplay, stating that it was both [...] "ridiculously complicated" [...] and unsuitable for a Banjo game. The reviewer of GamesRadar also criticised Rare's [...] "old habit" [...] of [...] "collect-a-thons", asserting that {{all the elements of}} the game were [...] "clumsily put together" [...] and the aspects of unlocking new levels were difficult to understand due to the many items that were pre-required. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer heralded the <b>vehicle</b> <b>construction</b> as [...] "fun", however he criticised Rare's [...] "habit of forcing the player" [...] to collect large quantities of items to build their vehicles and progress through the game. A reviewer of GameTrailers similarly criticised the vehicular theme of the game, citing that the sensitive physics and controls adds up to an overall frustrating experience. Erik Brudvig of IGN US praised the game's absence of platform elements, and asked fans of Banjo-Kazooie not to [...] "write the game off" [...] due to its change in genre. Brudvig also heralded the vehicle-creation as [...] "powerful" [...] and the depth of the game's mechanics. However, Matt Wales of IGN UK criticised the new direction of the game's genre, summarising the lack of platforming action as [...] "screwed up". Wales stated that the game's mechanics and <b>vehicle</b> <b>construction</b> [...] "fails badly" [...] {{due to the lack of}} [...] "any fundamentally engaging" [...] framework to support the game's creative elements. Tom Orry of VideoGamer praised the complex construction of vehicles and stated that it was the most rewarding aspect of the game. Chris Kohler of Wired heavily criticised the mechanics, challenges and new genre of the game, panning the overall experience as a [...] "disappointing, simplistic sandbox". Kohler also added that the racing missions were [...] "boring" [...] and frustrating, similarly stating the same for vehicle customisation. In a retrospective review, David Roberts of GamesRadar stated that Nuts & Bolts [...] "laid down groundwork" [...] for future games that revolve around construction, such as Fallout 4 and Kerbal Space Program.|$|E

500|$|Rare {{unveiled}} {{their work}} on Xbox Live avatars, [...] (the next instalment in the Viva Piñata [...] series), and [...] in 2008. Made by the core team that developed the first Banjo-Kazooie, [...] Nuts & Bolts received significant criticism from players due to its focus on <b>vehicle</b> <b>construction</b> rather than traditional platforming. Despite generally positive reviews, the company's titles for Microsoft sold poorly and Microsoft decided to restructure the studio {{at the end of}} the decade. In March 2010 Rare opened a new facility at Fazeley Studios in Digbeth, Birmingham. Later that year Microsoft confirmed that Scott Henson, a developer who had worked on the hardware and software designs of the Xbox 360 console and Kinect for Xbox 360, replaced Mark Betteridge as studio manager and announced a focus on Xbox Live avatars. Rare also shifted their focus to Kinect. According to Henson, [...] "Kinect will be the main focus for Rare going forwards as it's a very rich canvas. This is just the beginning of an experience that will touch millions of people". Rare's first Kinect project, Kinect Sports, was released in November 2010. Originally titled Sports Star, a more-complex sports simulation games, the game was streamlined into what Microsoft executive Don Mattrick hoped would be the Kinect equivalent of Wii Sports. According to a former Rare employee, the team was worried about the game during its development because of Kinect's limitations. Despite average reviews it was a commercial success, selling three million units by May 2011. Many non-Kinect teams at Rare and BigPark, another Microsoft studio, collaborated on the development of sequel [...] Combining with the sales of the first Kinect Sports, the game sold more than 8 million copies.|$|E

2500|$|Toronto was not {{the only}} city looking for such a solution, and there {{appeared}} to be a large market for automated transit systems in the 1970s and 80s. As GO-Urban was larger than most networks being considered, practically every company working on an AGT, or hoping to, submitted a proposal. The first cut reduced the field to a still-large fourteen proposals. After a year-long selection process, GO selected the Krauss-Maffei Transurban maglev as the preferred solution. As a maglev, the system would be silent, addressing concerns about noise on elevated portions of the track. Additionally, the system's linear induction motor did not require physical contact for traction, which meant it would run with equal capacity in snow or icy conditions. Krauss-Maffei agreed to do all <b>vehicle</b> <b>construction</b> in Ontario, and allow the local office to handle all sales efforts in North America - a stipulation most US companies were not willing to agree to. Local testing, construction and sales were centralized in the newly created [...] "Ontario Transportation Development Corporation" [...] (OTDC).|$|E
2500|$|Tungsten-halogen {{technology}} (also called [...] "quartz-halogen", [...] "quartz-iodine", [...] "iodine cycle", etc.) {{increases the}} effective luminous efficacy of a tungsten filament: when operating {{at a higher}} filament temperature which results in more lumens output per watt input, a tungsten-halogen lamp has a much longer brightness lifetime than similar filaments operating without the halogen regeneration cycle. [...] At equal luminosity, the halogen-cycle bulbs also have longer lifetimes. European-designed halogen headlamp light sources are generally configured to provide more light at the same power consumption as their lower-output plain tungsten counterparts. By contrast, many US-based designs are configured to reduce or minimize the power consumption while keeping light output above the legal minimum requirements; some US tungsten-halogen headlamp light sources produce less initial light than their non-halogen counterparts. A slight theoretical fuel economy benefit and reduced <b>vehicle</b> <b>construction</b> cost through lower wire and switch ratings were the claimed benefits when American industry first chose how to implement tungsten-halogen technology. There was an improvement in seeing distance with US halogen high beams, which were permitted {{for the first time}} to produce 150,000 candela (cd) per vehicle, double the non-halogen limit of 75,000cd but still well shy of the international European limit of 225,000cd. After replaceable halogen bulbs were permitted in US headlamps in 1983, development of US bulbs continued to favor long bulb life and low power consumption, while European designs continued to prioritise optical precision and maximum output.|$|E
