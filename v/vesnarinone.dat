50|$|Since AP {{is known}} to have an {{excitatory}} effect on cardiac muscle contractility at very low concentrations, without interfering with heart rate and blood pressure, it has been suggested to be useful as a possible treatment for patients with heart failure. Digoxin (purified cardiac glycoside) has more side-effects and is less potent than AP (which is 200 times more potent in the case of AP-A and AP-C, while AP-B is even more potent). AP-Q is quite similar to <b>vesnarinone,</b> a quinolinone derivative, a medicine that can be given to patients with chronic heart failure. Only lower doses of both AP-Q and <b>vesnarinone</b> have beneficial effects without raising blood pressure or heart rhythm. There is a narrow dose range in which the contractility is improved but also arrhythmias could be induced. AP itself cannot be used for therapeutic admission, because the stability of the molecule after oral transmission is too low and an immunological reaction might occur since the molecule is unfamiliar to the body. However, {{it may be possible to}} modify its structure using biological engineering.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the potential usefulness of <b>vesnarinone,</b> a novel cytokine inhibitor, {{for the treatment}} of lung fibrosis using a murine model of bleomycin (BLM) -induced pulmonary fibrosis. Mice were fed a control diet (n= 42), or a diet containing low (n= 42) or high (n= 42) dose of <b>vesnarinone.</b> Dietary intake of <b>vesnarinone</b> minimized the BLM toxicity as reflected by significant decreases in numbers of inflammatory cells, KC, and soluble TNF receptors in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A quantitative evaluation of histology demonstrated significantly mild lung parenchymal lesions in BLM-treated mice fed with diet containing high dose of <b>vesnarinone</b> than in the control diet group. Consistent with the histopathology, hydroxyproline levels in lung tissue from BLM-treated mice fed with diet containing <b>vesnarinone</b> were significantly lower than that from mice fed with control diet. We concluded that <b>vesnarinone</b> inhibits BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, at least in part, by the inhibition of acute lung injuries in the early phase. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>vesnarinone</b> on nitric oxide NO synthesis in cardiac myocytes. Methods: We measured the accumulation of nitrite, a stable oxidation product of NO, and the expression of inducible NO synthase.. iNOS protein in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Results: Incubation of the cultures with interleukin- 1 b IL- 1 b; 10 ngrml and. tumor necrosis factor a TNFa; 10 ngrml caused a marked increase in nitrite production. Although <b>vesnarinone</b> by itself showed no effect on nitrite accumulation, it enhanced cytokine-induced nitrite production by cardiac myocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of <b>vesnarinone</b> was completely abolished in the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine or actinomycin D. The vesnarinone-in-duced nitrite production was accompanied by increased iNOS protein expression. In the presence of dibutyryl-cAMP, cytokine-induced nitrite accumulation was further increased, but the stimulatory effect of <b>vesnarinone</b> on nitrite accumulation was diminished. The effect of <b>vesnarinone</b> was also inhibited by Rp- 8 -Br-cAMPS, a competitive inhibitor of protein kinase A, in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: These findings indicate that <b>vesnarinone</b> increases NO synthesis in cytokine-stimulated cardiac myocytes, at least partiall...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vesnarinone</b> is a {{positive}} inotropic agent {{that is used to}} treat for congestive heart failure. Recently，it has been shown to inhibit the growth of several cancer cells such as salivary cancer，pancreatie cancer and gastric cance. Large cell lung cancer is known to be refractory to usual chemotherapy，and new effective therapy for this type oflung cancer is needed. In the present study，I have examined the effect of <b>vesnarinone</b> on large cell lung cancer cell lines. Three large cell lung cancer cell lines (LU 65 A，LU 65 B，LU 65 C) were examined. Growth inhibition of these cells by <b>vesnarinone</b> was assayed with 3 H-thymidine incorporation after 72 -hrs culture. Apoptosis induction of LU 65 A cell was examined by the TUNEL method and DNA fragmentation. Expression of Bcl- 2 and Fas antigen in the cell was detected by FACS analysis. Expression of c-myc mRNA was examined by Northern Blotting. <b>Vesnarinone</b> inhibited 3 H-thymidine incorporation in a dose dependent manner at concentrations from 0. 1 to 20 μg/ml in all cell lines. TUNEL method and gel electrophoresis showed vesnarinone-induced apoptosis in Lu 65 A cells <b>Vesnarinone</b> induced expression of Fas antigen and c-myc，but did not affect the expression of Bcl- 2 in Lu 65 A cells. These results suggest that Fas antigen and c-myc expression may be one pathway of apoptosis induction by <b>vesnarinone</b> in LU 65 A cells，and that <b>vesnarinone</b> may be useful to treat for lung cancer. 医歯学総合研究科博士論文(医学); 学位取得日: 平成 12 年 4 月 21...|$|E
40|$|We {{undertook}} {{the present}} study to clarify the molecular mechanism {{of the effect of}} a new anti-cancer drug, <b>vesnarinone,</b> on a human salivary gland cancer cell line, TYS. We isolated TSC- 22 cDNA as avesnarinone-inducible gene from a cDNA library constructed from vesnarinone-treated TYS cells. TSC- 22 was originally reported as a transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta-inducible gene. The expression of TSC- 22 was up-regulated within a few hours after treatment with <b>vesnarinone</b> and was continued for 3 days. The level of TSC- 22 mRNA in TYS cells was continuously increased until the cells reached confluency. Furthermore, the induction of TSC- 22 by <b>vesnarinone</b> was inhibited by treatment with cycloheximide. When we treated the cells with an antisense oligonucleotide against TSC- 22 mRNA under quiescent conditions, the antisense oligonucleotide stimulated the growth of TYS cells; however, under growing conditions the antisense oligonucleotide did not affect cell growth. Furthermore, the antisense oligonucleotide suppressed the antiproliferative effect of <b>vesnarinone.</b> These results suggest that TSC- 22 may be a negative growth regulator and may {{play an important role in}} the antiproliferative effect of <b>vesnarinone...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractHyaluronan (HA), {{which is}} a major {{component}} of the extracellular matrix (ECM), is regulated during myofibroproliferative responses to numerous forms of inflammatory stimuli. It is a key factor involved in cellular migration and adherence. The development of a potent and non-toxic inhibitor of HA synthesis would open up a new avenue for the treatment of fibrocontractive diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. In this study, the effects of <b>vesnarinone</b> (OPC- 8212 : 3, 4 -dihydro- 6 -[4 -(3, 4 -dimethoxybenzoyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]- 2 (1 H) -quinolinone) on the secretion of HA in human myofibroblast cell lines (MRC- 5 and LI 90 cells, referred to as pulmonary and hepatic myofibroblasts, respectively) were examined. <b>Vesnarinone</b> specifically and dose-dependently inhibited HA secretion by myofibroblasts up-regulated by fetal calf serum (FCS). The treatment of <b>vesnarinone</b> did not modify the phenotype of myofibroblast cells in culture. <b>Vesnarinone</b> also potently inhibited the HA secretion by the two myofibroblast cell lines up-regulated by transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The addition of <b>vesnarinone</b> to myofibroblasts resulted in a significant decrease of HA synthase (HAS) activity, with or without the addition of FCS or either cytokine. These findings suggest that <b>vesnarinone</b> inhibits the secretion of HA in myofibroblasts by specifically suppressing HAS activity, and may therefore prove useful for the treatment of chronic inflammation and tissue fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|Controversy {{still exists}} {{concerning}} the therapy for viral myocarditis which manifests {{a wide variety}} of clinical symptoms. <b>Vesnarinone,</b> a quinolinone derivative that was developed as a positive inotropic agent with complex actions, including phosphodiesterase inhibition and cation channel modification, has recently been confirmed to improve the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure. However, the precise mechanism of this beneficial effect is not yet clearly understood. In this study, using a murine model of acute viral myocarditis resulting from encephalomyocarditis virus infection, survival and myocardial damage were markedly improved by treatment with <b>vesnarinone.</b> In contrast, survival was not improved by treatment with amrinone, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Although <b>vesnarinone</b> did not inhibit viral replication or protect myocytes from viral direct cell injury, it did inhibit the increase in natural killer cell activity after viral infection. On the other hand, amrinone failed to inhibit natural killer cell activity. Both <b>vesnarinone</b> and amrinone suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Therefore, we postulate that <b>vesnarinone</b> exerted its beneficial effects through an inhibition of natural killer cell activity, and that it serves as an immunomodulator providing new therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of viral myocarditis and/or immunological disorders...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{systemic}} {{inflammatory response}} {{is an important}} cause of organ dysfunction. The present study tested the hypothesis that 2 clinically used agents, amrinone and <b>vesnarinone,</b> would decrease inflammation and cardiac dysfunction in a relevant model of systemic inflammatory response activation. Methods: Rabbits received intravenous endotoxin, alone or in conjunction with amrinone or <b>vesnarinone.</b> Systemic effects were assessed by death, fever, behavior, and acidosis. Measures of inflammatory signaling were (1) plasma tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 1 β production, (2) lung tissue myeloperoxidase activity, and (3) myocardial inducible nitric oxide synthase activity. Indices of systolic and diastolic myocardial function were measured in Langendorff-perfused hearts. Results: <b>Vesnarinone,</b> in particular, reduced mortality rates (19 % vs 61 % for lipopolysaccharide alone, P =. 01) and acidosis in lipopolysaccharide-treated rabbits. Both agents markedly reduced systemic tumor necrosis factor and interleukin- 1 concentrations, lipopolysaccharide-mediated effects on myocardial systolic and diastolic function and on myocardial inducible nitric oxide synthase activity. <b>Vesnarinone,</b> but not amrinone, (1) decreased fever and lethargy, consistent with decreased central nervous system effects of endotoxin, and (2) decreased lung leukocyte infiltration. Conclusions: <b>Vesnarinone</b> and amrinone, which are used clinically for their inotropic and vasodilating properties, {{may be useful to}} limit inflammatory activation and consequent organ dysfunction. Structure-activity and/or pharmacokinetic between the compounds may be important, particularly in preventing inflamatory signaling within certain tissues.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} a differentiation inducing drug, <b>vesnarinone</b> induced the growth arrest and p 21 waf 1 gene expression {{in a human}} salivary gland cancer cell line, TYS. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of the induction of p 21 waf 1 gene by <b>vesnarinone</b> in TYS cells. We constructed several reporter plasmids containing the p 21 waf 1 promoter, and attempted to identify vesnarinone-responsive elements in the p 21 waf 1 promoter. By the luciferase reporter assay, we identified the minimal vesnarinone-responsive element in the p 21 waf 1 promoter at − 124 to − 61 relative to the transcription start site. Moreover, we demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that Sp 1 and Sp 3 transcription factors bound to the vesnarinone-responsive element. Furthermore, we found that <b>vesnarinone</b> induced the histone hyperacetylation in TYS cells. These results suggest that <b>vesnarinone</b> directly activates p 21 waf 1 promoter via the activation of Sp 1 and Sp 3 transcription factors and the histone hyperacetylation in TYS cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We have {{demonstrated}} that the stromal cell-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1; CXCL 12) /CXCR 4 system {{is involved in the}} establishment of lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Chemotherapy is a powerful tool for the treatment of oral cancer, including oral SCC; however, the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on the expression of CXCR 4 are unknown. In this study, we examined the expression of CXCR 4 associated with the chemotherapeutic agents in oral cancer cells. Results The expression of CXCR 4 was examined using 3 different chemotherapeutic agents; 5 -fluorouracil, cisplatin, and <b>vesnarinone</b> (3, 4 -dihydro- 6 -[4 -(3, 4 -dimethoxybenzoyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]- 2 -(1 H) -quinolinone) in B 88, a line of oral cancer cells that exhibits high levels of CXCR 4 and lymph node metastatic potential. Of the 3 chemotherapeutic agents that we examined, only <b>vesnarinone</b> downregulated the expression of CXCR 4 at the mRNA as well as the protein level. <b>Vesnarinone</b> significantly inhibited lymph node metastasis in tumor-bearing nude mice. Moreover, <b>vesnarinone</b> markedly inhibited 2. 7 -kb human CXCR 4 promoter activity, and we identified the transcription factor, Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF 2), as a novel vesnarinone-responsive molecule, which was bound to the CXCR 4 promoter at positions - 300 to - 167 relative to the transcription start site. The forced-expression of KLF 2 led to the downregulation of CXCR 4 mRNA and impaired CXCR 4 promoter activity. The use of siRNA against KLF 2 led to an upregulation of CXCR 4 mRNA. Conclusion These Results indicate that <b>vesnarinone</b> downregulates CXCR 4 via the upregulation of KLF 2 in oral cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vesnarinone,</b> a {{cardiotonic}} agent, blocks IKr and, {{unlike other}} IKr blockers, produces a frequency-dependent prolongation of action potential duration (APD). To elucidate the mechanisms, we studied {{the effects of}} <b>vesnarinone</b> on HERG, the cloned human IKr channel, heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. <b>Vesnarinone</b> caused a concentration-dependent inhi-bition of HERG currents with an IC 50 value of 17. 7 6 2. 5 mM at 0 mV (n 5 6).

The IC 50 values determined with voltage-clamp pulses to 0 mV were 4. 6 M and 57 M for quinidine and quinine, respectively.

40|$|AbstractBecause cardiac {{contractility}} is impaired {{in chronic}} heart failure, many pharmacologic agents {{have been developed}} to increase the contractile state of the failing heart. These drugs produce impressive hemodynamic effects, but long-term therapy has to failed to produce clinical benefits and has increased mortality in treated patients. This experience has led many physicians to suggest that positive inotropic therapy be abandoned as a therapeutic approach for heart failure. However, recent studies suggest that the efficacy and safety of many (if not all) positive inotropic drugs can be greatly enhanced by reducing the dose of these drugs. The importance of dose is dramatically illustrated by the results of trials with <b>vesnarinone,</b> which decreases mortality when used in low doses but increases mortality when administered in doses only twice as large. Although low doses of positive inotropic drugs may be clinically superior to high doses, {{it is not clear that}} these low doses exert significant inotropic effects. All positive inotropic drugs exert actions on the circulation in addition to stimulating the heart, and these ancillary properties may be particularly important at low doses of these drugs. Low doses of milrinone and pimobendan may act primarily to dilate peripheral blood vessels; low doses of digitalis may exert only neurohormonal effects, and low doses of <b>vesnarinone</b> may act as an antiarrhythmic agent. If the noninotropic actions of low doses account for the therapeutic benefits of these drugs, then the positive inotropic effects seen at high doses may be primarily responsible for their adverse effects. Therefore, hemodynamic activity should not be viewed as a prerequisite for the selection of the dose of a positive inotropic drug. Prior emphasis on the use of high doses with significant cardiostimulatory effects may have derailed the proper development of many positive inotropic agents for the treatment of heart failure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vesnarinone</b> is an {{important}} new drug that significantly de-creases mortality rates in severe congestive heart failure; how-ever, its use {{is associated with a}} relatively high incidence (-“ 1 %) of agranulocytosis.

The same pathway was observed with a combination of myeloper-oxidase/hydrogen peroxide/chloride, the major oxidizing system of neutrophils, or hypochiorous acid, which is generated by this system.

40|$|Most {{patients}} with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) are subjected to symptomatic treatment, predominantly with drugs. Over the years, {{it has become clear}} that treatment with unloading drugs is probably more beneficial than treatment with inotropic agents. In addition, it has been widely recognized that the neuroendocrine compensatory changes associated with CHF afford and important target for drug treatment. This may also hold for some of the changes in receptor density, such as the downregulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. The present and clearly changing insights into the backgrounds of drugs for the treatment of CHF are critically discussed. Apart from the changing views and appreciation of the currently used drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, digoxin, beta-adrenoceptor agonists), the following new approaches are discussed: beta-blockers, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, ibopamine, calcium antagonists, inhibitors of ANP degradation, vasopression antagonist, <b>vesnarinone,</b> and calcium sensitizer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of postmenopausal estrogen use on mortality in aging women with congestive heart failure (CHF). BACKGROUNDThe age-related increase in CHF mortality in women {{may be related to}} a menopause-associated increased incidence of coronary artery disease. In addition to inhibiting coronary atherosclerosis, estrogen may also have protective effects on cardiac myocytes independent of the coronary vasculature. We hypothesized that estrogen use is associated with improved survival in elderly women with CHF. METHODSAssociations between survival, estrogen use and patient characteristics were assessed in 1, 134 women who were at least 50 years of age, had CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 30 % and were enrolled in one of three clinical trials of <b>vesnarinone.</b> RESULTSAll-cause 12 -month mortality was 15. 0 % among the 237 estrogen users versus 27. 1 % among the 897 estrogen nonusers (p = 0. 004 for unadjusted comparison of survival). Similar results were observed for cardiac mortality. Regression analysis demonstrated that estrogen use was independently associated with improved survival (relative risk of mortality = 0. 68, 95 % confidence interval 0. 48 to 0. 96, p = 0. 03). Advanced age, low EF, New York Heart Association class IV CHF, Caucasian race and abnormal serum creatinine, sodium, potassium and transaminase were independently associated with increased mortality.
