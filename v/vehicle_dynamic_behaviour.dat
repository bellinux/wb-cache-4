In order to understand the effect of using a stability device, a literature review was undertaken, from which information was able to be extracted to create a mathematical model to demonstrate how vehicle characteristics are changed. Using the mathematical model, a range of concepts were able to be generated, with the variable stability fin being selected and developed further. The design was manufactured and tested using both wind tunnel testing and CFD simulations to determine how the forces and moments that act on the vehicle change with yaw angle and fin deployment stages. From the research that was carried out {{it can be said that}} the side force and yaw moment are affected by the inclusion of a stability fin, particularly at greater yaw angles.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) {{lead to the}} concept of eco-driving support systems, which assist drivers in controlling vehicles in a sustainable way by reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. In this thesis, an algorithm for an ecological Adaptive Cruise Control (ecoACC) system is designated. In order to test the system in MIL (Model in the Loop) and DIL (Driver In the Loop) environments, an important task is the specification of a fuel consumption model. In {{the first part of the}} thesis an overview is presented about fuel consumption models and several eco-devices developed by different authors. In the second part of the thesis an experimental campaign (with a sample of 100 drivers) is carried out in order to specify and validate the model. The survey is supported by the DRIVEIN 2 (DRIVEr monitoring: technologies, methodologies, and IN-Vehicle Innovative systems) project. As the major data are collected using the OBD-II port of the vehicle, and in particular the data related the instantaneous fuel consumption, a validation of the former data is carried out in collaboration with the CNR (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche – Istituto motori). To carry out a more realistic simulation a vehicle dynamics model was coupled with the ADAS model. The purpose of the implemented vehicle dynamics model is to simulate, in real time, the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour,</b> thanks to continuous integration of the balance equations regulating the longitudinal and lateral vehicle motion. Furthermore, a model able to provide an estimation of real-time fuel consumption of the vehicle is developed: such a model is embedded in the vehicle model discussed in the following, in order to optimize consumption performance during driving task. The implemented system is a next-generation eco-drive system, in the sense that it is able to observe the driver's behaviour and the current fuel consumption, as well as to simulate the fuel consumption in the same traffic conditions and stimuli the driver is subject to, and finally to compare the actual fuel consumption with this of an eco driver. In this way the system gives a reward to the driver if his/her fuel consumption is lower than those of the eco driver, vice versa the system indicates the possibility to improve his/her driving style...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Control {{systems for}} converter-controlled rail {{vehicles}} are {{orders of magnitude}} more complex than controllers for previous generations of <b>vehicles.</b> While the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of previous generations of vehicles was {{to a large extent}} determined by its power components alone, {{an important part of the}} dynamics of modern vehicles is shaped by real-time software, distributed computing and inter-controller communication. To ensure proper operation of the vehicle on track, an integration test of the vehicle control system is performed before initial roll-out. In order to achieve a maximum test depth and to minimize risk and cost, this test is achieved by connecting the original vehicle control system to a real-time <b>dynamic</b> <b>vehicle</b> simulator in closed loop operation. The present paper describes concept, evaluation, and operation of a digital hardware-in-the-loop simulator for testing control-relevant parts of the vehicle. Particular emphasis is put on the hybrid nature of the underlying simulation problem and its inherent causality variations due to the combination of discrete switching effects, e. g., in diodes and controlled converters, with continuous system parts, e. g., differential equations for currents or mechanical system parts...|$|R

40|$|All {{vehicles}} {{require a}} suspension system {{in order to}} provide comfort for their passengers and make the car stable and controllable in all its attitudes with respect to the road surface. The evolution of technology has led many car manufacturing companies to develop their suspension systems in innovative materials, one of the most exploited of which is aluminium. Over the years, its structural strength and workability, combined with its rather competitive cost and above all limited weight, have reached such a level that it {{has become one of the}} most intensely used materials. In fact, it is well known that weight affects the fuel consumption of cars; the lower the weight, the better the consumption and therefore the lower the pollutant emissions, today a priority element because of increasingly stricter norms on this subject. This reason further encouraged the choice of aluminium in the entire complex of the elements between the wheels and the body to which suspension systems belong. By way of an example, the new model of the Audi A 4 uses a front suspension system with independent aluminium arms which makes it possible to reduce the value of the car’s non-suspended weight by 8. 5 kg. Similarly, vehicles like the S class Mercedes-Benz, the BMW X 7, the Volkswagen Phaeton, the Ferrari 360, the Audi A 6 /A 8, and the Maserati GT use aluminium in many of their components, especially in the suspension systems. The current C class Mercedes-Benz uses single aluminium arms in the structure of the MacPherson suspension system. In the case of suspension systems, as well as helping to reduce the overall weight of the vehicle, the use of light alloys improves its handling and <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Today this is a highly significant aspect since, in the design phase of a motor vehicle, the priority is not so much to produce a car that allows the driver to “go fast” as to achieve a remarkably easy drive (for example, drivers highly appreciate the fact that they have to effect a minimum number of corrections when they drive through a bend). Reducing the weight of these elements implies a reduction of non-suspended weights, in other words of the parts in direct contact with the ground (wheels, tyres, brakes and components of the suspension system); as we know, these are the ones which have the greatest effect on the vehicle’s road holding. The development of suspension systems in aluminium also helps to limit the vehicle’s moment of inertia with respect to the vertical axis, the one which has the greatest effect on the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> when it changes its trajectory. Suspension systems are ‘peripheral’ masses, so even a slight change to them makes a great contribution towards limiting this parameter. A highly evident example of this is to be found in Formula 1 cars, whose suspension systems are extremely small-sized. In mass-produced vehicles, such extreme configurations are never achieved because during the sizing process extremely restrictive safety criteria have to be respected for all the components of the front axle, the steering system and the rear axle, which ensure that no fractures ever occur for the entire lifecycle of the vehicle, even in extreme or overloaded conditions. Another advantage of using aluminium in suspension systems derives from the material’s high level of ductility which makes it possible to achieve all sorts of shapes: this is an extremely important aspect if the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the suspension system call for the presence of leverages with complex geometries which would be difficult to achieve using machining operations on steel or cast irons. Special emphasis is placed on aluminium’s better crash properties compared with steel (to the advantage of passenger safety) and its excellent behaviour towards corrosion (so that pieces no longer need to be surface treated) ...|$|R

The intensity of perception to vibration decreased with decreasing input and increasing frequency; the rate of change is different from the published literature; the difference is large for angular modes of inputs. Vehicle dynamic response is used to inform and analyse the results. The repeatability of the method and the fact that they are in situ measurements may eventually help reduce reliance on the road tests. Furthermore, discomfort curves obtained, subsequently, can be used in predictive models...|$|E

After processing the results of these simulations, the analyzed parameters were sorted by increasing influence. It was also found which of these parameters could be estimated with a lesser degree of accuracy in future simulations without appreciably affecting the simulation results. In general terms, it was concluded that the highest influences were found for the longitudinal stiffness and the lateral stiffness of the primary suspension, and the lowest influences for the vertical stiffness and the vertical damping of the primary suspension, with the parameters of the secondary suspension showing intermediate influences between them...|$|E

40|$|The <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of railway <b>vehicles</b> {{depends on}} the {{wheelset}} configuration, i. e. solid axle wheelset or independently rotating wheels (IRWs). The self-centring behaviour, peculiar of the solid axle wheelset, makes this kind of wheelset very suitable for tangent track running at low speed: {{the absence of the}} self-centring mechanism in the IRWs may lead to anomalous wheel/rail wear, reduced vehicle safety and passengers’ discomfort. On the contrary, during negotiation of the sharp curves typical of urban tramways, solid axle wheelsets produce lateral contact forces higher than those of IRWs. This paper illustrates an electronic differential system to be applied to tramcar bogies equipped with wheel-hub motors which allows switching from solid axle in tangent track to IRWs in sharp curve (and vice versa).

All current <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> software programs assume that the contact between wheel and rail takes place in the vertical plane through the wheelset’s rolling axis. However, when the yaw angle of the wheelset is nonzero, the contact point is situated up to 10 ?mm from that plane.

Potential faults in the different subsystems that can affect the vehicle directional stability were collected in a failure mode and effect analysis. Similar driveline faults were grouped together if they resembled each other with respect to their influence on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The faults were physically modelled in a simulation environment before they were induced in a detailed vehicle model under normal driving conditions. A special focus was placed on faults in the driveline of electric vehicles employing in-wheel motors of the permanent magnet type. Several failures caused by mechanical and other faults were analysed as well. The fault {{classification method}} consists of a controllability ranking developed according to the functional safety standard ISO 26262. The controllability of a fault was determined with three parameters covering the influence of the longitudinal, lateral and yaw motion of the vehicle. The simulation results were analysed and the faults were classified according to their controllability using the proposed method. It was shown that the controllability decreased specifically with increasing lateral acceleration and increasing speed. The results for the electric driveline faults show that this trend cannot be generalised for all the faults, as the controllability deteriorated for some faults during manoeuvres with low lateral acceleration and low speed. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to various other types of road vehicles and faults. QC 20140509.

40|$|Abstract. Indian Rail {{transport}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} mode of transportation, so it must offer high comfort level for the passengers and the staff. However, the comfort that passengers experience is a highly complex and individual phenomenon. The improvement of passenger comfort while travelling has been the subject of intense interest for many train manufacturers, researchers and companies around the world. Although new techniques in manufacturing and design ensure better ride quality in railway carriages, still it is impossible to completely eliminate track defects or various ground irregularities. The dynamic behaviour of a train also depends on the load and the mechanical systems, such as springs, dampers, etc., which interact with the wheels, the train body and bogies. The present study deals with the effects of railway track imperfections on dynamic behaviour, and investigates the effect of vehicle speed and the rail irregularity on ride comfort through numerical simulation. The numerical simulation of the vertical dynamic behaviour of a typical railroad vehicle will be done by modelling through bond graph technique. The model consists of 17 degree of freedom with wheel set, bogie and car. For assessment of ride comfort Sperling ride index used by Indian Railway is calculated using filtered RMS accelerations. The ride characteristics of the vehicle provide assessment of the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle through analysis of accelerations at the vehicle body, whereas ride comfort assesses the influence of <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> on the human body.

A rising complexityof the vehicle subsystems and components accompanies this development and has tobe managed by increased electronic control. More potential elements, such as sensors,actuators or software codes, can cause a failure independently or by mutually influencingeach other. There is a need of a structured approach to sort the faults from avehicle dynamics stability perspective. This thesis tries {{to solve this issue}} by suggesting a fault classification method and faulttolerantcontrol strategies. Focus is on typical faults of the electric driveline and thecontrol system, however mechanical and hydraulic faults are also considered. Duringthe work, a broad failure mode and effect analysis has been performed and the faultshave been modeled and grouped based on the effect on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour.</b> A method is proposed and evaluated, where faults are categorized into different levelsof controllability, i. e. levels on how easy or difficult it is to control a fault for the driver,but also for a control system. Further, fault-tolerant control strategies are suggested that can handle a fault with acritical controllability level. Two strategies are proposed and evaluated based on thecontrol allocation method and an electric vehicle with typical faults. It is shown thatthe control allocation approaches give less critical trajectory deviation compared to noactive control and a regular Electronic Stability Control algorithm.

40|$|The {{development}} of precise and robust navigation strategies for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) {{is fundamental to}} reach {{the high level of}} performance required by complex underwater tasks, often including more than one AUV. One of the main factors affecting the accuracy of AUVs navigation systems is the algorithm used to estimate the vehicle motion, usually based on kinematic vehicle models and linear estimators. A precise and reliable navigation system is indeed fundamental to AUVs: the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal is not available underwater, thus making it very hard to know the position of the vehicle in real-time. In this paper, the authors present an innovative navigation strategy specifically designed for AUVs, based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The new algorithm proves to be effective if applied to this class of vehicles and allows us to achieve a satisfying accuracy improvement compared to standard navigation algorithms. The proposed strategy has been experimentally validated using the navigation data acquired in suitable sea tests performed in Biograd Na Moru (Croatia) in the framework of the FP 7 European ARROWS project tests performed during the Breaking the Surface 2014 (BtS 2014) workshop.

40|$|Abstract: The {{tangential}} contact {{forces that}} arise at {{the interface between}} {{the wheel of a}} railway vehicle and the rail provide all the traction, braking, and guidance required by the vehicle. These forces are the result of microslip or creepage and can become unstable exciting vibration of the wheel, particularly at frequencies corresponding to the wheel’s axial (and radial) modes. Although theories exist for predicting these creep forces and their relationship to creepages, most lack experimental verification in the characterization of the falling friction coefficient during unsteady squealing. This paper presents some new results from a project which aims to develop a complete, validated model of curve squeal noise generation accounting for friction characteristics, excitation due to unstable forces between the wheel and rail and <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The model includes wheel and track dynamic response and acoustic radiation. As part of the project, a twin disc rig has been modified to provide experimental data for the validation of the model and measurements were made of the lateral force and dynamic response of the rollers due to varying amounts of lateral creepage during squealing. The main feature of the twin disc rig compared with previous research [1] is that the contact force measuring system measures the contact forces at theweb of the rollers and therefore close to the contact patch and through a slipring arrangement enables the lateral vibration of both rollers in relation to squeal be measured with relative ease. In this paper, detailed descriptions of the twin disc rig and the test method developed are given. An outline of the squeal model is also presented. Results from the tests have been compared with the prediction from the squeal model and with available theories and showed good agreement...|$|E

Computer simulation of racing car handling through Lap Time Simulation (LTS) packages complements these tools. It also allows teams to examine the effect of different vehicle parameter setups to optimise vehicle performance. In similarity with the automotive industry, time is limited and rapid development of new ideas and technology is essential. Thus, the use of a more sophisticated computer simulation would allow a team to gain a significant advantage over their competitors. As LTS are computationally intensive,previous packages have simulateda full lap using a quasi-static method which splits the path of the vehicle into segments. An analysis is then made of the vehicle at each segment point using the external forces acting on the vehicle. Due to the constant acceleration(i. e. steady state) assumption across each segment, this method {{does not take into account}} the effect of roll, pitch and yaw inertia as well as damping and tyre lag effects. Another aspect that is not accounted for is the variation in the fastest effective vehicle path along the circuit (i. e. racing line) due to change in driver control inputs or vehicle parameters. The overall aim of this thesis is to develop a transient LTS methodology, which adopts a strategy to vary the racing line taken in order to address the problems found with the existing quasi-static LTS packages. In parallel an investigation of the accuracy of vehicle models in relationship to racing car performance has been developed. The thesis begins with a study of racing car modelling techniques and a review of current LTS packages. A description is then given of the collection of vehicle handlingd ataf rom an actualr acingc ar (alongw ith attaining a vehicle parametesr et) and the measured results displayed and discussed. The creation of two vehicle models, a simple and sophisticated version, is detailed and the measured results are compared to the simulated results of each vehicle model. It was found that the simple vehicle model does not fully represent the actual <b>vehicle's</b> lateral <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour,</b> although its steady state response was deemed to be accurate. The sophisticated vehicle model was seen to not only accurately predict the full range of lateral <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the actual vehicle, but also the actual vehicle's longitudinal and combined lateral and longitudinal <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour.</b> To further investigate LTS techniques, a comparison study was made between various simulation approaches which indicated that the transient approach, although more complicated and time consuming, allows for more accurate tuning of a greater number of vehicle parameters. Finally, the creation of two simulation packages has been detailed and case studies are presented to provide further insight into the look and feel of the packages. The first package is a quasi-static approach based LTS package, where a case study is made into the sensitivity of overall lap time to a range of vehicle parameters. The second is a transient approach based simulation package which optimises the driver controls,varying the racing line taken by the vehicle and ensuring the manoeuvre is completed in the quickest time for that vehicle parameter set. This final Manoeuvre Time Minimisation package fulfils the overall aim of the thesis and a case study is made into the effect of front damping value on manoeuvre completion time...|$|R
