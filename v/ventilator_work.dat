When various colors (not close {{each other in the}} spectrum) co-exist in a neighborhood (more or less like in a patchwork), this means that there is an instability in the interactions between the lung model and the ventilator, that is, one may expect that in such a situation with a real patient, the type of cycles could significantly change in a short duration (a real patient always breathes with a cyclic dispersion in the breathing frequency and in the occlusion pressure). When the color changes in a smooth way (according to the color spectrum), this means that the domain for which the <b>ventilator</b> <b>works</b> well is rather well defined: it is thus possible to state without any ambiguity for which (sub-) cohort of simulated patients, the ventilator can be recommended.|$|R
2500|$|A {{breath is}} {{assisted}} if the <b>ventilator</b> does <b>work</b> on the patient. An assisted breath is one {{for which the}} ventilator does some portion {{of the work of}} breathing. For constant flow inflation, work is defined as inspiratory pressure multiplied by tidal volume. Therefore, an assisted breath is identified as a breath for which airway pressure (displayed on the ventilator) rises above baseline during inspiration. An unassisted breath is one for which the ventilator simply provides the inspiratory flow demanded by the patient and pressure stays constant throughout the breath.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMechanical {{ventilator}} is {{a widely}} used device generating a controlled a flow of gas into patient's lungs in anesthesia and intensive care units. The patients are usually connected with the ventilator through an endotracheal tube (ETT). Oxygen, {{which is the most}} important gas for keep human alive, is moved to the patients’ lung by ventilators according to settings predetermined by clinicians. Clinicians have to determine the best treatment for patients {{because of the fact that}} <b>ventilators</b> generally <b>work</b> as open- loop controlled. Thus, a training mechanical ventilator set was designed and implemented to enhance the experiences of them. Besides, this set can be used in the medicine, veterinary and biomedical engineering students’ theoretical and experimental works, too. PLC, programmable logic controller, was used to control the system. It controls inspiration/expiration valves and evaluates pressure info received from pressure sensors. Inspiration/expiration time and operation mode can be easily changed on screen. Thanks to implemented training set, clinicians can make practice using of this ventilator set and students can increase their knowledge about respiratory system. The designed and implemented set is cheaper than ventilator used in intensive care units...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of invasive mechanical ventilation, and {{the regulation of}} sedation and analgesia during ventilation, constitutes {{a major part of}} the care of patients admitted to intensive care units. Both prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation and premature extubation are associated with increased risk of complications and higher hospital costs, but clinical opinion on the best protocol for weaning patients off of a <b>ventilator</b> varies. This <b>work</b> aims to develop a decision support tool that uses available patient information to predict time-to-extubation readiness and to recommend a personalized regime of sedation dosage and ventilator support. To this end, we use off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms to determine the best action at a given patient state from sub-optimal historical ICU data. We compare treatment policies from fitted Q-iteration with extremely randomized trees and with feedforward neural networks, and demonstrate that the policies learnt show promise in recommending weaning protocols with improved outcomes, in terms of minimizing rates of reintubation and regulating physiological stability...|$|R
30|$|We {{chose to}} compare PSV with either NAVA or PAV+ instead of {{choosing}} only one proportional mode, because we {{aimed to explore}} potential differences of proportional versus pressure support ventilation on exercise performance. Since NAVA and PAV+ both resemble proportional ventilation, choosing {{one of them would}} only limit our experience to one single mode and one single brand. This would be an issue regarding the difficulty to recruit such patients. Additionally, our primary end point was the effect of <b>ventilator</b> mode on <b>work</b> efficiency and not peak VO 2. A number of factors such as circulatory impairment, muscle fiber type, body mass index, breathing reserve and peak heart rate may strongly influence the linearity between VO 2 and work relationship [54, 55]. Hence, it has been proposed to use work efficiency as a better reflection of exercise tolerance [54, 56, 57]. We used the cycle ergometer, as already in use in our ICU to mobilize critically ill patients, and it offers the advantage to strictly control and monitor the workload performed by the patient [11, 58].|$|R
40|$|Background: India has an {{estimated}} backlog of 1000000 cleft patients. A total of 35000 new cleft patients are born each year. With {{the capacity to}} operate on approximately 50000 patients each year only 15000 patients from the national backlog can be operated upon each year if capability is not augmented. Objectives: To reach {{the population at large}} we meticulously planned an out-reach programme and operated on patients even in rural set ups with lack of modern facilities. We operated on patients at sub divisional centres, where apparatus for providing sevoflurane was not available. Institutional Ethical clearance was taken before conduction of the study. Patients who required prolonged surgery were taken to the tertiary centre. <b>Working</b> <b>ventilators</b> were also not available at peripheral centres. Materials and Methods: This interventional study was carried in a time span of four years on nineteen hundred and nine patients, after taking approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee. Patients were screened and some were operated at rural centers and others at a tertiary care centre. Patients who could not afford to come to the tertiary care centre were operated at different rural centers. Informed consent was taken. Results: There were 1909 patients with Congenital Facial Anomalies (CFA) over four years period out of which 918 patients were of either unilateral or bilateral cleft lip. They were successfully operated at rural health centers with limited facilities. This could reduce the total load of surgeries for CFA at tertiary care hospital ensuring safe surgeries for all with CFA for all age groups and both genders. No mortality was recorded and post operative complications consisted of nausea and vomiting, three had delayed recovery and one had laryngospasm. Conclusion: Outreach programmes can increase the efficacy of Smile Train Project and effective screening of patients before surgery can result in fruitful outcomes even in a rural set up with lack of modern anaesthetic facilities...|$|R
40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a union representing employees at an elementary school {{because of concerns about}} possible exposure to mold in the school building. In 2014, some elementary school employees went on medical leave reportedly because of illness from mold exposure after receiving results from fungal immunoglobulin G (IgG) blood tests and urine mycotoxin tests. Knowledge of these results prompted over 20 additional school employees to have their blood tested for IgG to fungi. Some of these employees and their physicians interpreted their blood test results as meaning they had high levels of mold in their bodies. Other employees had recurring upper respiratory and sinus infections and throat and eye irritation that they attributed to their work environment. During our evaluation, we (1) checked for moisture, water damage, and mold inside the building and in the crawl spaces beneath the building, (2) evaluated the ventilation systems, (3) measured carbon dioxide, temperature, and relative humidity, and (4) asked employees about their work, medical history, and work-related health concerns. We found no moisture, signs of water damage, or mold in the school or crawl spaces, except for three classrooms with minor mold growth. Some classroom unit <b>ventilators</b> did not <b>work,</b> had incorrectly installed or missing air filters, or were blocked. Carbon dioxide levels were high in some classrooms. Our employee interviews and review of medical records found symptoms often associated with damp buildings or inadequate ventilation but that are common in the general population. We found no evidence that problems such as neuropathy, thrush, and cancer were related to the school. Lacking an explanation for all symptoms led some employees to seek answers from unvalidated medical tests. To address indoor environmental quality concerns, we recommended the school (1) stop environmental sampling and blood testing for molds and urine testing for mycotoxins; (2) hire a licensed professional mechanical engineer to assess the ventilation systems; (3) encourage employees to report water leaks or water damage; and (4) create a system for employees to report building concerns and to receive feedback on how issues were resolved. We recommended employees report work-related health concerns and see an occupational medicine physician about health problems they think may be work related.
