25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>VCO)</b> which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E

50|$|A {{phase-locked loop}} is an {{electronic}} component or system comprising a closed loop for controlling {{the phase of}} an oscillator while comparing it with the phase of an input or reference signal. An indirect frequency synthesizer uses a PLL. In an all-digital PLL, a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>VCO)</b> is controlled using a digital, rather than analog, control signal. The phase detector gives a signal proportional to the phase difference between two signals; in a PLL, one signal is the reference, {{and the other is}} the output of the controlled oscillator (or a divider driven by the oscillator).|$|E
50|$|Phase {{detectors}} for {{phase-locked loop}} circuits may be classified in two types. A Type I detector {{is designed to}} be driven by analog signals or square-wave digital signals and produces an output pulse at the difference frequency. The Type I detector always produces an output waveform, which must be filtered to control the phase-locked loop <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>VCO).</b> A type II detector is sensitive only to the relative timing of the edges of the input and reference pulses, and produces a constant output proportional to phase difference when both signals are at the same frequency.

The outputs of these low-pass filters are inputs to another phase detector, the output of which passes through noise-reduction filter before being used to control the voltage-controlled oscillator. The overall loop response {{is controlled by the}} two individual low-pass filters that precede the third phase detector while the third low-pass filter serves a trivial role in terms of gain and phase margin.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Schematic {{drawing of}} an examplary FM-AFM setup using a silicon {{cantilever}} in ultra-high vacuum and a PLL for phase detection and {{generation of the}} excitation signal. A very small tip is mounted on an oscillating cantilever (1) that is in vicinity of a sample (in this case the cantilever is below the sample). The oscillation of the cantilever changes upon interaction between the tip and the sample and is detected with a laser beam (2) focussed {{on the back of}} the cantilever. The reflected beam travels via mirrors to a position sensitive detector (PSD) (3). The signal of the PSD is amplified by a preamplifier. An amplitude control (4) measures the amplitude A of this signal and a feedback loop compares it with a setpoint and determines the amplification (dissipation Γ) of the excitation signal (6) for the cantilever which is fed to a shaking piezo. To measure the current resonance frequency, a phase-locked loop (PLL) (5) is used. Its <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>VCO)</b> produces the excitation signal (6) for the cantilever. The detected frequency shift ∆f is passed to another feedback loop (7) that keeps the frequency shift constant by changing the distance between the tip and the surface (z position) by varying the voltage applied to the piezo tube.|$|E
5000|$|The {{synthesizer}} {{voices are}} based on the Curtis Electronics CEM 3394 chip. This allows for one <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>VCO)</b> per voice, with on/off toggles for any combination of sawtooth, triangle and variable pulse waveforms. There are coarse (up to 4 octaves) and fine (to just under a semitone) tuning parameters. A [...] "poly mod" [...] parameter allows the audio output of one voice to feed another's voltage-controlled filter (VCF) when they are layered in [...] "double" [...] mode. This results in a sound with 4-voice polyphony with no audio from the second voice's oscillators, processed through two filters in series. The single low-frequency oscillator (LFO) is free-running (i.e. doesn't restart when a key is depressed), with programmable rate (0.25 to 20 Hz according to the manual), and has programmable depth and waveform (triangle or square). This can modulate any combination of filter cutoff frequency, pitch, or oscillator pulse-width. There is a chorus with fixed rate and frequency. Filter cutoff frequency, resonance (to self-oscillation), keyboard tracking (off, half or full) and envelope amount can be programmed, but the envelope cannot be inverted. The two ADSR envelopes modulate the VCA and the 24 dB/octave VCF. The rate for the polyphonic portamento is programmable. [...] "Unison" [...] (monophonic mode) can be programmed for each patch. In this mode, the envelopes are re-triggered only after all keys are released ("legato", with low-note priority), and a delay of four oscillators relative to the other four can be programmed (fixed at 20, 40 or 80 milliseconds). A program can be [...] "linked" [...] to another so that both are called up and assigned correctly in a split or layer. There is also a programmable output level for each patch to help balance loud and soft sounds.|$|E
