5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like <b>vocal</b> <b>quality.</b> The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E

[...] These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities: [...] "Increasing the fidelity of recording... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre, pitch, and loudness." [...] Another basic problem—famously spoofed in the 1952 film Singin' in the Rain—was that some silent-era actors {{simply did not}} have attractive voices; though this issue was frequently overstated, there were related concerns about general <b>vocal</b> <b>quality</b> and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own.

Rosenberg compared the character to actress Marilyn Monroe's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk in the film Some Like it Hot (1959). Susie's lack of singing experience is balanced by an [...] "ineffable <b>vocal</b> <b>quality</b> that causes people to listen, because they might be missing something." [...] Steve Vineberg, writing in the journal Film Quarterly, agreed that, despite her unimpressive voice, Susie [...] "wears a lyric tight to her skin, liked a zipped-up sleeping bag." [...] According to Télérama's Guillemette Odicino, the character has been [...] "endowed with a voice and a charm to take the breath." [...] Susie remains a heavily guarded individual until she performs [...] "Makin' Whoopee", which finally allows her to lower her defenses. When Susie performs the song, she is – for the first time – not singing to the audience, but to her sole accompanist Jack instead. According to Slant film critic Chuck Bowen, [...] "When Susie sings 'Makin' Whoopee' in a traffic-stopping red dress, mounting Jack's piano as if it's an extension of his very essence... all bets of detached, business-collaborative stability between the two are understood to be off." [...] Bowen also compared the character's performance to actress Rita Hayworth's in the film Gilda (1946). Prior to this moment, it almost appears as though a romantic relationship might never actually develop between the two characters. Observing that the character's tough attitude matches the difficult life she has been through, Janet Maslin of The New York Times believes that Susie must be [...] "singing from experience" [...] when she performs the song [...] "Ten Cents a Dance". Go Slow: The Life of Julie London author Michael Owen considers both Pfeiffer's performance and Susie herself to be a tribute to actress and singer Julie London, citing similarities such as asking her accompanist to perform [...] "More Than You Know" [...] in a slow tempo, swearing into a live microphone and delivering a [...] "sexy rendition" [...] of [...] "Makin' Whoopee", capturing [...] "some of the essence of Julie's style." ...|$|E

As with all bassoons, the tone varies considerably, depending on individual instrument and performer. In the hands of a lesser player, the Heckel bassoon can sound flat and woody, but good players succeed in producing a vibrant, singing tone. Conversely, a poorly played Buffet can sound buzzy and nasal, but good players succeed in producing a warm, expressive sound, different from—but not inferior to—the Heckel.|$|E
