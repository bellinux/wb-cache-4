40|$|Ig 61. [...] In four normal {{subjects}} {{measurements of}} steady state diffusing capacity for CO (DLco) by an alveolar sample technique {{and of the}} degree of uneven <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> nitrogen washout were made simultaneously followed by measurement of DLco by rebreathing. A methacholine-histamine aerosol was then given. After this aerosol uneven ventilation worsened and steady state DLco fell, while rebreathing DLco did not change. Relief of uneven <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> isoproterenol was followed by increase of steady state DLco in two subjects. Alterations in rate and depth of breathing or changes in functional residual capacity do not explain the changes in steady state DL,, which are attributed to increase in uneven <b>ventilation</b> as predicted <b>by</b> the theory of CO absorption. Theory also predicts a lack of effect of uneven ventilation on the rebreathing DL co, but these results must be accepted wit...|$|R

40|$|Case study {{simulations}} with idealized tracers {{have been}} used to determine the relationship between the dynamics and conceptual representations of different midlatitude frontal systems and the amount, distribution, and time scale of boundary layer <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> these systems. The key features of <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> a kata– and ana–cold frontal system are found to be quantitatively and also often qualitatively similar to the main ventilation pathways, which are the conveyor belts, cloud head, and other convection. The conveyor belts and cloud head occur within cloud, implying that they can be identified using satellite imagery. Differences in the transport by the two systems can be related to their conceptual representations and include a sensitive dependence on the diurnal cycle for the kata- but not the ana-cold frontal case. ...|$|R

Adequate ventilation and acceptable gas exchange {{took place during}} HFBSO from 3 to 15 Hz. The tidal volume required to maintain a normocapnic state was established at each frequency studied. Using catheter-tip micromanometers inserted in the esophagus or the superior vena cava, new techniques to measure high-frequency intrathoracic pressure oscillations were developed. Using a gamma-function to fit the thermodilution curve, a new technique was developed to measure the cardiac output in small animals. No detrimental hemodynamic effect was found during HFBSO used either for normocapnic ventilation or with large pressure oscillations (30 cm H$ sb{ rm 2 }$O) in the body chamber. Finally, during normocapnic <b>ventilation</b> <b>by</b> HFBSO in normal rabbits, the mechanical behavior of the respiratory system was characterized using transfer impedances...|$|R
