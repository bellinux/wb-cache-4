40|$|Brines {{generated}} {{during the}} last marination step {{in the production of}} marinated herring (Clupea harengus) were chemically characterized and analyzed for antioxidant and enzyme activities. The end-products were <b>vinegar</b> <b>cured,</b> spice cured and traditional barrel-salted herring with either salt or spices. The chemical characterization encompassed pH, dry matter, ash, salt, fatty acids, protein, polypeptide pattern, iron and nitrogen. The antioxidant activity was tested with three assays measuring: iron chelation, reducing power and radical scavenging activity. The enzymatic activity for peroxidase and protease were also tested. Results revealed that the brine can contain up to 56. 7 mg protein/ mL, up to 20. 1 mg fatty acid/mL, good antioxidant activity, high amounts of the antioxidative amino acids lysine, alanine, and glycine, and high enzymatic activity. The potential of using the protein-rich fraction with biological activity from brines from the marinated herring production was demonstrated in this work...|$|E
50|$|Chervil has had various uses in folk medicine. It was {{claimed to}} be useful as a {{digestive}} aid, for lowering high blood pressure, and, infused with <b>vinegar,</b> for <b>curing</b> hiccups. Besides its digestive properties, it {{is used as a}} mild stimulant.|$|R
50|$|Chinese society greatly valued gastronomy, and {{developed}} an extensive {{study of the}} subject based on its traditional medical beliefs. Chinese culture initially centered around the North China Plain. The first domesticated crops {{seem to have been}} the foxtail and broomcorn varieties of millet, while rice was cultivated in the south. By 2000 BC, wheat had arrived from western Asia. These grains were, typically served as warm noodle soups, however, instead of baked into bread as in Europe. Nobles hunted various wild game and consumed mutton, pork, dog, and beef as these animals were domesticated. Grain was stored against famine and flood and meat was preserved with salt, <b>vinegar,</b> <b>curing,</b> and fermenting. The flavor of the meat was enhanced by cooking it in animal fats though this practice was mostly restricted to the wealthy.|$|R
50|$|Food {{artisans}} produce {{foods and}} edible foodstuffs {{that are not}} mass produced, but rather made by hand. These include cheeses, breads and baked goods, charcuterie and other foods that involve preservation or fermentation, home preservation or canning processes, and fruit preserves, cured meats, beverages, oils, and vinegars. Fermentation or otherwise controlling the preservation environment for beneficial microorganisms can be utilized for <b>vinegars,</b> cheeses, <b>cured</b> meats, wine, oolong tea, kimchi and other examples. An artisan food item is usually developed and produced {{over a long period}} of time and consumed relatively close to where the food is created.|$|R
50|$|Meat {{preservation}} as {{a survival}} technique {{dates back to}} ancient times. Indigenous peoples of Southern Africa, such as the Khoikhoi, preserved meat by slicing it into strips, curing it with salt, and hanging it up to dry. European seafarers preserved meat for their long journeys by curing meat in salt or brine. European settlers (Dutch, German, French) who arrived in southern Africa in the early 17th century used <b>vinegar</b> in the <b>curing</b> process, as well as saltpetre (potassium nitrate). The potassium nitrate in saltpeter kills Clostridium botulinum, the deadly bacterium that causes botulism while the acidity of the vinegar inhibits its growth. According to the World Health Organisation, C. botulinum will not grow in acidic conditions (pH less than 4.6), therefore the toxin will not be formed in acidic foods. The antimicrobial properties of certain spices have also been drawn upon since ancient times. The spices introduced to biltong by the Dutch include pepper, coriander, and cloves. Recently, a research group at the University of Beira Interior in Portugal tested the antimicrobial properties of coriander oil (coriander {{being one of the}} main spices in the most basic of biltong recipes) against 12 bacterial strains, and found that 10 of the 12 strains of bacteria were killed with a relatively mild concentration of coriander oil (1.6%). In the two strains that were not effectively killed, Bacillus cereus and Enterococcus faecalis, the coriander oil reduced their growth significantly.|$|R
