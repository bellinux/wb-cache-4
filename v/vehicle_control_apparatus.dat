40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{case study}} {{consisting}} of a plant, and associated control laws, is presented. An abstract specification of the control system is given in Hoare’s Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). Via a series of calculated refinements, an implementation is developed, and translated into a simulation in a Java-based library for CSP, JCSP. Verification of the development process is performed using the model-checker for CSP, FDR. The result is a complete, verified implementation of the control system. “Control (n) : The apparatus by means of which a machine, as an aeroplane or motor <b>vehicle,</b> is <b>controlled</b> during operation; also, any of the mechanisms of a <b>control</b> <b>apparatus,</b> or collectively for the complete apparatus. ” Oxford English Dictionary, 2 nd edition...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The {{achievement}} of radio electronics opens {{the possibility to}} create little size radio?controlled apparatus. Such apparatus application permits the fulfillment of tasks in extreme situations. The efficiency?s prognostication of apparatus is an actual. Problem statement. It was necessary to take the following factors into consideration in prognostic process: natural probable of process, extreme situations and work in rob technical complex. Theoretical results. In the article the methodology for definition the efficiency of little size radio ? <b>controlled</b> <b>apparatus</b> was considered. The methodology {{is based on the}} information ? probabilistic approach. Dependence of probability fulfilment of the problem from accessible information quantity was determined. Comparative analysis with dependences for ordinary radio ? <b>controlled</b> <b>apparatus</b> was fulfilled. The problems of probability fulfilment task estimation with information loss and information delay were formalized. The little size radio ? ?ontrolled apparatus work in rob technical complex was considered. Dependence between radio ? <b>controlled</b> <b>apparatus</b> quantity in rob technical complex and reserve of apparatus was determined. The characters of static regime were analyzed. The conditions for coefficient of efficiency were determined. Conclusions. The rob technical complex unfold problem was formalized as the limitations on task fulfilment probability and expenditure affectivity coefficient. ? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ????????????? ?????????????? ???????????????? ?????????
