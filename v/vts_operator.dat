40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{my study}} of situation awareness assessment of Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) operators. VTS operators are the traffic controllers on the water. They {{are responsible for}} a safe and efficient handling of vessel traffic. They monitor traffic, provide information on request and coordinate movement of ships in (emerging) conflict situations in harbours, rivers, and approach areas all around the world. Situation awareness is a term describing a person’s internal mental model of the current situation. Situation awareness {{is a concept that}} has been applied with success in many domains where controllers need to maintain an overview of their work. The concept of situation awareness presents new perspective for the study of <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> performance by investigating the mental picture of the operator. This perspective may lead to better understanding of the performance of VTS operators. The main objective of this thesis is to study how situation awareness of VTS operators can be assessed and to determine if the use and the assessment of <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> situation awareness leads {{to a better understanding of}} the performance of VTS operators. The thesis presents a framework for the examination of the concept situation awareness and for methods for assessing it in the context of <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> performance. This evaluation is based upon a literature study on situation awareness and VTS research and upon observations on VTS posts in the Netherlands. Two methods to assess situation awareness are developed. The first method, called SATEST, is derived from the SAGAT method developed by Mica Endsley and can be considered a traditional method for measuring situation awareness. This method presents a VTS scenario in an experimental setting. At unannounced, but previously specified times during these scenarios the system displays are blanked and the simulation is stopped. The operators are requested to answer a number of questions about their perception of the situation at that time, designed to reveal their situation awareness. After completion of the query, the simulation continues. SATEST was developed, tested and used in two experiments; in Rotterdam and Helsinki in the COMFORTABLE project. These experiments showed that SATEST was very useful in providing understanding of the VTS-work, the concept of situation awareness and its application in a VTS context. They also revealed the limitations of the method. It became clear in working with SATEST that the method covers situation awareness at any particular moment very well, but it is not very suitable to observe how situation awareness develops in a situation. The conclusion of the work with SATEST was that situation awareness is a useful concept in describing the work of the <b>VTS</b> <b>operator,</b> but that the method for assessing situation awareness needed more work. In the discussions of SATEST the idea grew that communication might be used to analyse when operators become aware of conflicts and when they will solve them. The second method, called PMI-P (Performance Measuring Instrument – Performance module), uses the assessment of communication to assess performance and situation awareness. Communication is scored on a PMI-P score form. This score form was constructed using the concept of Required Situation Awareness (RSA), developed in this thesis. RSA refers to the situation awareness needed to correctly handle a situation. For every event in the scenario the PMI-P score form contains information that the operator needs to communicate, and additional information that an operator may want to communicate. Communication between VTS and traffic is regarded as a direct measure of <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> performance and an indirect measure of situation awareness. The PMI-P score form captures the development of <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> situation awareness by describing all possible communications that an operator can have during the scenario run. This method was used in a project for the Rotterdam Port Authority. The results show that PMI-P is a powerful tool for assessing <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> performance. Understanding communication in PMI-P provides a solid handle on the assessment of <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> performance. This leads us to the question whether situation awareness is still needed as a concept in the assessment. The short answer to this question is yes: The required situation awareness of a situation that an operator requires has been used in the development of PMI-P to understand the scenario and to capture the required communication. Together the two methods offer a wide range of opportunities to study situation awareness of VTS operators, to study impact of new technology on <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> situation awareness, and to training operators.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} to the understanding of social and technical aspects of the work of Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) operators. VTS operators monitor maritime traffic in order to promote safety in narrow waters and around major ports. The task of the <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> is to support and direct ships that sail through the monitored area, primarily making the navigating officer of each ship aware of the current traffic situation, local weather and geographical conditions. When performing this task, it is crucial that the <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> builds a mental model of the situation in the monitored area. To understand this process, we need to explore what type of information VTS operators use as well as when, why and how they use available information. We also need to understand what factors affect the work of VTS operators and the influences of these factors on the work process. Applied Cognitive Task Analysis (ACTA) was used to study how VTS operators work with anomaly detection and pattern recognition from a holistic perspective. In addition, a midfidelity simulation was used as a knowledge eliciting tool to explore the work situation of VTS operators. The combination of methods was assessed using Hoffman’s (1987) method evaluation criteria. The results indicate that VTS operators build their mental models by combining their experiences, previous nautical experience, local area knowledge and information from technical support systems. In particular, voice communication was identified as an important source of information for creating these mental models and factors behind non-technical miscommunication were investigated, since the latter may lead to negative effects on navigational safety. As for the miscommunication, the results indicate that regulation and technical systems are not sufficient to combat miscommunication within VTS systems. For doing this, it is also necessary to consider social aspects...|$|E

40|$|The {{maritime}} domain is {{under pressure from}} changing economic, political and environmental factors. Technological advancements facilitate increased monitoring and control from land. By viewing the {{maritime domain}} as a complex socio-technical system, the importance of understanding {{the role of the}} on board and shore-side operator in maintaining safety and efficiency of navigation becomes apparent, particularly when introducing new technology. This paper looks at the success factors for navigational assistance, as currently performed by maritime pilots and Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) operators, aiming to identify issues worth consideration in future navigational assistance services. One focus group and one combined workshop/focus group were held with three pilots and two VTS operators respectively. The first looked at the prerequisites for successful navigational assistance {{from the perspective of the}} pilot. Using a grounded theory-style approach, a proposition was created that the main indicator of success is “no incidents”, that success depends on the integration of local knowledge, preparation and foresight into the ship-shore system and that good communication is vital to achieving this.

40|$|Milestone {{expert system}} {{applications}} for the development, management and operation of ports in South Africa since 1992 are briefly described. More recently, Integrated Technologies Engineering (ITE), in co-operation with Marine Data Systems (MDS) and Daimler Benz Aerospace (DASA), have been developing intelligent sub-systems for a VTS based Management Information (MIS) and Port Planning System (PPS). The primary objective of the sub-systems is to relieve the workload of VTS operators by automating {{as many of the}} mundane tasks as possible. This is done in a knowledge elicitation process where detailed operator knowledge is captured into computer based systems and re-deployed to less experienced personnel across the company. Artificial intelligence is used in two specific areas: intelligent logging and advanced port planning. With intelligent logging, the <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> is guided through the proper procedures and sequences of capturing data by dynamically controlling options and fields that are available at any one time, based on the information already captured in the system and automated input from the VTS system. The advance port planning system provides the operator with a graphical overview of the status of the port, current as well as any time in the near future. The expertise of experienced operators is captured in the system and used to optimally schedule resources (berths, pilot vessels and pilots, berthing crews, tugboats and crews) within seconds and allows the operator to graphically alter the schedule. A detailed discrete event simulation model can identify potential bottlenecks and allow the operator to explore ways to work around these problems long before they occur. (orig.)

40|$|In the Dirac {{theory for}} {{the motion of}} free {{relativistic}} electrons, highly oscillatory components appear in the time evolution of physical observables such as position, velocity, and spin angular momentum. This effect is known as zitterbewegung.

We find that the amplitude of oscillations of the Heisenberg velocity <b>operator</b> <b>v(t)</b> generally equals the uncertainty for a simultaneous measurement of two linearly independent components of v.

30|$|We present three {{case studies}} in this paper. In each case, the {{participants}} were experienced maritime professionals consisting of Ships Master / Captain (responsible for safe conduct of ship), Pilot (a local addition to the bridge team, who in practice takes over the manoeuvring and leads the communication), Tug Master (tugs are small powerful vessels that assist in manoeuvring large ships in restricted waters, either connected by rope/wire or pushing), Helmsman (performs the steering, on orders from master/pilot but no other tasks), and Vessel Traffic Service (<b>VTS)</b> <b>Operator</b> (VTS is a shore-based information service, much like air traffic control but with no mandate to give orders). First of all, we present an analysis of operator workload using the ISA (Instantaneous Self Assessment) and the SWAT (Subjective Workload Assessment Technique) that are commonly employed in the literature (Cain, 2007). These measures were chosen for their prevalence in the workload literature, {{and because they are}} straightforward to administer and analyse. Second, an analysis of communications patterns during emergency manoeuvres is presented as an additional means of understanding operator workload within the maritime environment. These studies illustrate some of the drawbacks to using the standard ISA/SWAT methodology, and provide some insight regarding communication patterns during an emergency event. Finally, we conducted a series of maritime operations while collecting GSR/EDA measures for the key team players: the Captain/Master, the Pilot, and the Tug Master. The use of GSR/EDA measurement allowed us to collect workload measures from a distributed team of maritime personnel as they performed routine and emergency manoeuvres in a large maritime ship simulator. It has the clear advantage of detecting the onset and relative level of operator stress (a robust correlate of mental workload), and further, of capturing this information for multiple individuals within a distributed team operating environment.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{operator}} at {{maritime traffic}} monitoring station {{is assumed to}} have access to a great amount of data. Information come from different sources and the data are generated by multiple of sensors. Multiple sources of data create challenge regarding data association. The challenge is met by data fusion. By means of fusion, different sources of information are combined to arrive at proper final decision. Ship’s presence within a confined area defines a non-empty bounded closed interval. It can be denoted by the earliest and latest bounds of the closed time interval at a given possibility level. To assess situation within any confined region one should take into account total of safety factors of all ships present within forecast imprecise slots of time. Safety factors enable vessels ’ classification regarding potential consequences of an accident. In general approach environmentally dangerous freight and huge tonnage increase the factor. Safety factors are treated as fuzzy, imprecise values. Small ranges of values are assigned to small craft without dangerous cargo. The largest intervals are reserved for huge crude carriers. Associated data enable the <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> to approximate congestion for each restricted and considered as important areas. To forecast and assess situation within such areas all ships are to be identified and classified. The process usually involves uncertainty, ambiguity and partiality in available evidence.

40|$|Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is a shore-sided service {{implemented}} {{to promote the}} safety of navigation, safety of life at sea, {{and the protection of}} the marine environment. Its purpose is to work for safe and fluent traffic movements within a determined area, a VTS area. VTS is provided by VTS operators, skilled experts that provide vessels with information and advice, and work for the overall traffic organisation. Although VTS is regulated on an international level there are differences in how the service is provided in between countries, and even VTS centres. This licentiate thesis focuses on understanding the role of the VTS for safety within maritime traffic management. Concepts derived from three bodies of research: High Reliability Organisation (HRO) theory, Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM), and Cognitive Systems Engineering (CSE), have been applied to analyse and discuss how safety is constructed, promoted, and can possibly be improved in the light of future demands within the maritime domain. The results show that maritime safety is experienced as a context-dependent condition in which the single operator has a direct impact on the outcome. Maritime safety therefore identified as being actively constructed through the actions of a control system, the Joint Cognitive System of the <b>VTS</b> <b>operator</b> and the decision support system at hand. This system, as it is today, is an unbalanced system in which actions need to be determined based on the “situation-as-it-was”, due to delays in information presentation in the decision support at hand, in contrast to the information on the vessel’s side that represents the “situation-as-it-is”. Although there has been a heavy focus on technical developments within the VTS domain, {{there is a lack of}} results when it comes to how or if these tools were implemented and used by the actual VTS operators. Further, the scope of participation within the VTS should be re-evaluated. The international and national authorities need to decide whether VTS is meant to be an effective service regulating the safe and fluent flow of traffic within an area or an information service. More attention needs also to be paid to both the ship-side and the shore-side of the VTS domain. They each reflect one perspective on maritime safety and the function of the VTS. Therefore, they are to be seen as equally important whenever means and measures with the aim to improve maritime safety are introduced within the VTS domain. Finally, more knowledge on what a VTS is and what purpose it serves needs to be fostered in the maritime domain.

As in many other safety-critical domains, work is increasingly characterised by the integration and dissemination of information between humans and technology, across disciplines and over multiple geographical locations. Technological advancements such as e-navigation facilitate increased monitoring and control from shore and create new possibilities to provide additional assistance on board vessels. E-navigation has thus {{a direct impact on}} navigational assistance as performed by pilots and VTS operators. This thesis views navigational assistance as a case of sociotechnical work in a safety-critical domain. It attempts to understand how work is performed and how it contributes to maritime safety by starting from empirical observation and a Resilience Engineering focus on everyday operations. Interviews, focus groups and field observations on board vessels and in VTS centres were conducted and analysed using an iterative approach, inspired by the principles of grounded theory and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) and informed by the traditions of Workplace Studies, Science and Technology Studies and Activity Theory. A generic FRAM model of navigational assistance was developed to describe the practice of everyday work and how the conditions which affect its performance may vary. A scenario and case study were also analysed and modelled to illustrate how safety may manifest itself in typical and actual events. Successful assistance was found to be dependent on: (i) the use of local knowledge, preparation and foresight to integrate information {{from a wide range of}} sources, and; (ii) communication and trust between the pilot, <b>VTS</b> <b>operator,</b> and the master and crew of the vessel, to provide timely assistance to vessels. FRAM was found to be a valuable tool for describing sociotechnical work, but was enriched by borrowing from the work studies traditions, with their strong grounding in empirical observations and themes of 'making work visible', symmetry between human/non-human, and work as activity. This approach indicated that bringing ideas from different traditions together to understand a real work practice may bring us closer to describing 'work as done', and its contribution to safe everyday operations. This thesis concludes that safety is an emergent property of sociotechnical work, which manifests itself through the interaction between humans and other actors in the context in which work is performed. The configuration of a sociotechnical system is not necessarily pre-defined, but is dependent on the human, technological, organisational and natural factors which affect the performance of work. It is inherently uncertain, variable and must adapt to circumstances. In order to inform the design of new systems or evaluate the impact of new technologies, one should therefore take account of the factors which affect how work is normally performed, and also how it is actually performed in specific circumstances to enable safe operations...|$|E
