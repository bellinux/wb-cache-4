50|$|VSM (<b>vibrating</b> <b>sample</b> <b>magnetometers)</b> {{detect the}} {{magnetization}} of a <b>sample</b> by mechanically <b>vibrating</b> the <b>sample</b> {{inside of a}}n inductive pickup coil or inside of a SQUID coil. Induced current or changing flux in the coil is measured. The vibration is typically created by a motor or a piezoelectric actuator. Typically the VSM technique is about {{an order of magnitude}} less sensitive than SQUID magnetometry. VSMs can be combined with SQUIDs to create a system that is more sensitive than either one alone. Heat due to the sample vibration can limit the base temperature of a VSM, typically to 2 Kelvin. VSM is also impractical for measuring a fragile sample that is sensitive to rapid acceleration.|$|R

In spintronics, exotic phenomena often {{emerge from a}} non-equilibrium spin polarization or magnetization, that {{is very difficult to}} measure directly. The challenge is due to the tiny total moment, which is out of reach of superconducting quantum interference devices and <b>vibrating</b> <b>sample</b> <b>magnetometers</b> or spectroscopic methods such as X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. The Kerr effect is sufficiently sensitive only in direct gap semiconductors, in which the Kerr angle can be resonantly enhanced. Here we demonstrate that even one excess spin in a million can be detected by a Hall effect at room temperature. The novel Hall effect is not governed by the spin Hall conductivity but by its energy derivative thereby related to the spin Nernst effect...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>vibrating</b> <b>sample</b> <b>magnetometer</b> or VSM is a {{scientific}} instrument that measures magnetic properties. Simon Foner at MIT Lincoln Laboratory invented VSM in 1955 and reported it in 1959. A sample is first magnetized {{in a uniform}} magnetic field. It is then sinusoidally vibrated, typically {{through the use of}} a piezoelectric material. Commercial systems use linear actuators of some form. Historically these systems were developed using modified audio speakers, though this approach was dropped due to the interference through the produced in-phase magnetic noise, as the magnetic flux through a nearby pickup coil varies sinusoidally. The induced voltage in the pickup coil is proportional to the sample's magnetic moment, but does not depend on the strength of the applied magnetic field. In a typical setup, the induced voltage is measured with a lock-in amplifier using the piezoelectric signal as a frequency reference. It is also possible to record the hysteresis curve of a material by sweeping the magnetic field.|$|E

The intersublattice coupling constant JRT, molecular field coefficient nRT, and exchange field Bex, are evaluated by a molecular field model. The decrease of JRT with increasing Al content is related to the decrease of the number of (Sm,Pr) -Fe interacting pairs.

40|$|It {{has been}} found that the {{magnetic}} ground state of nanoparticles can be heavily influenced by the size and macrostructure of the particles, which behave significantly differently from the bulk materials. To obtain superparamagnetic iron particles, co-precipitation technique is applied. Seven different samples (S 1 -S 7) are fabricated under varied conditions by changing the pH value or the reaction temperature.

30|$|A {{suitable}} {{cap layer}} {{is essential in}} magnetic recording media because it can affect the morphology, microstructure, and magnetic property of the magnetic films greatly. For example, Zhao et al. [11] found that the crystallographic ordering of the L 10 FCT FePt phase was significantly promoted when a Ag layer was deposited {{on top of the}} film; Yuan et al. [12] found that a Au cap layer was beneficial for FePt layer forming isolated grains and larger coercivity; Chen et al. [17] found that the exchange couple and magnetic reversal process can be controlled by the Cu cap layer diffusion in Cu/FePt/Pt/CrW multilayers. In this study, the effect of Ru and Ag cap layer on the microstructure and magnetic properties of ultrathin FePt films was investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), <b>vibrate</b> <b>sample</b> <b>magnetometer</b> (VSM), and anomalous Hall effect (AHE). We found that the Ag cap layer segregates from the FePt/Ag bilayer after annealing, which lowers the FePt ordering temperature, promotes the FePt thin films to form island structure, and enhances the coercivity, whereas the Ru cap layer shows a completely inverse behavior. The effects can be mainly attributed to the different melting point and thermal expansion stress between the cap layer and the FePt thin films.|$|R

The problems are {{due to the fact}} that in conventional VSMs the sample is rotating with respect to the coils, when performing angular dependent measurements. In this article a solution is presented based on a setup of VSM detection coils, whose position is linked to that of the sample. Together with a newly designed sample holder, the above mentioned problems are prevented or reduced. The vector detection coil system shows a relatively small error in the determination of the magnetization vector (± 1 % in the absolute value and ± 0. 6 ° in the angle). Furthermore, it has a relatively small positional dependency (1 % per mm) combined with a sufficient sensitivity (1  nA m 2 or 1 μemu at 10 s time constant) and a capability of using samples up to 10 × 10  mm 2. The improved sample holder for thin film measurements reduces positional problems while, at the same time, reducing the background signals of the holder (to 10  pA m 2 per kA/m or 7. 958 × 10 − 10  emu/Oe) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the reversal of magnetisation in sintered anisotropic Nd-Fe-B, isotropic melt-spun Nd-Fe-B powder, and in Sm-(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr) 2 : 17 anisotropic powder. Magnetisation measurements have been performed using <b>vibrating</b> <b>sample</b> <b>magnetometers,</b> a permeameter, and an adapted pulsed field magnetometer. Magnetisation reversal is explained in terms of domain wall formation and motion, and irreversible switching of moments across energy barriers. For sintered Nd-Fe-B, consisting of multi-domain grains in the virgin state, it is suggested that the pinning of domain walls at grain boundaries {{plays an important role in}} hindering reversal of magnetised grains. The type of pinning mechanism appears to depend on the initial magnetic state of the material. In the melt-spun Nd-Fe-B and in Sm-(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr) 2 : 17 powders, it is suggested that since domains remain correlated across several grains, the reversal mechanism is best described as bulk pinning of domain walls by grain boundaries. The nature of this mechanism is investigated. In Sm-(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr) 2 : 17 an unexpected variation of remanent coercivity and fluctuation field with magnetic orientation and texture is observed. Data on magnetic interactions and their effects on the reversal mechanisms is analysed. Weight changes of melt-spun Nd-Fe-B powders during ageing in different environments are related to the observed changes in the reversal mechanism.

In general, high electrical conductivity, dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability are the few factors that will contribute to a better microwave absorption property of a material. Among all PAni nanocomposites, PAni/HA/TiO 2 /MWNT nanocomposites with MWNT (D = 10 - 20 nm, l = 5 - 15 μm) possesses the highest reflection loss (RL = - 58 dB) at 7 GHz due to the high heterogeneity and high μrʹ′ and μrʹ′ʹ′. This significantly induces the space charge polarization and eddy current along the PAni backbone. Finally, it indicates the strongest absorption.
