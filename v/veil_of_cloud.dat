60|$|So they talked, and all {{the while}} the great galley drifted onward with a slow, majestic motion, her decks hid in shadow, for a sail cut off the light of the low moon from them.

60|$|It {{was close}} on six o'clock and the night, after the {{turbulent}} and capricious alternations {{of rain and}} sunshine, promised to be beautifully clear, though very cold. The pale crescent of the moon had just emerged from behind the thick <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> and mist which still hung threateningly upon the horizon: a fitful sheen of silver danced upon the waves.|$|E
60|$|We impute it, therefore, {{solely to}} the disease in his own eye and heart that the minister, looking upward to the zenith, beheld there the {{appearance}} of an immense letter--the letter A--marked out in lines of dull red light. Not but the meteor may have shown itself at that point, burning duskily through a <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud,</b> but with no such shape as his guilty imagination gave it, or, at least, with so little definiteness, that another's guilt might have seen another symbol in it.|$|E
6000|$|The {{main cause}} of this change being, that the {{prismatic}} cloud itself is always in rapid, and generally in fluctuating motion. [...] "A light <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> had drawn itself," [...] says Professor Tyndall, in describing his solitary ascent of Monte Rosa, [...] "between me and the sun, and this was flooded with the most brilliant dyes.

60|$|What {{was that}} noise above his head? A falling stone? Were his enemies in pursuit? Down to {{the depth of}} hell rather than that they should take him! He drove his heels into the {{slippery}} shale, and rushed forward blindly, springing, slipping, falling, rolling, till he stopped breathless on a jutting slab. And lo! below him, through the thin pearly <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud,</b> a dim world of dark cliffs, blue lakes, grey mountains with their dark heads wrapped in cloud, and the straight vale of Nant Francon, magnified in mist, till it seemed to stretch for hundreds of leagues towards the rosy north-east dawning and the shining sea.|$|E
60|$|This bay {{was further}} {{remarkable}} for a solar halo which I chanced {{to see on}} glancing up at the sun. I suppose it was the singular quality of the light that first caused me to look overhead. For a thin <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> had drawn over the blue and tempered the sunshine peculiarly. Of course one is familiar with caricatures of the thing in meteorological books; but the phenomenon itself is not so common, and the effect was uncanny. At the first glance it seemed a bit of Noto witchery, that strangely luminous circle around the sun. To admire the moon thus bonneted, as the Japanese say, is common enough, and befits the hour. But to have the halo of the night hung aloft in broad day is to crown sober noon with enchantment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gaw!" [...] said Bert--"guns!" [...] and was {{instantly}} at the lieutenant's side. The airship {{was still very}} high and the sea below was masked by a thin <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds.</b> The wind had fallen, and Bert, following Kurt's pointing finger, saw dimly through the colourless veil first a red glow, then a quick red flash, and then at a little distance from it another. They were, it seemed for a while, silent flashes, and seconds after, when one had ceased to expect them, came the belated thuds--thud, thud. Kurt spoke in German, very quickly.|$|R
60|$|They soon {{reached the}} scene of the robbery, and were able to examine the place {{by the light of the}} moon, which had just managed to pierce the thick <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> that had covered it during the earlier part of that night. Then they retired to a shady cavern, or hole, or hollow at the foot of the embankment, near to the gap in the hedge, and there they {{prepared}} to pass the night, with a heap of mingled clods and stones for their couch, and an overhanging bank of nettles for their canopy.|$|R
60|$|With solemn thankfulness we gazed--thankfulness to God {{for having}} {{withdrawn}} his <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> from this {{threshold of the}} heavenly vestibule, and brought us across the Atlantic to behold. And as our eyes, blinded by the dazzling vision,--which we might reside here years without beholding in such perfection,--filled with tears, {{we were forced to}} turn them away and hide them, or fasten them upon the dark range of Jura {{on the other side of}} us, until they were able to gaze again. Thus we rode onward, obtaining new points of view, new effects, and deeper emotions; nor can time efface the impressions we received in the depths of our souls.|$|R
60|$|So {{they stepped}} out briskly, {{and when they}} were about half-way down the street heard other steps behind them. They turned and looked back through the gloom, whereon the sound of the {{following}} steps died away. They pushed on again, and so, unless the echo deceived them, did those quick, stealthy steps. Then, as though by common consent, though no one gave the word, they broke into a run and gained the end of the street, which they now saw led into a large open space lit {{by the light of the}} great moon, that broke suddenly through the <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> or mist. Again, as though by common consent, they wheeled round, Hugh drawing his sword, and perceived emerging from the street six or seven cloaked fellows, who, on catching sight of the flash of steel, halted and melted back into the gloom.|$|E
60|$|My line {{of flight}} was about {{parallel}} with the surface as I came into the upper air. The temperature of sphere began to rise forthwith. I knew it behoved me to drop at once. Far below me, in a darkling twilight, stretched a great expanse of sea. I opened every window I could, and fell--out of sunshine into evening, and out of evening into night. Vaster grew the earth and vaster, swallowing up the stars, and the silvery translucent starlit <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> it wore spread out to catch me. At last the world seemed no longer a sphere but flat, and then concave. It {{was no longer a}} planet in the sky, but the world of Man. I shut all but an inch or so of earthward window, and dropped with a slackening velocity. The broadening water, now so near that I could see the dark glitter of the waves, rushed up to meet me. The sphere became very hot. I snapped the last strip of window, and sat scowling and biting my knuckles, waiting for the impact....|$|E
60|$|We {{arrived at}} the Lowwood Hotel, which is very near {{the head of the}} lake, not long after two o'clock. It stands almost on the shore of Windermere, with only a green lawn between,--an {{extensive}} hotel, covering a good deal of ground; but low, and rather village-inn-like than lofty. We found the house so crowded as to afford us no very comfortable accommodations, either as to parlor or sleeping-rooms, and we find nothing like the home-feeling into which we at once settled down at Newby Bridge. There is a very pretty vicinity, and a fine view of mountains to the northwest, sitting together in a family group, sometimes in full sunshine, sometimes with only a golden gleam on one or two of them, sometimes all in a <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud,</b> from which here and there a great, dusky head raises itself, while you are looking at a dim obscurity. Nearer, there are high, green slopes, well wooded, but with such decent and well-behaved wood as you perceive has grown up under the care of man; still no wildness, no ruggedness,--as how should there be, when, every half-mile or so, a porter's lodge or a gentleman's gateway indicates that the whole region is used up for villas. On the opposite shore of the lake there is a mimic castle, which I suppose I might have mistaken for a real one two years ago. It is a great, foolish toy of gray stone.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely a sound occurred, {{except for}} the little shuddering and {{stirring}} of the fire, and the reluctant, infrequent drip from the icicles along the sunny edge of the log hut roof. About one o'clock the amber sunshine faded out altogether, a <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> thickened and became greyly ominous, and a little after two the first flakes of a snowstorm fell hissing into the fire. A wind rose and drove the multiplying snowflakes in whirls and eddies before it. The icicles ceased to drip, but one or two broke and fell with a weak tinkling. A deep soughing, a shuddering groaning of trees and shrubs, came ever and again out of the ravine, and the powdery snow blew like puffs of smoke from the branches.|$|R

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{also carries}} three Lego minifigures representing Galileo, the Roman god Jupiter, {{and his sister}} and wife, the goddess Juno. In Roman mythology, Jupiter drew a <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> around himself to hide his mischief. Juno was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. The Juno minifigure holds a magnifying glass {{as a sign of}} searching for the truth, and Jupiter holds a lightning bolt. The third Lego crew member, Galileo Galilei, has his telescope with him on the journey. The figurines were produced in partnership between NASA and Lego as part of an outreach program to inspire children's interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Although most Lego toys are made of plastic, Lego specially made these minifigures of aluminum to endure the extreme conditions of space flight.|$|R

60|$|Thus on that starless {{night the}} Shallows were peopled by uneasy souls. The thick <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> {{stretched}} over them, {{cut them off}} from the rest of the universe. At times Mrs. Travers had in the darkness the impression of dizzy speed, and again it seemed to her that the boat was standing still, that everything in the world was standing still and only her fancy roamed free from all trammels. Lingard, perfectly motionless by her side, steered, shaping his course by the feel of the wind. Presently he perceived ahead a ghostly flicker of faint, livid light which the earth seemed to throw up against the uniform blackness of the sky. The dinghy was approaching the expanse of the Shallows. The confused clamour of broken water deepened its note.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was very}} dark, for the wind, having lulled, no longer thinned the <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> above, nor {{dissipated}} a steaming mist {{that appeared to}} rise from the sodden plain. Yet he moved easily through the darkness, seeming to be upheld by it as something tangible, upon which he might lean. At times he thought he heard voices,--not a particular voice he was thinking of, but strange voices--of course unreal to his present fancy. And then he heard one of these voices, unlike any voice in Sidon, and very faint and far off, asking if it [...] "was anywhere near Sidon?"--evidently some one lost like himself. He answered in a voice that seemed quite as unreal and as faint, and turned in the direction from which it came. There was a light moving like a will-o'-the-wisp far before him, yet below him as if coming out of the depths of the earth. It must be fancy, but he would see--ah! ...|$|R
60|$|Through half-closed eyes {{he looked}} out upon the broad drive. With the aid of an {{imagination}} naturally powerful, he was passing with marvellous facility into an unreal world of his own creation. The scene remained the same, but the environment changed as though by magic. Sunshine pierced the grey <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> gay voices and laughter broke the chill silence. The horn of a four-in-hand sounded from the corner, the path before him was thronged with men and women whose rustling skirts brushed often against his knees {{as they made their}} way with difficulty along the promenade. A glittering show of carriages and coaches swept past the railings; the air was full of the sound of the trampling of horses and the rolling of wheels. With a mental restraint of which he was all the time half-conscious, he kept back the final effort of his imagination for some time; but it came at last.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of Venus to Earth and their similarity in composition and size, our {{lack of knowledge of}} our sister planet is remarkable. As summarized in numerous studies in recent years, including the 2003 Decadal Study, reports by the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG), book chapters from international conferences on Venus, and in several white papers being submitted to the current Decadal Study effort (e. g., Crisp et al., 2003; NRCDS, 2003; Luhmann et al., 2007; Baines et al., 2007; Smrekar et al., 2009; Limaye et al, 2009 a; Limaye et al., 2009 b), we understand very little about the planet’s origin and evolution, its circulation, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorology. Yet, as amply demonstrated in the past – with, for example, fundamental revelations on the importance of the greenhouse effect and the terrestrial ozone hole – Venus has a lot to teach us about how planetary atmospheres, including the Earth, work and evolve. A primary hindrance to understanding the world next door is its perpetual <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> that greatly obscures views of the deep atmosphere except over a small range of near-infrared wavelengths. In-situ techniques are invaluable tools in filling this observational gap, allowing accurate measurements of salient atmospheric parameters such as pressure, temperature, winds...|$|R
60|$|Soon he got {{up again}} and stared {{for a long time}} it the sinking world below, at white cliffs to the east and {{flattening}} marsh to the left, at a minute wide prospect of weald and downland, at dim towns and harbours and rivers and ribbon-like roads, at ships and ships, decks and foreshortened funnels upon the ever-widening sea, and at the great mono-rail bridge that straddled the Channel from Folkestone to Boulogne, until at last, first little wisps and then a <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> filmy <b>cloud</b> hid the prospect from his eyes.

A pall of gloom seems to hang over the township for most of the year, like the <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> that obscures the Kanchenjunga and other snow-capped titans in the distance. In spring, though, the sparkle of rhododendrons lights up the region. The route to Sukhia Pokhri is via Mirik. Buses ply between Mirik and Darjeeling via Ghoom. It also allows the journey through the green tea estates to be savoured.Sukhia Pokhri is on the road to Manebhanjan from Ghoom. Gurashey Forest Resort, an eco-tourism project, (for booking 03324862313/9830372948) is a three-minute walk from the main market of Sukhia Pokhri. The trail ends {{on the bank of the}} Rangit. At 6800ft, Gurashey is a tapestry of nature and people, done up with ferns and orchids. The cottages rest comfortably on the lap of nature, with windows overlooking the mountains. The balconies provide a captivating view of Mim Tea Estate. Those who intends to visit Sandakphu by car, may choose Gurashey instead Mane Bhanjang for better stay.

5|$|Within the tropics, 36hours {{prior to}} the center passage of a {{tropical}} cyclone, a <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> white cirrus <b>clouds</b> approaches {{from the direction of}} the cyclone. In the mid to late 19th century, forecasters used these cirrus veils to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in Havana, Cuba, Father Benito Viñes, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion <b>of</b> these <b>clouds</b> in formulating his predictions.

6000|$|... § 6. In {{all these}} {{passages}} the meaning is unmistakable, if they possess definite meaning at all. We are too apt {{to take them}} merely for sublime and vague imagery, and therefore gradually to lose the apprehension of their life and power. The expression, [...] "He bowed the Heavens," [...] for instance, is, I suppose, received by most readers as a magnificent hyperbole, having reference to some peculiar and fearful manifestation of God's power to the writer of the Psalm in which the words occur. But the expression either has plain meaning, or it has no meaning. Understand by the term [...] "Heavens" [...] the compass of infinite space around the earth, and the expression, [...] "bowed the Heavens," [...] however sublime, is wholly without meaning; infinite space cannot be bent or bowed. But understand by the [...] "Heavens" [...] the <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> above the earth, and the expression is neither hyperbolical nor obscure; it is pure, plain, and accurate truth, and it describes God, not as revealing Himself in any peculiar way to David, but doing what he is still doing before our own eyes day by day. By accepting the words in their simple sense, we are thus led to apprehend the immediate presence of the Deity, and His purpose of manifesting Himself as near us whenever the storm-cloud stoops upon its course; while by our vague and inaccurate acceptance of the words we remove the idea of His presence far from us, into a region which we can neither see nor know; and gradually, from the close realization of a living God who [...] "maketh the clouds his chariot," [...] we refine and explain ourselves into dim and distant suspicion of an inactive God, inhabiting inconceivable places, and fading into the multitudinous formalisms {{of the laws of}} Nature.|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} very dark. For {{the first time}} in many months the East Coast slept unseen by the stars under a <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> {{motionless}} <b>cloud</b> that, driven before the first breath of the rainy monsoon, had drifted slowly from the eastward all the afternoon; pursuing the declining sun with its masses of black and grey that seemed to chase the light with wicked intent, and with an ominous and gloomy steadiness, as though conscious of the message of violence and turmoil they carried. At the sun's disappearance below the western horizon, the immense cloud, in quickened motion, grappled with the glow of retreating light, and rolling down to the clear and jagged outline of the distant mountains, hung arrested above the steaming forests; hanging low, silent and menacing over the unstirring tree-tops; withholding the blessing of rain, nursing the wrath of its thunder; undecided--as if brooding over its own power for good or for evil.|$|R

6000|$|We {{travelled}} {{five hours}} in a North-Easterly course up a diagonal valley,[FN#18] through a country fantastic in its desolation-a mass of huge hills, barren plains, and desert vales. Even the sturdy Acacias here failed, and in some places the camel grass could not find earth enough for its root. The road wound among mountains, rocks and hills of granite, and over broken ground, flanked by huge blocks and boulders piled up as if man's art had aided Nature to disfigure herself. Vast clefts seamed like scars the hideous face of earth; here they widened into dark caves, there they were choked with glistening drift sand. Not a bird or a beast was to be seen or heard; their presence would have argued the vicinity of water; and, though my companions opined that Badawin were lurking among the rocks, I decided that these Badawin were the creatures of their fears. Above, a sky like polished blue steel, with a tremendous blaze of yellow light, glared upon us without the thinnest <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> mist <b>cloud.</b> Below, the brass-coloured circle scorched the face and dazzled the eyes, mocking them the while with offers of water that was but air.

A hundred snakes her gloomy visage shade, A hundred serpents guard her horrid head; In her sunk eyeballs dreadful meteors glow: Such rays from Phoebe's bloody circle flow, When, labouring with strong charms, she shoots from high A fiery gleam, and reddens all the sky. Blood stain'd her cheeks, and from her mouth there came 150 Blue steaming poisons, and a length of flame. From every blast of her contagious breath Famine and drought proceed, and plagues and death. A robe obscene was o'er her shoulders thrown, A dress by Fates and Furies worn alone. She toss'd her meagre arms; her better hand In waving circles whirl'd a funeral brand: A serpent from her left was seen to rear His flaming crest, and lash the yielding air. But when the Fury took her stand on high, [...] 160 Where vast Cithæron's top salutes the sky, A hiss from all the snaky tire went round: The dreadful signal all the rocks rebound, And through th' Achaian cities send the sound. Oete, with high Parnassus, heard the voice; Eurotas' banks remurmur'd to the noise; Again Leucothoë shook at these alarms, And press'd Palærmon closer in her arms. Headlong from thence the glowing Fury springs, And o'er the Theban palace spreads her wings, [...] 170 Once more invades the guilty dome, and shrouds Its bright pavilions in a <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds.</b> Straight with the rage of all their race possess'd, Stung to the soul, the brothers start from rest, And all their Furies wake within their breast: Their tortured minds repining Envy tears, And Hate, engender'd by suspicious fears: And sacred thirst of sway, and all the ties Of nature broke; and royal perjuries; And impotent desire to reign alone, [...] 180 That scorns the dull reversion of a throne: Each would the sweets of sovereign rule devour, While Discord waits upon divided power.|$|R
