40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} a mechatronic <b>protection</b> <b>valve</b> that {{is a part of}} the new generation air management systems applied in pneumatic brake systems of commercial vehicles. The main goal of the thesis is to elaborate on the dynamic modelling, to prepare and apply a model simplification approach, to identify the unknown model parameters and to develop a pressure limiting controller design using the nonlinear model of the mechatronic <b>protection</b> <b>valve.</b> It has been shown that the mechatronic <b>protection</b> <b>valve</b> can be described as a mixed thermodynamical, mechanical and electro-magnetic system. Its dynamic model is built and verified by using a systematic modelling methodology. The state equations of the nonlinear dynamic model possesses a special algebraic structure. The model exhibits hybrid or switching behavior caused by different included elements with inherently discrete behavior. Having performed a systematic modelling procedure the obtained model for control design purpose has been considered for model simplification. A systematic model simplification approach has been developed. The simplification process has been applied to the model of the mechatronic <b>protection</b> <b>valve.</b> The size of the state vector has been reduced and the structur...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} of an ancestral circular genome to multiple linear chromosomes was crucial for eukaryogenesis because it allowed rapid adaptive evolution through aneuploidy. Here, we {{propose that the}} ends of nascent linear chromosomes {{should have had a}} dual function in chromosome end <b>protection</b> (<b>capping)</b> and chromosome segregation to give rise to the >proto-telomeres. > Later on, proper centromeres evolved at subtelomeric regions.

We further suggest that the origin of Drosophila telomeres may be reminiscent of how the first telomeres arose.

The simulations, conducted with the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), show a shift of direct payments in favour of sheep and dairy farms, mainly those with a high proportion of grassland in their rotation. By contrast, crop farms and intensive cattle farms should lose. This new reform of the CAP will reduce the variability of single farm payment amounts among French farms; however, it will not modify in depth the current hierarchy of agricultural incomes which is also highly dependent on agricultural prices. In addition, these measures promote a more targeted allocation of budgetary outlays on natural resource <b>protection.</b> <b>CAP,</b> France, health check, direct aid, single farm payment, farms, FADN...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a Cloud {{empowered}} Cognitive Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (C 2 -ICIC) scheme for small cellular networks. The scheme leverages a recently proposed cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture for enabling intra-tier coordination and relaxes the need for inter-tier coordination by adopting the phantom cell architecture. Employing tools from stochastic geometry, we characterize the downlink success probability for a Mobile User (MU) scheduled under the proposed coordination scheme. It is shown that, compared to un-coordinated scheduling, significant performance gains can be realized in ultra dense small cell deployment scenarios under the proposed C 2 -ICIC scheme. This is attributed to the robust interference protection provisioned by the scheme. It is demonstrated that the gains are particularly large for the users experiencing a weak received signal strength. Indeed, for these users, the received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can only be improved by reducing the experienced aggregate co-channel interference. The closed-form expression derived for the downlink success probability is employed to quantify the link level throughput under the proposed scheme. Finally, we briefly explore the design space of the C 2 -ICIC scheme in terms of interference <b>protection</b> <b>cap</b> which determines both the downlink throughput of the MU scheduled in the coordination mode and the transmission opportunity for the co-channel small cells...|$|R
