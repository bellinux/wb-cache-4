30|$|Based on {{the results}} in [14], in general, the maximum <b>voltage</b> <b>values</b> arise only at DG or {{capacitor}} connected buses and at the substation bus. The author suggested to install RTU at each of these buses. RTUs connected at these points can directly read the node voltages for maximum <b>voltage</b> <b>values.</b> In case of minimum <b>voltage</b> <b>values,</b> possibility of occurrence is {{only at the end}} nodes of the feeder or in-between any two DG (or capacitors, as well as between a capacitor and DG) connected buses.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{research}} the impact of physical parameters which characterize the MOSFET transistors structure on the threshold <b>voltage</b> <b>values</b> and its influence on critical <b>voltage</b> <b>values</b> which characterize digital circuits that contain the MOSFET transistors. The results obtained emphasize the impact of each single physical parameter on the total value of the threshold voltage. By adjusting the values of MOSFET physical parameters the accepted threshold voltage can be achieved. Since the threshold voltage will have influence on critical <b>voltage</b> <b>values</b> which characterise MOS inverters and delay times during transfer logic states between stages, it must be taken into consideration during design phase of logic gates that contain the MOSFET transistors...|$|R

25|$|A charged {{capacitor}} discharges {{over time}} through {{its own internal}} insulation resistance Risol. The multiplication of the insulation resistance together with the capacitance of the capacitor results in a time constant which is called the “self-discharge time constant”: (τisol = Risol•C). This {{is a measure of}} the quality of the dielectric with respect to its insulating properties, and is dimensioned in seconds. Usual values for film capacitors range from 1000s up to 1,000,000s. These time constants are always relevant if capacitors are used as time-determining elements (such as timing delay), or for storing a <b>voltage</b> <b>value</b> as in sample-and-hold circuits or integrators.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{evolution}} {{problem for}} a membrane based model of an electrostatically actuated microelectromechanical system (MEMS) is studied. The model describes {{the dynamics of the}} mem-brane displacement and the electric potential. The latter is a harmonic function in an angular do-main, the deformable membrane being a part of the boundary. The former solves a heat equation with a right hand side that depends on the square of the trace of the gradient of the electric po-tential on the membrane. The resulting free boundary problem is shown to be well-posed locally in time. Furthermore, solutions corresponding to small <b>voltage</b> <b>values</b> exist globally in time while global existence is shown not to hold for high <b>voltage</b> <b>values.</b> It is also proven that, for small <b>voltage</b> <b>values,</b> there is an asymptotically stable steady-state solution.

2500|$|The {{temperature}} and frequency {{dependence of the}} electrical characteristics for capacitance and dissipation factor of PEN film capacitors {{are similar to the}} PET film capacitors. Because of the smaller relative permittivity and lower dielectric strength of the PEN polymer, PEN film capacitors are physically larger for a given capacitance and rated <b>voltage</b> <b>value.</b> In spite of this, PEN film capacitors are preferred over PET when the ambient temperature during operation of the capacitors is permanently above 125nbsp&°C. The special PEN [...] "high voltage" [...] (HV) dielectric offers excellent electrical properties during the life tests at high voltages and high temperatures (175nbsp&°C). PEN capacitors are mainly used for non-critical filtering, coupling and decoupling in electronic circuits, when the temperature dependencies do not matter.|$|E

50|$|A {{version of}} Buridan's {{principle}} actually occurs in electrical engineering. Specifically, the input to a digital logic gate must convert a continuous <b>voltage</b> <b>value</b> into either a 0 or a 1, which is typically sampled and then processed. If the input is changing and at an intermediate value when sampled, the input stage {{acts like a}} comparator. The <b>voltage</b> <b>value</b> can then be likened {{to the position of}} the ass, and the values 0 and 1 represent the bales of hay. Like the situation of the starving ass, there exists an input on which the converter cannot make a proper decision, and the output remains balanced in a metastable state between the two stable states for an undetermined length of time, until random noise in the circuit makes it converge to one of the stable states.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamics}} {{of a free}} boundary problem for electrostatically actuated microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is investigated. The model couples the electric potential to the deformation of the membrane, the deflection of the membrane being caused by application of a voltage difference across the device. More precisely, the electrostatic potential is a harmonic function in the angular domain that is partly bounded by the deformable membrane. The gradient trace of the electric potential on this free boundary part acts as a source term in the governing equation for the membrane deformation. The main feature of the model considered herein is that, unlike most previous research, the small deformation assumption is dropped, and curvature for the deformation of the membrane is taken into account what leads to a quasilinear parabolic equation. The free boundary problem is shown to be well-posed, locally in time for arbitrary <b>voltage</b> <b>values</b> and globally in time for small <b>voltages</b> <b>values.</b> Furthermore, existence of asymptotically stable steady-state configurations is proved in case of small <b>voltage</b> <b>values</b> as well as non-existence of steady-states if the applied voltage difference is large. Finally, convergence of solutions of the free boundary problem to the solutions of the well-established small aspect ratio model is shown. 1...|$|R
