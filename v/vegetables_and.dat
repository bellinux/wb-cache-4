5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> tubers.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of {{international}} agrofood supply chains in greening <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit products and production in Vietnam. Mainly through contract-based procurement, the export- oriented <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit supply chain is better structured and organized than the domestic supply chain. Exporters intervene to some degree in fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> farming, to safeguard supply and to improve product quality. Pesticide use is one of exporters’ concerns, although pesticide application remains largely controlled by farmers. Despite some endogenous innovations to improve <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit pesticide practices, farmers and exporters are especially responding {{to the demands of}} importers. Relatively lax import regulations from the main export markets (China and Russia) are the main reason for limited achievements in less-pesticide-dependent <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit production in Vietnam. By the same token, these limited innovations constrain farmers and exporters from exporting to more challenging markets in the EU, the US, and Japan. Hence, in Vietnam export markets have hardly induced reduction in the use of pesticides in agricultural <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit productio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Limited {{evidence}} exists describing {{the effectiveness of}} strategies in facilitating the implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit programs by schools on a population wide basis. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effectiveness of a multi-strategy intervention in increasing the population-wide implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit breaks by primary schools and to determine if intervention effectiveness varied by school characteristics. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted in primary schools in the state of New South Wales, Australia. All primary schools in one region of the state (n = 422) received a multi-strategy intervention. A random sample of schools (n = 406) in the remainder of the state served as comparison schools. The multi-strategy intervention to increase <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit breaks involved the development and provision of: program consensus and leadership; staff training; program materials; incentives; follow-up support; and implementation feedback. Comparison schools had access to routine information-based Government support. Data to assess the prevalence of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit breaks were collected by telephone from Principals of the intervention and comparison schools at baseline (2006 – 2007) and 11 to 15 months following the commencement of the intervention (2009 – 2010). GEE analysis was used to examine the change in the prevalence of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit breaks in intervention schools compared to comparison schools. Results At follow-up, prevalence of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit breaks increased significantly in both intervention (50. 3 % to 82. 0 %, p Conclusion The findings suggest that a multi-strategy intervention can significantly increase the implementation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> fruit breaks by a large number of Australian primary schools. </p...|$|R
