50|$|ZSM-5 {{has a high}} silicon to {{aluminum}} ratio. Whenever an Al3+ cation replaces a Si4+ cation, {{an additional}} positive charge is required to keep the material charge-neutral. With proton (H+) as the cation, the material becomes very acidic. Thus the acidity {{is proportional to the}} Al content. The very regular 3-D structure and the acidity of ZSM-5 can be utilized for acid-catalyzed reactions such as hydrocarbon isomerization and the alkylation of hydrocarbons. One such reaction is the isomerization of meta-xylene to para-xylene. Within the pores of the ZSM-5 zeolite, para-xylene has a much higher diffusion coefficient than meta-xylene. When the isomerization reaction is allowed to occur within the pores of ZSM-5, para-xylene is able to traverse along the pores of the zeolite, diffusing out of the catalyst very quickly. This size-selectivity allows the isomerization reaction to occur quickly in high yield.ZSM-5 {{has been used as a}} support material for catalysis. In one such example, copper is deposited on the zeolite and a stream of ethanol is passed through at temperatures of 240 to 320 °C as a <b>vapour</b> <b>stream,</b> which causes the ethanol to oxidize to acetaldehyde; two hydrogens are lost by the ethanol as hydrogen gas. It appears that the specific pore size of ZSM-5 is of benefit to this process, which also functions for other alcohols and oxidations. The copper is occasionally combined with other metals, such as chromium, to fine tune the diversity and specificity of the products, as there is likely to be more than one. Acetic acid is an example of one possible byproduct from hot copper oxidation.It is used to convert alcohols directly into gasoline.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn Part I of this paper, it {{was shown}} on {{thermodynamic}} grounds that introducing a flash in the preheating train of an atmospheric oil distillation process, together with an appropriate introduction of the resulting vapour into the column, could potentially bring substantial energy savings, by reducing {{the duty of the}} preheating furnace, by doing some pre-fractionation and by reducing the column irreversibilities. Part II expands on this idea by showing how this can be done while keeping the throughput and the product characteristics unchanged. The outcome is that placing several flashes after the heat exchangers and feeding the corresponding <b>vapour</b> <b>streams</b> to the appropriate trays of the column reduces the pumparound flows and the heat brought to the preheating train. The resulting heat deficit may then be compensated in an additional heat exchanger by using low level heat recuperated from the products of the distillation and/or imported from other processes. The use of this residual heat reduces the furnace duty by approximately an equivalent amount. Thus high level energy (fuel-gas burnt in the furnace) is replaced by residual low level heat. The simulation with an example flowsheet shows that the savings on fuel could be as high as 21 %...|$|R

In this abstract we present an innovative miniaturisable system for continuously measurement of pH solutions and <b>vapours</b> <b>streams</b> during chemical or biological processes. It consists on a simple barcode sensor with several pH dyes doped in an ionogel matrix. 	This ionogel is a hybrid material fabricated from an hydrogel polymer (N-isopropylacrylamide and N,N-methylene-bis(acrylamide) ratio 100 : 5) and an ionic liquid (Trihexyltetradecylphosphonium dicyanoamide). The barcode sensor consists of nineteen independent micro-wells (1  20 mm by 50 m) fabricated in poly(methyl methacrylate) and pressure-sensitive adhesive in three layers using a CO 2 ablation laser. Different optically responsive molecular recognition ligands (pH-dyes) were incorporated in the ionogel matrix during monomers photo-polymerisation {{within each of the}} micro-wells generating a pH-sensor array for specific sensing applications like colorimetric, environmental or chemical sensing, Figure 1. It was observed that no leaching of pH dyes occurred during experiments and that the ionogel material was impressively robust under harsh conditions (pH: 1 to pH: 14). 	The result is a sensing barcode which is able to generate a characteristic fingerprint-type colour of response within a single “snapshot” for different pH solutions and vapours. Moreover the pH response can be monitoring continuously and the barcode is reusable at least fifty times without sensitivity withdrawing. ...|$|R

Deposition was found to take place through the photodissociation of adsorbed Gal molecules derived from the thermal decomposition of the triiodide. The reaction system was essentially oxygen-free, as shown by negligible dark deposition rates over the experimental temperature range of 673 - 873 K. The deposition rate was modelled using thermodynamic data in conjunction with the deBoer and B. E. T. adsorption theories.

The possible growth of GaAs by this method was investigated by introducing molecular arsenic or arsenic triiodide into the system. The negligible incorporation of arsenic into the films, even at high arsenic partial pressures, is consistent with the presence of a stable Gal monolayer covering the gallium surface: this layer is taken to inhibit the formation of GaAs.

During the past decades industrial desalination (reverse osmosis (RO) and multistage flash desalination (MSF)) became a viable, economical, and sustainable source of fresh water throughout the world. In the MSF units, the flashing of seawater involves formation of pure vapour, which flows through a wire mesh demister to remove the entrained brine droplets and then condenses into product water.

The aluminum extruded condenser tube used had cooled length 748 mm and 13 parallel channels each with height 1. 38 mm and width 1. 41 mm. The upper and lower outer surfaces were cooled separately by water in counter flow in channels above and below the test tube. The mass flow rates in the two channels were adjusted to be the same. Coolant temperatures were measured at 17 positions along each of the coolant channels as well as at inlet and exit. An accurate direct measurement of the overall inlet-to-outlet coolant temperature difference was also measured directly with a 10 junction thermopile for each of the two coolant streams with junctions downstream of mixers. Temperatures of the condenser tube wall were measured at 10 positions on each of the upper and lower surfaces using embedded thermocouples.

A detailed molecular description of this reaction is needed to understand oxygen-based redox processes. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is a haem-containing redox enzyme capable of catalysing the {{reduction of}} dioxygen to water. We developed instrumentation and experimental methodology to capture and characterise by X-ray crystallography transient reaction intermediates in this reaction. An instrument was designed (“the <b>vapour</b> <b>stream</b> system”) to facilitate reaction initiation, monitoring and intermediate trapping. In combination with single crystal microspectrophotometry, {{it was used to}} obtain conditions for capturing a reactive dioxygen complex in HRP. X-ray studies on oxidised intermediates can be difficult for various reasons. Electrons re-distributed in the sample through the photoelectric effect during X-ray exposure can react with high-valency intermediates. In order to control such side reactions during data collection, we developed a new method based on an angle-resolved spreading of the X-ray dose over many identical crystals. Composite data sets built up from small chunks of data represent crystal structures which received different X-ray doses. As the number of electrons liberated in the crystal is dose dependent, this method allows us to observe and drive redox reactions electron-by-electron in the crystal, using X-rays. The methods developed here were used to obtain a three-dimensional movie on the X-ray-driven reduction of dioxygen to water in HRP. Separate experiments established high resolution crystal structures for all intermediates, showing such structures with confirmed redox states for the first time. Activity of HRP is influenced by small molecule ligands, and we also determined the structures of HRP in complex with formate, acetate and carbon monoxide.

However, the mean velocity of the vapour is undetermined in this approach. We find, however, that by calculating the flux of Boltzmann’s H function, we can exclude high mean velocities, since they correspond to the unphysical destruction of entropy in the evaporation process.

40|$|Separation of {{azeotropic}} mixtures is {{of great}} industrial importance and distillation is the dominating unit operation for such separations. However, the presence of azeotropes and non-idealities in the phase behaviour of such mixtures complicates the separation. In the pharmaceutical and fine/specialty chemical industry, the small-scale production and the requirement for flexibility indicates batch distillation as the best suited process. Among, various techniques to enhance distillation, heterogeneous azeotropic (heteroazeotropic) distillation {{is a very powerful}} and widely used one. Thus, {{there is a need for}} deeper understanding of the complex behaviour of the separation of heteroazeotropic mixtures in batch distillation columns. This thesis is concerned with feasibility and operation aspects of heteroazeotropic distillation in different batch column configurations. Both conventional batch columns (rectifiers) and novel configurations (multivessel columns), with and without vapour bypass, are considered. The focus is on closed operations, without product removal. Batch time requirements for operation in all columns are provided for both zeotropic and heteroazeotropic mixtures. The advantages and drawbacks of each configuration are discussed and compared based on dynamic simulations. The configuration of the <b>vapour</b> <b>stream</b> in the middle vessel has an important effect on the time requirements of the process.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{development}} of an improved electrochemical fuel cell sensor for the detection of low-levels of formaldehyde vapour is described. Current fuel cell sensors used in the commercial Formaldemeter™ instrument lack sensitivity, respond to methanol, and show an interference response to humidity. For the detection and accurate determination of low-level concentrations of formaldehyde an improvement in these characteristics is essential. Two routes were investigated to achieve these requirements. Firstly the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode was replaced with that of a conducting polymer, polyaniline (P ANI). Before construction of the fuel cells the stability and open circuit behaviour of various P ANI films were investigated in order to assay their suitability as a cathode material in a fuel cell application. Based on these results various fuel cells containing P ANI as the cathode were prepared and incorporated into the FormaldemeterTM. The cells were then evaluated using a calibrated <b>vapour</b> <b>stream.</b> Fuel cells containing a Pt-black anode and a P ANI/SOlcoated Pt-black cathode in H 2 S 04 electrolyte displayed a significant improvement in sensitivity, selectivity and a reduced humidity response. In addition a fast response time, excellent reproducibility and a long shelf life was demonstrated. It is proposed that a P ANI film coated on Pt-black behaves as a more stable electron sink for the cathodic reaction instead of the oxygen reduction reaction which is dependent on the diffusion of oxygen. The fast fuel cell response time is explained by the fast switching of PAN I « lOJls). In {{the second part of the}} work, the effect of changing fuel cell catalyst was investigated. Initially, the electrocatalytic activity of various noble metals and alloys electrodeposited on glassy carbon were investigated. Based on these results several fuel cell electrodes were prepared and characterised by SEM and EDAX. Fuel cells were then constructed and their performance evaluated. Cells made up of 50 : 50...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} experiments {{aimed at}} measurement of heat-transfer coefficients for condensation in a multi micro channel tube. Experiments were performed with steam and R 113, fluids chosen {{to cover a}} wide range of thermophysical properties, in particular, surface tension which plays an important role during condensation in small, non-circular channels. The aluminum extruded condenser tube used had cooled length 748 mm and 13 parallel channels each with height 1. 38 mm and width 1. 41 mm. The upper and lower outer surfaces were cooled separately by water in counter flow in channels above and below the test tube. The mass flow rates in the two channels were adjusted to be the same. Coolant temperatures were measured at 17 positions along each of the coolant channels as well as at inlet and exit. An accurate direct measurement of the overall inlet-to-outlet coolant temperature difference was also measured directly with a 10 junction thermopile for each of the two coolant streams with junctions downstream of mixers. Temperatures of the condenser tube wall were measured at 10 positions on each of the upper and lower surfaces using embedded thermocouples. Temperatures and pressures of the vapour were measured in chambers at the inlet and outlet of <b>vapour</b> <b>stream.</b> Pressures were also measured in the condenser channels just upstream and just downstream of the cooled section. Data have been obtained for cases where the vapour was saturated (for both steam and R 113) at inlet. Runs were made for complete and incomplete condensation within the tube. Earlier investigations are critically reviewed and seen to exhibit wide scatter and disagreement. For reasons which will become clear in the thesis, the present results cannot, unfortunately, be claimed to have superior accuracy and generally fall within the ranges of earlier data. A new and innovative test section has been designed and will be used in forthcoming experiments. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{functional}} materials offer unique capabilities hitherto inaccessible using conventional materials. In particular, {{we focus}} on photo-controlled guest binding and release, inherent signalling of status, photo-actuation and solvent driven motion of small structures as examples of the fascinating behaviour of these exceptional materials. We have shown that by integrating the beneficial characteristics of PDMS micro-fluidic devices and spiropyrans dyes, a micro-chip configured as an on-line photonically controlled selfindicating system for metal ion accumulation and release can be realised. Moreover, spiropyran functionalised micro-beads were incorporated into micro-fluidic flow systems, such as capillary separation columns. In addition, photochromic monolithic scaffolds were synthesised within polytetrafluoroethylene coated fused silica capillaries and used as stationary phases in micro-chips to function as photo-controllable electro-osmotic pumps. Novel multifunctional materials based on ionogels, consisting of a polymeric structure incorporating spiropyran units and phosphonium based ionic liquids, {{have been used as}} light-actuated valve structures in micro-fluidic platforms. Through variation of the composition of the ionogels, the micro-valves can be tuned to open at different times under similar illumination conditions. In parallel, the ionogels were soaked in ethanol and then transferred to water, where they moved spontaneously. This movement is driven by the expulsion of the ethanol from the gel and subsequent ethanol spreading at the air-water interface. We have investigated this solvent driven motion for as a driving force for moving small objects in aqueous media. We have also developed an innovative miniaturised system for continuous measurement of the pH of sample solutions and <b>vapour</b> <b>streams</b> during chemical or biological processes. It consists of a simple barcode sensor with several pH dyes doped in an ionogel matrix which is able to generate a characteristic fingerprint-type colour response within a single “snapshot” for different pH solutions and vapours. As the sensor is based on an ionogel polymer, it has extremely long stability, and the sensor dyes show no measureable leaching into aqueous sample solutions. Finally a wearable, robust, flexible and disposable micro-fluidic device which incorporates micro-Light Emitting Diodes (μ-LEDs) as a detection system, for real time monitoring of the pH of sweat generated during an exercise period has been fabricated and assessed. In our approach, the sensors are immobilised within ECG electrodes, as this allows the pH measurements to be gathered without changing the conventional form of ECG monitoring during exercise. This provides immediate feedback regarding sweat composition to an athlete and coach, which can be used to optimise the hydration and performance of the athlete...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2008. The {{performance}} of a WO 3 /SiO 2 catalyst has been investigated for the metathesis of 1 -hexene in an isothermal, gas-phase fixed bed tubular reactor between 420 - 500 °C and at latm. The reactor was fabricated from stainless steel and was placed in an electric tube furnace. The study focused {{on the effect of}} operating conditions (reaction temperature, feed gas composition and space time) on the yield of heavy olefins (C 7 - C 16) and the primary product, decene, using a full factorial experimental design. The objective was to determine the optimum operating conditions for the production of decene. Compositions of condensed liquid and <b>vapour</b> product <b>streams</b> were determined via gas-liquid chromatography. Oxidative and reductive pre-treatments of the catalysts were compared to a conventional pre-treatment under nitrogen in terms of their effect on conversion and product distribution. Experimental tests for the existence of external and internal mass transfer resistances were also conducted. An improved yield of decene was obtained after oxidative pre-treatment of the catalyst. The conversion of l-hexene, selectivity and yield of decene dropped after pre-treatment under hydrogen and nitrogen only. This may be due to over-reduction of the tungsten centres and the formation of an inactive non-stoichiometric surface phase. The best yield of decene obtained from the experimental design was 2. 19 % at 420 °C, 51 % feed composition and 661 g. min. mo 1 - 1. The yield of decene decreased by 0. 11 % when the reaction temperature was raised by 40 °C, and by 0. 17 % when the feed gas composition was raised by 17. 5 % and increased by 0. 21 % when the space time was increased by 223 g. min. mol- 1. The large amount of ethylene and propylene produced as well as the formation of polynuclear aromatics suggest significant cracking of 1 -hexene. For the size range and flow-rates that were employed, the reaction does not suffer from intraparticle and external mass transfer resistance effects. It was concluded that a combination of lower temperature, lower feed gas composition and higher space time should be used to maximize the yield of decene. A final experiment was conducted to test this conclusion. At 380 °C, 55 % feed composition and 2875 g. min. mol- 1, the yield of decene was 12. 80 %, which represented a significant improvement...|$|R
40|$|After {{the laser}} {{was invented in}} 1960, {{it was not long}} until someone started using this {{powerful}} source of light to weld parts together. Laser welding became an industrial application during the 1970 's and the field has developed ever since. In 2008 a new 15 kW fibre laser was installed at Luleå University of Technology, {{and at the same time}} a considerable investment was made in new digital high speed cameras. This combination of equipment enabled research on a new level, and a first step towards a more general understanding of laser welding. This thesis presents the results acquired by analyzing high speed videos of laser welding. Qualitative and quantitative results from these high speed videos have revealed a considerable amount of information about the physics which underlies the laser welding process, including direct measurements of fluid flow within the melt pool and the interpretation of electromagnetic signals which emanate from the welding process. The thesis comprises three papers which are thematically linked by their concentration on the analysis of high speed imaging of the laser welding process. Paper A concerns the quantitative evaluation of high speed imaging of the time-dependent metal <b>vapour</b> jet that <b>streams</b> out of the laser welding vapour capillary. This work has revealed an important correlation. The output of commercially available process monitoring photodiodes (used for detecting infrared radiation) correlates with the fluctuating vapour jet above the weld, instead of, as was previously assumed, with the radiation from the molten and solid surface. In paper B, for the first time, ultra-high speed images of the surface of the laser welding vapour capillary have been obtained, (at a rate of 180 000 frames per second) with good spatial resolution and contrast. In addition, a streak technique was developed that measures and the time-dependent melt flow velocity along a selected line. Wave-like patterns that flow down the capillary have been directly observed. These phenomena are of essential importance for a basic understanding of the laser welding process and are a very powerful support for future research, e. g. for modelling and simulation. Using the above method, the velocity of the flowing vapour capillary waves was quantitatively evaluated in Paper C for varying process parameters, like laser power, focus position or welding speed, revealing clear, important trends of the laser welding process.
