25|$|Highwall mining {{is another}} form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining. In Highwall mining, the coal seam is {{penetrated}} by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes sumping (launch-pushing forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the cutterhead boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam). As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutterhead is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet (6.01 m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutterhead. The Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the coal seam. One patented Highwall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Pushbeam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner's progress. Highwall mining can produce {{thousands of tons of}} coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas (inert) <b>venting</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} used as a target to test the effect of various weapons on capital ships, along with Emperor of India. The tests {{included}} firing destroyer armament at the upper works at close range to test their effectiveness in a simulated night engagement, direct hits from 13.5-inch shells, bomb tests, and experiments with flash tightness in the magazines. The first two tests were conducted in July 1931, and were simulations of magazine explosions. The <b>venting</b> <b>system</b> worked as designed, and while the explosions caused serious internal damage, Marlborough was not destroyed, as the three battlecruisers had been at Jutland. In 1932, further tests were conducted with dummy [...] and [...] bombs to test deck strength; [...] armour-piercing (AP) bombs and [...] high explosive (HE) bombs were then detonated inside the ship to test their effectiveness. The Royal Navy determined that the HE bombs were useless, but that thick deck armour would be required to defeat AP bombs. This led to the decision to reinforce the deck armour of existing battleships throughout the 1930s.|$|E

2500|$|The 747-400ER {{included}} {{the option of}} one or two additional [...] body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by Marshall Aerospace, these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks featured a double wall, integrated <b>venting</b> <b>system,</b> and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo loading system. Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the Boeing 777-200LR and Boeing P-8A Poseidon. Other changes to the 747-400ER include relocation of oxygen system components and the potable water system tanks and pumps since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.|$|E

50|$|Emissions from {{fossil fuel}} fired water heaters are {{expelled}} {{using a variety}} of venting technologies. Atmospheric <b>vented</b> <b>systems</b> use room air as combustion air and exhaust air. The exhaust air is expelled through the exhaust flue by buoyancy forces resulting from the combustion. Power vent models operate similarly to atmospheric <b>vent</b> <b>systems,</b> but an exhaust fan is added to aid in the expulsion of combustion gases. Direct <b>vent</b> <b>systems</b> do not use room air for combustion; instead, buoyancy forces air from the outside through the water heater combustion system and finally exhausts the combustion gases to the outside. Powered direct-vent systems include an exhaust fan to aid in the expulsion of combustion gasses.|$|R

40|$|Soil vapour {{intrusion}} of subsurface {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) into indoor air of buildings is a significant potential concern at existing sites where chemical releases occur, or at new buildings at Brownfield sites with residual chemical impacts. While soil vapour intrusion mitigation systems are increasingly being implemented, there are limited published data on mitigation performance for VOCs particularly for industrial or commercial buildings or high density residential buildings with below ground parking garages. Data gaps include the effectiveness of passive and active <b>venting</b> <b>systems</b> and reduction in vapour intrusion {{that can be achieved}} relative to unmitigated buildings. Because of lack of knowledge and standardization, design practices and post-mitigation monitoring requirements vary widely and are, in some cases, over-conservative. To address these gaps, a comprehensive empirical review of data on the performance of active and passive <b>venting</b> <b>systems</b> and a study using the Modified Johnson and Ettinger Model was completed. The empirical data indicate performance of passive <b>venting</b> <b>systems</b> are variable in terms of venting air flow rates and pressures. The results of modelling for passive venting indicate a wide range of predicted reduction factors, defined as the vapour attenuation factor for a baseline unmitigated building divided by the attenuation factor for the mitigated case. Because of the potential for depressurized buildings and/or reverse vent stack effect, for passive <b>venting</b> <b>systems</b> a continuous leak free barrier that reduces the potential for soil gas diffusion and advection is essential. The performance of active <b>venting</b> <b>systems</b> can be more readily controlled and quantified based on design principles as supported by the results of modelling, which indicated higher reduction factors than for passive <b>venting</b> <b>systems.</b> For both passive and active <b>venting</b> <b>systems,</b> improved efficiency in venting can be achieved through aerated subfloors. A monitoring framework that is robust but efficient and sustainable is presented that incorporates the concept of a concentration exceedance factor and the type of mitigation system...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} <b>vent</b> <b>system</b> for a cryogenic nitrogen {{tank was}} {{tested in a}} vacuum chamber simulating oxygen storage in low earth orbit. The nitrogen tank {{was surrounded by a}} cryo-shroud at - 40 F. The tank was insulated with two layers of multi-layer insulation. Heat transfer into cryogenic tanks causes phase change and increases tank pressure which must be controlled. A thermodynamic <b>vent</b> <b>system</b> was used to control pressure as the location of vapor is unknown in low gravity and direct venting would be wasteful. The thermodynamic <b>vent</b> <b>system</b> consists of a Joule-Thomson valve and heat exchanger installed on the inlet side of the tank mixer-pump. The combination is used to extract thermal energy from the tank fluid, reducing temperature and ullage pressure. The system was sized so that the tank mixer-pump operated {{a small fraction of the}} time to limit motor heating. Initially the mixer used sub-cooled liquid to cool the liquid-vapor interface inducing condensation and pressure reduction. Later, the thermodynamic <b>vent</b> <b>system</b> was used. Pressure cycles were performed until steady-state operation was demonstrated. Three test runs were conducted at tank fills of 97, 80, and 63 percent. Each test was begun with a boil-off test to determine heat transfer into the tank. The lower tank fills had time averaged vent rates very close to steady-state boil-off rates showing the thermodynamic <b>vent</b> <b>system</b> was nearly as efficient as direct venting in normal gravity...|$|R
