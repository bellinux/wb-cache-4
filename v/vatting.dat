40|$|In textile {{chemical}} processing industries vat dye {{is one of}} the important dyes for coloration of cotton, when high fastness properties are required. But, vat dye has the problem of insolubility in water. Hence, the process of <b>vatting</b> is needed to reduce and solubilize the dye in water. Vat dye is normally dissolved in water using sodium hydrosulphite (hydrose) as reducing agent and sodium hydroxide as solubilising agent suitable for dyeing. In this work, an attempt is made to reduce the vat dye using ferrous sulphate (2 % owm) and its combination with hydrose as ferrous sulphate (1. 5 % owm) +hydrose (0. 5 % owm) and ferrous sulphate (1 %owm) + hydrose (1 %owm). The effect of ferrous sulphate as reducing agent and its combination with hydrose is compared with the conventional reducing agent (hydrose).

Written evidence as well as numismatic and archaeological sources dating from the 5 th century BC to the 5 th century AD have been analysed in this context to identify purpura rubra Tarentina. In addition, the results of a series of dye experiments with hypobranchial glands from the same species are treated in order to detect chromatic properties and potential manufacturing processes for Tarentine Red. The methods for <b>vatting</b> the dye glands are discussed in relation to historical validity and chromatic outcome. To conclude, comparisons are drawn between the colour characteristics of Bolinus brandaris and Hexaplex trunculus (banded dye-murex), and the possibility of mixing both dyes is taken into consideration. The synthesis of historical and experimental approach finally shows that purpura rubra Tarentina can potentially be identified with purple dye extracted from Bolinus brandaris...|$|E
40|$|Mei (Ume, Japanese apricot) is one {{of famous}} special {{agricultural}} produce in Nanto County due to available for improving function of liver, adjusting gastroenteric disorder including stomachache, diarrhea and food poisoning, recovering bodily fatigue, and even culturing beauty. Inyu, a traditionally fermented food product in Taiwan, is made from black bean through soaking, steam cooking, fungus inoculating, koji-making by traditionally artificial method, koji-washing, incubating, salt adding, vating, and outdoor fermenting. Though Inyu has special properties in flavors and qualities, its market share is lower than soy sauce made from soybean with wheat by automatic koji-making method due to limitation in production scale and labor cost. In this study, the Mei-juice from brined Mei and Inyu from brewing were combined {{to make a new}} product Mei-Inyu. The processing quality and market acceptability of the product were investigated. Probability of fermentation by mixing Mei-juice and black bean koji were also evaluated. Results obtained were as follows. 1. Mei-juice was made from fresh mature Mei through sorting, washing, leaching, and brined with 25 % NaCl for three months. Total solids, acidity, pH, salt content, and amino nitrogen of the juice were 29 OBrix, 5 %, 1. 5 - 1. 8, 18 - 22 %, and 8 - 11 mg/ 100 g, respectively. The juice was an excellent material instead of brine for <b>vatting</b> of Inyu or mixing directly with it. 2. Inyu was made from black bean through the processes of soaking, steam cooking, koji making and <b>vatting.</b> Browning was increase during aging for 90 days. Salt content, pH, total nitrogen and amino nitrogen of the raw Inyu directly pressed were 11 - 13 %, 4 - 5, 1. 85 g/mL, and 0. 73 mg/mL, respectively. The quality levels were higher than CNS, the Inyu should be refrigerated due to low salt content. 3. Mei-juice and Inyu were mixed in same proportion. After addition of water to adjust salt concentration, the mixture was boiling with various condiments. Mei-Inyu with total solids 22 - 24 Brix, acidity 1. 6 - 1. 9 %, salt 9 - 10 % was obtained through cooling, sedimentation, filtration, filling, sealing, and pasteurization. Compared to market soy sauce, consumers were fond of Mei-Inyu due to health figure with low salt content and special flavor. 4. Though directly <b>vatting</b> and brewing Mei-liquid with black bean koji was a good model for obtaining perfect Mei-Inyu product, proteins were not well hydrolyzed during fermentation due to high acidity. Further study was needed to improve the efficiency. 梅子為南投縣特色農產品之一，具有增進肝功能，有效抵抗腸胃失調、胃痛、下痢、食物中毒等症狀，以及恢復疲勞、養顏美容等功效。蔭油則是台灣傳統發酵食品，以黑豆為原料，經浸漬、蒸煮、植菌、製麴、洗麴、保溫、加鹽、下缸製醪、戶外發酵後調和製成，雖然蔭油有特殊口味和性質，但囿於產量和成本限制下，生產量及普及度都較黃豆和小麥經自動化製麴而製成之黃豆醬油為低。本研究結合兩製品之特性，將梅子鹽漬加工所得之汁液，配合以黑豆純釀蔭油調合成梅子蔭油，分析其品質與市場接受性，同時評估梅汁與黑豆麴混合發酵之可能性。所得結果如下。 1. 成熟鮮梅經選別、清洗、瀝乾後，加 25 % 鹽漬三個月，取除梅粒即得梅原汁。此原汁經分析總固形物約 29 OBrix，酸度約 5 %，pH 1. 5 - 1. 8 ，鹽分 18 - 22 %，胺基態氮 8 - 11 mg/ 100 g，為取代鹽水進行蔭油下缸製醪或直接混合調味的良好原料。 2. 黑豆經浸漬、蒸熟、接菌製麴後，下缸製醪，釀造熟成 90 天期間褐變率逐漸增高，壓搾所得生蔭油之鹽分 11 - 13 %，pH 4 - 5 ，總氮量及胺基態氮為 1. 85 g/mL 及 0. 73 g/mL，高於中國家標準，唯因鹽度低，生油需冷藏以防止變敗。 3. 梅原汁與生蔭油以等比例混合，加水調整鹽度後加熱熬煮，熬煮期間並以各種添加物調整風味。煮液經冷卻、沉降、過濾、充填、密封、殺菌即得成品。梅蔭油成品之總固形分 22 - 24 OBrix，酸度 1. 6 - 1. 9 %，鹽度 9 - 10 %。與市售醬油相較，梅子蔭油在感官品評具特殊風味，加上酸度之提高降低食鹽之濃度，以低鹽製品及梅風形象而具相當高之市場接受性。 4. 將鹽漬梅汁與黑豆麴混合下缸製醪雖為良好的純釀造模式，卻因梅原汁的酸度太高，影響黑豆蛋白質之分解速率，需進一步研究改善之。目錄 中文摘要．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 英文摘要．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 圖表索引．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 壹、前言．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 1 一、研究動機及目的．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 1 二、文獻整理．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 3 (一) 醬油之簡介．．．．．．． ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 3 1. 醬油之歷史．．．．．．．．．．．．．． ．．．．．．．．． 3 2. 醬油之種類．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 4 (1) 中國式醬油．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． ．．．．．． 4 (2) 日本式醬油．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 8 (二) 蔭油之釀造．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． ．． 10 1. 主要原料．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 10 (1) 黑豆．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 10 (2) 食鹽．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 10 (3) 水．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 11 2. 原料處理．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 11 (1) 黑豆洗滌及浸水．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 11 (2) 蒸煮．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 11 3. 製麴．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 12 (1) 製麴之酵素．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 13 (2) 製麴與酵素活性之關係．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 16 (3) 麴菌．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． ．．．．．．．． 17 4. 洗麴．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 17 5. 保溫．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 17 6. 下缸方式及醬醪發酵熟成．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 18 (1) 食鹽濃度．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 18 (2) 下缸濃度．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 18 (3) 攪拌．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 19 (4) 醬醪中之微生物．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 19 7. 壓榨．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 21 8. 調和與加熱．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 22 (1) 沉澱物前趨物之去除．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 22 (2) 降低加熱後沉澱之產生．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 23 (三) 梅子之簡介．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 32 貳、材料與方法．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 37 一、實驗材料．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 37 二、實驗試藥．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 37 1. 基本成分分析試藥．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 37 2. 酵素感受性及酵素活性測定試藥．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 37 3. 胺基態氮測定試藥．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 38 三、實驗流程設計．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 38 四、實驗方法．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 41 (一) 原料之基本成分分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 41 1. 水分．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 41 2. 灰分．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 41 3. 粗脂質．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 41 4. 粗蛋白．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 42 5. pH值之測定．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 42 (二) 組織硬度之測定．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 42 (三) 酵素感受性 (Enzyme susceptibility, ES) ．．．．．．．．．． 43 1. 蒸煮黑豆對蛋白酶之感受性．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 43 2. 蒸煮黑豆對液化澱粉酶(α-amylase) 及糖化澱粉酶(β-amylase) 之感受性．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 43 (四) 酵素活性之測定．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 45 1. 粗酵素液之製備．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 45 2. 澱粉酶活性之測定．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 45 3. 蛋白酶活性之測定．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 48 (五) 梅子醬油之分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 50 1. 黑豆麴pH值之測定．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 50 2. 總氮之測定．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 50 3. 甲醛態氮 (formalin-nitrogen) ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 50 4. 氨態氮．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 51 5. 胺基態氮(amino-nitrogen) 之測定．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 51 6. 酸度之測定．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 51 7. 褐變程度（degree of browning）之測定．．．．．．．．．．． 52 8. 鹽濃度之測定．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 52 9. 嗜好性品評．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 54 10. 統計分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 56 參、結果與討論．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 57 一、生蔭油的釀造與熟成．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 57 1. 生蔭油釀造過程．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 57 2. 黑豆之成分分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 57 3. 蒸煮後黑豆之硬度分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 57 4. 製麴後酵素之活性分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 57 5. 釀造期間蔭油之pH變化．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 58 6. 釀造期間蔭油之酸度變化．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 67 7. 釀造期間生蔭油之總氮變化．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 67 8. 釀造期間生蔭油之胺基態氮變化．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 67 9. 釀造期間生蔭油之色度（L, a, b）值變化．．．．．．．．．． 68 10. 釀造期間生蔭油之酒精變化．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 69 11. 釀造期間生蔭油褐變程度之變化．．．．．．．．．．．．． 69 二、梅子蔭油之製成與品質分析．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 77 1. 梅汁與蔭油原料之品質．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 77 2. 純釀梅子蔭油及不同混合比例梅子蔭油之pH值和酸度．．．． 77 3. 純釀梅子蔭油及不同混合比例梅子蔭油之色澤．．．．．．．． 78 4. 成品與市售蔭油膏之比較．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 85 三、感官品評分析試驗．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 94 肆、結論．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 96 伍、參考文獻．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 9...|$|E

40|$|Under {{the current}} <b>VAT</b> system {{defined in the}} Sixth <b>VAT</b> Directive, Member States are {{required}} to have a single <b>VAT</b> rate of at least 15 % and may have a maximum of two reduced <b>VAT</b> rates set no lower than 5 %. Annex H of the 6 Directive outlines {{the list of the}} goods and services to which reduced rates could apply. However, this basic structure which applies to all Member States is complicated by the numerous individual temporary derogations granted to particular Member States. Most of these specific rates (zero rate, super reduced rates, parking rate and so on) are to be found under the title XVI Transitional provisions Article 28 of the 6 Directive and most have been granted until the entry into force of the "definitive system" of <b>VAT</b> based on taxation in the Member State of origin. The aim {{of this paper is to}} shed some light on the application of the current <b>VAT</b> system to both <b>VAT</b> bases and rates among Member States. For the <b>VAT</b> bases, our indicators demonstrate the share of the base to which a specific <b>VAT</b> rate applies relative to the whole taxable base. For the <b>VAT</b> rates, focusing on the statutory standard <b>VAT</b> rate is not satisfactory. To take into account the existence of different <b>VAT</b> rates, we compute implicit <b>VAT</b> rates. These implicit <b>VAT</b> rates give an indication on the <b>VAT</b> burden. Our analysis shows that the standard <b>VAT</b> rate is far from applicable to the whole taxable base. In the year 2000, on average for the EU- 15, 69 % of the <b>VAT</b> taxable transactions value was taxed at the standard <b>VAT</b> rate. Moreover for some Member States, only around half of the taxable transactions were actually taxed at the standard <b>VAT</b> rate. Therefore, non-standard <b>VAT</b> rates are not the exception as they should be. Taking into account all <b>VAT</b> rates in force gives us an implicit <b>VAT</b> rate that is up to 30 % lower than the standard rate in force in the Member States. In the year 2000, the EU- 15 average for the statutory standard <b>VAT</b> rate was 19. 4 % with a minimum (compulsory) of 15 % and a maximum of 25 %.

40|$|The Value Added Tax (<b>VAT)</b> {{is one of}} the key {{resources}} within {{tax collection}} and therefore <b>VAT</b> effectiveness and <b>VAT</b> complexity represent one of the current world topics. Standard rates of <b>VAT</b> may and may not be the simple key to define whether <b>VAT</b> is important in the tax mix or not. This paper focuses on the question whether the amount of the <b>VAT</b> rate has an impact on the share of <b>VAT</b> in the tax mix. The <b>VAT</b> share on total taxes is studied in connection of average and median standard rates applied so as to answer the question: “Do the countries with higher share of <b>VAT</b> in the tax mix set its standard rates of <b>VAT</b> beyond the average of EU 27 ?” The paper examines this issue using data EU member countries, especially EU 27, in years 1995 – 2010...|$|R

It estimates a Laffer curve {{for the standard}} rate of <b>VAT</b> using a pooled sample of data of revenue statistics for 14 countries in the EU. The results confirm that {{the efficiency of the}} <b>VAT</b> system declines as the <b>VAT</b> rate increases. The decline in efficiency is due to a mixture of a reduction in the <b>VAT</b> base, and <b>VAT</b> evasion and avoidance. As a result of the single market, the EU Commission has proposed a common or closely converged rate of <b>VAT</b> within Europe. The actual common rate of <b>VAT</b> has yet to be decided. This paper contributes to this policy debate. ...|$|R

The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan proved too expensive for <b>VAT.</b> This may have led the major owners of <b>VAT</b> to start discussions about merging <b>VAT</b> and SAT. The chairman of <b>VAT</b> held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in <b>VAT</b> and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was interested in co-operation with, or acquisition of, <b>VAT.</b> Valmet is also rumoured to {{have been interested in}} <b>VAT</b> but {{there is no evidence of}} concrete negotiations.|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} and practical advantages of the <b>VAT</b> have led to its adoption {{in some form or}} another by most countries and by many hundreds of subnational administrations worldwide. However, nowhere is <b>VAT</b> found without exemptions. Exemptions are arguably the most controversial feature of <b>VAT</b> regimes. They constitute exceptions to the principle of <b>VAT</b> as a tax on consumption, undermine its fundamental logic, and compromise its efficiency and neutrality. In traditional <b>VAT</b> systems, like those in place in European countries, exemptions constitute a sizable portion of the potential tax base. Historical factors that led to the adoption of multiple exemptions in the traditional European <b>VAT</b> model were not present in most jurisdictions outside the EU and adopters of a modern <b>VAT</b> model were able to avoid these features of the traditional <b>VAT,</b> for the most part substantially limiting the number of exemptions. However, whilst the modern <b>VAT</b> model undoubtedly constitutes an improvement on the traditional <b>VAT</b> model, there is a clear realisation that modern <b>VATs</b> are not a complete panacea. Existing exemptions under modern <b>VATs</b> can still impose significant economic and administrative costs. Against this background, this paper questions the current existence of <b>VAT</b> exemptions. Are <b>VAT</b> exemptions desirable and/or unavoidable, or are alternative legal designs possible and/or necessary? And if alternative designs are available and required, which of these represents the best solution to doing away with exemptions? Thirty years since the first appearance of modern <b>VATs</b> on the world stage, this paper argues {{that it is time to}} consider a progression in tax design and move towards a post-modern <b>VAT...</b>|$|R
