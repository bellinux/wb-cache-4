25|$|When created {{prior to}} 1895, Acme screw threads were {{intended}} to replace square threads {{and a variety of}} threads of other forms used chiefly for the purpose of traversing on machines, tools, etc. Acme screw threads are now extensively used for a variety of purposes. Long-length Acme threads are used for controlled movements on machine tools, testing machines, jacks, aircraft flaps, and conveyors. Short-length threads are used on <b>valve</b> <b>stems,</b> hose connectors, bonnets on pressure cylinders, steering mechanisms, and camera lens movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{agent is}} emptied and {{depressurized}} and the valve is removed. After a thorough {{internal and external}} visual inspection, the cylinder is filled with water, placed inside a safety cage, and pressurized to the specified test pressure (varies with the type, age, and cylinder material) for the specified time period. If no failure, bulges, or leaks are detected, the cylinder passes. The cylinder is then emptied of water and thoroughly dried, and labeled with the test date and company that performed the test. CO2 types have the test information stamped on the cylinder, all other types get a sticker {{on the back of}} the cylinder. Once dry, the units are recharged. Unlike the UK, the US does not rebuild extinguishers and replace valves at specific intervals unless parts are found to be defective, with the exception of halon. Halon types are often given new o-rings and <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> at every internal maintenance to minimize any leakage potential.|$|E
40|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>stem</b> {{seal leakage}} {{is a major}} source of {{fugitive}} emissions, and controlling these emissions can result in added expense in leak detection and repair programs. Elastomeric O-rings can be used as <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> seals, and O-ring manufacturers recommend lubrication of elastomeric seals to prevent damage and to assure proper sealing. In this research, a metallic coating was applied as a lubricant using a vacuum vapor deposition process to the surface of elastomeric <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> seals. <b>Valve</b> <b>stem</b> leak measurements were taken to determine if the coated O-rings, alone or with the recommended lubrication, reduced <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> seal leakage.

500|$|Later {{production}} R engines featured sodium-filled exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> {{for improved}} cooling, while additional modifications included a redesigned lower crankcase casting {{and the introduction}} of an oil scraper ring below the piston gudgeon pin; a measure that was carried over to the Merlin engine. A balanced crankshaft was introduced in May 1931, and the compression ratio on the [...] "sprint" [...] engines prepared for that year was raised from 6:1 to 7:1.|$|E
500|$|Liquid sodium {{is used as}} a heat {{transfer}} fluid in some types of nuclear reactors because it has the high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section required to achieve a high neutron flux in the reactor. The high boiling point of sodium allows the reactor to operate at ambient (normal) pressure, but the drawbacks include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its explosive properties. Radioactive sodium-24 may be produced by neutron bombardment during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard; the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be shut down frequently, NaK is used; because NaK is a liquid at room temperature, the coolant does not solidify in the pipes. In this case, the pyrophoricity of potassium requires extra precautions to prevent and detect leaks. [...] Another {{heat transfer}} application is poppet valves in high-performance internal combustion engines; the <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> are partially filled with sodium and work as a heat pipe to cool the valves.|$|E
2500|$|The {{enactment}} of the CPSIA banned the sale of youth motorcycles and ATVs because of the lead content of battery terminals and tire <b>valve</b> <b>stems.</b> [...] The law has a provision for exceptions {{to be made by}} the CPSC, but it has not done so for these products as of March 2009. [...] The ban has left many motorsports retailers with unsalable products, and motorcycle industry leaders suggest that the ban may cost the US economy $1 billion. [...] However, on 08/12/11, an amendment was signed by President Obama, which exempts youth ATVs and motorcycles from the CPSIA.|$|E

50|$|Inexpensive engines {{may have}} valve seats that are simply {{cut into the}} {{material}} of the cylinder head or engine block (depending {{on the design of}} the engine). Some newer engines have seats that are sprayed on rather than being pressed into the head, allowing them to be thinner, creating more efficient transfer of heat through the valve seats, and enabling the <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> to function at a lower temperature, thus allowing the <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> (and other parts of the valvetrain) to be thinner and lighter.|$|E
50|$|Valve burn (overheating) {{is another}} problem. It causes {{excessive}} valve wear and defective sealing, {{as well as}} engine knocking (the hot valve causes the fuel to prematurely ignite). It can be solved by valve cooling systems that use water or oil as a coolant. In high performance or turbo charged engines sometimes sodium filled <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> are used. These <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> then act as a heat pipe. A major cause of burnt valves {{is a lack of}} valve clearance at the tappet; the valve cannot completely close. This reduces its ability to conduct heat to the cylinder head via the seat, and may allow hot combustion gases to flow between the valve and its seat. Burnt valves will cause a low compression in the affected cylinder and loss of power.|$|E
50|$|The hemi head {{always has}} {{intake and exhaust}} <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> that point in {{different}} directions, requiring a large, wide cylinder head and complex rocker arm geometry in both cam-in-block and overhead cam engines.

50|$|For {{motorcycle}} tires, {{a device}} {{similar to the}} internal beadlock of 4-wheel drive vehicles can be used. A special inner tube is inflated via its own <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> to high pressure to push the bead of the tire tight against the wheel. Like the rim lock, this clamps both beads at once. The regular <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is used to inflate the tire to the desired pressure.|$|R

5000|$|Another engine, {{supposedly}} {{based upon}} the Cosworth BDA and YB series engines, weighed 168 lb, half the weight of its metal counterpart.

50|$|If the {{camshaft}} {{is located in}} the crankcase, a valve train of pushrods and rocker arms will be required to operate overhead valves. Mechanically simpler are side valves, where the <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> rested directly on {{the camshaft}}. However, this gives poor gas flows within the cylinder head as well as heat problems and fell out of favor for automobile use, see flathead engine.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} forming a carbon {{composite}} valve for internal combustion engines is discussed. The process includes {{the steps of}} braiding carbon fiber into a rope thereby forming a cylindrically shaped <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> portion and continuing to braid said fiber while introducing into the braiding carbon fiber rope a carbon matrix plug having an outer surface in a net shape of a valve head thereby forming a valve head portion. The said carbon matrix plug acting as a mandrel over which said carbon fiber rope is braided, said carbon fiber rope and carbon matrix plug forming a valve head portion suitable for mating with a valve seat; cutting said braided carbon <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> portion at one end to form a valve tip and cutting said braided carbon fiber after said valve head portion to form a valve face and thus provide a composite valve preform; and densifying said preform by embedding the braided carbon in a matrix of carbon to convert said <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> portion to a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> and said <b>valve</b> head portion to a valve head thereby providing said composite valve...|$|R

The {{finite element}} model of {{electric}} stop valve with flange bolts preload and <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> force was established to improve the valve stress calculation method which was based only on action of fluid pressure, thermal stresses and pipe reaction forces. The principle and application of pretension load elements were expounded. By ANSYS, the stresses of this valve with preload and <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> force were calculated, and the Mises equivalent stresses contour and some values of key position of whole valve were obtained. The results indicate {{the influence of the}} stresses on the valve caused by preload of bolt mounted on the flange and <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> force can not be ignored...|$|R
5000|$|For example, the [...] "Regina Valve" [...] is a valve {{very much}} {{similar to the}} Presta and mostly being used in Italy. Invisible tire valves are {{different}} in design from traditional tire <b>valves.</b> An inflator <b>stem</b> is not used; instead, a removable cap on a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> embedded in the tire rim is fitted, with only the cap visible. When inflating the tire, the cap is first removed, typically with a coin, and then a [...] "portable" [...] dedicated inflator stem is screwed onto the <b>valve</b> <b>stem.</b> Through the inflator the tire is inflated as usual.|$|R
50|$|The two DOHC, 16-valve heads {{incorporate}} a fuel-efficient, low-emission design, with a 'tumble swirl air' motion {{created by a}} specially shaped intake port and increased valve angle and lift. The belt-driven camshafts act directly on hollow <b>valve</b> <b>stems.</b> Intake valves are hollow (reducing their mass from 51.6 to 48.4 grams) and the exhaust valves (46.7 versus 50.5 grams) are sodium-filled for more efficient heat transfer.|$|E
50|$|On June 27 1962 {{a larger}} Twin Cam {{appeared}} in the just-released Giulia. The obvious change was that displacement was increased to 1567 cc, but the engine was also now being produced using a different casting method. The diameter of the <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> had been increased by 1 mm to 9 mm, the bore centre spacing was different, the timing chain longer and the crank had been revised, among other changes.|$|E
50|$|The {{valve stem}} is a tube made of metal or rubber, {{through which the}} tire is inflated, with a check valve, {{typically}} a Schrader valve on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles. <b>Valve</b> <b>stems</b> usually protrude through the wheel for easy access. They mount directly to the rim, {{in the case of}} tubeless tires, or {{are an integral part of}} the inner tube. The rubber in <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> eventually degrades, and, in the case of tubeless tires, replacement of the valve stem at regular intervals or with tire replacement reduces the chance of failure. Some may notice that their valve stem is all metal with a nut retaining it (as opposed to the typical rubber stem with brass threads). Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a valve stem attached to an electronic module. The module is hidden inside and is only visible when the tire has been removed from the wheel.|$|E

50|$|The '3E' and '3E-E' {{engines are}} {{considered}} slightly less reliable than other Toyota engines, {{although they are}} also among the easiest engines to service.

Any of these conditions can lead to rough idling, stalling, and fouled spark plugs, and therefore need to be differentially diagnosed.
