40|$|Surface {{fermentation}} by Acetobacter pasteurianus, {{the traditional}} batch system of <b>vinegar</b> <b>making</b> in Japan, produces vinegar with better flavor but less in productivity than sumberged fermentation. For enhancing the productivity in surface fermentation, continuous fermentation system {{was conducted by}} changing initial acidity and alcohol concentrations, and depth of fermentation broth. The highest productivity was achieved with the depth of broth of 10 cm, initial acidity 2 % to 3 %, and initial alcohol concentrations 2. 5 % to 3. 5 %. Continuous surface fermentation under the optimum conditions was conducted for 80 days, and it showed almost 4. 5 % of the final acidity with 2 time higher productivity {{than that of the}} traditional batch fermentation system. The flavor of the vinegar produced by this method was better than those produced by both batch surface and submerged fermentations.

40|$|Background: Vinegars {{based on}} fruit juices could {{conserve}} {{part of the}} health-associated compounds present in the fruits. However, in general very limited knowledge exists on the consequences of vinegar-making on different antioxidant compounds from fruit. In this study vinegars derived from apple and grape are studied. Methods: A number of steps, starting from the fermentation of the fruit juices {{to the formation of}} the final vinegars, were studied from an industrial vinegar process. The effect of each of the vinegar processing steps on content of antioxidants, phenolic compounds and flavonoids was studied, by spectroscopic methods and by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: The major observation was that spectrophotometric methods indicate a strong loss of antioxidant phenolic compounds during the transition from fruit wine to fruit vinegar. A targeted HPLC analysis indicates that metabolites such as gallic acid are lost in later stages of the vinegar process. Conclusion: The major conclusion of this work is that major changes occur in phenolic compounds during <b>vinegar</b> <b>making.</b> An untargeted metabolite analysis should be used to reveal these changes in more detail. In addition, the effect of vinegar processing on bio-accessibility of phenolic compounds was investigated by mimicking the digestive tract in an in vitro set up. This study is meant to provide insight into the potential of vinegar as a source of health-related compounds from fruit. </p...|$|E
40|$|Vinegar is an {{important}} by-product on many Iowa farms, utilizing a considerable part of the apple crop which would otherwise be wasted by spoiling, often on account of difficulty in marketing. The apple crop of Iowa amounts to between three and four million dollars per year and a more efficient home production of vinegar from culls and windfalls {{would result in a}} large saving. Many inquiries are received by the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station regarding difficulties or failure in <b>vinegar</b> <b>making.</b> In many cases the vinegar never reaches the legal standard of strength for marketable vinegar, which is 4 percent of acetic acid. This is gene rally due to contamination of the fermenting vinegar with bacteria or other micro-organisms which cause what are called 2 ̆ 2 foreign” or unfavorable fermentations, thus changing the sugars to something else than the acetic acid which is desired. These contaminating bacteria also sometimes impart an unfavorable or disagreeable flavor to the vinegar, as well as preventing the development of the proper amount of acidity, which is necessary for proper preservation as well as to meet the legal standard if the vinegar is to be offered for sale. In a few cases the low acidity produced is due to the use of apples too low in sugar content, or to dilution of the cider with water. The cause and prevention of these difficulties is to be discussed in this bulletin...|$|E

25|$|The penanggalan {{is another}} type of female vampire {{attracted}} to the blood of newborn infants, which appears {{as the head of}} a woman from which her entrails trail, used to grasp her victim. There are several stories of her origins. One is that she was a woman who was sitting meditating in a large wooden vat used for <b>making</b> <b>vinegar</b> when she was so startled that her head jumped up from her body, pulling her entrails with it. Another has her as a normal woman during the day, whose head and entrails leave her body at night. If a baby is expected, branches from a type of thistle are placed around the doors or windows to protect the house, since her entrails will be caught by the thorns. The penanggalan is known in Thai as krasue and a similar Philippine ghost called the manananggal which preys on pregnant women with an elongated proboscis-like tongue.|$|R
5000|$|Pyrolysis or thermal {{decomposition}} of wood {{in a low}} oxygen manner originated prehistorically to produce charcoal. Condensates of the vapors eventually were made and found useful as preservatives. The term wood vinegar for centuries was the popular term {{used to describe the}} water based condensates of wood smoke. Presumably, this is due to its utilization as food vinegar. Pliny the Elder recorded in one of his ten volumes of Natural History the use of wood vinegar as an embalming agent, declaring it superior to other treatments he used. Widely recognized as the father of chemical engineering, another naturalist documentarian Johann Rudolf Glauber outlined in Furni Novi Philosophici [...] the methods to produce wood <b>vinegar</b> during charcoal <b>making.</b> Further, he described the use of the water insoluble tar fraction as a wood preservative and documented the freezing of the wood vinegar to concentrate it. Use of the French derivation, pyroligneous acid as a widely used term for wood vinegar emerged by 1788.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Citrus fruits are {{significant}} sources of bioactive compounds, such as ascorbic acid, polyphenols and carotenoids, {{due to their}} antioxidant properties important for human nutrition. In addition, since oranges possess high sugar content (8 - 15 %), <b>making</b> <b>vinegars</b> from alcoholic orange substrates, with functional characteristics is a possible development of novel products. The aim of this research work was to analyze changes in ascorbic acid, total phenolics, total carotenoids and antioxidant activity during orange vinegar processing. In order to analyze the influence of acetification and aging in these characteristics, samples were taken in three stages: orange alcoholic substrate for acetification (SNA), young orange vinegar or recently obtained (Vn 0) and orange vinegar after six month-aging in bottles (Vn 6). Statistically significant differences (p < 0. 05) were found among bioactive compounds concentrations; antioxidant activity decreased along the process, but total phenolics and carotenoids remained constant during aging period (Vn 0 -Vn 6). The highest reduction was recorded during the acetification stage, possibly due to components oxidation caused by continuous air flow to the system. A higher contribution (p < 0. 05) to antioxidant activity was associated to ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds concentration...|$|R

On 4 August 1638, on consideration of a petition to government presented in March previous, Sir Theodore de Mayerne, Cademan, and others distillers of spirits and makers of vinegar in London, were incorporated as [...] "Distillers of London". Cademan and Mayerne were asked to set up rules of the corporation. The Company of Apothecaries petitioned against it in September as infringing their monopoly. To this petition Mayerne, Brouncker, and Cademan replied, and the undertaking was allowed to proceed, and in 1638 was published The Distiller of London, compiled and set forth by the special Licence and Command of the King's most Excellent Majesty for the sole use of the Company of Distillers of London, and by them to bee duly observed and practiced.

50|$|Qu is also {{mentioned}} in the Zhouli (circa 150 BC), a collection of texts from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, where it is described for usage in preparing fermented meat and a type of grain-meat paste (Jujiang). At the Mawangdui (200 BC to 10 AD), bamboo strips found in Han Tomb Number 1 document an inventory of tomb furnishings and list two sacks of Qu {{as part of the}} tombs contents. The Liji (100 AD), a collection of texts from the Eastern Han Dynasty, mentions Qu as one of the six requisites to make good wine. Another almanac from the Eastern Han Dynasty, the Shuowen Jiezi (121 AD), records a character for Qu modified to include the yellow Chrysanthemum flower. This has been interpreted as referring to the distinctive yellow colour formed on Qu by sporulating molds. The Shiming (151 AD) goes further to indicate several types of Qu, which are interpreted as being distinguished by the source of the starch and the form of the substrate. Importantly it reveals that since the Han Dynasty Qu was being produced in China from mostly wheat or barley and being pressed into cakes or bricks for handling. The earliest reference to actual preparation of Qu appears in the Qimin Yaoshu (544 AD) of the Northern Wei Dynasty. Here the techniques employed for making 9 separate kinds of Qu Nieh are described in detail, as are their usage in the manufacture of 37 different wines. The usage of Qu in <b>making</b> <b>vinegar,</b> soy pastes and soy sauces is also documented. With the release of the Qing Yilu (965 AD), the use of a special Hong Qu (Red Ferment) is recorded for the first time.|$|R

The problematic cases presented here seek to underline the need for an efficient diachronic analysis of the various Latin and Palaeo-Romance layers in Albanian, in order to explain with a certain clarity the different and sometimes confusing phonological results in this language. The fundamental idea is that of different linguistic areas that, in different periods, borrowed foreign words that continued to evolve in their source languages...|$|R
