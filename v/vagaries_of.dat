5|$|Stories of the Sea Mither and Teran {{are among}} Orkney's oldest legends, perhaps invented {{to explain the}} <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> weather and other {{naturally}} occurring events. In Shetland fishermen petition Sea Mither to afford them protection from the Devil.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Keating was {{stationed}} in the U.S., sometimes at Banana Creek in Florida, and flew Hellcats to armed services swimming meets. He narrowly escaped serious injury one night at Naval Air Station Vero Beach when he neglected to lower the landing gear on his Hellcat and wrecked the plane in an unexpected belly landing. Due to additional training on new intercept methods and the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> squadron transfers, the war ended before he would be deployed to any combat theater.|$|E

6000|$|... "A <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> nature, wherein she has {{displayed}} less of her infinite wisdom than is usual. Could rotary levers {{be substituted}} {{for two of the}} limbs, agreeably to the improvement in my new order of phalangacrura, which might be rendered into the vernacular as lever-legged, there would be a delightful perfection and harmony in the construction. But, as the quadruped is now formed, I call it a mere <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> nature; no other than a vagary." ...|$|R

5|$|The community's Finns {{organized}} a temperance society {{and built the}} Finnish Temperance Hall. The community also included a band, a volunteer fire department, tennis courts and a clubhouse for employees. A small Methodist church and Presbyterian church were built. The town also had a night watchman and later a full-time patrolman. Always noted as a quiet, orderly town, Elcor managed to avoid the social <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> adjacent communities, like Gilbert's red-light district.|$|E
5|$|Kenney {{informed}} Whitehead of {{the proposed}} convoy date, and warned him about the usual Japanese pre-convoy air attack. He also urged that flying hours be cut back so as {{to allow for a}} large strike on the convoy, and instructed him to move forward as many aircraft as possible so that they could be close to the nearby captured airfields around Dobodura, where they would not be subject to the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> weather over the Owen Stanley Range. Kenney flew up to Port Moresby on 26 February, where he met with Whitehead. The two generals inspected fighter and bomber units in the area, and agreed to attack the Japanese convoy in the Vitiaz Strait. Kenney returned to Brisbane on 28 February.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} for {{information}} on the missionaries is the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum of the medieval writer Bede, written around 731. Bede details several {{of the members of the}} mission. Another important source of information is the papal registers which list copies of Gregory's letters sent to the missionaries. Neither source gives a complete listing of the missionaries in either group, so a listing of members must be gathered from scattered references in Bede and Gregory's letters. Although it is known that about 40 people were included in the first group, how many arrived in the second group is unknown. The <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> the evidence allow only some of the missionaries to be named.|$|E

The editors {{wrote that}} Flanker 2.0 is [...] "not everyone's cup of tea, and even veteran simmers {{find it a}} challenge to master every <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> the Su-27. But for sheer authenticity, it can't be topped." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{front of}} Lane, {{extending}} some distance, was a broad unbroken expanse of water {{leading to the}} dam. A tremendous roar issued from that fall. The muddy spray and mist rose high. To drift over there would be fatal. Logs and pieces of debris were kept rolling there for hours before some <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> current caught them and released them.|$|R
6000|$|Rosa {{laughed at}} the idea of being in debt. It seemed, to her inexperience, a comical <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> the imagination. Mr. Grewgious {{stretched}} his near sight to be sure that this was her view of the case. ‘Ah!’ he said, as comment, with a furtive glance towards Miss Twinkleton, and lining out pounds, shillings, and pence: ‘I spoke of having got among the angels! So I did!’ ...|$|R
5|$|At 20:45, with Jason {{far behind}} in the darkness, Mars hauled up and Hood {{attempted}} to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule. The <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside. At 21:15 Mars was in range and L'Héritier opened fire, Hood replying immediately. For ten minutes, the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire, with damage to the bowsprit and foremast, as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21:25 and dropping anchor. The port bow anchor became entangled with the starboard anchor on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship, {{the force of the}} collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars.|$|E
5|$|Four Times of the Day is {{a series}} of four {{paintings}} by English artist William Hogarth. Completed in 1736, they were reproduced as a series of four engravings published in 1738. They are humorous depictions of life in the streets of London, the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> fashion, and the interactions between the rich and poor. Unlike many of Hogarth's other series, such as A Harlot's Progress, A Rake's Progress, Industry and Idleness, and The Four Stages of Cruelty, it does not depict the story of an individual, but instead focuses on the society of the city. Hogarth intended the series to be humorous rather than instructional; the pictures do not offer a judgment on whether the rich or poor are more deserving of the viewer's sympathies: while the upper and middle classes tend to provide the focus for each scene, there are fewer of the moral comparisons seen in some of his other works.|$|E
5|$|When Hillyar's {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Port Louis, Captain Schomberg immediately assumed command {{and led the}} squadron out again on 14 May, following the French eastwards. Heading straight for Tamatave, the only resupply point between Bourbon and the Cape of Good Hope, Schomberg rapidly gained on the French and when dawn broke on 20 May the French were {{within sight of the}} harbour. During the day, both commanders were frustrated by light winds and periods of calm in which none of the ships were able to move. Roquebert completed resupplying his ships at 12:00 and pulled away from the harbour in battle line, Clorinde followed by Renommée and Néréide while the British, although initially intending to form a line with Astraea at its head, gradually broke into a loose formation created by the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> the wind.|$|E
6000|$|And {{then came}} the day when my {{socialism}} grew respectable,--still a <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> youth, it was held, but romantically respectable. Romance, to the bourgeois mind, was respectable {{because it was not}} dangerous. As a [...] "red-shirt," [...] with bombs in all his pockets, I was dangerous. As a youth with nothing more menacing than a few philosophical ideas, Germanic in their origin, I was an interesting and pleasing personality.|$|R
60|$|In {{five minutes}} we had seen, handled, and smelt {{enough to satisfy}} us with this very odd and very nasty <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> tropic nature; and as we {{did not wish to}} become faint and ill, between the sulphuretted {{hydrogen}} and the blaze of the sun reflected off the hot black pitch, we hurried on over the water-furrows, and through the sedge-beds to the farther shore--to find ourselves in a single step out of an Inferno into a Paradiso.|$|R
50|$|His works, {{including}} landscapes, genre, and portraits, {{have the}} bright chromatic sensibility of post-impressionism or late-Macchiaioli painters. The critic M. Bernardi stated that Conterno affirmed subtlety, the aristocracy of touch, the serene poetry that diffuses from his placid and accurate painterliness Schialvino describes it {{him as a}} painter able to depict small things made large by the insufflation of a poetic spirit, depictions, despite the <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> the subject, full of intimacy, exquisiteness, preciosity, meditation, solemnity, and religion. A retrospective of his work was displayed in 1953 at the Circolo degli Artisti, in Turin.|$|R
5|$|The draft-Constitution {{was to be}} {{subjected}} to a referendum on 8 August 1797, after a very lively campaign in which the French ambassador Noël weighed in with a supportive appeal. This probably contributed to the resounding defeat of the proposal (108,761 votes to 27,995). The Assembly was back at square one. At this moment in time foreign events {{in the form of the}} 18 Fructidor coup of general Pierre Augereau intervened. This brought the more radical faction to power in France, which proved to be ultimately less patient with the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> the Dutch political process, and more prone to intervene. Elections for a second National Assembly returned one in which the balance of power had shifted to the unitarists in the Fall of 1797. Nevertheless, the federalists managed to retain control of the new constitutional commission by a bare majority. This led to more dawdling and the unitarists in the Assembly now came with their own proposal in the form of the Declaration of 43 on 12 December 1797, containing a nine-point manifesto concerning the minimum conditions to which the new constitution should conform.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Critical reception== After {{the initial}} {{exhibition}} of El Jaleo in 1882 at the French Salon, John Singer Sargent became, as one writer put it, [...] "the most talked-about painter in Paris." [...] Some critics in 1882 {{said that the}} painting caused Sargent to {{join the ranks of}} the French Impressionists. A critic for the Le Figaro called the painting [...] "one of the most original and strongest works of the present Salon." [...] Some writers hailed the painting as clever, while others dismissed it as a <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> the artist.|$|R
6000|$|Try it with Zeus, 'tis {{just the}} same; The thing evades, we hug a name; [...] 110 Nay, {{scarcely}} that,--perhaps a vapor Born of some atmospheric caper. All Lempriere's fables blur together In cloudy {{symbols of the}} weather, And Aphrodite rose from frothy seas But to illustrate such hypotheses. With years enough behind his back, Lincoln will take the selfsame track, And prove, hulled fairly to the cob, A mere <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> Old Prob. [...] 120 Give the right man a solar myth, And he'll confute the sun therewith.|$|R
60|$|We {{were talking}} {{of these things}} one morning quite alone. Anna heard me when I was most sedate with {{manifest}} pleasure, and she smiled mournfully when the thread of my argument was entangled by a <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> the imagination. I felt at my heart's core what a blessing such a mentor would be, and how fortunate would be my lot could I succeed in securing her for life. Still I did not, could not, summon courage to lay bare my inmost thoughts, and to beg a boon that in these moments of transient humility I feared I never should be worthy to possess.|$|R
25|$|RTTY, {{using either}} AFSK or FSK modulation, is {{moderately}} resistant to <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> HF propagation and interference, however modern digital modes, such as MFSK, use Forward Error Correction to provide much better data reliability.|$|E
25|$|Playing as a wicket-keeper batsman, Bisset scored 35 and 21* {{and took}} a catch and a stumping. Bisset also captained the Second Test of the series but, due to the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> {{turn of the century}} {{international}} cricket it would be another 11 years before Bisset played his third and final Test.|$|E
25|$|Due to the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> {{the cube}} tower, {{it can be}} very {{difficult}} to predict the outcome of any battle. Many cubes can be poured into the tower, while only a few may come out. During initial setup, armies from all players are added to the tower as well, so {{it is also possible that}} in some battles, more cubes come out than were poured in.|$|E
6000|$|Looking {{neither to}} the right nor to the left, hardly at Fitzpiers himself, he put his hat under his chair, and with a preoccupied gaze at the floor, he said, [...] "I've called to ask you, doctor, quite privately, a {{question}} that troubles me. I've a daughter, Grace, an only daughter, {{as you may have}} heard. Well, she's been out in the dew--on Midsummer Eve in particular she went out in thin slippers to watch some <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> the Hintock maids--and she's got a cough, a distinct hemming and hacking, that makes me uneasy. Now, I have decided to send her away to some seaside place for a change--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} furze-dealer, {{standing}} up, giving his forehead a thorough mopping, and handing the beeswax to Humphrey, who succeeded at the rubbing forthwith. [...] "Not that this couple be in want of one, but 'twas well to show 'em {{a bit of}} friendliness at this great racketing <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> their lives. I set up both my own daughters in one when they was married, {{and there have been}} feathers enough for another in the house the last twelve months. Now then, neighbours, I think we have laid on enough wax. Grandfer Cantle, you turn the tick the right way outwards, and then I'll begin to shake in the feathers." ...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, he {{was there}} at the end of all this incomprehensible journey. He became possessed by an irresistible desire to hurry. Once more Dorn {{attempted}} to control the far-flinging of his thoughts--to come down to earth. The earth was there under his hand, soft, sticky, moldy, smelling vilely. He dug his fingers into it, until the feel of something like a bone made him jerk them out. Perhaps he had felt a stone. A tiny, creeping, chilly shudder went up his back. Then he remembered, he felt, he saw his little attic room, in the old home back among the wheat-hills of the Northwest. Six thousand miles away! He would never see that room again. What unaccountable <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> memory had ever recalled it to him? It faded out of his mind.|$|R
25|$|Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones was {{published}} six years later, in 1904, in two volumes, and remains a standard reference. In {{keeping with the}} standards of the times, much of the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> his personal life were glossed over (the years of the episode with Maria Zambaco fall neatly into a period somewhere between the end of Volume 1 and the beginning of Volume 2).|$|E
25|$|Pocock loved playing cricket, and {{had plenty}} of {{theories}} and experiments if the opposing batsmen got on top. His entire first-class cricket career was spent with Surrey County Cricket Club, and {{he got his first}} taste of the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> international selection, when he replaced Fred Titmus, who had lost four toes in a boating accident, on the 1967–68 tour to the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} decorative {{features of}} a cathedral or great church might follow a carefully conceived scheme which might continue the theme begun on the west front. There are many examples which give evidence of this, and include the mosaic vaults of Orthodox churches, the stained glass windows of Medieval churches and the sculptural schemes of Baroque churches. However, in many other cases, any unified scheme has been lost with the <b>vagaries</b> <b>of</b> the building's history.|$|E
40|$|Droughts {{are among}} the most feared natural disasters. They can affect the lives of many people such as farmers, consumers, or {{commodity}} traders. Droughts have taken a year’s work and salary away from farmers, led to higher prices for consumers, and taken the life savings away from some speculators. There has been a recent push in science to better understand the enigma of a drought. However, the research has not yet prevented people from losing a lot of money. The best way to protect people is by understanding how prices react to droughts. Agricultural prices are inherently unstable, primarily due to a combination of inelastic demand for food and production that is subject to the natural <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> weather. The agricultural product on which this research focuses is soybeans. In particular, I will focus on the November futures contract because it has the most liquidity in the season after the crucial August weather...|$|R
6000|$|The <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> Timothy Fairway was infectious. The turf-cutter seized old Olly Dowden, and, {{somewhat}} more gently, poussetted with her likewise. The {{young men were}} not slow to imitate the example of their elders, and seized the maids; Grandfer Cantle and his stick jigged {{in the form of}} a three-legged object among the rest; and in half a minute all that could be seen on Rainbarrow was a whirling of dark shapes amid a boiling confusion of sparks, which leapt around the dancers as high as their waists. The chief noises were women's shrill cries, men's laughter, Susan's stays and pattens, Olly Dowden's [...] "heu-heu-heu!" [...] and the strumming of the wind upon the furze-bushes, which formed a kind of tune to the demoniac measure they trod. Christian alone stood aloof, uneasily rocking himself as he murmured, [...] "They ought not to do it--how the vlankers do fly! 'tis tempting the Wicked one, 'tis." ...|$|R
60|$|Far below {{over the}} choppy sea of waves {{he saw a}} bridge. It was his old {{familiar}} resting place. Through the white enveloping glow he seemed to see himself standing on that bridge. Then came to him a strange revelation. Yesterday he had stood on that bridge, after seeing Blair for the last time. He had stood there while he lived through an hour of the keenest anguish {{that had come to}} him; and in that agony he had watched the plunging river. He had watched it with eyes that could never forget. His mind, exquisitely alive, with the sensibility of a plexus of racked and broken nerves, had taken up every line, every channel and stone and rapid of that flood, and had engraved them in ineffaceable characters. With the unintelligible <b>vagary</b> <b>of</b> thought, while his breast seemed crushed, his heart broken, he had imagined himself adrift on that surging river, and he had planned his escape through the rapids.|$|R
