50|$|The {{slot antenna}} {{was invented in}} 1938 by Alan Blumlein, while working for EMI.

50|$|Use is not {{normally}} made of masts higher than five-eighths (5/8) of a wavelength, because such masts (except for some special constructions for high power mediumwave broadcasting) exhibit poor <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns.

5000|$|In telecommunication, a periscope antenna is {{an antenna}} {{configuration}} {{in which the}} transmitting antenna is oriented to produce a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> pattern, and a flat or off-axis parabolic reflector, mounted above the transmitting antenna, is used to direct the [...] in a horizontal path toward the receiving antenna.|$|E

5000|$|Note: An {{example of}} an antenna blind cone is that of an Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR). The {{horizontal}} radiation pattern of an ARSR antenna is very narrow. The <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> pattern is fan-shaped, reaching approximately 70° of elevation above the horizontal plane. As the fan antenna is rotated about a vertical axis, it can illuminate targets {{only if they are}} 70° or less from the horizontal plane. Above that elevation, they are in the antenna blind cone.|$|E
50|$|The {{radiation}} pattern {{referred to above}} is usually the horizontal {{radiation pattern}}, which is plotted {{as a function of}} azimuth about the antenna, although the <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> pattern may also have a main lobe. The beamwidth of the antenna is the width of the main lobe, usually specified by the half power beam width (HPBW), the angle encompassed between the points {{on the side of the}} lobe where the power has fallen to half (-3 dB) of its maximum value.|$|E
5000|$|An {{anti-fading}} antenna (informally {{and often}} incorrectly termed a [...] "Franklin" [...] antenna) is a long- and medium-wave transmission antenna {{with a flat}} <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> pattern. The design goal is to move the mush zone farther from the transmitter site. An anti-fading antenna will reduce radiation at elevations of more than 50 degrees as much as possible. In principle, such a radiator should be as thin as possible, although thicker radiators improve the bandwidth and contribute to a taller effective height.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSolar {{energy has}} become one of the most {{promising}} renewable energies being the most widespread used nowadays. In order to achieve an optimum performance, both photovoltaic and solar thermal applications require the use of some kind of solar tracking technique. Every solar concentration system has to constantly reposition itself according to the Sun's position changes throughout the day. This movement must be done in the most effective way as possible to avoid a high negative impact on the system efficiency. The present paper attempts to describe in detail the design process of a state-of-the-art semi-passive solar tracking concentrator (SPSTC) in which, in order to track the sun, two independent arrays of acrylic prisms are implemented to refract sunlight by rotating said prisms, thus being able to redirect solar radiation as desired. The first set of PMMA prisms is responsible of eliminating one of the directional components of the solar radiation; the task is achieved by rotating the prisms within the array at a specific angle. The second set of “refractive heliostats” deals with another of the sunlight's directional components, transforming its direction into a completely perpendicular pattern to the array. Having downward <b>vertical</b> <b>radiations</b> makes possible to implement a stationary Fresnel lens to concentrate the solar radiation for any application desired. The system is designed and validated using simulation software to prove the feasibility of the concept...|$|R

The governing equations with Boussinesq approximation are written in primitive variables, and transposed from the physical to the mathematical space by the BFC (Boundary-Fitted Coordinate) technique. Predictions are obtained for Rayleigh numbers {{in the range of}} 10 ^ 3 to 10 ^ 6. Results are presented for pure free convection, free convection and wall conduction, and free convection and radiation.

50|$|At VLF, LF and MF {{the radio}} mast or tower {{is often used}} {{directly}} as an antenna. Its height determines the <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> pattern. Masts and towers with heights around a quarter wave or shorter, radiate considerable power towards the sky. This allows only a small area of fade-free reception at night, because the distance at which groundwave and skywave are of comparable strength and can interfere with each other is severely restricted (approximately 40 kilometres to 200 kilometres from the transmission site, depending on frequency and ground conductivity).|$|E
50|$|OSE3 was {{provided}} with an {{emergency power supply}} consisting of two 750-bhp diesel alternator sets. The diesel engines, which had been designed for railway locomotives abroad, were equipped with battery starting facilities instead of the compressed-air starting arrangements that were conventional for diesel engines of this size. The station came into service on 16 February 1941 and during May of that year a number of tests were carried out using a captive balloon to measure {{the performance of the}} horizontal dipole arrays and to determine the effect of the contour of the ground close to the station on their <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> pattern.|$|E
50|$|The Transmitter Ismaning {{is a large}} radio {{transmitting}} station near Ismaning, Bavaria, Germany. It was inaugurated in 1932. From 1932 to 1934 this transmitter (which replaced the Stadelheim Transmitter at Munich-Stadelheim) used a T-antenna as transmitting antenna, which was spun between two 115-metre-high free-standing wooden lattice towers, which were 240 metres apart. As this antenna had an unfavourable <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> pattern, which produced much skywave resulting in a too small fading-free reception area at night, in 1934 a new antenna was installed. Therefore, one of the towers was dismantled and rebuilt on a 39 metres high wooden lattice base. While this work took place, an L-Antenna was used, which was spun between the other tower and a small auxiliary wooden tower.|$|E

This improved model computes the absorption and scattering of both visible and near-infrared radiation in a multilayer canopy as a function of solar position and leaf orientation distribution. Multiple scattering is allowed, and the spectral reflectance of the vegetation stand is predicted. The results of the model are compared to those of other models and actual observations...|$|R

The exact solutions for velocity, temperature and concentration are obtained. Numerical results are shown graphically for some selected values of embedded flow parameters and discussed...|$|R
5000|$|A {{more complex}} {{anti-fading}} antenna is a vertical radiator which is sectionalized {{and is one}} wavelength (360 degrees, generally 180 over 180 degrees, and historically and correctly termed a [...] "Franklin" [...] radiator; two in an array at KFBK), or 300 degrees (180 over 120 degrees, and formally called a WHO radiator), or 240 degrees (120 over 120 degrees, and formally called a WOAI radiator, but WOAI has since replaced this with a 195 degree radiator for lower maintenance cost {{at the expense of}} somewhat poorer [...] "fringe" [...] reception). Several have been incorporated into phased arrays (directional antennas). When so sectionalized the sections are themselves phased so as to provide the optimum <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> pattern (suppressing high-angle radiation). An advantage of the 180 over 180 degree configuration is no ground radial system is required, and the bottom of the lower section may be insulated from the ground; for the others, the bottom of the lower section is usually connected to a ground radial system through a capacitor.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} the mast determines the {{radiation}} properties. For high power transmitters in the MW range, masts with heights around half of the radiated wavelength are preferred because they focus the radiated power better to the ground than structures with heights of quarter wavelengths, which are preferred for economical reasons for low power medium wave transmitters. A focus of radiated power towards the ground is much desired on frequencies below 3 megahertz, because groundwave propagation is very stable. Masts longer than five eighths of the wavelength are normally not used, because they show bad <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns, so masts for mediumwave transmitters do not normally exceed 300 metres. For longwave transmitters, however, the construction of masts with heights of half-wave wavelength is generally not economically viable {{and in most cases}} impossible. The only longwave radio mast with a {{height of the}} half length of the radiated wavelength was the Warszawa Radio Mast at Konstantynów, Poland. At the time of its collapse in 1991 it was the tallest manmade structure in the world, at 646.38 metres (2,120.67 ft) tall, for a wavelength of 1292.76 metres (frequency 232 kHz). For frequencies below longwave, masts are electrically enlarged by loading coils or capacity hats on the top, because masts of even quarter wavelength would be too high to be practical.|$|E
5000|$|For broadcasting, mast {{radiators}} are {{the most}} common type of antenna used, consisting of a steel lattice guyed mast in which the mast structure itself is used as the antenna. Stations broadcasting with low power can use masts with heights of a quarter-wavelength (about 310 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) to 5/8 wavelength (225 electrical degrees; about 440 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer), while high power stations mostly use half-wavelength to 5/9 wavelength. The usage of masts taller than 5/9 wavelength (200 electrical degrees; about 410 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) with high power gives a poor <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> pattern, and 195 electrical degrees (about 400 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) is generally considered ideal in these cases. Usually mast antennas are series-excited (base driven); the feedline is attached to the mast at the base. The base of the antenna is at high electrical potential and must be supported on a ceramic insulator to isolate it from the ground. Shunt-excited masts, in which the base of the mast is at a node of the standing wave at ground potential and so does not need to be insulated from the ground, have fallen into disuse, except in cases of exceptionally high power, 1 MW or more, where series excitation might be impractical. If grounded masts or towers are required, cage or long-wire aerials are used. Another possibility consists of feeding the mast or the tower by cables running from the tuning unit to the guys or crossbars at a certain height.|$|E

40|$|By {{taking into}} account the local energy balance per unit volume between the viscous heating and the advective cooling plus the {{radiative}} cooling, we investigate the <b>vertical</b> structure of <b>radiation</b> pressure-supported accretion disks in spherical coordinates. Our solutions show that the photosphere of the disk is close to the polar axis and therefore the disk seems to be extremely thick. However, the density profile implies that most of the accreted matter exists in a moderate range around the equatorial plane. We show that the well-known polytropic relation between the pressure and the density is unsuitable for describing the <b>vertical</b> structure of <b>radiation</b> pressure-supported disks. More importantly, we find that the energy advection is significant even for slightly sub-Eddington accretion disks. We argue that the non-negligible advection may help us understand why the standard thin disk model is likely to be inaccurate above similar to 0. 3 Eddington luminosity, which was found by some works on black hole spin measurement. Furthermore, the solutions satisfy the Solberg-Hoiland conditions, which indicate the disk to be convectively stable. In addition, we discuss the possible link between our disk model and ultraluminous X-ray sources.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) in 3 -D cylindrical, square, and triangular microcavities with vertical optical confinement of semiconductors are numerically {{investigated by the}} finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique. For a microcylinder with a vertical refractive index 3. 17 / 3. 4 / 3. 17 and a center layer thickness 0. 2 mu m, Q-factors of transverse electric (TE) WGMs around wavelength 1550 nm are smaller than 10 (3), as the radius R < 4 mu m and reach the orders of 10 (4) and 10 (6) as R = 5 and 6 mu m, respectively. However, the Q-factor of transverse magnetic (TM) WGMs at wavelength 1. 659 mu m reaches 7. 5 x 10 (5) as R = 1 mu m. The mode coupling between the WGMs and <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> modes in the cladding layer results in <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> loss for the WGMs. In the microcylinder, the mode wavelength of TM WGM {{is larger than the}} cutoff wavelength of the <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> mode with the same mode numbers, so TM WGMs cannot couple with the <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> mode and have high Q-factor. In contrast, TE WGMs can couple with the corresponding <b>vertical</b> <b>radiation</b> mode in the 3 -D microcylinder as R < 5 mu m. However, the mode wavelength of the TE WGM approaches (is larger than) the cutoff wavelength of the corresponding radiation modes at R = 5 mu m (6 mu m), so TE WGMs have high Q-factors in such microcylinders too. The results show that a critical lateral size is required for obtaining high, Q-factor TE WGMs in the 3 -D microcylinder. For 3 -D square and triangular microcavities, we also find that the Q-factor of TM WGM is larger than that of TE WGM...|$|E

50|$|For {{horizontal}} propagation between transmitting {{and receiving}} antennas situated near the ground reasonably far from each other, the distances traveled by {{the direct and}} reflected rays are nearly the same.
