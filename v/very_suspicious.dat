25|$|According to {{eyewitness}} accounts, Mansour Osanlou {{was arrested}} on Sunday, November 19, 2006 along with the vice-president of SWTSBC, Ibrahim Madadi under <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> circumstances. Osanlou and Madadi were beaten {{by a group of}} armed militia and were taken away after shots were fired into the air. This is his second arrest. Oslanou had been recently released on bail after being kept in solitary confinement for months. This seems to be another case where special police and state sponsored undercover militia of “Ansar-e Hezbollah” are used in arresting and silencing social and political activists.|$|E
25|$|Kovari's {{previous}} roommate, John Pape, {{reported being}} <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> {{that there was}} more to his friend's death than the Police were letting on. He searched on the internet for other unexplained deaths in the Barking area, and found information about the unexplained death of Port's first victim, Anthony Walgate, furthering his suspicions that Kovari's death was not accidental. He was astonished at the similarities of the cases, especially the locations in which the bodies were found, however Dagenham Police did not link the two cases nor did they issue any warnings to the LGBT community.|$|E

25|$|After a {{fortnight}} of intense fighting I Corps {{had been reduced}} from 18,000 men to just under 3,000 effectives by 12 November. After six days of bickering between British and French generals, I Corps was relieved by French troops; Haig being <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> of the pro-French sympathies of Henry Wilson. Following {{the success of the}} First Battle of Ypres, French, who had been ordered by his doctor to rest to relieve the strain on his heart, recommended Haig for immediate promotion to General. Haig travelled to London on French's behalf (23 November) to consult Kitchener about the plan to expand the BEF and reorganise it into two armies.|$|E
25|$|The MythBusters episode {{also pointed}} out another complication: it would be {{necessary}} to insert the item into one's mouth (for example, eat an onion, rinse with mouthwash, conceal a battery), take the breath test, and then possibly remove the item — all of which would have to be accomplished discreetly enough to avoid alerting the police officers administering the test (who would obviously become <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> if they noticed that a person was inserting items into their mouth prior to taking a breath test). It would likely be very difficult, especially for someone in an intoxicated state, to be able to accomplish such a feat.|$|E
25|$|Avon {{tells the}} rest of the group that Orac has traced Blake to Gauda Prime, an {{agricultural}} planet. Blake is masquerading as a bounty hunter; his latest quarry is Arlen, whom he hopes to recruit for his rebellion. Scorpio approaches Gauda Prime and is attacked. The crew, except Tarrant, use the teleport to abandon the damaged craft. Slave is rendered non-functional and Tarrant remains aboard to pilot Scorpio and is injured during a crash landing. Blake arrives, rescues and takes Tarrant to his base and purportedly captures Tarrant as bounty. Tarrant thinks that Blake has betrayed the group, and Blake lets Tarrant escape. Tarrant is nearly killed by Blake's colleagues when Avon and his crew save him, giving credence to Tarrant's accusation that Blake has betrayed them to the Federation. Becoming <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> of Blake, Avon kills him. Arlen reveals that she is a Federation officer and Federation guards arrive. Tarrant, Soolin, Vila, and Dayna are gunned down by Federation troops, who slowly surround Avon. Avon steps over Blake's body, raises his gun and smiles. Shots are heard.|$|E

50|$|Initially panned by critics, “Fuss And Fight” drew {{its share}} of negative, or at the <b>very</b> least, <b>suspicious,</b> press upon its release. Long {{accustomed}} to Fela-esque prototypes, purists found the group's radical take on Afrobeat not to their liking. Although initially stung by the lukewarm response, Lugo quickly set off to write Kokolo’s second album during a stay in Amsterdam in 2003, noting only the criticisms from a selected number of writers whose opinion he respected, more inspired than ever to solidify an original sound for the group.|$|R
500|$|Greek {{society was}} in reality very {{tolerant}} of other religions. But after 400 years of religious oppression by the Ottomans, Greeks were <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> of imposed [...] "Liberal European progress". Such forced [...] "progress" [...] {{was viewed as}} one more attempt against their faith and against their own understanding of freedom, as the main motto of the Greek Revolution was [...] "for the holy faith of Christ and {{the freedom of the}} homeland"; home and faith were inseparable, given also that the Church was the main contributor to the survival of the Greek language and Greek consciousness during Turkish occupation.|$|E
500|$|Dylan first {{performed}} [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] {{in public}} on December 4, 1965, at the Berkeley Community Theatre. Present at this concert was Joan Baez, who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, [...] "He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> to me...he'd never performed it before and Neuwirth told him I {{was there that}} night and he performed it." [...] Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was Allen Ginsberg, who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg {{to be an important}} influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the Beat poet.|$|E

The people of Springfield are <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> of Homer and Marge, and Chief Wiggum does not believe their story. Finally, during an inspection of the house, Maggie is found with Mrs. Bellamy's stolen necklace.

Unaware of this, Geoffrey insists she {{get the latest}} inside {{information}} from Fair, as {{the stock market is}} behaving <b>very</b> strangely. <b>Suspicious</b> of Linda's rapid about face, Fair refuses to tell her anything. Not wanting to admit that she was unable to charm her ex-lover, Linda lies to her husband, telling him the market will rise. As a result, Geoffry loses all of his money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Unwilling to deal with being impoverished, Linda persuades her husband to pay for her extended stay in Bermuda, using some of the money he needs to try to recover.|$|R
60|$|Whether {{the last}} {{also saw the}} pretended chief was more than I knew, but he decided to let the {{conversation}} go on, rather leaning to the anti-rent side of the question, as the course that could do no serious evil, while it might secure our own safety.

500|$|In August 2009, Martin Offiah, who {{was working}} as a pundit for {{broadcaster}} Sky Sports during the match, spoke to the News of the World, stating that he believed the blood replacement in the final minute of extra time where Julien Dupuy returned to the field [...] "looked <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> and, in light of what happened in the previous round with Harlequins, I think Hipkiss and Leicester should be called to question." [...] Leicester coach Richard Cockerill responded that the replacement was within the laws of the game and that the club had done nothing illegal. ERC confirmed that the match commissioner had spoken to the referee regarding the incident and on the basis that the referee was satisfied, no further action was required. Cardiff also confirmed that they were satisfied that no wrongdoing had taken place and would not seek any further action.|$|E
500|$|After World War II, Koval was {{discharged}} from the Army. He returned to New York and CCNY, where he received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering on February 1, 1948. Telling his friends {{he was thinking about}} taking a trip to Poland or Israel, Koval secured a passport for six months' travel to Europe. According to the Russian publication Rossiyskaya Gazeta, he might have left because American counter-intelligence agents had discovered Soviet literature about his parents after being tipped off about the leak by a Soviet defector. He left by sea in October 1948 and never returned to his birth country. In Russia, he left the Soviet military with discharge papers as an untrained rifleman and the rank of private. His foreign background and service record made him [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> character", he wrote to Kramish. Turned down for education and research positions, Koval turned to his old GRU contact, who secured him a job as a laboratory assistant at the Mendeleev Institute. Eventually, Koval managed to obtain a teaching job there; his students often laughed at his foreign pronunciations for technical terms.|$|E

60|$|It was a cunning and {{suspicious}} idea, quite {{in the way}} of his school of Misers, and he looked <b>very</b> cunning and <b>suspicious</b> as he went jogging through the streets. More than once or twice, more than twice or thrice, say half a dozen times, he took his stick from the arm on which he nursed it, and hit a straight sharp rap at the air with its head. Possibly the wooden countenance of Mr Silas Wegg was incorporeally before him at those moments, for he hit with intense satisfaction.|$|R
5000|$|Kuranda may be {{regarded}} as one of the founders of liberal press conditions in Austria. Memorable is his lawsuit with Sebastian Brunner, a Catholic priest and editor of the Kirchenzeitung, which case was tried on 10 May 1860. Kuranda had pointed out in the Oesterreichische Post that Brunner collected material for his accusations against the Jews [...] "from <b>very</b> unclean and <b>suspicious</b> sources, whereby he spread untruthfulness and slander." [...] Brunner pressed a charge of calumny against Kuranda, who, through his able defense, and after a masterful pleading by Johann Berger , was acquitted in terms which implied a condemnation of Brunner's anti-Jewish campaign.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few seconds}} a whisky-John came flying towards the open hand, and alighted on a branch within a yard of it. Here he shook his {{feathers}} and looked <b>very</b> bold, but <b>suspicious,</b> for a few minutes, turning first one eye towards the hand, and then the other. After a little he hopped on a branch still nearer, and, seeing no motion in the hand, he at last hopped upon the palm and began to peck the crumbs. Instantly the fingers closed, and Jasper caught him by the toes, whereupon the whisky-John began to scream furiously with rage and terror. But I am bound to say there was more of rage than of terror in his cry.|$|R
2500|$|Kephart {{goes on to}} give a quasi-factual {{account of}} a North Carolina deputy's raid into the Sugarlands to find three fugitives.

40|$|In {{reviewing}} Mauro Barberi’s book Libertà, the reviewer sketches {{the many}} topics {{of the book}} and its historical reconstruction. At the same time the reviewer points out some significant sources of Western civilization, such as Jewish and Christian writings, that generally are not correctly considered even in this book. In fact, one notices the striking absence of any term corresponding to the Greek "eleutheria" in the Jewish Bible and a <b>very</b> limited and <b>suspicious</b> use of the term in the New Testament. This suggests a different meaning given to and possibly a different interest in what we call "freedom" among Greek and Judeo-Christian thinkers. This issue relates to the difficulties and the fractures still existing within Western thought towards globalization...|$|R
6000|$|What {{they had}} told her of her lover was after all true. That was the first idea that {{occurred}} {{to her as she}} sat in her chair, stunned by the sorrow that had come upon her. They had dinned into her ears their accusations, not against the man himself, but against the tribe to which he belonged, telling her that a Jew was, of his <b>very</b> nature, <b>suspicious,</b> greedy, and false. She had perceived early in her acquaintance with Anton Trendellsohn that he was clever, ambitious, gifted with the power of thinking as none others whom she knew could think; and that he had words at his command, and was brave, and was endowed with a certain nobility of disposition which prompted him to wish for great results rather than for small advantages. All this had conquered her, and had made her resolve to think that a Jew could be as good as a Christian. But now, when the trial of the man had in truth come, she found that those around her had been right in what they had said. How base must be the nature which could prompt a man to suspect a girl who had been true to him as Nina had been true to her lover! ...|$|R
40|$|In late September 2002, the Antarctic {{ozone hole}} {{was seen to}} split into two parts, {{resulting}} in large increases in ozone at some stations {{and the potential for}} significant modification of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) -induced ozone loss. The phenomenon was dynamical (a split vortex), causing large increases in stratospheric temperature above stations normally within the vortex. Temperatures at Halley, Antarctica, at 30 hPa increased by over 60 K, and temperatures at South Pole at 100 hPa increased by over 25 K. It is important to know if this has happened before, since if it happens in the future, it would significantly alter the total hemispheric ozone loss due to chlorine from CFCs, particularly if it happens in August or September. Temperatures in winter and spring measured at Halley or the South Pole since 1957 and 1961, respectively, show no other comparable increases until the final warming in late spring, except for two dates in the 1980 s at Halley when meteorological analyses show no vortex split. There are very few periods of measurements missing at both Halley and the South Pole, and analyses in those few periods show no vortex split. Measurements in August and September at sites normally {{near the edge of the}} vortex show <b>very</b> few <b>suspicious</b> dates, and analyses of those few suspicious dates again show no vortex split. It is concluded that the vortex has probably not split before the final warming since Antarctic records began in the late 1950 s, and almost certainly not in August or September...|$|R

2500|$|The {{aforementioned}} {{changes were}} approved by Verna Fields and commissioned to Jim Clark, who reluctantly agreed, and Cynthia Scheider.

Scheider was also interested in applying those changes, offering his cooperation. Jim Clark was reportedly assured by Fields that Friedkin permitted changes, but was <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> about the authenticity of this claim. Therefore, Clark wrote an indemnity preventing Friedkin from any form of interference. Some additional dialogue written by Clark and Ken Levinson was later dubbed in. The studio did not possess the original work print; hence it was forced {{to work on the}} combined print. Jim Clark said the cut was [...] "at best, passable" [...] and was of the opinion that if he [...] "had left Friedkin's version alone, it would have had exactly the same fate." ...|$|E

He would rather read a good baseball novel than a complex statistical analysis of the game. 'I found that players are <b>very</b> <b>suspicious</b> of computers, much like the general public,' he said. 'They fear them as cold and impersonal and inhuman. I couldn't make them understand that I was still going to make my own decisions, I wasn't going to let the computer make them for me.

60|$|This was {{sufficiently}} awkward; for, by going {{near enough to}} give a warning in a low voice, and have that warning followed by {{a change in the}} discourse, we should be betraying ourselves, and might fall into serious danger.

60|$|I had {{indirectly}} {{gained from}} him an {{important piece of}} information, that Father Vaughan, namely, {{was not supposed to}} be at the Hall. If, therefore, there appeared light in the windows of the library this evening, it either could not be his, or he was observing a <b>very</b> secret and <b>suspicious</b> line of conduct. I waited with impatience the time of sunset and of twilight. It had hardly arrived, ere a gleam from the windows of the library was seen, dimly distinguishable amidst the still enduring light of the evening. I marked its first glimpse, however, as speedily as the benighted sailor descries the first distant twinkle of the lighthouse which marks his course. The feelings of doubt and propriety, which had hitherto contended with my curiosity and jealousy, vanished when an opportunity of gratifying the former was presented to me. I re-entered the house, and avoiding the more frequented apartments with the consciousness of one who wishes to keep his purpose secret, I reached the door of the library--hesitated for a moment as my hand was upon the latch--heard a suppressed step within--opened the door--and found Miss Vernon alone.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to narrate the Indian experience in operationalising capital account liberalisation. At the outset, the Indian context is described followed by a brief account of the factors that triggered the process of liberalisation in the ‘nineties. The policy framework that governed liberalisation, the process of liberalisation and the current framework of controls are then explained. Subsequent sections describe the management of capital account and volatility in capital flows. The perceptions on the links between capital account, current account and, dollarisation are also mentioned. Other aspects relevant to capital account such as policy on reserve accumulation, exchange rate, monitoring of flows, dissemination of data and legal framework are elaborated in view of their significance for operational purposes. The current thinking on further steps towards liberalisation is briefly indicated. While recognising the stringent limitations on inferences based on experience of one country, some broad generalisations are made to enable meaningful discussion. Context The country-context provides an essential background for approaching the process of operationalising capital account liberalisation. An initial step in understanding the Indian context is appreciating why strict capital controls existed till the reform of ‘nineties. Firstly, in view of the colonial past, the public opinion since independence (1947) has been <b>very</b> guarded or <b>suspicious</b> abou...|$|R
