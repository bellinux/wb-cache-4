Contemporary systems used the radio as the intercom as well, but the TR9D sets used in RAF aircraft used the <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> for 15 seconds every minute for the pip-squeak system, blocking communications. Even when modified sets were supplied that addressed this, the radar was found to interfere strongly with the intercom. A speaking tube was tried but found to be useless. Newer VHF radios being developed through this same period did not suffer these problems, and the Blenheims were moved {{to the front of}} the queue to receive these units.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{telephone}} switches connected physical circuits (e.g., wire pairs) while modern telephone switches use {{a combination}} of space- and time-division switching. In other words, each <b>voice</b> <b>channel</b> is represented by a time slot (say 1 or 2) on a physical wire pair (A or B). In order to connect two voice channels (say A1 and B2) together, the telephone switch interchanges the information between A1 and B2. It switches both the time slot and physical connection. To do this, it exchanges data between the time slots and connections 8,000 times per second, under control of digital logic that cycles through electronic lists of the current connections. Using both types of switching makes a modern switch far smaller than either a space or time switch could be by itself.|$|E

[...] PSK31 is distinguished from other digital modes {{in that it is}} specifically tuned to have a data rate close to typing speed, and has an extremely narrow bandwidth, allowing many conversations in the same bandwidth as a single <b>voice</b> <b>channel.</b> This narrow bandwidth also concentrates the RF energy [...] in a very narrow bandwidth, allowing relatively low-power equipment (25 watts) to communicate globally using the same skywave propagation used by shortwave radio stations.|$|E
2500|$|The TR.9D HF radio {{telephone}} set in fighters {{at the time}} of the Battle of Britain had two channels and the operating frequencies of the two could only be selected before take-off. One channel was used for voice communication with sector control, while the other was used by the [...] "pip-squeak" [...] system. With only one <b>voice</b> <b>channel,</b> set to a squadron-specific frequency, the TR.9D limited the ability to co-ordinate with other squadrons. The set was low power, with a range of about [...] air-to-ground and [...] air-to-air, which presented numerous problems with reception quality. The TR.9 originally operated on a band that was relatively empty, but by the time of the war it was much busier and interference was a constant problem.|$|E

Pulse-code modulation allowed sharing a coder and decoder among several voice trunks, so this method was chosen for the T1 system introduced into local use in 1961.
