25|$|The {{following}} {{waves of}} migration have been identified: the First Aliyah and the Second Aliyah to Ottoman Palestine; the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Aliyah to Mandatory Palestine including Aliyah Bet between 1934 and 1948 and the Bericha of the Holocaust survivors; the Aliyah from {{elsewhere in the}} Middle East and North Africa {{as well as the}} Aliyah from western and Communist countries following the Six-Day War with the 1968 Polish political crisis, as well as the Aliyah from post-Soviet states to the State of Israel in the 1990s. Today, most aliyah consists of <b>voluntary</b> <b>migration</b> for ideological, economic, or family reunification purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Anthropologist Laura Agustín {{has written}} {{at great length}} about the way <b>voluntary</b> <b>migration</b> is purposefully conflated with {{involuntary}} trafficking, and how anti-trafficking laws tend to assume any foreign or underage prostitute is a [...] "trafficking victim" [...] even if she denies it. In a similar vein, ethnographers studying U.S.-born adolescents involved in street-based sex markets {{have argued that the}} relationships that these adolescents have with the adults in their lives who help facilitate their market activity typically have a far greater mutuality and equality than is understood by policy-makers, social service providers, and not-for-profit advocates who embrace the human trafficking model.|$|E
25|$|In the {{establishment}} of the African diaspora, the transatlantic slave trade is often considered the defining element, but people of African descent have engaged in eleven other migration movements involving North America since the 16th century, many being <b>voluntary</b> <b>migrations,</b> although undertaken in exploitative and hostile environments.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>voluntary</b> <b>migrations,</b> the Ottoman authorities used mass deportations (sürgün) {{as a method}} of control over potentially rebellious elements in the Balkans and in Anatolia. Far away from their home bases, the potential threat of such elements was considerably reduced {{as in the case of}} the followers of the rebellious Karamani Pir Ahmed. Tribal resistance was followed by large-scale transfers of Karamanid and Türkmen nomads to Deliorman and Rumelia. Deportations in both directions occurred throughout the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries.|$|R
40|$|This volume {{collects}} ten essays {{that look}} at intra-regional migration in the Southern Balkans {{from the late}} Ottoman period to the present. It examines forced as well as <b>voluntary</b> <b>migrations</b> and places these movements within their historical context, including ethnic cleansing, population exchanges, and demographic engineering {{in the service of}} nation-building as well as more recent labor migration due to globalization. Inside, readers will find the work of international experts that cuts across national and disciplinary lines. This cross-cultural, comparative approach fully captures the complexity of this highly fractured, yet interconnected, region. Coverage explores the role of population exchanges in the process of nation-building and irredentist policies in interwar Bulgaria, the story of Thracian refugees and their organizations in Bulgaria, the changing waves of migration from the Balkans to Turkey, Albanian immigrants in Greece, and the diminished importance of ethnic migration after the 1990 s. In addition, the collection looks at such under-researched aspects of migration as memory, gender, and religion. The field of migration studies in the Southern Balkans is still fragmented along national and disciplinary lines. Moreover, the study of forced and <b>voluntary</b> <b>migrations</b> is often separate with few interconnections. The essays collected in this book bring these different traditions together. This complete portrait will help readers gain deep insight and better understanding into the diverse migration flows and intercultural exchanges that have occurred in the Southern Balkans in the last two centuries...|$|R
2500|$|A {{long line}} of {{scholars}} has challenged conventional views of the African diaspora as a mere dispersion of Black people. For them, it is a movement of liberation that opposes the implications of racialization. Their position assumes that Africans and their descendants abroad struggle to reclaim power over their lives through <b>voluntary</b> <b>migration,</b> cultural production and political conceptions and practices. It also implies the presence of cultures of resistance with similar objectives throughout the global diaspora. Thinkers like W. E. B. Dubois and more recently Robin Kelley, for example, have argued that Black politics of survival reveal more {{about the meaning of}} the African diaspora than labels of ethnicity and race, and degrees of skin hue. From this view, the daily struggle against what they call the [...] "world-historical processes" [...] of racial colonization, capitalism, and western domination defines Blacks links to Africa.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Mann, basing his {{figures on}} those {{provided}} by Justin McCarthy, states that between 1821 and 1922, {{a large number}} of Muslims were expelled from Southeast Europe as Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia gained their independence from the Ottoman Empire. Mann describes these events as [...] "murderous ethnic cleansing on a stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe". These countries sought to expand their territory against the Ottoman Empire, which culminated in the Balkan Wars of the early 20th century. After each Russo-Turkish War, the Russians engaged in ethnic cleansing in the Caucasus. After the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) some 750,000 Ottoman Muslims disappeared from their native places. Some 210,000-310,000 civilian Bulgarians were slaughtered during the same war and the Bulgarian Horrors in 1876, and 100,000 fled. In the previous Russo-Turkish Wars as a result of <b>voluntary</b> <b>migration</b> and ethnic cleansing an emigrant community of Bessarabian Bulgarians was formed. Some 200,000 Bulgarians had emigrated from the Ottoman Empire between 1768 and 1812, until 1870 another 400,000 Bulgarians emigrated, mainly prompted by terror and ethnic cleansing in Thrace, while 200,000 were killed. Partly as a result of ethnic cleansing some 250,000 Bulgarians immigrated to Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire between 1878-1912.|$|E

40|$|For many centuries, Europe {{called the}} Ottoman empire "Turkey.

The country's rulers and inhabitants, however, only took on the name Turkey (Türkiye) in 1923, upon proclamation of the republic in what is the country's present-day territory. To keep consistent with contemporary historiographic usage, references to the period of the republic must thus be to "the Ottoman empire," rather than to "Turkey.

50|$|One of {{the major}} forces driving human {{trafficking}} in the Middle East is the large influx of foreign migration. Research conducted in 1996 on the routes of illegal migration, smuggling and trafficking concluded that over the period 1992-97, the majority of illegal migrants to Europe had originated from Iraq, China, Pakistan, India or Africa. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) notes trafficking of women from Ghana to Lebanon, Libya and EU countries, women for domestic service from Central and West Africa to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and even <b>voluntary</b> <b>migrations</b> of women from Ethiopia to the Middle East, where working conditions {{are considered to be}} virtual slavery. The Middle East is a destination region for men and women trafficked for the purpose of commercial and sexual exploitation. Wealthy Arab men from the Persian Gulf area have been known to rent flats that are ‘furnished with housemaids’ for anywhere from a few hours to a few months. Most of the prostitutes and human trafficking victims tend to be from Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Very few countries in the Middle East are devoid of the commercial sex industry.|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part, the author {{points out that}} the {{imperial}} politics have been using forcible migrations, through the history of mankind. Numerous non <b>voluntary</b> <b>migrations</b> in the twentieth century have soon become one of the central problems of the international community. Basically, Mesić follows establishing and determination of the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, confronted to contemporary world refugee movements. The second part of the review presents the summary of the author 2 ̆ 7 s typology of the Croatian exiles and refugees, based on large empirical research. For the »inland refugees« he uses the term exiles, while displaced persons are only one of its categories. The author devides exiles in six categories: »pre refugees«, pseudo refugees, exorbitant refugees, refugees before war destruction and occupation, displaced persons and detainees-refugees. The research further shows that these »touchy, irritable and angry people« react differently to the tragic situation they found themselves in. Three types of reaction are sorted: resignation, realism and dissatisfaction. The last part of the work is {{based on the results of}} the questionnaire containing numerous questions on the return, which was carried out among 726 displaced and refugees in Croatia. It showed that orientation to the return, besides general safety and political conditions, depended on some socio-professional characteristics of the questioned as well. Well educated people do not consider the possibility of return as much as less educated people. As it seems, answers about the return were also influenced by the regional origin and the nationality of the questioned...|$|R

50|$|The {{conquest of}} the Balkans by the Ottomans set in motion {{important}} population movements of Turks brought over from Anatolia and Asia Minor, establishing a firm Turkish base for further conquests in Europe. Thus, the Ottomans used colonization as a very effective method to consolidate their position and power in the Balkans. The colonizers that {{were brought to the}} Balkans consisted of soldiers, nomads, farmers, artisans and merchants, dervishes, preachers and other religious functionaries, and administrative personnel. Densely populated Turkish colonies were established in the frontier regions of Thrace, the Maritsa and the Tundzha valleys. In addition to <b>voluntary</b> <b>migrations,</b> throughout the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, the Ottoman authorities also used mass deportations ("sürgün") as a method of control over potentially rebellious individuals. One of the greatest impacts of the Ottoman colonization process of the Balkans was felt in the urban centres, many towns became major centres for Turkish control and administration, with most Christians gradually withdrawing to the mountains. The Ottomans embarked on creating new towns and repopulating older towns that had suffered significant population decline and economic dislocation during the wars preceding the Ottoman conquests. Major Balkan towns, especially those on or near transportation and communication routes, were the focal point of Ottoman colonization in the Balkans. Most urban centres in the Balkans, especially in Thrace, Macedonia, Thessaly, and Moesia, achieved Muslim/Turkish majorities or substantial minorities soon after the completion of the conquest and remained overwhelmingly Muslim in composition into the eighteenth century, and in some areas such as Macedonia and Bulgaria well into the nineteenth century. However, {{in the course of the}} nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many Turks were displaced, most of them fleeing to Anatolia. At present, there are still significant Turkish minorities living in Bulgaria, the province of East Macedonia and Thrace in Northern Greece, Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, and Romania.|$|R

40|$|Student Number : 0515393 R - MA {{research}} report - School of Literature and Language Studies - Faculty of HumanitiesThis study examines {{the effects of}} diaspora and displacement in characters as presented in Abdulrazak Gurnah’s Paradise, Admiring Silence and By the Sea. It looks at {{the role played by}} these effects in the construction of ideas of home and identity in the characters. Displacement is studied here against a backdrop of a long history of movements brought about by trading activities, exile and <b>voluntary</b> <b>migrations.</b> The texts are set in the east African coastal region, the islands and in Western countries such as England. The study relies on theories of postcolonialism and diaspora for its reading. The introduction places Gurnah’s work within the postcolonial archive by looking at his stance against the existing postcolonial discourses. It is also of importance to consider Gurnah’s biography and attempt to relate this to the view he takes as he narrates this geographical space in a postcolonial era. Chapter two looks at ideas of home as posited by different theorists in relation to the displaced and scattered characters he presents in these texts. Chapter three is concerned with how characters construct their identities against the ideas of ‘otherness’. In this chapter, I argue that Gurnah’s ideas of ‘otherness’ operate outside the (post) colonial idea of the same where the other is defined purely by difference in race. In chapter four I examine the significance of the preponderance of violence in the families presented by Gurnah. I investigate the connection between this perpetration of violence in the family and the idea of an elusive ‘paradise’ which runs through all Gurnah’s texts. The conclusion summarizes my major findings about Gurnah’s presentation of diaspora and displacement in the East African coast and the islands, and how he uses different structures like the home, self and the family to do this...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, return {{migration}} from Sweden to three sources of refugee immigration is analysed, {{with a focus}} on the effect of political change in 1990. Chilean immigrants reacted more strongly to political liberalization in the home country than Polish immigrants did, primarily due to more favourable economic circumstances in Chile compared to Poland in the 1990 s. In fact, the increase in Polish {{return migration}} propensity after 1990 is not statistically different from the Iranian increase, in spite of the absence of political liberalization in Iran. There are significant cohort differences within the Chilean group, indicating an element of economically motivated migration within the last waves of Chilean refugee immigration in the late 1980 s. Hence, successful implementation of schemes of <b>voluntary</b> return <b>migration</b> for refugees will not only be dependent on an improved political situation in the source country, but will also be highly dependent on economic circumstances...|$|R
