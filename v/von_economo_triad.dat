40|$|The {{cerebral}} cortex is a distinctive {{part of the}} mammalian nervous system, displaying a spatial variety in cyto-, chemico-, and myelinoarchitecture. As part of a rich history of histological findings, pioneering anatomists <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> and Koskinas provided detailed mappings on the cellular structure of the human cortex, reporting on quantitative aspects of cytoarchitecture of cortical areas. Current day investigations into the structure of human cortex have embraced technological advances in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess macroscale thickness and organization of the cortical mantle in vivo. However, direct comparisons between current day MRI estimates and the quantitative measurements of early anatomists have been limited. Here, we report on a simple, but nevertheless important cross-analysis between the histological reports of <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> and Koskinas on variation in thickness of the cortical mantle and MRI derived measurements of cortical thickness. We translated the <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> cortical atlas to a subdivision of the commonly used Desikan-Killiany atlas (as part of the FreeSurfer Software package and a commonly used parcellation atlas in studies examining MRI cortical thickness). Next, values of "width of the cortical mantle" as provided by the measurements of <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> and Koskinas were correlated to cortical thickness measurements derived from high-resolution anatomical MRI T 1 data of 200 + subjects of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Cross-correlation revealed a significant association between group-averaged MRI measurements of cortical thickness and histological recordings (r= 0. 54, P< 0. 001). Further validating such a correlation, we manually segmented the <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> parcellation atlas on the standardized Colin 27 brain dataset and applied the obtained three-dimensional <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> segmentation atlas to the T 1 data {{of each of the}} HCP subjects. Highly consistent with our findings for the mapping to the Desikan-Killiany regions, cross-correlation between in vivo MRI cortical thickness and <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> histology-derived values of cortical mantle width revealed a strong positive association (r= 0. 62, P< 0. 001). Linking today's state-of-the-art T 1 -weighted imaging to early histological examinations our findings indicate that MRI technology is a valid method for in vivo assessment of thickness of human cortex.

5000|$|From 1903 to 1904, {{he was a}} {{resident}} at the Clinic of Internal Medicine under Carl Wilhelm Hermann Nothnagel. Subsequently, he travelled through Europe {{for two years and}} worked for several scientists. He studied neurology, histology, and psychiatry in Paris (under Alexis Joffroy, Valentin Magnan and Pierre Marie). In Nancy, he was introduced to hypnosis (under Hippolyte Bernheim); in Strasbourg he became familiar with methods of microscopic research of the nervous system (under Albrecht von Bethe). In Munich, <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> worked with Emil Kraepelin and Alois Alzheimer and wrote his article [...] "Contribution to the normal anatomy of the ganglion cell." [...] He also worked in the psychiatry of Berlin under Theodor Ziehen and in the neurologic ambulatory under Hermann Oppenheim and, finally, did experimental animal research in Trieste (under Carl Isidor Cori).After these two years, he returned to Vienna and worked as assistant at the Clinic for Psychiatry and Nervous Diseases (headed by Julius Wagner-Jauregg) at Vienna’s General Hospital. <b>Von</b> <b>Economo</b> obtained his habilitation in 1913. In 1919 at age 43, he married Princess Karoline von Schönburg-Hartenstein. In 1921, <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> was appointed Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology.

50|$|During the 1920s {{an obscure}} {{disorder}} that caused encephalitis and attacked {{the part of}} the brain that regulates sleep influenced Europe and North America. Although the virus that caused this disorder was never identified, the psychiatrist and neurologist Constantin <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> decided to study this disease and identified a key component in the sleep-wake regulation. He identified the pathways that regulated wakefulness and sleep onset by studying the parts of the brain that were affected by the disease and the consequences it had on the circadian rhythm. He stated that the pathways that regulated sleep onset are located between the brain stem and the basal forebrain. His discoveries were not appreciated until the last two decades of the 20th century when the pathways of sleep onset were found to reside in the exact place that Constantin <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> stated.|$|R
50|$|This {{encephalitis}} {{with acute}} {{inflammation of the}} gray matter occurred in epidemic form worldwide from 1915 until about 1924, mainly in Europe and North-America, causing lesions in the substantia nigra. <b>Von</b> <b>Economo</b> described in detail the symptoms, pathology and histology of the disease which was soon called <b>Von</b> <b>Economo’s</b> Disease. Three types of this illness could be distinguished. The symptoms of the somnolent-ophthalmoplegic form were somnolence, often leading to coma and death, paralysis of cranial nerves, extremities and eye muscles and expressionless faces. The hyperkinetic form manifested itself with restlessness, motor disturbances as twitching of muscle groups, involuntary movements, anxious mental state and insomnia or inversion of sleep patterns. The amyostatic-akinetic form often led to a chronic state similar to Parkinson's disease, called postencephalitic parkinsonism. The symptoms were weakness of muscles, rigidity of movements and insomnia or sleep inversion.|$|R
50|$|Between 1916 and 1927 {{he worked}} at the University of Vienna in {{neuropathology}} and neuroanatomy. At the Neurological Institute, his mentors in neuropathology were Heinrich Obersteiner (1847-1922) and Otto Marburg (1874-1948). In 1925 Koskinas published, with neurologist Constantin <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> (1876-1931), the monumental Cytoarchitektonik der Hirnrinde des erwachsenen Menschen (Cytoarchitectonics of the Adult Human Cerebral Cortex).|$|R
50|$|In 1916, <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> {{described}} encephalitis lethargica (EL), a CNS disorder presenting with pharyngitis {{followed by}} sleep disorder, basal ganglia signs (particularly parkinsonism) and neuropsychiatric sequelae. Since the 1916-1927 epidemic, only sporadic {{cases have been}} described. Pathological studies revealed an encephalitis of the midbrain and basal ganglia, with lymphocyte (predominantly plasma cell) infiltration. The EL epidemic occurred {{during the same time}} period as the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the two outbreaks have been linked in the medical literature. However, <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> and other contemporary scientists thought that the 1918 influenza virus was not the cause of EL. Recent examination of archived EL brain material has failed to demonstrate influenza RNA, adding to the evidence that EL was not an invasive influenza encephalitis. By contrast, the findings of intrathecal oligoclonal bands (OCB) and beneficial effects of steroid treatments have provoked the hypothesis that EL may be immune‐mediated.|$|R
40|$|The <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> neurons {{are one of}} the few known specializations to {{hominoid}} cortical microcircuitry. The recent {{emergence of}} this cell type, as well as its localization to subregions of the frontal cortex, suggest its involvement in sophisticated cognitive behaviors. Studies of this cell may thus provide insights into human uniqueness and origin and may additionally be relevant to the treatment and understanding of mental illness. The first section of this thesis investigates the anatomical details of these cells, including their structure and surface receptor expression. Using a Golgi preparation of a human postmortem brain, I describe the dendritic architecture of this unique population of neurons. We found that, in contrast to layer 5 pyramidal neurons, the <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> neurons have sparse dendritic trees with symmetric apical and basal components. This confirms that the <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> cells in both ACC and FI share the architectural characteristics of a single population, and that this population is distinct from other layer 5 neurons. I additionally used immunohistochemistry to probe the receptor expression on these cells, and found that the <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> neurons strongly express the dopamine D 3 and D 5 receptors, as well as serotonin- 1 b and serotonin- 2 b receptors. Together, these results provide the first detailed anatomical description of a neuron type unique to great apes and humans. In the second part of this thesis, I explore whether a behavioral stimulus, humor, activates the regions in which this cell occurs. Humor is a hallmark of social discourse and usually depends on the convergence of fast, intuitive assessments with a slow "re-interpretation" of the humor. Because of these characteristics, we thought it likely that humor would activate FI and ACC in addition to other regions in the brain. I used event-related fMRI to differentiate brain activity induced by the hedonic similarities and cognitive differences inherent in cartoons depicting two kinds of humor: visual humor (sight gags) and language-based humor. I found that the brain networks recruited during a humorous experience did indeed include FI and ACC, and that the profile of activation differs according to the type of humor being processed. Taken together, these projects significantly expand on our knowledge of these unusual cells, and provide a basis that allows us to hypothesize about their function. In the conclusion of this paper, we propose that the role of the <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> neurons is to facilitate fast decision making in the context of high uncertainty, such as during social interaction. </p...|$|R

50|$|On a {{cellular}} level, the ACC {{is unique in}} its abundance of specialized neurons called spindle cells, or <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> neurons.

50|$|Spindle neurons, {{also called}} <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> neurons (VENs), are a {{specific}} class of neurons that {{are characterized by}} a large spindle-shaped soma (or body), gradually tapering into a single apical axon in one direction, with only a single dendrite facing opposite. Other neurons tend to have many dendrites, and the polar-shaped morphology of spindle neurons is unique. A neuron's dendrites receive signals, and its axon sends them.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the first}} {{attempts}} {{to divide the}} human cortex into areas according to the cytoarchitecture by Theodor Meynert, Vladimir Betz, Alfred Walter Campbell, Grafton Elliot Smith and Korbinian Brodmann, <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> started his own project in 1912 and was joined by Georg N. Koskinas in 1919. In 1925, their monumental work [...] "Die Cytoarchitektonik der Hirnrinde des erwachsenen Menschen" [...] ("Cytoarchitectonics of the Adult Human Cerebral Cortex") was published. This work was presented in two volumes, a textbook of more than 800 pages and an atlas with 112 large-sized microphotographic plates of the cortex. The textbook contains detailed descriptions of their studies and {{an introduction to the}} history of cytoarchitectonic research. Two years later, a shorter version, [...] "Zellaufbau der Großhirnrinde" [...] ("The Cellular Architecture of the Cerebral Cortex") was published and translated into French, Italian and English. With their atlas, <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> and Koskinas hoped to create a basis for future brain research and the localisation of brain functions since they assumed that cytoarchitectonic differences reflect functional differences.

40|$|The term {{schizophrenia}} embraces a {{group of}} disorders that are characterised by a heterogeneous set of symptoms. Poor social cognition, including metacognitive dysfunction is present across all schizophrenia phenotypes, accounting for {{a large proportion of}} patients social impairment. Metacognitive functioning is subserved by a distinct neural network of widely distributed regions of the brain, foremost areas of the prefrontal cortex, as well as, areas in the temporal and parietal lobes. While dysfunction of the metacognition neural network in schizophrenia has been well documented, the underlying neuronal correlates are only partially understood. This review focuses on two distinct cell populations that evolved during primate evolution: The mirror neurons, and the <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> neurons. Empirical evidence suggests that these cell types have a special role in social cognition and metacognitive functioning. However, only recent studies have addressed their potential role in schizophrenia. In spite of current paucity of research on mirror neuron function in schizophrenia, it seems plausible to suggest that their functional properties are compromised, and contribute to aberrant imitation behaviour in schizophrenia. The potential impact of <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> neurons in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is even less clear, but future research may help to better understand the nature of this devastating group of disorders...|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{starting}} in 1917 {{an epidemic of}} encephalitis lethargica, also called <b>von</b> <b>Economo’s</b> encephalitis or [...] "sleepy-disease" [...] occurred, possibly related to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic; however, even {{with the use of}} modern molecular diagnostic tests on appropriate corpses no firm link between encephalitis lethargica with influenza has been made. Although parkinsonism was occasionally seen during the acuteencephalitic phase of encephalitis lethargica, it was often encountered in the post-encephalitic phase. The onset of post encephaliticparkinsonism can be delayed by several years from the resolution of encephalitis lethargica.|$|R
40|$|The {{temporal}} pole (TP) is the rostralmost {{portion of}} the human temporal lobe. Characteristically, it is only present in human and nonhuman primates. TP has been implicated in different cognitive functions such as emotion, attention, behavior, and memory, based on functional studies performed in healthy controls and patients with neurodegenerative diseases through its anatomical connections (amygdala, pulvinar, orbitofrontal cortex). TP was originally described as a single uniform area by Brodmann area 38, and <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> (area TG of <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> and Koskinas), and little information on its cytoarchitectonics is known in humans. We hypothesize that 1) TP is not a homogenous area and we aim first at fixating the precise extent and limits of temporopolar cortex (TPC) with adjacent fields and 2) its structure can be correlated with structural magnetic resonance images. We describe here the macroscopic characteristics and cytoarchitecture as two subfields, a medial and a lateral area, that constitute TPC also noticeable in 2 D and 3 D reconstructions. Our {{findings suggest that the}} human TP is a heterogeneous region formed exclusively by TPC for about 7 mm of the temporal tip, and that becomes progressively restricted to the medial and ventral sides of the TP. This cortical area presents topographical and structural features in common with nonhuman primates, which suggests an evolutionary development in human species...|$|R
50|$|Brodmann {{areas were}} {{originally}} defined and numbered by the German anatomist Korbinian Brodmann {{based on the}} cytoarchitectural organization of neurons he observed in the cerebral cortex using the Nissl method of cell staining. Brodmann published his maps of cortical areas in humans, monkeys, and other species in 1909, {{along with many other}} findings and observations regarding the general cell types and laminar organization of the mammalian cortex. The same Brodmann area number in different species does not necessarily indicate homologous areas. A similar, but more detailed cortical map was published by Constantin <b>von</b> <b>Economo</b> and Georg N. Koskinas in 1925.|$|R
50|$|Abnormal spindle neuron {{development}} may {{be linked}} to several psychotic disorders, typically those characterized by distortions of reality, disturbances of thought, disturbances of language, and withdrawal from social contact. Altered spindle neuron states have been implicated in both schizophrenia and autism, but research into these correlations remains at a very early stage. Frontotemporal dementia involves loss of mostly spindle neurons.An initial study suggested that Alzheimer's disease specifically targeted <b>Von</b> <b>Economo</b> neurons; this study was performed with end-stage Alzheimer brains in which cell destruction was widespread, but later, it was found that Alzheimer's disease doesn't affect the spindle neurons.|$|R
