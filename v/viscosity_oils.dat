Often, these motors are not exposed to as wide service temperature ranges as in vehicles, so these oils may be single <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|E

50|$|Shell Oil {{first arrived}} {{in the form of}} the Asiatic Petroleum Company Ltd, a sales company formed by Royal Dutch Petroleum and the British company Shell Transport and Trading Company, prior to their merger as Royal Dutch Shell. A licence was {{obtained}} in 1912 to store petroleum at Shell Haven, in iron tanks, each containing not more than 4,000 tonnes. The maximum storage allowed for the whole site was 80,000 tonnes. Refinery operations began on a 40 hectare (100 acre) site in 1916 with a distillation plant which produced fuel oil for the Admiralty. In 1919 this unit was converted to manufacture road surfacing bitumen. In 1925, a bench still was erected for the manufacture of lubricating oils; the first high <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils</b> were produced in 1937.Other plants were erected before the outbreak of war, including a blending plant for producing horticultural chemical products.|$|E

It {{has been reported}} that zinc and phosphorus emissions may damage catalytic converters and standard formulations of lubricating oils for gasoline engines now have reduced amounts of the additive due to the API limiting the concentration of this additive in new API SM and SN oils, however this only affects 20 and 30 grade [...] "ILSAC" [...] oils, 40 and higher grades have no regulation regarding the concentration of ZDDP except for diesel oils meeting the API CJ-4 specification which have had the level of zddp reduced slightly, although most diesel Heavy Duty Engine oils still have a higher concentration of this additive. [...] Crankcase oils with reduced ZDDP have been cited as causing damage to, or failure of, classic/collector car flat tappet camshafts and lifters which undergo very high boundary layer pressures and/or shear forces at their contact faces, and in other regions such as big-end/main bearings, and piston rings and pins. Roller camshafts/followers are more commonly used to reduce camshaft lobe friction in modern engines. There are additives, such as STP(R) Oil Treatment, and some racing oils such as PurOl, Brad Penn and Valvoline VR-1, which are available in the retail market with the necessary amount of ZDDP for engines using increased valve spring pressures. The same ZDDP compounds serve also as corrosion inhibitors and antioxidants.|$|E

Oil vapour concentrations were measured with a direct reading total hydrocarbon analyser with a flame ionisation detector. The results suggested average oil mist levels of 0. 5 - 4 mg/m 3 and oil vapour levels within 10 - 100 mg/m 3.

40|$|Predicting {{reservoir}} <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity</b> with numerical correlation equations using field-measured variables {{is widely}} used in the petroleum industry. Most published correlation equations, however, have never profoundly realized the genuine relationship between the reservoir <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity</b> and other field-measured parameters. Using the proposed systematic strategy is an effective solution for achieving a high performance correlation equation of reservoir <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity.</b> The proposed strategy begins with creating a large database of pressure-volumetemperature (PVT) reports and screening all possible erroneous data. The relationship between the <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity</b> and other field-measured parameters is intensively analyzed by using theoretical and empirical approaches to determine the influential parameters for correlating reservoir <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity</b> equations. The alternating conditional expectation (ACE) algorithm is applied for correlating saturated and undersaturated <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity</b> equations. The precision of field-measured PVT data is inspected by a data reconciliation technique in order to clarify the correctness of <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity</b> correlations. Finally, {{the performance of the}} proposed <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity</b> correlation equations is represented in terms of statistical error analysis functions. The result of this study shows that reservoir oil density {{turns out to be the}} most effective parameter for correlating both saturated and undersaturated reservoir <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity</b> equations.

30|$|BPR Installation on {{the casing}} reduces the <b>viscosity</b> of <b>oil</b> at the wellbore. The <b>oil</b> <b>viscosity</b> is {{inversely}} proportional to the terminal settling velocity of the sand grains.

40|$|The {{effects of}} oil viscosity, base oil temperature, and {{surface-active}} agents naturally present in mineral oils on the lubricating effectiveness of MoS 2 dispersions under boundary lubrication conditions are investigated. Friction and wear data are obtained from tests conducted under {{a wide range}} of oil viscosities and operating temperatures. The dispersion temperature at which the friction dropped below that obtained with the base oils, depended upon the base oil viscosity and the concentration of surface-active agents present in the oil. White oils showed reductions in friction before mineral oils of like viscosity, and lower <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils</b> showed reductions in friction before heavier <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils.</b> The results show that for a given base oil, wear increases as temperature increases, while the wear obtained from a MoS 2 dispersion made from the base oil remains approximately constant as temperature is increased...|$|E
30|$|Styrene {{reacted with}} butyl {{acrylate}} during suspension polymerization {{to form a}} copolymer, poly (styrene-co-butyl acrylate). Soft and flexible butyl acrylate chain segments prompted poly (styrene-co-butyl acrylate) chains to entangle {{with each other in}} spinning solution. Rigid polystyrene chains did not relax during electrospinning so that its fibrous membrane owned a morphological structure without beads; however, poly (styrene-co-butyl acrylate) chains relaxed at a faster rate to result in that the fibrous membrane fabricated from poly (styrene-co-butyl acrylate) had a morphological structure of beads-on-a-string. Extrusion rate and applied voltage imposed a great impact on the relaxation of polymer chains through affecting strain rate and fiber formation duration. The fibrous membranes prepared at different extrusion rates or applied voltages showed different morphological structures. Due to the different morphological structures, the fibrous membrane electrospun from poly (styrene-co-butyl acrylate) had a potential use as absorbent for low <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils</b> while electrospun polystyrene fibrous membrane could be used as absorbent for high <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|E

The viscosity–temperature plot for the oils used is shown in Fig.  11. The brine used was 3.5 % wt/wt NaCl. To generate homogeneous slurry, an anti-agglomerant “A” was used at 3 %v/v dosage with respect to brine for all watercuts.

The amount of hydrates formed was estimated from gas material balance and system PVT measurements. Tests were performed at 30, 50 and 70 % watercut.

Experimental results of friction power are compared with the novel use of non-intrusive acoustic emission (AE) technique to provide information pertaining to engine friction. Conventional method of friction assessment revealed that there is some improvement in reducing engine friction power when lower <b>viscosity</b> grade engine <b>oil</b> is used in place of recommended grade <b>viscosity</b> <b>oil.</b> These findings were corroborated with the modern AE technique which also indicated the benefits of using lower <b>viscosity</b> grade engine <b>oil</b> in reducing the friction.

30|$|Intermediate watercuts {{posed the}} {{greatest}} plugging risk {{for all the}} oils tested. This was attributed to phase separation which is prevalent in low <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils.</b> The oils used in this work did not form emulsions under the test conditions examined. The amount of transportable hydrates increased with oil viscosity. Generally hydrate slurries generated exhibited shear thinning behavior that increased with increasing hydrate volume fraction. However, the overall rheology of these slurries is a complex function of the oil used, watercut, gas added to the system and hydrate solid fraction. Lowering shear rates for high HVF systems resulted in separation.|$|E
30|$|The use of {{hot water}} is well {{established}} in thermal/steam oil recovery for high <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils</b> (Gray 1994). This can {{take the form of}} cyclic steam soaks, steam drive, well bore heating or—for thicker hydrocarbon-bearing regions, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). The main purpose of the heating is to mobilise the hydrocarbons by heat-induced temporary reduction of the viscosity or by a form of stripping to remove the lighter fractions. The same is true for oil sands, although this is usually carried out as a kind of surface mining operation with intensive treatment in site processing plants. Similar considerations apply to systems for oil shales where mining, crushing, ash-forming mineral removal, but most importantly the liberating heating (or “retorting”) process are applied.|$|E

30|$|Application Various {{heavy oil}} {{components}} {{of interest to}} the petroleum industry become accessible if they are produced exploiting more than merely the heating properties of hot water. The sources include oil sands, kerogenic deposits (“oil shales”) and indeed normal oil reservoirs with high <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils.</b> The enablers are the properties of near critical water: enhanced solubility and higher cracking potential due to higher water dissociation near the critical point. The optimum points of operation are not the same for the solubilisation and cracking processes. Whereas many oil shales schemes require long term heat soaking to stimulate and simulate the maturation associated with traditional catagenesis, exploitation of the enhanced properties associated with near critical water indicate that judicious p, T operation would achieve this with shorter times and lower energy inputs. This may enable increased efficiency of operation and yields from many more reservoirs than are currently considered viable.|$|E
30|$|Hydrate {{slurries}} generated without anti-agglomerant showed {{high shear}} thinning behavior and higher viscosities compared to systems with AAs. Also, shear thinning behavior increased with increasing hydrate volume fraction. Without AA hydrates agglomeration result in early onset of exponential viscosity increase and early deviation from Newtonian rheology. Use of AAs minimize agglomeration and dispersed slurries exhibit Newtonian rheology. Newtonian slurries display gradual increase in viscosity with increase in HVF. However, at high HVF AAs fail and agglomeration occurs. Slurries that experience severe agglomeration flow with a radial solid concentration gradient exhibit shear thinning rheology. This suggests that shear thinning (or non-Newtonian) behavior of hydrate slurries {{is associated with}} particle interaction, agglomeration and solid concentration gradient. When high <b>viscosity</b> <b>oils</b> were used, the resulting slurries exhibited less shear thinning effects and less viscosity increase with increasing hydrate volume fraction. This suggests that for the same AA dosage, AA performance is enhanced by high oil viscosity.|$|E

Air entrainment is a common problem in marine fuel transfer (bunkering) operations, which can induce measurement errors in many metering technologies. The latest generation of Coriolis mass flow meters is able to operate in both single- and two-phase (oil-air) flow conditions.

40|$|When a low <b>viscosity</b> <b>oil</b> droplet is laid on {{the surface}} of a high <b>viscosity</b> <b>oil</b> liquid, it stays at rest for a moment before coalescencing.

In this case, the droplet basically bounces on the interface. We observe that the conditions for bouncing depends on the frequency, more precisely we observe resonance when the Eigenfrequency of the droplet is excited. Lord Rayleigh expressed the droplet deformation modes in terms of spherical harmonics Y_ℓ^m. We present different experimental modes of deformation with the corresponding spherical harmonic model with ℓ= 2, 3, 4 and 5. In some conditions, the droplet is excited along a non axi-symmetric mode of deformation (m 0). That leads to a rotation of the droplet and to a horizontal displacement...|$|R

The rotor main bearing can also fail due to various problems like low oil pressure, and a lower <b>viscosity</b> <b>oil</b> was recommended in the North American market. The oil pan has a common problem of being crushed or bent during maintenance and can decrease the oil pickup tube flow causing main bearing failures as well. Modified Renesis engines can experience side seal failures due to a combination of exhaust back pressure and higher exhaust temperature. Overheating and heat expansion of housings can cause seals in the rotary engine to fail as well.

This paper describes the development and testing of a Coriolis two-phase flow metering solution for nitrogen/synthetic oil mixtures with viscosities ranging from 50 cSt to 500 cSt, and with Gas Volume Fractions (GVFs) ranging from 0 % to 90 %. Formal trials took place at the UK National Flow Laboratory. A single synthetic oil was used; its viscosity was adjusted by controlling temperature. The results show that Coriolis metering is well suited to high viscosity oil/gas mixtures: in the formalized trials, mass flow errors for gas were mostly within 5 % and for liquid were mostly within 2. 5 %.
