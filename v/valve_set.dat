25|$|Valve added random skin rewards {{as part of}} {{an update}} to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in 2013, believing that players would use these to trade with other players and bolster both the player {{community}} and its Steam marketplace. A number of websites were created to bypass monetary restrictions <b>Valve</b> <b>set</b> on the Steam marketplace to aid in high-value trading and allowing users to receive cash value for skins. Some of these sites subsequently added the ability to gamble on the results of professional matches or in games of chance with these skins, which in 2016 was estimated to handle around $5 billion of the virtual goods. These sites, along with Valve and various video game streamers, have come under scrutiny due to ethical and legal questions relating to gambling on sporting matches, underage gambling, undisclosed promotion, and outcome rigging. Evidence of such unethical practices was discovered in June 2016, and led to two formal lawsuits filed against these sites and Valve in the following month. Valve subsequently has taken steps to stop such sites from using Steam's interface for enabling gambling, leading to about half of these sites to close down, while driving more of the skin gambling into an underground economy.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, Westinghouse Air Brake {{supplied}} High Speed Control {{brake equipment}} for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains.

50|$|The {{pressure}} of the expanded steam is {{less than that of}} steam supplied directly from the boiler.

50|$|It is {{also common}} {{to find that}} {{refrigerant}} begins to evaporate immediately after the expansion valve, before arriving to the evaporator. This may also be considered as flash-gas but normally doesn’t produce complications in the refrigeration cycle. Many refrigeration systems have the expansion <b>valve</b> <b>set</b> up inside the room being cooled, consequently generating productive refrigeration if absorbing heat from the room, to produce this kind of flash-gas between the expansion and the evaporator. Besides, the expansion valve deregulates its operation if the fluid arriving to it is boiling. In this case, the boiling occurs after the expansion.|$|E

40|$|Background: Hydrocephalus causes {{impaired}} gait, balance, cognition and continence, all {{of which}} can be reversed by shunt treatment. Adjustable valves are commonly used in the shunt treatment of hydrocephalus but randomized controlled trials (RCT) are scarce. The aim of the present thesis was to evaluate adjustable valves in the treatment of hydrocephalus. Patients and Methods: In Study I, 450 hydrocephalus patients undergoing primary shunt insertion were followed over 10 years to investigate the short-term perioperative risk factors of shunt surgery. In Study II the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and ICP wave amplitude (AMP), valve settings and body positions were studied in 15 hydrocephalus patients. During the shunt operation an intraparenchymatous ICP-sensor was simultaneously inserted and ICP/AMP analyzed with the shunt ligated and when opened at different opening pressures and body positions. A double-centered RCT was conducted in studies III and IV, including 68 patients with iNPH. The patients received a ventricular shunt and were randomized into two groups; in one group (20 - 4) the <b>valve</b> was initially <b>set</b> to 20 cm H 2 O and gradually reduced to 4 cm H 2 O {{over the course of the}} 6 month study period. In the other group (12), the <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> was kept at a medium level of 12 cm H 2 O during the whole study period. In study III the time to and type of complications and overdrainage symptoms were recorded. In Study IV clinical variables were continuously compared between the two groups. Results: In total, 538 patients were included and the six month shunt revision rate was 19 %. Fifty-four percent of the patients received adjustable valves. Both adjustable valves and right frontal placement of the shunt were associated with a lower shunt revision rate, but not independently. ICP and AMP decreased significantly when the shunt was opened but the difference in ICP between the highest and lowest valve settings (in vivo) was smaller than previous measurements in vitro. Gradual reduction of the <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> from 20 to 4 cm H 2 O neither improved clinical outcome nor the complication rate, compared to a fixed <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> at 12 cm H 2 O. The clinical improvement was seen within 3 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Gradual reduction of the <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> from a high to a low level neither improved the clinical outcome nor the complication rate, compared to a fixed <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> at medium level. The pressure window in an adjustable valve is narrower in vivo than in vitro. ICP in the upright position is significantly different from the supine position. Right frontal shunt placement and the use of adjustable valves were associated with a lower shunt revision rate, but a coincidence of these two variables was found...|$|R

50|$|The ASME code requires, in {{addition}} to very conservative design of the vessel and its fittings, the installation of a code-stamped safety <b>valve</b> <b>set</b> at the design pressure.

While this triggering of the valve will relieve any possible overpressure in the vessel, {{it must also be}} able to keep the pressure source, whatever it is, from pushing enough air, inert gas, or steam in to bring the pressure back up to an unsafe level even with the safety valve wide open.|$|E

50|$|Another common {{issue is}} that {{regulators}} are required to operate outside of their design limits when making the corrections needed for thermal expansion and contraction.
