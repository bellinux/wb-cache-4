40|$|Can recent {{developments}} in video projection techniques aid us in finding new ways of expressing our creativity and creative audio-visual works on a new surface other than the screen? <b>Video</b> <b>Mapping</b> {{is one of the}} newest video projection techniques that are used to turn almost any surface into a dynamic video display. The aim of <b>video</b> <b>mapping</b> is to create a physical illusion of images by combining audio-visual elements. Most of the mapping projects are used in fashion shows, corporate events, concerts and theatrical performances. Lately a new trend of <b>video</b> <b>mapping</b> system is being used on architectural and historical structures, buildings and displayed in public spaces to reach a wider audience. This paper will focus on 3 aspects of <b>video</b> <b>mapping</b> and its application; 1) the technical aspects of <b>video</b> <b>mapping</b> and its tools. 2) the conceptual development of the project YEKPARE and the application of <b>video</b> <b>mapping</b> on Haydarpasa Terminal within the Istanbul 2010 European Capital of Culture events. 3) the feedback from the audiences who have experienced the performance and the effects of <b>video</b> <b>mapping...</b>|$|R

This allowed telescope operators to identify satellites, and also to identify - and catalog - potentially dangerous space debris.|$|E

30|$|The {{original}} iteration of COPUS {{can capture}} a complex array of classroom behaviors; however, {{it can become}} unwieldy for comparison and analysis (Smith et al. 2014). To provide a more streamlined {{way of looking at}} the data, an updated version of COPUS (Smith et al. 2014) condenses the original 25 codes into four categories for instructor behaviors and four categories for student behaviors (see Table  1). The two most important instructor behaviors from the collapsed categories for discriminating between active and passive learning practices are guiding and presenting, respectively. Instructor behaviors such as posing and answering questions, asking and following up on clicker questions, among others, map onto the collapsed category of guiding, which we contend reflects instructors’ use of active learning practices. Whereas instructor practices such as lecturing, writing on the board, or showing a demonstration or <b>video</b> <b>map</b> onto the collapsed category of presenting, which we contend reflects instructors’ use of passive learning practices.|$|E

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{interactive video}} maps for the web. The main component of video maps is a video stream that is areally georeferenced to a spatial reference {{system in the}} same way rectified raster orthoimages are georeferenced. The areal georeference allows for interactivity that goes beyond the play, pause, and stop functionality of video player software. We highlight two types of functionality, allowing the user to (1) combine the video stream layer with other raster and vector map layers and (2) adjust the projection of the map in real time. We exemplify video maps by A Year in the Life of Earth&# 039;s CO 2, an interactive <b>video</b> <b>map</b> that visualizes the results of a high-resolution NASA computer model of global atmospheric carbon dioxide distribution. The map shows how carbon dioxide travels around the globe over the course of one year. We use a combination of WebGL, a programming interface to the hardware-accelerated graphics pipeline, and HTML 5 video for adding an areally georeferenced video layer to other map layers, and for the on the fly projection of the video stream in the web browser...|$|E
40|$|The Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS) {{provides}} {{physical security}} for Department of Defense bases and depots using autonomous unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) {{to patrol the}} site while operating payloads for intruder detection and assessment, barrier assessment, and product assessment. MDARS is in the System Development and Demonstration acquisition phase and is currently undergoing developmental testing including an Early User Appraisal (EUA) at the Hawthorne Army Depot, Nevada- the world’s largest army depot. The Multiple Resource Host Architecture (MRHA) allows the human guard force to command and control several MDARS platforms simultaneously. The MRHA graphically displays <b>video,</b> <b>map,</b> and status for each resource using wireless digital communications for integrated data, video, and audio. Events are prioritized and the user is prompted with audio alerts and text instructions for alarms and warnings. The MRHA also interfaces to remote resources to automate legacy physical devices such as fence gate controls, garage doors, and remote power on/off capability for the MDARS patrol units. This paper provides an overview {{and history of the}} MDARS program and control station software with details on the installation and operation at Hawthorne Army Depot, including discussions on scenarios for EUA excursions.

40|$|Georeferenced video mosaicing – an {{approach}} for advanced seafloor mapping Quantitative analysis of seabed features in video images is {{of a great}} importance for numerous underwater applications. It is particularly interesting to produce mosaics from the seabed to create a <b>video</b> <b>map</b> whose extent is far larger than the size of a still camera image. The MATISSE ® system (Mosaicing Advanced Technologies included in a Single Software Environment developed by Ifremer) is based upon image and signal processing components and produces on-line and off-line geo-referenced mosaics of the seabed by given video input and navigation data (Allais et al., 2004; Vincent et al. 2003). The resulting mosaics can be represented in a dedicated environment as a GIS enabling a further image analyses and linkages to other georeferenced data. The whole algorithm to produce geo-referenced mosaics is performed by different steps as lighting correction, camera self-calibration, and mosaic post-processing. Lighting correction is necessary because in case of deep underwater vehicle applications, videos are acquired using an artificial lighting. In general, a non-uniform intensity distribution is produced within the image and this can have negative effects on the mosaic processing and rendering. The intensity correction in an underwater environment was investigated in Borgetto et al. (2003). Since the marine environment is subject to varying optical conditions and since existing uncalibrated video data can be considered, tools for automated camera calibration without external means are required. A specific method has bee...|$|E
