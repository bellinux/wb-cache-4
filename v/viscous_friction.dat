25|$|Fanno flow {{refers to}} {{adiabatic}} flow through a constant area duct where {{the effect of}} friction is considered. Compressibility effects often come into consideration, although the Fanno flow model certainly also applies to incompressible flow. For this model, the duct area remains constant, the flow {{is assumed to be}} steady and one-dimensional, and no mass is added within the duct. The Fanno flow model is considered an irreversible process due to viscous effects. The <b>viscous</b> <b>friction</b> causes the flow properties to change along the duct. The frictional effect is modeled as a shear stress at the wall acting on the fluid with uniform properties over any cross section of the duct.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, high Reynolds numbers (Re>>1) {{indicate}} that the inertial effects have more effect on the velocity field than the <b>viscous</b> (<b>friction)</b> effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an inviscid flow, an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the Navier–Stokes equations to be simplified into the Euler equations. The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields Bernoulli's equation. When, {{in addition to being}} inviscid, the flow is irrotational everywhere, Bernoulli's equation can completely describe the flow everywhere. Such flows are called potential flows, because the velocity field may be expressed as the gradient of a potential energy expression.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the nozzle is important. Consider a balloon {{propelled}} by air {{coming out of a}} tapering nozzle. In such a case the combination of air pressure and <b>viscous</b> <b>friction</b> is such that the nozzle does not push the balloon but is pulled by it. Using a convergent/divergent nozzle gives more force since the exhaust also presses on it as it expands outwards, roughly doubling the total force. If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains. Note {{that in the case of}} liquid propellant engines, the pumps moving the propellant into the combustion chamber must maintain a pressure larger than the combustion chamber -typically on the order of 100 atmospheres.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{scientific}} consensus, {{the occurrence of}} the paradox {{is due to the}} neglected effects of viscosity. [...] In conjunction with scientific experiments, there were huge advances in the theory of <b>viscous</b> fluid <b>friction</b> during the 19th century. With respect to the paradox, this culminated in the discovery and description of thin boundary layers by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904.

5000|$|The {{braking force}} of an {{eddy current brake}} is exactly {{proportional}} to the velocity V, so it acts similar to <b>viscous</b> <b>friction</b> in a liquid. The braking force decreases as the velocity decreases. When the conductive sheet is stationary, the magnetic field through each {{part of it is}} constant, not changing with time, so no eddy currents are induced, and there is no force between the magnet and the conductor.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} new general framework, i. e. hybrid {{modeling}}, for the modeling of systems submitted to friction. The proposed hybrid model has two modes (states) : one models the system sliding, the second the system sticking.

This capability is shown for the most common behaviors encountered experimentally and comparisons with other models presented in the literature are carried out. Also, the simulation parameters of the hybrid modeling is addressed. The literature proposes many models and methods of parameters identification. These works are generally validated in simulation or on system with sensors and actuators of high precision. This paper focuses then on modeling and identifying complex mechanical system with low resolution sensors. To validate the hybrid model and its method of identification in case of low sensor resolution, a real clutch-by-wire is studied.

40|$|Ionic {{electro-active}} polymers (E. A. P.) is {{an active}} material consisting in a polyelectrolyte (for example Nafion). Such material is usually used as thin film sandwiched between two platinum electrodes. The polymer undergoes large bending motions when an electric field is applied across the thickness. Conversely, a voltage can be detected between both electrodes when the polymer is suddenly bent. The solvent-saturated polymer is fully dissociated, releasing cations of small size. We used a continuous medium approach. The material is modelled by the coexistence of two phases; it {{can be considered as}} a porous medium where the deformable solid phase is the polymer backbone with fixed anions; the electrolyte phase is made of a solvent (usually water) with free cations. The microscale conservation laws of mass, linear momentum and energy and the Maxwell's equations are first written for each phase. The physical quantities linked to the interfaces are deduced. The use of an average technique applied to the two-phase medium finally leads to an Eulerian formulation of the conservation laws of the complete material. Macroscale equations relative to each phase provides exchanges through the interfaces.
