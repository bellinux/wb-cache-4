50|$|The DEC 4000 AXP {{uses the}} KFA40 I/O module, which {{contains}} the entire I/O subsystem. The I/O module {{is the largest}} module in the system, and two variants existed. The first <b>variant</b> <b>offered</b> four SCSI-2 buses and two Ethernet ports and the second <b>variant</b> <b>offered</b> four DSSI/SCSI buses and one Ethernet port. The second variant however only has half the bandwidth of the SCSI-2 buses of the first variant, although the advanced features of DSSI justified its use in some cases.

5000|$|Besides {{enhanced}} penetration capabilities, these overpressure <b>variants</b> <b>offer</b> a flatter trajectory and lessened recoil. The {{increase in}} service pressure causes {{a rise in}} bolt thrust, so {{the use of this}} overpressure ammunition induces more stress on critical weapon parts during firing.

These approaches and several <b>variants</b> <b>offer</b> new computational and classifier characteristics that lend themselves to particular applications...|$|R
