40|$|Interests in vehicle {{fuel economy}} have {{increased}} {{in the past few}} years with the implementations of more stringent CAFE standard in USA and mandatory carbon emission standard in the EU. We seek to understand the effects of recent policies such as restructuring of <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Excise</b> <b>Duties</b> and EU standard on new vehicle fuel economy in the UK. In the past few years there have been substantial fluctuations in income and fuel prices, offering an interesting testing ground to understand their impact on the demand for fuel economy in vehicles. We use a monthly dataset to find that the emission standard is the largest driver for fuel economy improvements in recent years. Also, contrary to some recent findings in Europe and in UK, we find that income has an effect and that the recession had some role in improving the fuel economy. The effects of fuel prices were relatively small. Restructuring of the VED also improved new vehicle fuel economy in the UK, but the scrappage scheme had no significant effect. Results indicate that both supply and demand side policies are effective in improving fuel economy, although quantitatively the emission standard appears more effective due to its stringency. It is also important to consider the effects of income while devising demand side policies...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} to a low carbon transport world requires a host of demand and supply policies to be developed and deployed. Pricing and taxation of vehicle ownership plays a major role, as it affects purchasing behavior, overall ownership and use of vehicles. There is a lack in robust assessments {{of the life cycle}} energy and environmental effects of a number of key car pricing and taxation instruments, including graded purchase taxes, <b>vehicle</b> <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> and <b>vehicle</b> scrappage incentives. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring which type of vehicle taxation accelerates fuel, technology and purchasing behavioral transitions the fastest with (i) most tailpipe and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions savings, (ii) potential revenue neutrality for the Treasury and (iii) no adverse effects on car ownership and use. The UK Transport Carbon Model was developed further and used to assess long term scenarios of low carbon fiscal policies and their effects on transport demand, vehicle stock evolution, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. The modeling results suggest that policy choice, design and timing can play crucial roles in meeting multiple policy goals. Both CO 2 grading and tightening of CO 2 limits over time are crucial in achieving the {{transition to}} low carbon mobility. Of the policy scenarios investigated here the more ambitious and complex car purchase tax and feebate policies are most effective in accelerating low carbon technology uptake, reducing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and, if designed carefully, can avoid overburdening consumers with ever more taxation whilst ensuring revenue neutrality. Highly graduated road taxes (or VED) can also be successful in reducing emissions; but while they can provide handy revenue streams to governments that could be recycled in accompanying low carbon measures they are likely to face opposition by the driving population and car lobby groups. Scrappage schemes are found to save little carbon and may even increase emissions on a life cycle basis. The main policy implication of this work is that in order to reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from transport governments should focus on designing incentive schemes with strong up-front price signals that reward 'low carbon' and penalize 'high carbon'. Policy instruments should also be subject to early scrutiny of the longer term impacts on government revenue and pay attention to the need for flanking policies to boost these revenues and maintain the marginal cost of driving...|$|R

25|$|The {{competition}} from road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced the revenue {{available to the}} railways, even though the needs for maintenance on the network had never been higher, as investment had been deferred over the past decade. Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage {{through the construction of}} roads subsidised by the taxpayer, while restricting the rail industry's ability to use flexible pricing because it was held to nationally agreed rate cards. The government response was to commission several inconclusive reports; the Salter Report of 1933 finally recommended that road transport should be taxed directly to fund the roads and increased <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Excise</b> <b>Duty</b> and fuel duties were introduced. It also noted that many small lines would never be likely to compete with road haulage. Although these road pricing changes helped their survival, the railways entered a period of slow decline, owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles.|$|E

40|$|As part of {{environmental}} fiscal reform initiatives the South African government proposed, inter alia, increases in <b>vehicle</b> customs and <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> (ad valorem) and the licensing fees of fuel-inefficient vehicles. Consequently it is {{proposed that the}} existing ad valorem <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> on motor <b>vehicles</b> be adjusted to incorporate carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions as an environmental criterion from 1 March 2010. The purpose of these proposed vehicle green taxes is to discourage the acquisition and use of vehicles with higher carbon dioxide emissions and fuel-inefficient vehicles. The prospects of it achieving the aforementioned purpose could however {{be affected by the}} design of the proposed vehicle green taxes and the provisions of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. An extended literature review (non-empirical study) was performed. Literature on studies in Japan, European Union countries and fiscal reform instruments implemented in United States were reviewed. Certain weaknesses in, and alternatives for, the proposed vehicle green taxes were noted. The focus on consumers is probably the most important weakness which could be addressed by the implementation of a “feebate” policy (with the focus on vehicle manufacturers and “fuel economy technology”). Based on {{the findings of this study}} it is also apparent that certain provisions of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 do allow for a tax deduction if the proposed vehicle green taxes are incurred (depending on the category of the taxpayer). The possible tax deduction could impair the ability of the proposed vehicle green taxes affecting purchasing and usage behaviour. As section 23 (d), of Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, currently does not prohibit these deductions possible amendments thereto should also be considered.

40|$|Despite its {{selective}} nature, the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> {{is one of}} themost effective {{sources of}} the state budget revenues. A fundamental influence on the receipts from this source is exercised by: the kinds and number of articles recognized as excisable and the volume of their sales {{in the country and}} of their imports, the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, the extent of granted allowances and exemptions, as well as the efficiency in collecting the revenues from this duty. The range of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> applicability is very large and covers a great number of articles, many of them of no significant fiscal importance. At the same time, the list of allowances and exemptions introduced both by acts of Parliament or by ordinances of government bodies is excessively extended. The bulk of revenues obtained from the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> comes from taxation of alcoholic beverages, tobacco articles and fuels, while the source of greatest importance is the duty on domestic sales of goods that, in 1994 - 2001, provided on average 87. 7 % of the total <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> revenues. The taxation of imports played a much smaller role. The rates of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> burden are relatively high and since the start of their functioning have been many times modified. However, in recent years a trend towards stabilizing the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, and even towards reducing some of them, can be observed.
