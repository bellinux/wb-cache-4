40|$|The {{goal of the}} VISCOS {{project is}} to develop {{enabling}} techniques for cognitive vision {{that can be applied}} in various IT-systems, and to demonstrate these in prototypes and implementations. The project, which started in 2003, involves computer <b>vision</b> <b>groups</b> from KTH, Linköping University and Lund University. It sponsors 6 PhD students and 7 postdoctoral researchers. During the first year 15 publications have been generated and 1 PhD degree and 1 licentiate degree have been awarded with partial support from the program. The consortium has an extensive international collaboration, especially through on-going and future EU-projects and the EC Vision Network on cognitive vision. The Stockholm Workshop on Computational Vision was arranged and the project also contributed to a European summer school. Two systems for handheld camera applications have been developed in industrial collaborations. 2 1 Program overview and research results Please see the previous page for an executive summary in under 1000 characters.

40|$|AbstractTemporal {{information}} promotes visual {{grouping of}} local image features into global spatial form. However, experiments demonstrating time-based grouping typically confound two {{potential sources of}} information: temporal synchrony (precise timing of changes) and temporal structure (pattern of changes over time). Here, we show that observers prefer temporal structure for determining perceptual organization. That is, human <b>vision</b> <b>groups</b> elements that change according to the same global pattern, even if the changes themselves are not synchronous. This finding prompts an important, testable prediction concerning the neural mechanisms of binding: patterns of neural spiking over time {{may be more important}} than absolute spike synchrony...|$|R
