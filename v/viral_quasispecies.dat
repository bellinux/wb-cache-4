Phylogenetic analysis of C 2 –C 5 envelope nucleotide sequences was used for HIV- 1 subtype classification. Forty-two of 53 samples (79 %) showed a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) suggestive of transmission of a single quasispecies, while 21 % showed infection with multiple quasispecies. No differences among HIV- 1 subtypes were found in the proportion of single to multiple quasispecies transmitted in-utero (Likelihood ratio test, P = 0. 83), nor were differences found among single to multiple quasispecies transmitted and maternal viral load (Mann–Whitney test, P = 0. 44). This suggests that differences in perinatal transmission between subtypes we previously observed in this cohort could not be associated with the likelihood for multiple independent infections during in-utero infections...|$|R

40|$|Despite recent {{treatment}} advances, {{the majority}} of patients with chronic hepatitis C fail to respond to antiviral therapy. Although the genetic basis for this resistance is unknown, accumulated evidence suggests that changes in the heterogeneous <b>viral</b> population (<b>quasispecies)</b> {{may be an important}} determinant of viral persistence and response to therapy. Sequences within hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope 1 and envelope 2 genes, inclusive of the hypervariable region 1, were analyzed in parallel with the level of viral replication in serial serum samples obtained from 23 patients who exhibited different patterns of response to therapy and from untreated controls. Our study provides evidence that although the viral diversity before treatment does not predict the response to treatment, the early emergence and dominance of a single viral variant distinguishes patients who will have a sustained therapeutic response from those who subsequently will experience a breakthrough or relapse. A dramatic reduction in genetic diversity leading to an increasingly homogeneous viral population was a consistent feature associated with viral clearance in sustained responders and was independent of HCV genotype. The persistence of variants present before treatment in patients who fail to respond or who experience a breakthrough during therapy strongly suggests the preexistence of viral strains with inherent resistance to IFN. Thus, the study of the evolution of the HCV quasispecies provides prognostic information as early as the first 2 weeks after starting therapy and opens perspectives for elucidating the mechanisms of treatment failure in chronic hepatitis C...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) inhibit {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection by targeting viral {{proteins that}} play essential {{roles in the}} replication process. However, selection of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) during DAA therapy has been a cause of therapeutic failure. In this study, we wished to address whether such RAVs could be controlled by the co-administration of host-targeting entry inhibitors that prevent intrahepatic viral spread. Design: We investigated {{the effect of adding}} an entry inhibitor (the anti-scavenger receptor class B type I mAb 1671) to a DAA monotherapy (the protease inhibitor ciluprevir) in human-liver mice chronically infected with HCV of genotype 1 b. Clinically relevant non-laboratory strains were used to achieve viraemia consisting of a cloud of related <b>viral</b> variants (<b>quasispecies)</b> and the emergence of RAVs was monitored at high resolution using next-generation sequencing. Results: HCV-infected human-liver mice receiving DAA monotherapy rapidly experienced on-therapy viral breakthrough. Deep sequencing of the HCV protease domain confirmed the manifestation of drug-resistant mutants upon viral rebound. In contrast, none of the mice treated with a combination of the DAA and the entry inhibitor experienced on-therapy viral breakthrough, despite detection of RAV emergence in some animals. Conclusions: This study provides preclinical in vivo evidence that addition of an entry inhibitor to an anti-HCV DAA regimen restricts the breakthrough of DAA-resistant viruses. Our approach is an excellent strategy to prevent therapeutic failure caused by on-therapy rebound of DAA-RAVs. Inclusion of an entry inhibitor to the newest DAA combination therapies may further increase response rates, especially in difficult-to-treat patient populations...|$|R

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is {{recognized}} and cleaved in vitro by RNase P enzyme near the AUG start codon. Because RNase P identifies transfer RNA (tRNA) precursors, {{it has been}} proposed that HCV RNA adopts structural similarities to tRNA. Here, we present experimental evidence of RNase P sensitivity conservation in natural RNA variant sequences, including a mutant sequence (A 368 –G) selected in vitro because it presented changes in the RNA structure of the relevant motif. The variation did not abrogate the original RNase P cleavage, but instead, it allowed a second cleavage at least 10 times more efficient, 4 nt downstream from the original one. The minimal RNA fragment that confers sensitivity to human RNase P enzyme was located between positions 299 and 408 (110 nt). Therefore, most of the tRNA-like domain resides within the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element. In the variant, in which the mutation stabilizes a 4 nt stem–loop, the second cleavage required a shorter (60 nt) substrate, internal to the minimal fragment substrate, conforming a second tRNA-like structure with similarities to a ‘Russian-doll’ toy. This new structure did not impair IRES activity, albeit slightly reduced the efficiency of translation both in vitro and in transfected cells. Conservation of the original tRNA-like conformation together with preservation of IRES activity points to an essential role for this motif. This conservation {{is compatible with the}} presence of RNA structures with different complexity around the AUG start codon within a single <b>viral</b> population (<b>quasispecies)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a {{major cause}} of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma. Studies of HCV replication and pathogenesis have so far been hampered by the lack of an efficient tissue culture system for propagating HCV in vitro. Although HCV is primarily a hepatotropic virus, an increasing body of evidence suggests that HCV also replicates in extrahepatic tissues in natural infection. In this study, we established a B-cell line (SB) from an HCV-infected non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. HCV RNA and proteins were detectable by RNase protection assay and immunoblotting. The cell line continuously produces infectious HCV virions in culture. The virus particles produced from the culture had a buoyant density of 1. 13 to 1. 15 g/ml in sucrose and could infect primary human hepatocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and an established B-cell line (Raji cells) in vitro. The virus from SB cells belongs to genotype 2 b. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism and sequence analysis of the <b>viral</b> RNA <b>quasispecies</b> indicated that the virus present in SB cells most likely originated from the patient's spleen and had an HCV RNA quasispecies pattern distinct from that in the serum. The virus production from the infected primary hepatocytes showed cyclic variations. In addition, we have succeeded in establishing several Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-cell lines from PBMCs of HCV-positive patients. Two of these cell lines are positive for HCV RNA as detected by reverse transcriptase PCR and for the nonstructural protein NS 3 by immunofluorescence staining.

40|$|Background: Mother-to-child {{transmission}} of HIV- 1 remains {{a significant problem}} in the resource-constrained settings where anti-retroviral therapy is still not widely available. Understanding the earliest events during HIV- 1 transmission and characterizing the newly transmitted or founder virus is central to intervention efforts. In this study, we analyzed the <b>viral</b> env <b>quasispecies</b> of six mother-infant transmission pairs (MIPs) and characterized the genetic features of envelope glycoprotein that could influence HIV- 1 subtype C perinatal transmission. Methodology and Findings: The V 1 -V 5 region of env was amplified from 6 MIPs baseline samples and 334 DNA sequences in total were analyzed. A comparison of the viral population derived from the mother and infant revealed a severe genetic bottleneck occurring during perinatal transmission, which was characterized by low sequence diversity in the infant. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that most likely in all our infant subjects a single founder virus was responsible for establishing infection. Furthermore, the newly transmitted viruses from the infant had significantly fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites in Env V 1 -V 5 region and showed a propensity to encode shorter variable loops compared to the nontransmitted viruses. In addition, a similar intensity of selection was seen between mothers and infants with {{a higher rate of}} synonymous (dS) compared to nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions evident (dN/dS 3 ̆c 1). Conclusions: Our results indicate that a strong genetic bottleneck occurs during perinatal {{transmission of}} HIV- 1 subtype C. This is evident through population diversity and phylogenetic patterns where a single viral variant appears to be responsible for infection in the infants. As a result the newly transmitted viruses are less diverse and harbored significantly less glycosylated envelope. This suggests that viruses with the restricted glycosylation in envelope glycoprotein appeared to be preferentially transmitted during HIV- 1 subtype C perinatal transmission. In addition, our findings also indicated that purifying selection appears to predominate in shaping the early intrahost evolution of HIV- 1 subtype C envelope sequences...|$|R

A prospective study (CoPanFlu-RUN) was carried out in Reunion Island to characterize pH 1 N 1 genetic variability and molecular evolution occurring in population during the pH 1 N 1 Influenza pandemic in 2009. Methodology: We directly amplified pH 1 N 1 genomes from 28 different nasal swabs (26 individuals from 21 households). Fifteen strains were fully sequenced and 13 partially. This includes pairs of sequences from different members of 5 separate households; and two pairs from individuals, collected at different times. We assessed the molecular evolution of pH 1 N 1 by genetic variability and phylogenetic analyses. Principal Findings: We found that i) Reunion pH 1 N 1 sequences stemmed from global "clade 7 '' but shaped two phylogenetic sub-clades; ii) D 239 E mutation was identified in the hemagglutinin protein of all Reunion sequences, a mutation which has been associated elsewhere with mild-, upper-respiratory tract pH 1 N 1 infecting strains; iii) Date estimates from molecular phylogenies predicted clade emergence some time before the first detection of pH 1 N 1 by the epidemiological surveillance system; iv) Phylogenetic relatedness was observed between Reunion pH 1 N 1 viruses and those from other countries in South-western Indian Ocean area; v) Quasispecies populations were observed within households and individuals of the cohort-study.

Despite extensive evidence of lethal mutagenesis of RNA viruses by different mutagenic compounds, a detailed picture of the infectivity of individual genomes and its relationship with the mutations accumulated is lacking. Here, we report a molecular analysis of a foot-and-mouth disease virus population previously subjected to heavy mutagenesis to determine whether a correlation between increased mutagenesis and decreased fitness existed. Plaque-purified viruses isolated from a ribavirintreated quasispecies presented decreases of up to 200 -fold in infectivity relative to clones in the reference population, associated with an overall eightfold increase in the mutation frequency. This observation suggests that individual infectious genomes of a quasispecies subjected to increased mutagenesis lose infectivity by their continuous mutagenic 'poisoning'. These results support the lethal defection model of virus extinction and the practical use of chemical mutagens as antiviral treatment. Even when extinction is not achieved, mutagenesis can decrease the infectivity of surviving virus, and facilitate their clearance by host immune responses or complementing antiviral approaches. © 2013 SGM.

40|$|The {{degree of}} change in the {{nucleotide}} sequence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) that occurs when it is transmitted sexually from one individual to another or vertically from mother to child is unknown. Previous studies have shown that most cultured HIV- 1 isolates from the same individuals differed in the entire envelope gene nucleotide sequence by up to 2 %, although most isolates from unrelated individuals differed by 6 - 22 %. To examine diversity among HIV- 1 isolates from close contacts, we determined the nucleotide sequences of viruses from a family with a known epidemiologic profile, in which a woman transmitted HIV- 1 heterosexually to her partner and vertically to her daughter. Direct DNA sequence analysis of primary HIV- 1 isolates amplified by PCR was used to distinguish the major and minor <b>viral</b> sequences, termed <b>quasispecies,</b> to rapidly determine the predominant sequences and their phylogenetic relationships. The nucleotide sequence diversity of a major portion of the HIV- 1 envelope gene was 3. 7 % between isolates from the woman and her heterosexual partner and 8. 5 % between isolates from this woman and her daughter, who had been infected for a longer period than the partner. The configuration of the phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the daughter's predominant isolate evolved from a progenitor of her mother's current strain. This study provides evidence of a continuous spectrum of sequence diversity between any two isolates ranging from those derived from the same person to those from close contacts and, ultimately, those from unrelated individuals. These data and methods can be applied to epidemiologic investigations of possible HIV- 1 transmission between health care workers and their patients...|$|R
