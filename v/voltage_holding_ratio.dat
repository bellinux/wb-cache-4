40|$|In our studies, it was {{confirmed}} that the cause of image sticking on liquid crystal (LC) cells is based on attacks of electrostatic discharge (ESD), which can be greatly relieved by doping {{with a small amount of}} tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanoparticles. Our proposed remedy allows the residual time of image sticking to be significantly reduced by more than an order and may protect the LC displays against any adverse ESD conditions, thus enhancing the overall display quality and reliability. In this study, conventional voltage-transmittance (V-T) characterization, <b>voltage</b> <b>holding</b> <b>ratio</b> (VHR) measurement, and ESD testing were employed to investigate the properties of the ITO-doped LCs.

40|$|The <b>voltage</b> <b>holding</b> <b>ratio</b> (VHR) ' {{the ratio}} of the control voltage at a pixel at the end and at the {{beginning}} of a defined period ' is a very critical parameter for the reliability of liquid crystal displays (LCD). A low VHR causes loss of contrast and image flickering. LC with a high ion affinity can dissolve ions from peripheral display materials (adhesives, polyimide layers, etc.). This reduces the specific resistivity of the LC layer and thus the VHR. Because of this effect, the main focus of this thesis is the determination of proton affinities of 19 liquid crystal model compounds by FT-ICR mass spectrometry. This thesis results in the first available proton affinity ladder of liquid crystal compounds. For the determination of proton affinities by the equilibrium method the knowledge of ion chemistry is necessary to understand the influence of parallel and consecutive reactions (e. g. cluster formation or dissociation reactions) on the proton transfer equilibrium. To examine this influence, computer assisted simulations of gas phase ion/molecule reaction kinetics are presented. Additional, the proton affinities, structures of the protonated molecules and the sites of protonation were calculated by DFT methods. To evaporate the low volatile liquid crystals, a novel inlet system for solid samples was constructed, that allows FT-ICR spectrometric investigations at the baseline pressure of the vacuum system.

40|$|In this thesis, photo-aligned {{ferroelectric}} {{liquid crystal}} displays based on azo-dye layer are investigated. A remarkable property of such azo-dye is pure reorientation of the molecular absorption oscillator perpendicular to the UV light polarization, without any photochemical transformations. This property makes it suitable to provide a high photo-alignment quality of FLC using the azo-dye layer. The mechanism of azo-dye photo-alignment process is explained with a specific potential, which characterizes the interactions of the dye molecules and the activated UV light. Both the approximations of negligible and strong molecular interaction are considered {{during the process of}} reorientation under the action of a polarized light. The reorientation ordering of azo-dye increases with the exposure time and comes to a saturation level; such saturation value increases with the intensity of the activated light. A non-zero order parameter relaxation is observed when the activating light switched off, which is caused by dye molecular interaction. The properties of photo-aligned azo-dyes would be presented. The azo-dyes shows remarkable properties, including high order parameter, good thermostability, high anchoring energy, pretilt angle generation and high <b>voltage</b> <b>holding</b> <b>ratio.</b> A photo-aligned FLC with a bistable switching are discussed in static and multiplex operations.

40|$|Liquid crystal {{displays}} are intricate devices which {{consist of}} many {{cells that are}} filled with liquid crystal hosts. The operation of the liquid crystal cell is to modulate the polarisation of light, by varying their birefringence, which in turn {{can be used to}} control the intensity of light and colour as a function of time. Many individual cells grouped together can be controlled to give specific intensity of light and colour, to build up images that are viewed on displays, i. e. pictures on TV’s. The properties of the liquid crystalline material used in a cell dictate the performance of the device which they are used. Commercially used liquid crystal material is typically a multi-component system that exhibits many physical properties such as birefringence, dielectric anisotropy, <b>voltage</b> <b>holding</b> <b>ratio,</b> visco-elastic, guest-host effect and the kinetic switching response time of the cell between the on state and off state. By manipulating the physical properties we can exert specific control over the properties of the cell of particular importance in display applications is the speed with which cells can be turned between the on and off state; these are known as the rise and decay response times respectively. Introducing guest molecules into the liquid crystal host may alter the dielectric anisotropy which potentially increases the speed of the switching process, making the device faster. Guest molecules must be compatible with the dielectrically positive or negative liquid crystal host allowing good mixing of the components and alignment between the guest molecule and liquid crystal molecule. This compatibility is important as it allows both, guest and host, to align with the applied electric field when turned on giving the on state of the cell and when turned off allowing both to re-align with the alignment layer in the cell bringing to the cell order of the medium back to the off state of the cell. The time taken for the cell to reach the on state and off state {{is an important part of}} this study. Dopants have been designed with a head, tail and linker core moiety that are compatible with dielectrically positive and negative liquid crystals. Head groups will have polar substituents such as heteroarenes, fluorine and bromine, to exert control over the dielectric anisotropy. Alkoxy or alkyl tails were selected to increase solubility and size compatibility with the liquid crystal hosts. The linkers between the two arenes were selected as acetylene (linear, large Raman cross-section) and ether, methylene and propylene (to bring about a bend in the molecule). The switching times for liquid crystal devices are studied using an electro-optic method developed in conjunction with SONY MSL (Stuttgart). These studies enable analysis of the transmission of light through the cell as it goes from the on/off state as a function of time and applied potential. By comparison with the currently used liquid crystal materials our work shows that the level of doping, the length of the tail and the nature of the linker do affect the switching time significantly. It is shown that a non-linear linker, which introduces a ‘bite angle’ within the guest molecule brings about the best increase in response times. Time-Resolved Raman spectroscopy studies of a liquid crystal cell during the turn on/off process were made. These demonstrate the capability of this technique to measure the orientation of the molecules as a function of time as well allowing the independent motion of the guest and host molecules during the switching process. Raman spectroscopy gives a useful insight into the behaviour of the guest and host materials in an operating liquid crystal cell. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCOS) {{light valve}} has {{recently}} been recognized as an alternative approach for the fabrication of active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD). The major advantage is matured silicon fabrication technology. Very advanced display drivers and fine pixels can be integrated together as a self-contained and high-resolution display. The aperture ratio of the silicon light valve can be higher than 90 % for good light efficiency and picture quality. As a result, the silicon light valve is very suitable for high-definition projection display, and has merits of high resolution, superior picture quality, high light efficiency and low power consumption. However, the silicon light valve used in projection display has a drawback in flicker. In this dissertation research, systematic approaches were used to study flicker mechanisms in silicon light valves.

40|$|In {{negative}} ion electrostatic accelerators {{a considerable}} fraction of extracted ions is lost by collision processes causing efficiency loss and heat deposition over the components. Stripping {{is proportional to}} the local density of gas, which is steadily injected in the plasma source; its pumping from the extraction and acceleration stages is a key functionality for the prototype of the ITER Neutral Beam Injector, and it can be simulated with the 3 D code AVOCADO. Different geometric solutions were tested aiming at the reduction of the gas density. The parameter space considered is limited by constraints given by optics, aiming, <b>voltage</b> <b>holding,</b> beam uniformity, and mechanical feasibility. The guidelines of the optimization process are presented together with the proposed solutions and the results of numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|As {{technology}} {{feature size}} is reduced, ESD {{becomes one of}} the dominant failure modes due to the lower gate oxide breakdown <b>voltage.</b> Also, the <b>holding</b> <b>voltage</b> of LVTSCR devices is reduced with operating temperature increase. As a result, during stress testing (burn-in), the risk of latch-up in LVTSCR is extremely high. In this paper, a new latch-up free LVTSCR-based protection circuit is proposed. It can be reliably used in sub- 0. 18 um CMOS technologies and burn-in environment. The proposed ESD circuit has higher <b>holding</b> <b>voltage</b> by 1. 5 X than the conventional LVTSCR structure at burn-in temperature. Under 3 kV HBM ESD stress, the developed LVTSCR-based protection circuit has the voltage peak less than the conventional LVTSCR structure and GG-MOSFET by 2 X and 1. 25 X, respectively...|$|R
