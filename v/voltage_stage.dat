40|$|Electroporation is {{the process}} where {{externally}} applied electric fields cause significantly increased permeability of the cell membrane. The increased permeability allows the transport of external compounds into the cell. This is important for applications in electrochemotheropy, electrofusion and drug delivery. Electroporation also has applications in the disinfection of liquids. Given a high enough electric field across the cell membrane, the electroporation process can become irreversible, leading to cell destruction. With the cell membrane under an intense electric field, the cell membrane structure fails causing the cell to die. Conventional liquid beverage disinfection systems rely on slow heating methods requiring large power requirements; this can reduce the taste and quality of some liquids. Pulse generators provide the necessary electric fields to produce the required voltage potential across the cell membrane. The usefulness of electroporation depends on several parameters such as amplitude, frequency and rise/fall times of the electric field. The wave shape also has a bearing on performance, and {{is limited by the}} pulse generator topology. A multilevel bipolar waveform is desired with operating frequencies above about 1 kHz. The cascaded H-bridge or full-bridge topology is the most useful as it capable of producing multilevel bipolar waveforms at high frequency. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a multilevel high-voltage pulse generator, capable of creating very high-voltage AC pulses. MOSFET switching devices in conjunction with good layout practices were used to provide required fast switching speeds. The full-bridge topology is used to create a multilevel output profile through cascading of multiple stages. As a full-bridge topology inherently creates a RCL resonant network, there are many challenges associated with mitigating high-frequency noise sources. Two separate stages are built, a low <b>voltage</b> <b>stage</b> capable of outputting up to 200 Vp and a high <b>voltage</b> <b>stage</b> capable of switching up to 1 kVp. A control board was also built for pulse signal generation and user configuration of the output waveforms.

Little high frequency switching noise was observable on the output waveform. A single stage pulse generator was also tested with actual liquid loads using an electrode chamber, demonstrating electroporation. The liquid load testing was performed on water and milk derived from milk powder. Results showed that the liquid loads were consistent with primarily resistive loads...|$|E

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) Nanosatellites and CubeSats is currently limited by their susceptibility to natural de‐orbiting. An appropriately scaled pulsed plasma thruster {{offers the most}} adaptable technological {{solution to this problem}} by compensating for atmospheric drag. This technology can be used to aid the spacecraft de‐orbiting to comply with the 25 years de‐orbiting guidelines. A PPT consists of a pair of electrodes separated by a propellant bar than can be fed either from the side or from the breech of the electrodes. The electrodes are connected to a main capacitor bank charged to a voltage of the order of 1 ‐ 2 kV and storing energy of some joules. To operate the thruster a high voltage pulse (5 ‐ 10 kV) is sent to a spark plug. This triggers a discharge between the two main electrodes that ablates some of the propellant, ionizes it, and expels it to high velocity generating thrust. The design of the electronics and the thruster head of the nanosat and CubeSat PPT have evolved over time based on tests and experiments during several test campaigns. Inherent constraints such as small size and limited power budget of this type of satellites have been overcome by the use of the proposed topology. Previous designs use voltage multipliers for high voltage generation in the ignition circuit. These circuits provide a very simple way of generating the high voltage needed for such circuit. However the repeatability of the high voltage pulse event it is not precisely controlled. The following paper presents a new topology used for the electronics of the PPT that brings the following advantages with respect to other topologies used: lower power consumption achieved by the use of a pre‐charged stage before all the energy is released into the high <b>voltage</b> <b>stage,</b> better control of the power consumption; a more accurate control of the firing process; and a smaller size. These characteristics allow the use of the same circuit to provide the high energy to be stored between the anode and the cathode of the chamber and for the ignition circuit, thus simplifying the design and test of the overall system. The results presented in this paper show that the design proposed provides lower power consumption and a more precise control of the ignition process compared to previous designs. The proposed design is also scalable to be used in thrusters for bigger satellites offering the previously cited advantages...|$|E
