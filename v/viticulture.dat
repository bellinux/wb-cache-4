5|$|The {{region was}} known for its wine. Since the 15th century the local {{inhabitants}} practiced <b>viticulture</b> and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners' Guild in 1447, the oldest such guild in the German-speaking world. Terraced vineyards extended {{up the sides of}} the Krems River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation. The Loiben plain supported both <b>viticulture</b> and agriculture. As the terrain became steeper, the vines grew in terraces built from the dark Urgestein, primordial rock. From Dürenstein to Krems the river makes its wide curve; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line-of-sight between the two towns.|$|E
5|$|Higher {{education}} in the Riverina is provided by Charles Sturt University (CSU), with campuses serving the Riverina in Albury and Wagga Wagga. The university was established in 1989 with the amalgamation of the Albury and Wagga Wagga campuses of the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education with the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst. CSU provides specialist services to the Riverina {{in areas such as}} <b>viticulture</b> and winemaking.|$|E
5|$|The accolades {{continued}} into the 1980s, and the Oregon wine industry continued to add both wineries and vineyards. The state industry continued to market itself, establishing {{the first of several}} AVAs (American <b>Viticulture</b> Areas) in the state. The state also grew strong ties with the Burgundy region of France, as Oregon's governor Neil Goldschmidt paid an official visit to Burgundy and a leading French winemaking family bought land in Dundee.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Willamette Valley is mild year-round, with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers; extreme {{temperatures}} are uncommon. Most rainfall occurs outside {{the growing season}} and the valley gets relatively little snow. Not {{all parts of the}} Valley are suitable for <b>viticulture,</b> and most wineries and vineyards are found west of the Willamette River, with the largest concentration in Yamhill County.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{is handled}} in Books XII to XVIII, with Theophrastus {{as one of}} Pliny's sources. The {{manufacture}} of papyrus and the various grades of papyrus available to Romans are described. Different types of trees and the properties of their wood are explained in Books XII to XIII. The vine, <b>viticulture</b> and varieties of grape are discussed in Book XIV, while Book XV covers the olive tree in detail, followed by other trees including the apple and pear, fig, cherry, myrtle and laurel, among others.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Group diversified into <b>viticulture,</b> {{planting}} vines in Western Australia. The {{company reported}} {{that it had been}} the ASX200's fourth-best performer in 2004, and second-best performer over the preceding two years. In November 2004, Young indicated to the company's annual meeting that harvesting of the first plantations had now commenced, and forecast further MIS sales growth. The shares in Great Southern peaked at A$4.76 at this time, and Young sold a significant proportion of his shareholding, netting him A$32.6 million.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian form Crljenak Kaštelanski was not bottled in Croatia as a varietal in its {{own right}} before the link to Zinfandel was revealed. UCD has since sent clones of both Zinfandel and Primitivo to Professor Maletić in Croatia, which he planted on the island of Hvar. He made his first ZPC wines in Croatia in 2005. There is high demand for red grapes in the country, and the {{government}} has been supportive of ongoing research. Figures from the department of <b>viticulture</b> and enology at the University of Zagreb claim that from only 22 vines of Crljenak Kaštelanski in Croatia in 2001, there were about 2,000 vines in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1987 and became a public company in 1999. It {{expanded}} its MIS business rapidly in the 2000s, supported by favourable tax regulations for these types of investments. Most of the Group's business was in plantation forestry to supply woodchips for the pulp and paper industry, but in the 2000s it diversified into high-value timbers, beef cattle, olives, <b>viticulture,</b> and almond production. The company's after-tax profit peaked at A$132 million in 2006, but by 2008 had deteriorated to a A$63 million loss.|$|E
5|$|This {{included}} the planting of Pinot noir grapes in the Willamette Valley, a region long thought {{too cold to}} be suitable for <b>viticulture.</b> In the 1970s, more out-of-state winemakers migrated {{to the state and}} started to organize as an industry. The state's land use laws had prevented rural hillsides from being turned into housing tracts, preserving a significant amount of land suitable for vineyards. In 1979, The Eyrie Vineyards entered a 1975 Pinot noir in the Wine Olympics; the wine was rated among the top Pinots in the world, thus gaining the region its first international recognition.|$|E
5|$|Having been vocal in criticising Playford for sacrificing {{heritage}} to {{the march}} of development, Dunstan was prominent in protecting historic buildings from being bulldozed for high-rise office blocks. In 1972, the government intervened to purchase and thereby save Edmund Wright House on King William Street from being replaced with a skyscraper. In 1975, the Customs House at Semaphore was purchased to save it from demolition. His support of heritage preservation overlapped with his promotion of gourmet dining when his personal efforts helped to save the historic Ayers House on North Terrace, having it converted into a restaurant to avoid demolition. In contrast, there were also some controversial developments. Part of the rocky Hallett Cove on Gulf St Vincent in Adelaide's southern suburbs was developed for housing, as were vineyards in Morphettville, Tea Tree Gully, Modbury, and Reynella. This attracted criticism, as Dunstan was prominent in promoting South Australian <b>viticulture</b> and enotourism.|$|E
5|$|The grape's true origins were {{discovered}} in 1996 {{with the use of}} DNA typing at the UC Davis Department of <b>Viticulture</b> and Enology, by a team led by Dr. Carole Meredith. The DNA evidence determined that Cabernet Sauvignon was the offspring of Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc and was most likely a chance crossing that occurred in the 17th century. Prior to this discovery, this origin had been suspected from the similarity of the grapes' names and the fact that Cabernet Sauvignon shares similar aromas with both grapes—such as the blackcurrant and pencil box aromas of Cabernet franc and the grassiness of Sauvignon blanc. In 2016 scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole genome of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing grape to be sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{facility}} did attract visitors, local residents' support {{failed to reach}} the numbers expected by the founders. Original projections of 300,000 admissions per year were never met. In October 2006, the museum announced plans to turn galleries into conference rooms, remove most of the museum's focus on art, and lay off 28 of its 85 employees (most of whom were security guards for the art gallery). At the time, Copia had $68 million ($ today) in debt. That year the museum also lowered its original adult admission fee of $12.50 to $5. For three months in 2006, the museum admitted guests free of charge, and attendance and revenue increased. The museum also began hosting weddings and renting its space more frequently {{in order to raise}} revenue. In 2007, the museum altered its theme significantly by removing its focus on food and art, and instead focusing solely on wine. It replaced some of its gardens with vineyards, changed its displays to focus more on the history and aspects of wine and <b>viticulture,</b> and decreased the restaurant's and programs' focus on food.|$|E
5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern <b>viticulture,</b> selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E
5|$|González-Gordon worked most of {{his life}} for the family company González Byass, which specializes in making sherry. He was the fifth {{generation}} of the family to chair the company. While working for the firm he was involved in the making, tasting and commercialisation of sherry and in later years he also helped the company expand into producing brandy and several sorts of wine. Immediately after he finished his studies in 1946 he joined the business and started at the bottom with the picking and crushing of grapes. During this time he also learned about the solera system, which is used to age different type of liquids. His interest in oenology had only developed after visiting California the year he graduated. He visited California after previously being sent to New York by boat with twelve containers of wine. In 1955 he founded the first research center for <b>viticulture</b> and winemaking in Spain by establishing one at González Byass. For twenty years he was occupied as head of wine selection at the company. González-Gordon also served on the board of González Byass beginning in 1961, and was president of the company between 1993 and 1999. During this period González-Gordon managed to expand the business by exporting all over the world, including to the United States, United Kingdom, China and East Asia. After his time as president he continued to serve as an advisor to his son, Mauricio Junior, who took over his position. Apart from his work at González Byass González-Gordon also diverted some of his time towards the regulatory council of the sherry making industry, serving for 24 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viticulture</b> and wine-making {{were widely}} practised {{in the area}} from the {{earliest}} times. <b>Viticulture</b> even {{goes back to the}} earlier Shulaveri-Shomu culture.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the era of}} Charlemagne, Germanic <b>viticulture</b> was practiced primarily, {{although}} not exclusively, {{on the western side}} of Rhine. Charlemagne is supposed to have brought <b>viticulture</b> to Rheingau. The eastward spread of <b>viticulture</b> coincided with the spread of Christianity, which was supported by Charlemagne. Thus, in Medieval Germany, churches and monasteries played the most important role in <b>viticulture,</b> and especially in the production of quality wine. Two Rheingau examples illustrate this: archbishop Ruthard of Mainz (reigning 1089-1109) founded a Benedictine abbey on slopes above Geisenheim, the ground of which later became Schloss Johannisberg. His successor Adalbert of Mainz donated land above Hattenheim in 1135 to Cistercians, sent out from Clairvaux in Champagne, who founded Kloster Eberbach.|$|E
25|$|Further downstream, {{just outside}} Vienna lies Klosterneuburg. As the biggest private wine {{estate in the}} country, the abbey has played a {{formative}} role in Austrian wine for the last 900 years. The Federal Institute for <b>Viticulture</b> and Pomology was the world's first college of <b>viticulture</b> and continues {{to play an important}} part in the development of wine in Austria.|$|E
25|$|Twin {{brothers}} Ted and Terry Casteel founded Bethel Heights {{with their}} partners {{and other family}} members in 1997. The Casteel brothers graduated from Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington with Ted going on to teach European History at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and Terry working as a clinical psychologist in Seattle. Soon after the Casteel purchased the vineyard, Ted went to study <b>viticulture</b> at the University of California-Davis while Terry did apprentice work at various Willamette Valley wineries. In 2010, Terry Castel was honored by Salud! for his contribution to the Oregon Pinot wine industry. Ted has become an industry leader when it comes to sustainable <b>viticulture,</b> co-founding the Low Input <b>Viticulture</b> and Enology (LIVE) certification program in Oregon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viticulture</b> is {{generally}} {{a part-time job}} for wine-growers; their produce is sold mainly in the numerous Heurigen.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the valley}} is located at 33°S, {{much closer to the}} Equator than any European vineyard, <b>viticulture</b> here is {{possible}} because of the cooling influence of the Pacific ocean, in the shape of cool morning fog and greater cloud cover than is found elsewhere in the north of Chile. Free-draining clay and sandy soils, whilst good for <b>viticulture,</b> encourage nematodes, so grafting onto nematode-resistant rootstocks is common.|$|E
25|$|Though wild grapevines {{have grown}} on the Italian {{peninsula}} since prehistory, historians {{are unable to}} determine precisely when domestic <b>viticulture</b> and winemaking first occurred. It {{is possible that the}} Mycenaean Greeks had some influences through early settlements in southern Italy, but the earliest recorded evidence of Greek influence dates to 800 BC. <b>Viticulture</b> was widely entrenched in Etruscan civilization, which was centered around the modern winemaking region of Tuscany.|$|E
25|$|Its {{location}} in the Niagara Peninsula puts Brock at the centre of cool-climate grape and wine research. It carries {{the distinction of being}} the only university in Canada to offer an Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Oenology and <b>Viticulture</b> (See the Cool Climate Oenology and <b>Viticulture</b> Institute). Brock University is also the only school in Canada and internationally to offer the program MICA (Mathematics Integrated with Computing and Applications).|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} French wine, spans {{a period of}} at least 2600 years dating to the {{founding}} of Massalia in the 6th century BC by Phocaeans with the possibility that <b>viticulture</b> existed much earlier. The Romans did much to spread <b>viticulture</b> across the land they knew as Gaul, encouraging the planting of vines in areas that would become the well known wine regions of Bordeaux, Burgundy, Alsace, Champagne, Languedoc, Loire Valley and the Rhone.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of irrigation {{has a long}} history in wine production. Archaeologists describe it as one of the oldest practices in <b>viticulture,</b> with irrigation canals discovered near vineyard sites in Armenia and Egypt dating back more than 2600 years. Irrigation was already widely practiced for other agricultural crops since around 5000 BC. It is possible that the knowledge of irrigation helped <b>viticulture</b> spread from these areas to other regions, due to the potential for the grapevine to grow in soils too infertile to support other food crops. A somewhat robust plant, the grapevine's largest need is for sufficient sunshine, and it is able to flourish with minimum needs of water and nutrients. In areas where its water needs are unfulfilled, the availability of irrigation meant that <b>viticulture</b> could still be supported.|$|E
25|$|The City of Clarence is a {{primarily}} residential {{city with}} 20,737 dwellings, although small scale manufacturing, agriculture, <b>viticulture,</b> retail and government administration are all prevalent.|$|E
25|$|Wine merchants {{failed to}} survive {{the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire and <b>viticulture</b> {{declined}} dramatically. The Germanic tribes preferred to drink beer and did not see the value of the wine trade. The decline of <b>viticulture</b> was intensified when Vikings cut the sea lanes in the Atlantic. In the south the Saracens were making Ghazw or raids. These campaigns in southern Europe caused Languedoc, Provence, Southern Italy, and the Douro Valley to become depopulated – the people being taken into slavery or fleeing the threat.|$|E
25|$|The Phoenicians {{and their}} Punic {{descendants}} of Carthage {{had a direct}} influence on the growing winemaking cultures of the ancient Greeks and Romans that would later spread <b>viticulture</b> across Europe. The agricultural treatises of the Carthaginian writer Mago {{were among the most}} important early texts in the history of wine to record ancient knowledge of winemaking and <b>viticulture.</b> While no original copies of Mago's or other Phoenician wine writers' works have survived, there is evidence from quotations of Greek and Roman writers such as Columella that the Phoenicians were skilled winemakers and viticulturists.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viticulture</b> {{suffered}} {{with the}} invasions of Bavarians, Slavs and Avars {{after the fall}} of the Roman Empire, but from 788 the rule of Charlemagne saw considerable reconstruction of vineyards and introduction of new grape presses. Once Otto the Great had seen off the threat from Magyar incursions in 955, Austrian <b>viticulture</b> was nurtured by the Church and encouraged among the populace at large. The first vineyard names recorded are Kremser Sandgrube in 1208, and Steiner Pfaffenberg in 1230. Rudolf IV introduced the first wine tax, Ungeld, in 1359, as Vienna established itself as a centre for wine trading on the Danube.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viticulture</b> was {{introduced}} to Argentina during the Spanish colonization of the Americas and later again by Christian missionaries. In 1556 father Juan Cedrón established the first vineyard in Argentina when cuttings from the Chilean Central Valley were brought {{to what is now}} the San Juan and Mendoza wine region, which firmly established <b>viticulture</b> in Argentina. Ampelographers suspect that one of these cuttings brought the ancestor grape of Chile's Pais and California's Mission grape. This grape was the forerunner of the Criolla Chica variety that would be the backbone of the Argentine wine industry for the next 300 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viticulture</b> {{refers to}} the growing of grapes. Grapes require a mild winter season, {{which can be found}} in some Maritime locations, {{southern}} British Columbia, Essex county, Ontario and locations on the Niagara Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these major conferences dedicated to the Albanian agriculture as a whole, Shundi also organized every year 9 pan-Albanian conferences on <b>viticulture</b> and viniculture in Albania and Kosovo in the 2001-2010 period.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{sustaining}} that production much of Australia’s <b>viticulture</b> {{is located}} in irrigable areas where water supply is reliable and well managed, with many new vineyards relying upon the availability of water pumped from rivers and streams.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viticulture</b> {{in present-day}} Germany {{dates back to}} Ancient Roman times, to {{sometime}} from 70 to 270 CE/AD (Agri Decumates). In those days, the western parts of today's Germany made up the outpost of the Roman empire against the Germanic tribes {{on the other side}} of Rhine. What is generally considered Germany's oldest city, Trier, was founded as a Roman garrison and is situated directly on the river Moselle (Mosel) in the eponymous wine region. The oldest archeological finds that may indicate early German <b>viticulture</b> are curved pruning knives found in the vicinity of Roman garrisons, dating from the 1st century AD. However, it is not absolutely certain that these knives were used for viticultural purposes. Emperor Probus, whose reign can be dated two centuries later than these knives, is generally considered the founder of German <b>viticulture,</b> but for solid documentation of winemaking on German soil, we must go to around 370 AD, when Ausonius of Bordeaux wrote Mosella, where he in enthusiastic terms described the steep vineyards on river Moselle.|$|E
25|$|When the Romans reached Portugal, {{they named}} the area Lusitania after Lusus, {{the son of}} the Roman god of wine Bacchus. As they did before in Italy, France, Germany and Spain, the Romans did much to expand and promote <b>viticulture</b> in their {{settlements}} in Portugal. Wines were produced across the territory for both local consumption as well as export to Rome. Vineyards extended further north and inland, being firmly established in places such as Douro by the end of Roman rule. Following the Fall of the Roman Empire, local barbarian tribes sustained the tradition and practice of <b>viticulture</b> in the area. In the mid-9th century AD, Ordoño the Gothic king of Asturias (in what is now northern Portugal) granted vineyards and landowning privileges around Coimbra to a monastic Christian order in the area. While most historian's accounts of the history of wine following Roman rules suggest that the Christian Church took the lead in preserving <b>viticulture</b> across the former Roman empire, the evidence suggest that, at least in Portugal, the ruling authorities played an important role.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Portuguese wine has been {{influenced}} by Portugal's relative isolationism in the world's wine market, with the one notable exception of {{its relationship with the}} British. Wine has been made in Portugal since at least 2000 BC when the Tartessians planted vines in the Sado and Tagus valleys. By the 10th century BC, the Phoenicians had arrived and introduced new grape varieties and winemaking techniques to the area. Up until this point, <b>viticulture</b> was mostly centered on the southern coastal areas of Portugal. In later centuries, the Ancient Greeks, Celts and Romans would do much to spread <b>viticulture</b> and winemaking further north.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} known wine presses was discovered in Palekastro in Crete, from which island the Mycenaeans {{are believed to have}} spread <b>viticulture</b> to others in the Aegean Sea and quite possibly to mainland Greece.|$|E
