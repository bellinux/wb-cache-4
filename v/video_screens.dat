5|$|When {{the shuffle}} format was introduced, the Hot Seats and {{corresponding}} monitors were {{replaced with a}} single podium, and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able {{to walk around the}} stage. Also, two <b>video</b> <b>screens</b> were installed–one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order {{to take into account the}} show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year. The two <b>video</b> <b>screens</b> were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and light-emitting diode (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.|$|E
5|$|Madonna trained {{physically}} doing aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to {{cope with}} the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from her music videos. The stage had four <b>video</b> <b>screens,</b> multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Patrick Leonard, who was the music director, encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for the show. The title Who's That Girl came to Madonna's mind when during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage.|$|E

5|$|As {{the second}} WrestleMania {{to be held}} entirely outdoors, Vince McMahon also {{announced}} that the show would have taken place regardless of the weather conditions. In the March 2008 issue of WWE Magazine, WWE set designer Jason Robinson revealed that a steel rig with a tarpaulin roof would be built above the ring itself to prevent rain from falling on the ring. In that same issue, an initial design of the ring setup was revealed showing a larger rig surrounding the tarpaulin rig, with lighting and two giant screens attached. The final design had the lighting and <b>video</b> <b>screens</b> on the tarpaulin rig, {{as well as the}} sound system. During an interview, WWE production manager Brian Petree mentioned that video reinforcement should prevent anyone's view from being obstructed by the steel structure.

5|$|PlayStation Home is a {{community-based}} social gaming networking {{service for}} the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Network (PSN). It is available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar. Membership is free, and only requires a PSN account. Home has been in development since early 2005 and started an open public beta test on December 11, 2008. Home allows users to create a custom avatar, which {{can be made to}} suit the user's preference. Users can decorate their avatar's personal apartment ("HomeSpace") with default, bought, or won items. They can travel throughout the Home world (except cross region), which is constantly updated by Sony and partners. Each part of the world is known as a space. Public spaces can just be for display, fun, or for meeting people. Home features many mini-games which can be single player or multiplayer. Users can shop for new items to express themselves more through their avatars or HomeSpace. Home features <b>video</b> <b>screens</b> in many places for advertising, but the main video content is shown at the theatre for entertainment. Home plays host to a variety of special events which range from prize-giving events to entertaining events. Users can also use Home to connect with friends and customize content. Xi, a once notable feature of Home, is the world's first console based Alternate Reality Game that took place in secret areas in Home and was created by nDreams.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the loading station and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition <b>video</b> <b>screens</b> which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads through the hole in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests see before disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E

40|$|With {{technology}} evolving, {{organizations are}} constantly examining {{more efficient and}} accessible modes of screening job applicants. Executives want the hiring process to be seamless, unveiling, and efficient. Globalization adds {{to the complexity of}} this process as organizations have the need to connect with a broader external labor market in order to gain a competitive advantage in the market. However, it is unrealistic and costly to screen applicants in person. Even if all applicants were in close proximity, it would be too cumbersome and time-consuming for employers to interview each one. To alleviate such problems, employers are turning to more creative methods to screen applicants for positions. For many years organizations have been using the telephone as a screening method to narrow down the applicant pool. With advances in technology, many organizations are now using <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> rather than more traditional methods to <b>screen</b> applicants. <b>Video</b> <b>screening</b> reveals more about the applicants and how they interact. Additionally, <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> allows employers to be selective with their time by only reviewing the videos of those who are qualified. However, little research has been conducted explaining the effects of this technology on applicants and the external labor market. This research looked at the differences in applicant perception after telephone <b>screening</b> and <b>video</b> <b>screening.</b> The researchers used a survey method to determine the results of their study. Upon completion of a <b>video</b> and telephone <b>screening,</b> participants were asked to participate in the survey. The survey data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics to determine the existence of any significant difference in participants? perception between the telephone and <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> methods. The research supported that the participants believed that the telephone screening was easier than the <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> and that the <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> technology made them feel uncomfortable. It also showed that the participants believed that they would secure a follow-up interview with either method but most felt that this was more so when the telephone method was used. Lastly, the participants believed that they were better represented when using the telephone screening as opposed to the <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> method. Overall, the research showed that the participants were pleased with process of the <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> but felt more confident with the traditional telephone screening...|$|R
