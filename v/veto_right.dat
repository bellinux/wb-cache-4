25|$|There was no fixed {{process for}} papal {{selection}} before 1059. Popes, {{the bishops of}} Rome {{and the leaders of}} the Catholic Church, were often appointed by their predecessors or secular rulers. While the process was often characterized by some capacity of election, an election with the meaningful participation of the laity was the exception to the rule, especially as the popes' claims to temporal power solidified into the Papal States. The practice of papal appointment during this period would later give rise to the jus exclusivae, a <b>veto</b> <b>right</b> exercised by Catholic monarchies into the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|The much harder-line Milošević {{pushed for}} a tougher policy towards the Kosovo Albanians. On 28 March 1989 he had the Serbian Constitution amended to give the Serbian Assembly {{exclusive}} rights {{to decide on the}} constitutional structure of the country, overturning the <b>veto</b> <b>right</b> of Kosovo and Vojvodina. According to the ICTY indictment of Milošević, when the proposed amendments were put before the Kosovo Assembly, the majority of the Assembly's members abstained in protest and the vote failed to reach the necessary two-thirds supermajority. The Speaker of the Assembly nonetheless declared that the amendments had passed and they were duly enacted. This however was refuted in court by Vukasin Jokanovic who was the President of the Kosovo Assembly at the time during the trial. He provided the court with a video recording of the vote along with the stenographic notes of the assembly session which clearly showed the assembly members voting in favor of the constitutional amendments by the required majority.|$|E

Home Rule became technically assured after a new Home Rule bill was introduced in 1912 with the IPP holding {{the balance of power}} at Westminster. During the 1913–14 parliamentary debates on the Third Home Rule Bill, O'Brien, alarmed by Unionist resistance to the bill, opposed the IPP's coercive [...] "Ulster must follow" [...] policy, and published in the Cork Free Press end of January 1914 specific concession, including a suspensory <b>veto</b> <b>right,</b> which would enable Ulster join a Dublin Parliament [...] "any price for an United Ireland, but never partition". William O'Brien resigned his seat as MP again for a fourth time in January and re-stood to test local support for his policies, after the All-for-Ireland League suffered heavy defeats in the Cork City municipal elections.|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, Jersey Standard and General Motors pooled its tetraethyllead-related {{patents and}} {{established}} the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation. [...] In 1927, Jersey Standard signed a 25-years cooperation agreement with IG Farben for the coal hydrogenation {{research in the}} United States. [...] Jersey Standard assumed this cooperation to be beneficial as it believed the United States oil reserves to be exhausted {{in the near future}} and that the coal hydrogenation would give an access for producing synthetic fuels. It erected synthetic fuel plants in Bayway, Baton Rouge, and Baytown (unfinished). The interest in hydrogenation evaporated after discovery of the East Texas Oil Field. [...] As a part of the cooperation between Jersey Standard and IG Farben, a joint company, Standard I.G. Company, was established with Jersey Standard having a stake of 80%. [...] IG Farben transferred rights to the hydrogenation process outside of Germany to the joint venture in exchange of $35million stake of Jersey Standard shares. [...] In 1930, the joint company established Hydro Patents Company to license the hydrogenation process in the United States. [...] The agreement with IG Farben gave to Jersey Standard access to patents related to polyisobutylene which assist Jersey Standard to advance in isobutolene polymerization and to produce the first butyl rubber in 1937. [...] As the agreement with IG Farben gave to the German company a <b>veto</b> <b>right</b> of licensing chemical industry patents in the United States, including patent for butyl rubber, Jersey Standard was accused of treason by senator Harry S. Truman. [...] In 1941, it opened the first commercial synthetic toluene plant.|$|E

40|$|Literature on {{bargaining}} within {{international organizations}} points to two {{potential sources of}} bargaining power: <b>veto</b> <b>rights</b> and exit rights. In some circumstances a member state {{may be able to}} veto a rules change which it opposes. In others, it may be able to threaten to leave the organization if its demands are not met. Finally, if exit from the organization is possible, other member states may be able to force a laggard member state to accept changes it opposes by threat-ening to kick the laggard out of the organization if the state does not agree to the proposed change. Under what circumstances do <b>veto</b> <b>rights</b> provide bargaining leverage and under what circumstances are exit threats a source of power? When would a member state prefer to use one of these sources of power over the other? Are both of these options available simultaneously or if one is available does that mean that the other is not? What implications does this have for politi-cal integration, and more broadly, the possible creation of a federal state? This paper seeks to answer these questions using a game the-oretic model to examine the interaction between <b>veto</b> <b>rights</b> and exit threats in international organizations and federal states. My model has implications for European integration and can also help explain the conditions under which independent states give up sovereignty to form a stable federal union. I test the implications of the model through a case study of EU integration in the 1970 s and 1980 s. ...|$|R

40|$|Green {{certificates}} are {{the main}} instrument for promoting renewable electricity (RES-E) in Sweden. But certificates cover only a limited share of total RES-E production. Under partial coverage, crowding out may arise whereby costly new RES-E replaces inexpensive old RES-E. Granting certificates to all of RES-E production improves efficiency, but leaves windfall rent to otherwise profitable facilities. We also analyze transaction costs in the permit process for new RES-E in Sweden. Municipalities veto socially desirable projects because of asymmetrically distributed investment costs and benefits. We propose market-based permit fees rather than limited <b>veto</b> <b>rights</b> {{as a solution to}} this NIMBY problem...|$|R
