5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that surgery was a <b>viable</b> <b>option,</b> {{there is no}} evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment; They suggest several possible factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed by a lack of reporting, for the lack of surgery or evidence of such. Maisonneuve, partially shown in one of the photographs, treated another intersex patient in 1862.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{exploration of}} Saturn {{is still considered}} to be a <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for NASA as part of their ongoing New Frontiers program of missions. NASA previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to Saturn that included an atmospheric entry probe and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> in a custody case.|$|E

5|$|In February 1999, Payton {{announced}} that he had a rare autoimmune liver disease known as primary sclerosing cholangitis, which may have led to his cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). He spent his final months as an advocate for organ transplants, appearing in many commercials to encourage others to donate organs, although by the time his first appeal was recorded, his illness was already too far advanced for transplantation to have been a <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b> In April of that year, Payton made a final public appearance at a Chicago Cubs game with Mike Ditka, where he threw the game's ceremonial first pitch. Author Don Yaeger worked with him during the last weeks of his life to create his autobiography, Never Die Easy.|$|E
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a <b>viable</b> <b>option,</b> even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse {{to protect them from}} the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able to support themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for taking over that role.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under the amended Football Spectators Act 1989, {{it became}} {{compulsory}} for {{first and second}} tier English clubs to have their stadia all-seated {{in time for the}} 1994–95 season. Arsenal, like many other clubs, experienced difficulty raising income for converted terraced areas. At the end of the 1990–91 season, the club introduced a bond scheme which offered supporters the right to purchase a season ticket at its renovated North Bank stand of Highbury. The board felt this was the only <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> after considering other proposals; {{they did not want to}} compromise on traditions nor curb manager George Graham's transfer dealings. At a price of between £1,000 to £1,500, the 150-year bond was criticised by supporters, who argued it potentially blocked the participation of those less well-off from supporting Arsenal. A campaign directed by the Independent Arsenal Supporters' Association brought relative success as only a third of all bonds were sold.|$|E

40|$|Cracks {{found in}} many of the double-shell tank (DST) pump and valve pits bring into {{question}} the ability of the pits to provide secondary containment and remain in compliance with State and Federal regulations. This study was commissioned to identify <b>viable</b> <b>options</b> for maintain/restoring secondary containment capability in these pits. The basis for this study is the decision analysis process which identifies the requirements to be met and the desired goals (decision criteria) that each option will be weighed against. A facilitated workshop was convened with individuals knowledgeable of Tank Farms Operations, engineering practices, and safety/environmental requirements. The outcome of this workshop was the validation or identification of the critical requirements, definition of the current problem, identification and weighting of the desired goals, baselining of the current repair methods, and identification of potential alternate solutions. The workshop was followed up with further investigations into the potential solutions that were identified in the workshop and through other efforts. These solutions are identified in the body of this report. Each of the potential solutions were screened against the list of requirements and only those meeting the requirements were considered <b>viable</b> <b>options.</b> To expand the field of <b>viable</b> <b>options,</b> hybrid concepts that combine the strongest features of different individual approaches were also examined. Several were identified. The decision analysis process then ranked each of the <b>viable</b> <b>options</b> against the weighted decision criteria, which resulted in a recommended solution. The recommended approach is based upon installing a sprayed on coating system...|$|R
25|$|It is arguable that {{in such a}} retail/planning policy {{environment}} use of bicycles {{ceases to}} be a <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for many shoppers and access to a private motor-car or public transport becomes a necessary prerequisite for access to basic services.|$|E
25|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, {{including}} South America, Eastern Europe, China, and India, butadiene was also produced from ethanol. While not competitive with steam cracking for producing large volumes of butadiene, lower capital costs make production from ethanol a <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for smaller-capacity plants. Two processes were in use.|$|E

25|$|Always {{interested}} in {{independence from the}} British, Maududi lost faith in the Congress Party and its Muslim allies in the 1920s as the party developed an increasingly Hindu identity.

25|$|Surgery for {{metastatic disease}}: If metastatic disease is present {{surgical}} treatment may still a <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b> Radical and partial nephrectomy can still occur, {{and in some}} cases if the metastasis is small this can also be surgically removed.

25|$|The {{resulting}} set {{of parts}} was frequently enormous and a daunting logistical task to transport. Re-assembly also depended heavily upon the availability of skilled labour at the customer’s premises.
