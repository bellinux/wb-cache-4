5|$|Brian McCoy was {{the first}} to die, having been hit in the back by nine rounds from a 9mm Luger pistol in the initial <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> gunfire. Fran O'Toole {{attempted}} to run away, but was quickly chased down by the gunmen who had immediately jumped down into the field in pursuit. He was then machine-gunned 22 times, mostly in the face, as he lay supine on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts {{frequently}} carried torpedo tubes themselves. In theory, {{a line of}} battleships so equipped could unleash {{a devastating}} <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> torpedoes on an enemy line steaming a parallel course. In practice, torpedoes fired from battleships scored very few hits, {{and there was a}} risk that a stored torpedo would cause a dangerous explosion if hit by enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was now precarious and violence appeared likely as the rebels prepared to unleash a <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> arrows. Richard rode forwards towards {{the crowd and}} persuaded them to follow him away from Smithfields, to Clerkenwell Fields, defusing the situation. Walworth meanwhile began {{to regain control of}} the situation, backed by reinforcements from the city. Tyler's head was cut off and displayed on a pole and, with their leader dead and the royal government now backed by the London militia, the rebel movement began to collapse. Richard promptly knighted Walworth and his leading supporters for their services.|$|E
50|$|Mutual {{eye contact}} that signals {{attraction}} initially {{begins as a}} brief glance and progresses into a repeated <b>volleying</b> <b>of</b> eye contact.|$|R
50|$|The protests {{continued}} into February. Riot police fired <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> {{tear gas and}} rubber bullets in Dakar on 19 February 2012, one week before the election.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, there isn’t {{much use}} {{in looking for}} any more game around here,” said Dave. “Those <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> shots will make them lay low for some time.” ...|$|R
5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E
5|$|Grey's troops marched {{around the}} head of the Acushnet River and camped on the eastern banks. The {{following}} day, they embarked on their boats, but General Grey decided that Fairhaven should also be raided. Concurrently, militia were beginning to arrive to defend Fairhaven, with Major Israel Fearing taking command from an elderly colonel who was reluctant to pursue an active defense. The British approached Fairhaven on the morning of September 6, and Fearing arrayed about 150 men between the village and their landing point. The British set fire to a few nearby buildings and then headed for the village. At this point, Fearing's men unleashed a withering <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> musket fire, and the British precipitately retreated to their boats.|$|E
5|$|Hipólito Vieytes {{was about}} to make a {{diplomatic}} mission to Britain, but Moreno requested that he should be given the appointment instead. Saavedra accepted immediately. He traveled to Britain with his brother Manuel Moreno and his secretary Tomás Guido, on the British schooner Fame. His health declined and there was no doctor on board, but the captain refused requests to land at some earlier port such as in Río de Janeiro (Brazil) or Cape Town (South Africa). The captain gave him an emetic in common use at that time, prepared with four grams of antimony potassium tartrate. Moreno had great convulsions as a consequence, and considered that in his state he could not have resisted more than the quarter of a gram. He died shortly afterwards. His body was wrapped in a Union Jack and thrown into the sea, after a <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> musketry.|$|E
60|$|Then, as the {{prisoner}} made no movement, {{and the chief}} agent indulged in one <b>of</b> his favourite <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> oaths, Chauvelin placed a peremptory hand on his colleague's shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' was the answer. 'I {{have often}} thought of that, and of {{what it might be}} to hear those <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> musketry in earnest. It has made me very thankful.' ...|$|R
60|$|The men {{dropped their}} pikes, and two <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> musketry were {{poured into the}} insurgents. Those of the front line were swept away by the fire, {{and for a moment}} the whole recoiled.|$|R
5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E
5|$|Other {{inquiries}} obtained similar {{testimony from}} witnesses, including {{the taxi driver}} who now stated that the activists were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene. The taxi driver stated {{that there was a}} short exchange of gunfire, and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> gunfire, but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots. The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal grand jury (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots also {{employ a}} corps {{known as the}} End Zone Militia. During each game, about ten men dressed as minutemen line the back of each end zone. When the Patriots score a touchdown, field goal, point-after-touchdown or safety, the militia behind the {{opposite}} end zone fire a <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> blanks from flintlock muskets. Per {{an interview with the}} Loren & Wally Show on WROR 105.7 FM in and around the time of Super Bowl XLIX, said shots use double the load of black powder than a regular historical reenactor does, specifically 200 grains, in order to be heard throughout the stadium. ESPN writer Josh Pahigian named this one of the top ten celebrations in the league in 2007.|$|E
60|$|The enemy, however, {{maintained}} a heavy fire {{for a few}} minutes; but the <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> the Egyptians, {{at a distance of}} only a hundred yards, were so deadly that they soon took to flight.|$|R
60|$|The guns of {{the ship}} kept up a heavy fire, searching the wood for some {{distance}} round with shell, and pouring <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> grape into the trees near the battery. Presently the fire ceased.|$|R
6000|$|While {{the captain}} was {{explaining}} to them what he had heard from Farmer Goodenough, a sudden noise of shouting and laughing, with <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> evil words, was heard near the [...] "Fox and Hounds." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{introduction}} of shell guns and steam {{ships in the}} 1840s created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. In 1850, with {{the closure of the}} prison, seven 8-inch (22.3 cm) guns were mounted along the walls in brick emplacements, but there were concerns about the defences and two earthwork auxiliary batteries were built just alongside the castle to house additional guns. In 1856, {{at the end of the}} Crimean War, there was a large review of the fleet along the Solent, attended by Queen Victoria and numerous tourists. Naval gunboats launched a mock attack on the castle, which responded by firing a <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> forty 8-inch guns, causing chaos among the crowds watching around the base of the fortification.|$|E
5|$|The last Texian {{group to}} remain in the open were Crockett and his men, {{defending}} the low wall in front of the church. Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives. After a <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church. The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls. Mexican soldiers turned their attention to a Texian flag waving from the roof of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.|$|E
5|$|To the {{surprise}} of Lacrosse and his officers, Indefatigable did not retreat from the ship of the line, nor did she pass the ship of the line at long-range to leeward as expected. Instead, at 17:30, Pellew closed with the stern of Droits de l'Homme and opened a raking fire. Lacrosse turned to meet the threat and opened fire with the guns on the upper deck accompanied by a heavy <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> musket fire from the soldiers on board. Pellew then attempted to pull ahead of Droits de l'Homme and rake her bow, to which Lacrosse responded by attempting to ram Indefatigable. Neither manoeuvre was successful, as Droits de l'Homme raked the British ship but caused little damage as most of her shot scattered into the ocean.|$|E
50|$|Note: The {{match was}} moved from Estadio José Amalfitani {{as the home}} stadium of Vélez Sársfield was closed after fans fired <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> flares during their Clausura match against Banfield.----Vélez Sársfield won on points 6-0.|$|R
60|$|Presently their {{attention}} {{was attracted to}} four boats, each containing from six to eight men. Two had come from either direction, and when they neared each other <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> abuse were exchanged between their occupants.|$|R
25|$|Al-Shabaab forces has pounded <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> mortars to {{the town}} of Garbaharey, No deaths or {{injuries}} were reported. Some residents started to flee from their home against of back of new more fighting could again renew from the area.|$|R
5|$|Anderson {{arrived at}} the guerrilla camp and {{described}} the day's events, the brutality of which unsettled Todd. By mid-afternoon, the 39th Missouri Volunteer Infantry had arrived in Centralia. From the town, they saw {{a group of about}} 120 guerrillas and pursued them. The guerrillas heard that the cavalry was approaching, and Anderson sent a party to set an ambush. They drew the Union troops {{to the top of a}} hill; a group of guerrillas led by Anderson had been stationed at the bottom and other guerrillas hid nearby. Anderson then led a charge up the hill. Although five guerrillas were killed by the first <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> Union fire, the Union soldiers were quickly overwhelmed by the well-armed guerrillas, and those who fled were pursued. One Union officer reached Centralia and gave word of the ambush, allowing a few Union soldiers who had remained there to escape. However, most were hunted down and killed; Anderson's men mutilated the bodies of the dead soldiers and tortured some survivors.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{inaccurate}} {{though to}} depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aborigines. Although many more Aborigines died than British, this may have {{had more to do}} with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre-existing hunting and fighting practices—using spears, clubs and other primitive weapons. Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main Aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans. Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them. On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than the Europeans.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that they}} need one big show to raise the {{necessary}} money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert—and alerting the police, the Nazis, and the Good Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, and the Good Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract—more than enough {{to pay off the}} orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU—and then shows the brothers how to slip out of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-fiancée. After her <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> M16 rifle bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.|$|E
5000|$|Loyalist {{paramilitary}} groups, {{such as the}} Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), {{have also}} used Eleventh Night bonfires to hold [...] "shows of strength", which often involve masked gunmen firing <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> shots into the air.|$|R
60|$|There {{was little}} {{connected}} conversation--only short <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> jests as they whizzed along the splendid drives of the park--but Douglass needed {{little more than}} Helen's shining face to put him at peace with all the world. Each moment increased their intimacy.|$|R
60|$|Seven <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> arrows {{followed}} one {{upon the}} other, {{and in the}} very thick of the discharges Dick was touched from behind upon the arm, and found a page holding out to him a leathern jack, strengthened with bright plates of mail.|$|R
5|$|The action {{continued}} {{across the}} Narrow Seas towards Dunkirk, Nieuwpoort, Gravelines and Sluis. The Dutch Admiral Jan Cant soon {{cut off the}} Spanish and the English waited outside of the Flemish road stead in case any tried to escape elsewhere. The States' ship Mackerel (Makreel), came in sight and attacked the already damaged San Felipe, pouring in a broadside. Drawing off from this assailant, the galley found herself close to Vice-Admiral Cant's Half Moon (Halve Maene). The galley tried to evade discovery by remaining immobile in the darkness but this had disastrous results. The Halve Maene bore straight down upon the galley and struck at her amidships carrying off her mainmast and her poop. Whilst extricating himself with difficulty from the wreck Half Moon sent a tremendous <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> cannon fire straight into the waist. Another State's galliot bore down to complete the work; San Felipe sunk quickly carrying with her all the galley slaves, sailors, and soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{contacts}} Sulu, who informs {{them the}} conference is being held at Camp Khitomer. Both ships head for the talks {{as fast as they}} can. As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the Bird of Prey with a <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.|$|E
5|$|While {{the killing}} of Hálfdan by the Orkney islanders is {{recorded}} independently in the Historia Norvegiæ, the manner of his death is unspecified. The blood eagle sacrifice may be a misunderstanding or an invention of the sagawriters as it does not feature directly in the earlier skaldic verses, which instead indicate that Hálfdan {{was killed by a}} <b>volley</b> <b>of</b> spears. The verses do mention the eagle as a carrion bird, and this may have influenced the saga writers to introduce the blood eagle element. The sagas then relate that Harald sought vengeance for his son's ignoble death, and set out on campaign against Einarr, but was unable to dislodge him. Eventually, Harald agreed to end the fight in exchange for a fine of 60 gold marks levied on Einarr and the allodial owners of the islands. Einarr offered to pay the whole fine if the allodial landowners passed their lands to him, to which they agreed. Einarr's assumption of control over the islands appears well-attested and was considered by later commentators to be the moment at which the Earls of Orkney came to own the entire island group in fee to the King of Norway. Others have interpreted the payment of 60 gold marks as wergild or blood money.|$|E
60|$|Inside the inn, {{everything}} was still. Brogard and his wife, terrified of Chauvelin, had given {{no sign of}} life; they hoped to be forgotten, and at any rate to remain unperceived: Marguerite could not even hear their usual <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> muttered oaths.|$|R
60|$|The reply of the {{stranger}} was interrupted by sudden and heavy explosions of artillery, which were immediately followed by continued <b>volleys</b> <b>of</b> small arms, {{and in a few}} minutes the air was filled with the tumult of a warm and well-contested battle.|$|R
