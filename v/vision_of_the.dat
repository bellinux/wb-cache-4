5|$|Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions {{throughout}} his life, and he claimed {{that they were a}} common aspect of life. His understanding of these events was, as he explained, similar to the experiences of biblical prophets. In the commentary to A <b>Vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Last Judgement, Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced that allowed him to see the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of A <b>Vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Last Judgement was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of Judgement. Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E

5|$|Before {{this the}} church had {{maintained}} {{a distance from the}} Armenian revolutionary groups as the latter saw the former as a conservative institution.

According to Panossian, Khrimian thus radicalised, to a certain degree, the Armenian Church and as such secularised in its <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armenian nation.|$|E

5|$|Collins {{opposed the}} profanity in the script, as the vulgar {{language}} {{did not fit}} his <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.|$|E

Frontman Trent Reznor wrote the album's music and lyrics while touring {{in support of the}} band's previous album With Teeth (2005). In contrast to the introspective style of songwriting Reznor used on previous albums, Year Zero is a concept album that criticizes contemporary policies of the United States government by presenting a dystopian <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year 2022.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Last Judgement is a {{painting}} by William Blake that was designed in 1808 before becoming a lost artwork. The painting was to be shown in an 1810 exhibition with a detailed analysis added to a second edition of his Descriptive Catalogue. This plan was dropped after the exhibition was cancelled, and the painting disappeared. Blake's notes for the Descriptive Catalogue describe {{various aspects of the}} work in a detailed manner, which allow the aspects of the painting to be known. Additionally, earlier designs that reveal similar Blake depiction of the Last Judgement have survived, and these date back to an 1805 precursor design created for Robert Blair's The Grave. In addition to Blake's notes on the painting, a letter written to Ozias Humphrey provides a description of the various images within an earlier design of the Last Judgement.|$|E
5|$|According to Patrick Drazen, {{the series}} {{contains}} numerous allusions to the Kojiki and the Nihongi, the Shinto <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami. Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references to Adam, Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, the Tree of Life, among many others. The merging {{of all human}} souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project {{at the end of}} the series is similar to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam. The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore, and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of oni (Japanese demons or ogres).|$|E
