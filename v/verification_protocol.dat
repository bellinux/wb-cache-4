In accepting arbitrary mobile code from unknown and potentially untrustworthy sources, a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) enforces type safety [...] the first line of defence in mobile code security [...] through a a link-time bytecode verification process. The bytecode verifier performs dataflow analysis and various structural analyses to guarantee that untrusted classfiles can be linked into the JVM without producing type confusion.

This paper fills the gap between manual analysis and simulation-based experimental analysis of ASV, through automated formal analysis.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the last twenty years of {{research}} on the <b>verification</b> of security <b>protocols,</b> there exists now a range of protocol models, security properties, logics and verification tools.

However, the highest level of the Common Criteria (ISO 15408) requires a formal <b>verification</b> of <b>protocol</b> correctness. Doing this strictly formal is still not possible, {{because of the lack of}} strictly formal protocol models with an associated verification technique. In this diploma thesis, we present a conservative embedding in Isabelle/HOL [20] of the protocol model given by the operational semantics of security protocols proposed in [11]. This formalization is an important milestone towards the strictly formal <b>verification</b> of security <b>protocols.</b> Its benefits are twofold: First, it is an unambiguous description of a protocol model, which greatly facilitates communicating results.

50|$|After {{installing}} the energy conservation measures (ECMs), the savings created {{from the project}} must be determined. This process, termed Measurement and Verification (M&V), is frequently performed by the ESCO, but may also be performed by the customer or a third party. The International Performance Measurement and <b>Verification</b> <b>Protocol</b> (IPMVP) is the standard M&V guideline for determining actual savings created by an energy management program. Because savings are the absence of energy use, they cannot be directly measured. IPMVP provides 4 methods for using measurement to reliably determine actual savings. A plan for applying the most appropriate of the 4 general methods to a specific project is typically created and agreed upon by all parties before implementation of the ECMs.|$|E
