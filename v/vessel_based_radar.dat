30|$|We have {{presented}} {{a new approach}} to robust navigation for surface <b>vessels</b> <b>based</b> on <b>radar</b> measurements only. No infrastructure or maps are needed. The basic idea is to treat the radar scans as images and apply the SIFT algorithm for tracking landmarks of opportunity. We presented two related frameworks, one based on the SLAM idea where the trajectory is estimated jointly with a map, and the other one based on odometry. We have evaluated the SIFT performance and the odometric framework on data from a high-speed patrol boat and obtained a very accurate trajectory and map.|$|R
25|$|Over the summer, the {{original}} experimental set {{was used in}} a series of experiments against submarines. The first took place on 30 April 1941 against HMS Sea Lion, and a second on 10–12 August against ORP Sokół. These clearly demonstrated that the AIS could indeed detect the submarines with only the conning tower exposed, just as the Admiralty had hoped. This led to orders for Air-Surface <b>Vessel</b> <b>radars</b> <b>based</b> on the AIS internals.|$|R

40|$|Earth <b>based</b> <b>radar</b> {{has often}} {{observed}} planets decades before space missions and provided valuable {{information leading to}} the success of those missions. As a Mars Sample Return Mission is contemplated, possible measurements by earth <b>based</b> <b>radar</b> should be reviewed. Earth <b>based</b> <b>radars</b> provide measurements of topography, bulk dielectric constants, rms slopes, and surface rock populations. All of these measurement will be valuable to a Mars Sample Return Mission. The 1988 and 1990 oppositions provide excellent positions for the extension of southern earth based coverage of Mars to - 25 deg, while oppositions {{for the rest of the}} 1990 's will provide coverage of northern latitudes to 25 deg...|$|R

50|$|An {{airborne}} {{early warning}} and control (AEW&C) system is an airborne radar picket system designed to detect aircraft, ships and vehicles at long ranges and perform command {{and control of the}} battlespace in an air engagement by directing fighter and attack aircraft strikes. AEW&C units are also used to carry out surveillance, including over ground targets and frequently perform C2BM (command and control, battle management) functions similar to an Air Traffic Controller given military command over other forces. When used at altitude, the radar on the aircraft allows the operators to detect and track targets and distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft much farther away than a similar ground <b>based</b> <b>radar.</b> Like a ground <b>based</b> <b>radar,</b> it can be detected by opposing forces, but because of its mobility, it is much less vulnerable to counter-attack.|$|R

5000|$|Aircraft are {{frequently}} {{out of the}} range of ground <b>based</b> <b>radar</b> due to altitude. Radar can be blocked by mountains, and typically is not useful for coverage near an airport unless that airport itself has radar. Thus, approach, departure, and especially taxi/ground based operations are compromised (a major selling point of the system).|$|R
