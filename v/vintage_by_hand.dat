This paper applies the same ideas to Grange Hermitage, the only Australian wine with sufficient history to warrant a comparable study. Weather {{does not appear to}} play the same role as in Bordeaux, which {{may be due to the}} fact that Grange is a blended wine or that the market in Australia is too thin or that the climatic variation in Australia is unimportant in wine growing...|$|R

40|$|Maker {{movement}} is often celebrated as a rekindled {{interest in making}} <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> {{as well as a}} promise for new forms of manufacturing and economic growth. In contrast to this popularized image, the theoretical background in the maker movement remains ambivalent. This article {{takes a look at the}} theoretical foundation of the maker movement and proposes a phenomenological approach to making <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> as a framework for maker movement. A particular focus is on the knowledge making process in the maker movement following Finnish craft researcher Kojonkoski-Rännäli's account of making <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> Basing her theory on Martin Heidegger’s philosophical analysis, Kojonkoski-Rännäli sees making <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> an essential way of existing in the world: making <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> develops not only maker’s handicraft skills but also her/his knowledge, responsibility and caring for the world as it appears to her/him through the act of making. In this paper, I explore maker movements’ relation to Kojonkoski-Rännäli’s philosophy of making <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> Moreover, I focus on how the maker movements approach to digital and digitalization relate to making <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> Keywords: Maker movement, code literacy, craft education, philosophy, making <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> </div...|$|R
