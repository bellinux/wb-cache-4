25|$|The Twenty-sixth Amendment (1971) {{prohibits the}} {{government}} from denying the right of United States citizens, eighteen {{years of age or}} older, to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of age. The drive to lower the voting age was driven in large part by the broader student activism movement protesting the Vietnam War. It gained strength following the Supreme Court's decision in Oregon v. Mitchell, which held that Congress may set requirements for voting in federal elections, but not for state or local elections. The measure, which overturns the Mitchell decision, is another in a line of constitutional changes that expanded the right to vote to more citizens.|$|E
500|$|Section 2 prohibits any {{jurisdiction}} from {{implementing a}} [...] "voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure... {{in a manner}} which results in a denial or abridgement of the right... to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race," [...] color, or language minority status. The Supreme Court has allowed private plaintiffs to sue to enforce this prohibition. In Mobile v. Bolden (1980), the Supreme Court held that as originally enacted in 1965, Section 2 simply restated the Fifteenth Amendment and thus prohibited only those voting laws that were intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose. In 1982, Congress amended Section 2 to create a [...] "results" [...] test, which prohibits any voting law that has a discriminatory effect irrespective of whether the law was intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose. The 1982 amendments provided that the results test does not guarantee protected minorities a right to proportional representation.|$|E

2500|$|In Part A, Roberts {{described}} the Fifteenth Amendment's problematic history of enforcement {{that led to}} the passage of the Voting Rights Act, much of which consists of a [...] "scheme of stringent remedies aimed at areas where voting discrimination has been most flagrant." [...] These remedies were bolstered by §5, which suspended any change in state election procedure until the federal government certified that it neither [...] "has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race or color." [...] To confine these remedies to areas of flagrant disenfranchisement, the Act applied them only to States that met certain explicit standards. However, recognizing that this coverage formula [...] "might bring within its sweep governmental units not guilty of any unlawful discriminatory voting practices, [...] afforded such jurisdictions immediately available protection in the form of ... 'bailout' suit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Appellants, a {{group of}} {{citizens}} and registered voters in the Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth Congressional Districts in Manhattan brought suit against New York state officials, including then Governor Nelson Rockefeller, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging {{the constitutionality of the}} portion of New York's 1961 congressional apportionment statute which defined the four districts. [...] The District Court permitted Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, who represented the Eighteenth District, along with several other New York County officials, to intervene as defendants supporting the constitutionality of the statute. [...] The appellants claimed that apportionment statute deprived them of rights guaranteed by the Due Process and Equal protection portions of the Fourteenth Amendment and by the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibit the government from denying or abridging the right to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. [...] Specifically, they claimed that the statute [...] "establish irrational, discriminatory and unequal Congressional Districts in the County of New York and segregat eligible voters by race and place of origin." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of its creation, the Constitution did not {{explicitly}} give citizens an inherent right to vote. [...] Rather, it provided that those qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of a state's legislature may vote in Congressional (House of Representatives) elections. [...] Since the Civil War, several constitutional amendments have been enacted that have curbed the states' broad powers to set voter qualification standards. [...] Though never enforced, clause 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State. [...] The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. [...] The Nineteenth Amendment prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on sex. [...] The Twenty-fourth Amendment prohibits the revocation of voting rights due to the non-payment of a poll tax.

60|$|The head of {{exclusion}} from votes {{for members of}} Parliament is closely connected with the former. When you cast {{your eye on the}} statute-book, you will see that no Catholic, even in the ferocious acts of Queen Anne, was disabled from <b>voting</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of his religion. The only conditions required for that privilege were the oaths of allegiance and abjuration,--both oaths relative to a civil concern. Parliament has since added another oath of the same kind; and yet a House of Commons, adding to the securities of government in proportion as its danger is confessedly lessened, and professing both confidence and indulgence, in effect takes away the privilege left by an act full of jealousy and professing persecution.|$|R
25|$|Indirect – {{nothing in}} law {{specifically}} prevents anyone from <b>voting</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of their race, but other laws or regulations {{are used to}} exclude people of a particular race. In southern states of the United States of America before {{the passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, poll taxes, literacy and other tests were used to disenfranchise African-Americans. Property qualifications have tended to disenfranchise a minority race, particularly if tribally owned land is not allowed to be taken into consideration. In some cases this was an unintended (but usually welcome) consequence. Many African colonies after World War II until decolonization has tough education and property qualifications who practically gave meaningful representation only for rich European minorities.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Frankfurter {{issued the}} opinion of the Court, which held that the Act did violate the {{provision}} of the 15th Amendment prohibiting states from denying anyone their right to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Justice Whitaker concurred but he said in his opinion that he believed the law should have been struck down under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5000|$|With {{respect to}} the Nineteenth Amendment, which states that [...] "The right of {{citizens}} of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex", the court dismissed {{the notion that the}} purpose of the tax was [...] "to deny or abridge the right of men to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of their sex", and denied the claim as a result.|$|E
50|$|The plaintiff, Joseph Hayden, {{a former}} incarcerated felon and Campaign Director at Unlock the Block, {{argues that the}} law has a disproportionate impact on African Americans and {{therefore}} violates Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act as a denial {{of the right to}} <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race, in addition to violating the First, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. The U.S. District Court dismissed the case as not violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, nor of violating any of the Constitutional Amendments.|$|E
5000|$|There {{remained}} {{instances in}} many states that still prevented Natives from voting, {{even though they were}} citizens of the United States. For example, the attorney general of Colorado in 1936 declared that Natives could not vote because they were not citizens of the state. Similarly, states found ways around voting in other ways. Because the Fifteenth Amendment 1870 barred states from limiting <b>voting</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race, states found other ways - residency: claiming that Native Americans were not residents of the state if they resided on reservations, self-termination: one must first abandon their tribal ties in order to vote, taxation: Natives who do not need to pay taxes cannot vote, guardianship: the claim that Native Americans were incompetent and “wards of the state”, and on the lack of ability to read English (McCool 19) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Fifteenth Amendment {{does not}} confer {{the right of}} {{suffrage}} upon any one. It prevents the States, or the United States, however, from giving preference, in this particular, to one citizen of the United States over another <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Before its adoption, this could be done. It was as much within {{the power of a}} State to exclude citizens of the United States from <b>voting</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race, &c., as it was <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of age, property, or education. Now it is not. If citizens of one race having certain qualifications are permitted by law to vote, those of another having the same qualifications must be. Previous to this amendment, there was no constitutional guaranty against this discrimination: now there is. It follows that the amendment has invested the citizens of the United States with a new constitutional right which is within the protecting power of Congress. That right is exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This, under the express provisions of the second section of the amendment, Congress may enforce by [...] "appropriate legislation." ...|$|R

50|$|In 1965 the Voting Rights Act (VRA) {{put an end}} to {{individual}} states' claims on whether or not Natives were allowed to vote through a federal law.

50|$|The {{right of}} blacks {{to vote and}} {{to serve in the}} United States Congress was {{established}} after the Civil War by amendments to the Constitution. The Thirteenth Amendment (ratified December 6, 1865), abolished slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment (ratified July 9, 1868) made all people born or naturalized in the United States citizens. The Fifteenth Amendment (ratified February 3, 1870) forbade the denial or abridgment of the right to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and gave Congress the power to enforce the law by appropriate legislation.|$|E

50|$|Winning only 34 seats, the Liberals {{suffered}} the worst result in their history. They will sit {{as the third}} party in the 41st Parliament, the first since Confederation where the Liberals will not form either the Government or the Official Opposition in the House of Commons. This was the worst showing for an incumbent Official Opposition party in terms of seats, and the lowest percentage for a national Official Opposition party (the Bloc Québécois in 1997 won more seats with a smaller <b>vote</b> share <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of its being a regional party).|$|R
50|$|Once appointed, {{both the}} Chairman of Ways and Means and the Deputy Chairmen {{follow the same}} {{tradition}} of neither speaking nor <b>voting</b> <b>on</b> any matter before the House (unless a casting vote is required). Unlike the Speaker, though, they remain members of their political party and campaign in general elections as party politicians. The Chairman and Second Deputy Chairman are elected from {{the opposite side of}} the House to the (former) party of the Speaker, while the First Deputy Chairman comes from the same side. Because the four do not vote (except to break a tie), this effectively pairs the occupants of the chair (their presumed support for their side cancelling each other out), which means no party loses a <b>voting</b> advantage <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of having one of the four drawn from its ranks.|$|R
5000|$|To {{definitely}} {{end with}} these anomalies, a national Referendum {{was held on}} November 8, 1998, in order to approve a new regionalization (Referendo à Regionalização), which was rejected by over 60% of the <b>voting</b> population <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of disagreements {{over the loss of}} sovereignty of some districts to others (e.g. {{by the time of the}} Referendum it was not known where would be the Seat of Government of the new [...] "Estremadura & Ribatejo" [...] region which was a fusion of the District of Leiria with the District of Santarém, being Leiria and Santarém cities of the same size and importance).|$|R

5000|$|The {{entire state}} of Arizona was a covered {{jurisdiction}} under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, meaning that any change in voting requirements or procedures {{must be approved by}} either the U.S. Department of Justice or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia before taking effect. At the end of the redistricting process, the state had to submit its maps and demonstrate [...] "that the proposed voting change does not deny or abridge the right to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of race, color, or membership in a language minority group," [...] the latter primarily referring to, in the case of Arizona, non-Anglophone Hispanics. The formula for Section 5 was struck down by the United States Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. ___ (2013). Additionally, the proposed boundaries may not have a retrogressive effect on the ability of minority groups to elect [...] "their preferred candidates of choice." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1882, Clifford {{began to}} publish [...] "The Pioneer Press", a {{newspaper}} that was distributed nationally to a largely African American audience. In 1884, he was elected delegate to the Republican National Convention, but several delegations withdrew their <b>votes</b> <b>on</b> <b>account</b> of his race. This group was led by a congressional nominee named Flick. Clifford's opposition to Flick in the Pioneer Press played an key role in Flick's defeat in that election. He published the newspaper until 1917; it was the longest running weekly newspaper dedicated to African American issues during that time period. In 1884, Clifford was honorary commissioner of the colored department of the World Cotton Centennial, the world's fair held in New Orleans that year. In 1887, Clifford became the first African American attorney admitted to the West Virginia State Bar. He practiced law for forty-five years and was active in both state and national politics. Clifford was the President of the National Independent League and the first Vice-President of the American Negro Academy. Clifford was among {{the founders of the}} Niagara Movement, with other prominent African-American civil rights leaders such as W. E. B. Du Bois. In 1906, the Niagara Movement's first American meeting occurred in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The Niagara Movement {{led to the formation of}} the NAACP a few years later and is considered to be the cornerstone of the modern Civil Rights Movement.|$|R

Her July 2012 call to the mostly-black voters at an inner-city candidate forum to [...] "vote for someone who looks like you" [...] led to accusations that she was attacking Assemblywoman Sandy Pasch, the only white candidate in the race to replace Coggs in her 10th Assembly district seat (Pasch's current seat was eliminated by the Republican-led legislature during the most recent redistricting, and she had moved into the new 10th district). All her opponents were African-American, but several African-American candidates at the forum decried her remarks as racist. None of Pasch's opponents had held elected office.
