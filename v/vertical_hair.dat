50|$|As {{in other}} spiders, male {{is smaller than}} female which is 7mm in average length. The species has a {{cylindrical}} and elongate abdomen. The purple spots along the dorsal surface if the abdomen is the characteristic feature. There is a dark stripe in the ventral surface of sternum. A synanthropic spiders, it builds irregular cobweb in sheltered areas to capture small insects and other spiders for food. Legs without spines, few <b>vertical</b> <b>hairs</b> can be seen. Female has a simple epigynum without pockets.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Usage== A typical surveyor's {{instrument}} reticle has {{two pairs}} of stadia marks. One pair are on the horizontal centreline {{and the other on}} the <b>vertical</b> cross <b>hair.</b> Each functions in the same manner and are placed for measuring on either axis.|$|R
40|$|Two small, {{ground and}} litter-dwelling pholcid species from {{northern}} Borneo {{are described as}} representatives of a new genus, Hantu gen. nov. : H. kapit gen. et sp. nov. and H. niah gen. et sp. nov. Previous cladistic analyses suggested a closer relationship with the genera Savarna Huber, 2005 and Khorata Huber, 2005 (mainland Southeast Asia) than with the geographically closer genus Aetana Huber, 2005 (Borneo and Philippines to Fiji). Since the two species do not share any of the synapomorphies of Khorata and Savarna while having several synapomorphies on their own (ventral apophysis on male palpal coxa; male palpal trochanter apophysis with small teeth or scales; spines on male femora 1; high density of <b>vertical</b> <b>hairs</b> on male femora; presence of scape on epigynum), they are here proposed as representing a new genus...|$|R
5000|$|Sagittal — Resembles {{the first}} {{but with the}} {{addition}} of a narrow <b>vertical</b> band of <b>hair</b> extending from the pubic hair towards the navel, often slang called a 'Treasure Trail' or 'Happy Trail'.|$|R
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the <b>vertical</b> emphasis, <b>hair</b> was pulled back at the sides and worn in a high knot or cluster of ringlets, often with a fringe (bangs) over the forehead. [...] False hair was {{commonly}} used. [...] Bonnets were smaller {{to allow for the}} elaborately piled hairstyles and resembled hats except for their ribbons tied under the chin. [...] Smallish hats, some with veils, were perched on top of the head, and brimmed straw hats were worn for outdoor wear in summer.|$|R
40|$|Male. Length 1650, width 1140 μ. — Colour pale; dorsal shield straw-coloured. — Shape {{like that}} of Laelaps agilis C. L. Koch, broad-oval, top forward, with a {{slightly}} indicated shoulder above legs I and II. — Texture scaly in the shields; finely wrinkled in the weak skin. Dorsal side (fig. 1) protected by one shield, long 1530, wide 910 μ, so that a wide margin of weak skin surrounds the shield from the shoulder backwards, and posteriorly. Anteriorly the shield shows the same shoulders above legs I as the body, and less developed shoulders above legs II. The side-edges of the shield are slightly rounded, the posterior edge well rounded. Hairs. The hairs are bristles of two kinds; there are longer and finer ones on the shield, and very short (comparatively thicker) ones in the weak skin. In general {{the length of the}} bristles on the shield is equal to the width of femur I or II. Four stronger ones are visible on the anterior fourth part of the shield, and six longer ones are planted in the posterior edge of the shield. The number of the hairs is normal in the median third part of the shield, abnormal (more numerous) in the lateral third parts of the shield, where they are arranged in oblique rows of about three to six hairs each. In the anterior third part of the shield these oblique rows run {{from the edge of the}} shield inward and forward; in the remaining part they run from the edge of the shield inward and backward. The weak skin (except a portion behind the shield, limited by the 6 long hairs which are planted in the posterior edge of the shield) is densely hairy; the hairs are here minute bristles. Four small <b>vertical</b> <b>hairs</b> are directed forward...|$|R
5000|$|One soldier {{looked through}} the {{telescope}} (a 12- or 20-power instrument) and [...] "waterlined" [...] the target ship, putting a <b>vertical</b> cross <b>hair</b> on the ship's forward stack and a horizontal crosshair on the ship's waterline. By turning a geared crank, he attempted to hold the ship in his sights as it passed through his field of view. A second soldier read azimuth and range data from the instrument at designated intervals. These intervals (usually set at 20 or 30 seconds) were indicated by the ringing of a time-interval bell or buzzer (shown in the image at right on the ceiling over the instrument). This information was then called in by telephone to a fire control center or plotting room for the gun battery that had been selected to fire upon the designated target.|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{such high}} {{adhesion}} between a water droplet and a superhydrophobic surface is explained considering {{the mechanism of}} the gecko's ability to climb up rapidly smooth, <b>vertical</b> surfaces. Each <b>hair</b> of the gecko's foot produces just a miniscule force through van der Waals' interactions, but millions of hairs collectively create the formidable adhesion [47]. In the present case, the ZnO structure-covered superhydrophobic surface is capable of making close contact with water droplets due to large van der Waals' forces, similar {{to the effect of}} the gecko's foot hairs. The high adhesive ability of such a superhydrophobic surface can be applied as a ‘mechanical hand’ in small water droplet transportation without any loss or contamination for microsample analysis [48 – 51].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{exceptional}} {{performance of}} mammalian hearing {{is due to}} the cochlea's amplification of sound-induced mechanical stimuli. During acoustic stimulation, the vertical motion of the outer hair cells relative to the tectorial membrane (TM) is converted into the lateral motion of their stereocilia. The actual mode of this conversion, which represents a fundamental step in hearing, remains enigmatic, as it is unclear why the stereocilia are deflected when pressed against the TM, rather than penetrating it. In this study we show that deflection of the stereocilia is a direct outcome of the anisotropic material properties of the TM. Using force spectroscopy, we find that the vertical stiffness of the TM is significantly larger than its lateral stiffness. As a result, the TM is more resistant to the vertical motion of stereocilia than to their lateral motion, and so they are deflected laterally when pushed against the TM. Our findings are confirmed by finite element simulations of the mechanical interaction between the TM and stereocilia, which show that the <b>vertical</b> outer <b>hair</b> cells motion is converted into lateral stereocilia motion when the experimentally determined stiffness values are incorporated into the model. Our results thus show that the material properties of the TM play a central and previously unknown role in mammalian hearing...|$|R
5000|$|Trainer : Controls the mount's train angle (bearing). He sits in {{the right}} front corner of the mount. (See the far right man in the Mk21 open mount picture.) In front of him, are his optical sight, hand wheels, and train drive {{controls}}. Between his knees is a large box called the Train Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the train power drive. On top of the box, is a window {{with a set of}} dials that indicate the train angle of the gun, and the automatic train orders electrically coming from the Fire Control System by synchro. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", he looks down at the dials on his Indicator-Regulator. The dials also tell him the difference between the gun's present train angle and the ordered train angle. He changes the bearing of the gun, by moving his hand wheels, until the dial difference is zero. His dials are now [...] "matched", and he switches the train drive into Auto. This disengages his hand wheels, and gives train angle control to the Fire Control System. Then, he reports back to the Mount Captain, [...] "Train in auto." [...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the train drive to local. In local control, he controls the gun's train angle with his hand wheels to keep his sight's <b>vertical</b> cross <b>hair</b> on the target.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Study is {{determination}} of histogenesis of the facial skin in ghezel sheep. The study was {{in the form of}} descriptive observation conducted on 100 male sheep fetuses which were collected randomly from pregnant ewes at Tabriz abbatoine. The length of the collected fetuses were measured and their age calculated by the formula X= 2. 1 (Y+ 17) to be between 40 to 130 days old. Following fixation of the fetuses in 10 % buffered formalin samples were separated from the face region having individual and tactile hair follicles. They were studied histologically after the histotechnique and H&E staining procedures. In initial stages of facial skin development, the epidermal layer consisted of a row of cuboidal cells (basal layer) covered by a row of squamus cells, the periderm. At the 8 th week of gestation the intermediate layer was formed by multiplication of germinal layer cells which was converted to spinosus cell layer at the 14 th week of gestation. The skin was cornified at the last trimester of gestation. Formation of hair follicles, sebaceous and sweat glands began at the 9 th week of gestation. Sebaceous and sweat glands formed from primary hair follicles and the appearance of myoepithelial cells coincides with the formation of sweet glands. Unlike other mammals in which hair follicle grows obliquely, <b>vertical</b> growth of <b>hair</b> follicle was observed in sheep. It was concluded that the 13 th week of gestation is a critical period in the appearance of most ovine fetal akin structures as mellanocytes, myoepithelial cells, sebaceous and sweet glands appear at this time. Based on {{the results of the present}} study, the developmental pattern of sheep embryonic skin is similar to that observed in man and other mammals...|$|R
