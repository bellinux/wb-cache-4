5000|$|Forty-nine main {{armament}} rounds {{are carried}} in the turret and hull; these are a mix of L27A1 APFSDS (also referred to as CHARM 3), L31 HESH and L34 white phosphorus smoke rounds, depending on the situation. As with earlier versions of the 120 mm gun, the propellant charges are loaded separately from the shell or KE projectile. A combustible rigid charge {{is used for the}} APFSDS rounds, and a combustible hemispherical bag charge for the HESH and Smoke rounds. An electrically fired <b>vent</b> <b>tube</b> is used to initiate firing of the main armament rounds. (The main armament ammunition is thus described to be [...] "three part ammunition", consisting of the projectile, charge and <b>vent</b> <b>tube.)</b> The separation of ammunition pieces also aids in ensuring lower chances of ammo detonation.|$|E

50|$|The pumps used in VADs can {{be divided}} into two main categories—pulsatile pumps, that mimic the natural pulsing action of the heart, and {{continuous}} flow pumps. Pulsatile VADs use positive displacement pumps. In some pulsatile pumps (that use compressed air as the/a energy source), the volume occupied by blood varies during the pumping cycle. If the pump is contained inside the body then a <b>vent</b> <b>tube</b> to the outside air is required.|$|E

50|$|Usually, special <b>vent</b> <b>tubes</b> allow {{atmospheric}} {{pressure to be}} maintained in the float chamber as the fuel level changes; these tubes usually extend into the carburetor throat. Placement of these <b>vent</b> <b>tubes</b> is critical to prevent fuel from sloshing out of them into the carburetor, and sometimes they are modified with longer tubing. Note that this leaves the fuel at {{atmospheric pressure}}, and therefore it cannot travel into a throat which has been pressurized by a supercharger mounted upstream; in such cases, the entire carburetor must be contained in an airtight pressurized box to operate. This is not necessary in installations where the carburetor is mounted upstream of the supercharger, which {{is for this reason}} the more frequent system. However, this results in the supercharger being filled with compressed fuel/air mixture, with a strong tendency to explode should the engine backfire; this type of explosion is frequently seen in drag races, which for safety reasons now incorporate pressure releasing blow-off plates on the intake manifold, breakaway bolts holding the supercharger to the manifold, and shrapnel-catching ballistic blankets made from nylon or kevlar surrounding the superchargers.|$|R

50|$|The gun {{superseded}} the QF six-inch gun of the 1890s, {{a period}} during which the Royal Navy had evaluated QF technology (i.e. loading propellant charges in brass cartridge cases) for all classes of guns up to six inches to increase rates of fire. BL Mk VII returned to loading charges in silk bags after {{it was determined that}} with new single-action breech mechanisms a six-inch BL gun could be loaded, a <b>vent</b> <b>tube</b> inserted and fired as quickly as a QF six inch gun. Cordite charges in silk bags stored for a BL gun were also considered to represent a considerable saving in weight and magazine space compared to the bulky brass QF cartridge cases.|$|E
50|$|Shock {{absorber}} {{design was}} changed slightly in 2005 to incorporate an elevated <b>vent</b> <b>tube</b> to prevent oil {{loss in the}} event of a tip-over. The factory-fitted mono shock has three-way dampening, using a combination of internal coil spring, air and hydraulic fluid (oil). Air pressure is used to adjust the mono shock depending on the load at any time. The mono shock is a sealed unit and not able to be repaired or re-built if it fails. Such failures after relatively low mileage were common-place in early years and were replaced under warranty. Third party, after-market replacement units are popular with owners despite the fact they are more expensive than original (OEM), as they are serviceable and can be re-built if necessary.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a second}} type of ink drying that most {{printers}} are unable to prevent. For ink to spray from the cartridge, air must enter to displace the removed ink. The air enters via an extremely long, thin labyrinth tube, up to 10 cm long, wrapping {{back and forth across}} the ink tank. The channel is long and narrow to reduce moisture evaporation through the <b>vent</b> <b>tube,</b> but some evaporation still occurs and eventually the ink cartridge dries up from the inside out. To combat this problem, which is especially acute with professional fast-drying solvent inks, many wide-format printer cartridge designs contain the ink in an airtight, collapsible bag that requires no vent. The bag merely shrinks until the cartridge is empty.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{explore the}} effect of {{equivalence}} ratio on the propagation process of combustible gas in the <b>venting</b> <b>tube,</b> in the present study, the k turbulent model and the combustion models were implemented base on unaltered venting conditions and different equivalence ratio of methane-air. In particular, the numerical simulation results illustrate both speed and pressure were at maximum when equivalence ratio was 1. 0. However, methane-air didn't reach the most sufficient combustion when equivalence ratio was 1. 0. It was possible that the pressure release caught the equivalence ratio change and failed to generate detonation...|$|R
50|$|In 1911 {{the first}} rigid airship {{produced}} by the German Schütte-Lanz company was flown. Designed by the naval architect Johann Schütte, the Schütte-Lanz introduced a number of technical innovations. The shape of the hull was more streamlined than the early Zeppelin craft, the hulls of which were cylindrical {{for most of their}} length, simplifying construction at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency. Other Schütte-Lanz innovations included the use of an axial cable running the length of the airship to reduce additional stressing caused by the partial deflation of a single gasbag, the introduction of <b>venting</b> <b>tubes</b> to carry any hydrogen vented {{to the top of the}} ship and simplified cruciform tail surfaces.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Otitis {{media with}} {{effusion}} (OME) {{is one of}} the most common diseases in the childhood. Clinical manifestations vary from speech damage to learning deficit. The diagnosis must be made, mainly, through the physical exam and tympanometry. The treatment of OME may be clinical or surgical, with a <b>vent</b> <b>tube.</b> Objective: To evaluate the follow-up of patients with OME submitted to the placing of <b>vent</b> <b>tube</b> and compare the pre- and postoperative audiometric findings. Method: Children with OME and failure in the clinical treatment were submitted to tympanometry and placing of <b>vent</b> <b>tube.</b> The audiometry obtained in the postoperative period was compared with that requested during follow-up, between six and twelve months after surgery, subsequent to the tube extrusion.

A 21 -mm Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT (CEP) Magna Ease pericardial prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) was implanted after valve excision. The patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary support uneventfully. Intraoperative administration of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (200  mg) and red cell concentrates (560  ml) was carried out.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the NACA Cleveland icing research tunnel to determine the aerodynamic and icing characteristics of several recessed fuel-vent configurations. The vents were investigated aerodynamically to obtain vent-tube pressures and pressure distributions on the ramp surface as functions of tunnel-air velocity and angle of attack. Icing investigations were made to determine the vent-tube pressure losses for several icing conditions at tunnel-air velocities ranging from 220 to 440 feet per second. In general, under nonicing conditions, the configurations with diverging ramp walls maintained, vent-tube pressures greater than the required marginal value of 2 inches of water positive pressure differential between the fuel cell and the compartment containing the fuel cell {{for a range of}} angles of attack from 0 to 14 deg at a tunnel-air velocity of approximately 240 feet per second. A configuration haying divergIng ramp sldewalls, a 7 deg ramp angle; and <b>vent</b> <b>tubes</b> manifold,ed to a common plenum chamber opening through a slot In the ramp floor gave the greatest vent-tube pressures for all the configurations investigated. The use of the plenum chamber resulted in uniform pressures in all <b>vent</b> <b>tubes.</b> In a cloud-icing condition, roughness caused by ice formations on the airfoil surface ahead of the vent ramp, rather than icing of the vent configuration, caused a rapid loss in vent-tube pressures during the first few minutes of an icing period. Only the configuration having diverging ramp sidewalls, a 7 ramp angle, and a common plenum chamber maintained the required vent-tube pressures throughout a 60 -minute icing period, although the ice formations on this configuration were more severe than those observed for the other configurations. No complete closure of vent-tube openings occurred for the configurations investigated. A simulated freezing-rain condition caused a greater and more rapid vent-tube pressure loss than was observed for a cloud-icing condition...|$|R
30|$|The {{influence}} of the culture vessel on the glycosylation profile of the mAb produced by CHO cells in microcarriers was also considered in this work, by comparing <b>vented</b> conical <b>tubes</b> with shake flasks. The culture vessel was highly influential particularly in the sialylation levels of the mAb, which abruptly decreased to practically absent sialylation in shake flasks, predicting a positive outcome on mAb biological activity. Additionally, shake flasks seem to provide a less heterogeneity of glycoforms, {{as demonstrated by the}} lowest number of peaks obtained (11 peaks, Table[*] 3). Since cell concentrations are highly improved in shake flasks when compared to the <b>vented</b> conical <b>tube</b> cultures, it is possible that these improved levels, or the factors that led to them (e.g. better oxygenation and mass transfer), have caused these modifications on sialylation and heterogeneity.|$|R

40|$|Effusive {{activity}} at Stromboli is uncommon, and the 2002 – 2003 flank eruption {{gave us the}} opportunity to observe and analyze a number of complex volcanic processes. In particular, the use of a handheld thermal camera during the eruption allowed us to monitor the volcano even in difficult weather and operating conditions. Regular helicopter-borne surveys with the thermal camera throughout the eruption have significantly improved (1) mapping of active lava flows; (2) detection of new cracks, landslide scars, and obstructions forming within and on the flanks of active craters; (3) observation of active lava flow field features, such as location of new <b>vents,</b> <b>tube</b> systems, tumuli, and hornitos; (4) identification of active vent migration along the Sciara del Fuoco; (5) monitoring of crater's inner morphology and maximum temperature, revealing magma level changes within the feeding conduit; and (6) detection of lava flow field endogenous growth.
