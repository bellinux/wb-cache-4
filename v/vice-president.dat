5|$|In 1925 Brundage became <b>vice-president</b> of the AAU, and {{chairman}} of its Handball Committee. After a year as first <b>vice-president,</b> he became president in 1928 and kept the post (except for a one-year break in 1933) through 1935.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>vice-president's</b> office of the USA, his powers and his {{position}} in the American executive. Considering relatively limited constitutional definition of the vice-presidency, also circumstances of the historic evolution of election this function and issues of <b>vice-president's</b> succession to the presidential office are the subjects of my thesis. The <b>vice-president's</b> selection in the United States of America used to be for many reasons a very important and by the public desirously awaited decision of a presidential candidate before presidential elections. This is the reason, why the thesis deals also {{with the issue of}} the impact of the <b>vice-president's</b> nomination on a presidential campaign...|$|R

5|$|This is a {{complete}} list of Vice-Presidents of the Philippines, who were inaugurated as <b>Vice-President</b> of the Philippines following the ratification of a constitution that explicitly declared the existence of the Philippines. The inclusion of Mariano Trías in the list is disputed, for Trias was chosen as <b>vice-president</b> at the Tejeros Convention, and again as <b>vice-president</b> for the short-lived Republic of Biak-na-Bato, which was dissolved after the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato and Aguinaldo's exile. Neither the reassumption of power by Emilio Aguinaldo when the revolution was resumed in May 1898 nor his formal proclamation and inauguration as President under the First Philippine Republic in 1899 were regimes that provided for a vice-presidency. The vice-presidency {{within the context of the}} Philippine government was formally created by the constitution in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Three vice-presidents succeeded to the {{presidency}} due {{to the death of}} presidents - Sergio Osmeña (1944), Elpidio Quirino (1948) and Carlos P. Garcia (1957). They did not nominate a new <b>vice-president,</b> since the 1935 constitution was silent on the matter; a new <b>vice-president</b> would sit after the results of following elections were known. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo became president after the Supreme Court ruled that President Joseph Estrada resigned. Arroyo appointed Teofisto Guingona days after she ascended to power. The 1987 constitution mandated the President to nominate a <b>vice-president</b> from a member of the Congress of the Philippines, in which both houses vote separately for confirmation via a majority vote.|$|E
