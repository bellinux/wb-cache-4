40|$|Abstract- There {{are several}} {{critical}} {{issues facing the}} area of software engineering as it moves towards being generally recognized as a distinct engineering discipline, including the formulation of a Body of Knowledge, the development of curriculum models, the accreditation of software engineering degree programs in higher education, the formulation of {{a code of ethics}} and professional practice for the discipline, and the licensing of professional engineers in software engineering. All of these areas have major efforts currently going on, some of which affect only the United States, with others having global impact. One effort with possible worldwide ramifications is the Guidelines for Software Education currently being developed by the Working Group for Software Engineering Education and Training. The first task of the team the writing the Guidelines is to develop a detailed undergraduate software engineering curriculum model. This paper will discuss how current efforts in other areas such as the body of knowledge, licensing and accreditation are impacting upon the formulation of the Guidelines. The second task of the Guidelines team is to show how software <b>engineering</b> <b>fits</b> within the larger concept of software education across computing disciplines. In this regard, the Guidelines will demonstrate how software <b>engineering</b> <b>fits</b> into computer science, computer engineering, and software engineering curricula. This paper will therefore also provide some background concerning developments in software education that have both inspired and impact the Guidelines. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{introduction}} of composite materials {{which has been}} used for 35  years in the field of Civil Engineering allows other techniques of strengthening of reinforced concrete structures by bonding composite carbon fibre fabrics Ivanova [1]. However, the short reinforced concrete corbel is an important structural element to support the pre-cast structural system, such as pre-cast beam and pre-stressed beam. Most of the structures in Civil <b>Engineering</b> <b>fit</b> the current safety standards or have excessive cracks. Steel corrosion may also cause the occurrence of high deflection or instability of the structure itself. It is generally manifested by poor performance under service loading in the form of excessive deflections or cracking. The technique of strengthening compensates the loss of stiffness and cracking development. In fact, this technique improves the performance and durability of the structures.|$|R

40|$|Experience-based {{continuous}} learning {{is an essential}} for improving methods, techniques, and tools in a discipline such as software engineering. This can be facilitated by capturing and managing the experience in a repository. Since we have to handle a "continuous stream of experience," such a repository requires maintenance.

40|$|Abstract—Fit {{represents}} a central concept for organizational design, but extant research maintains a static focus on fit, a focus that is incommensurate with the fundamentally dynamic nature of organizations and their environments. Most key organizational environments are inherently dynamic; hence, the corresponding organizational designs required for fit are necessarily dynamic too. The problem is, {{the dynamics of}} fit are not addressed well by extant theory in organization and management sciences. Al-ternatively, organizations {{can be viewed as}} systems of purposeful design, and designing organizations to maintain fit and respond to dynamic environments over time may be informed well by theory and practice in engineering fields where such design is well established. In this paper, we abstract to the level of airplane design, and we utilize the dynamical language and integrated system of concepts, definitions, and interrelationships from the en-gineering field Aerodynamics to extend organization and manage-ment sciences and address the problem of organizational design in a dynamic context. We begin with a focused summary of the literature regarding the nature of organizational fitness. We then outline a conceptual model adapted to organizational design from Aerodynamics, and we summarize the key aerodynamics concepts stability and maneuverability to inform our conceptualization in terms of both airplane and organization design. This paper enables us to articulate a set of propositions and measures that form a basis for empirical testing. This paper also reveals important, dynamic organizational design tradeoffs and implications, and it shows how such conceptualization can elucidate new insights via comparison with and extension to extant theory.
