40|$|Multimodal {{displays}} {{are increasingly}} being utilized as driver warnings. Abstract warnings, without any semantic association to the signified event, and language-based warnings are examples of such displays. This paper presents a first comparison between these two types, across all combinations of audio, visual and tactile modalities. Speech, text and Speech Tactons (a novel form of tactile warnings synchronous to speech) were compared to abstract pulses in two experiments. Results showed that recognition times of warning urgency during a non-critical driving situation were shorter for abstract warnings, highly urgent warnings and warnings including visual feedback. Response times during a critical situation were shorter for warnings including audio. We therefore suggest abstract visual feedback when informing drivers during a non-critical situation and audio in a highly critical one. Language-based warnings during a critical situation performed equally well as abstract ones, so they are suggested as less annoying <b>vehicle</b> <b>alerts...</b>|$|E
40|$|Vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) {{wireless}} {{networks are}} {{a special case}} of mobile ad hoc networks where the topology is constrained to a street map, maximum relative speeds are in excess of 90 m/s and the node density spans a large dynamic range reaching over 5, 000 vehicles/mi 2. V 2 V communication aims to make the driving experience safer, more efficient and more enjoyable by delivering <b>vehicle</b> <b>alerts,</b> traffic updates and streaming data across multiple hops. Given the scale and ephemeral connectivity of such networks, {{it is essential to}} evaluate V 2 V network protocols in terms of end-to-end message delay, reachability and persistence with incremental deployment. We propose GrooveNet, a hybrid simulation approach where the same network models are used both in simulation and real mobile test-beds and also allow interaction between real and virtual nodes. GrooveNet accurately models inter-vehicular communication between thousands of vehicles within a real street map-based topography. It facilitates protocol design, rapid in-vehicle deployment and model validation. GrooveNet supports multiple network interfaces, GPS and events triggered from the vehicle’s on-board computer. Through simulation, we are able to study the message latency, persistence and coverage under various traffic conditions.

This implies that different coding strategies, diversity andretransmission schemes must be used to achieve correctness and robustness against theimpairments of the wireless channel. This survey presents and discusses different wireless communication standards as well asproprietary solutions that are intended especially for a high-speed vehicular environment. Since VAS is aiming for real-time wireless communication, the examined standards will beevaluated accordingly. Real-time communication implies that there is an upper bound on thecommunication delay such that if the data never reaches its intended recipient before a certaindeadline this will have a more or less negative impact on the system performance. One of themost important features of a real-time communication system (and perhaps even more crucialin a wireless high-speed vehicular environment) is the medium access method. If it is notdeterministic (i. e., if there exists no upper bound on the delay before a station gets access tothe wireless channel) {{it is not possible to}} give guarantees about meeting the deadlines. All currently existing standards, draft specifications and proprietary solutions with explicitintention for being used in a vehicular environment are covered in this survey. In preparationof this document the standard/draft documents themselves have been studied and forproprietary solutions the respective company’s home pages and in some cases articles havebeen used for collecting information. One of the currently most discussed standards is thedraft IEEE 802. 11 p which has been thoroughly studied here. It inherits features from theQuality of Service amendment IEEE 802. 11 e and the physical layer supplement IEEE 802. 11 a. The full protocol suite WAVE, also developed by IEEE, incorporates the 802. 11 p. Other standards, drafts and proprietary solutions that have been studied are IEEE 802. 16,IEEE 802. 20, flash-OFDM, national DSCR systems, CALM and IEEE 802. 21. These systemsrange from being simple RFID-look-a-like DSRC systems to more advanced centralized WMAN standards. It can be concluded that none of the standards or proprietary solutions described in this surveyis suitable for applications such as those considered in the VAS research project. Within thedifferent standards there certainly are features suitable for a <b>vehicle</b> <b>alert</b> system but nostandard totally fit the requirements of VAS.

40|$|Abstract — During recent years, {{various studies}} have {{suggested}} that around 20 % of all road accidents are fatigue-related and up to 50 % on certain roads. In this scenario, preventing accidents under drowsiness state has become a major focus for active safety driving. To reduce the accidents rate, it is needed to provide an efficient safety measure. Literature says that, the drowsiness condition of driver can be best monitored by using an eye blink sensor (or) fabric electrode (or) ECG Sensor. But by monitoring the drowsiness condition alone, the accidents cannot be avoided, unless vehicle speed is controlled. To overcome this problem, the proposed hardware system implemented with ECG electrode and PIC microcontroller measures the heart function of the driver and it compares that with stored ECG signal for drowsy state. For that the electrode is fixed in the right hand and left hand of the driver. If the system identifies that the driver is in drowsy state, it follows the sequence of operation like alters the driver by a buzzer, sends a warning signal to the control room, monitor and control the speed of the vehicle by cutting the fuel supply to the engine. In addition to that, the LED fixed at the backside of <b>vehicle</b> <b>alerts</b> the rear vehicles to reduce its speed. The proposed idea is developed as hardware model using PIC microcontroller and the results obtained are discussed...|$|E
