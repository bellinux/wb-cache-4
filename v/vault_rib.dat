50|$|The 15th-century portico {{has three}} arches, the two outer being pointed, {{supported}} by four columns and <b>vaulting</b> <b>ribs.</b> Under the portico is the Porta Regum (Kings' Door), with a finely decorated marble portal flanked by wall paintings.|$|R
50|$|The {{windows and}} {{ceilings}} in the cloister and chapter house are fine examples of mediaeval stonework. The rib-vaulted ceiling is constructed from stone ribs filled in with stone blocks. There are decorative carved faces along the cloister where the <b>vaulting</b> <b>ribs</b> {{emerge from the}} walls.|$|R
50|$|Architecture {{throughout}} the Gothic ages {{began with the}} construction of various cathedrals including ones the abbey church of Saint-Denis which not only was highly decorated with wondrous statues, but was also the resting place of their kings. The churches in these times were made larger by introducing the <b>ribbed</b> <b>vaults.</b> These <b>ribbed</b> <b>vaults</b> enlarged the clerestory and windows while allowing them to bear more weight from the building with the help of buttresses. Overall, these <b>ribbed</b> <b>vaults</b> helped to expand the space, making the Gothic churches larger.|$|R
50|$|The {{intersection}} {{of two to}} three barrel <b>vaults</b> produces a <b>rib</b> <b>vault</b> or <b>ribbed</b> <b>vault</b> when they are edged with an armature of piped masonry often carved in decorative patterns; compare groin vault, an older form of vault construction. While {{the mechanics of the}} weight of a groin vault and its transmission outwards to the supporting pillars remained as it had been, the new use of <b>rib</b> <b>vaults</b> demonstrates the skill of the masons and the grandeur of the new ideas circulating at the introduction of Gothic architecture in the end of the eleventh century. This technique was new in the late eleventh century, for example in the roofs of the choir side-aisles at Durham Cathedral. Romanesque ancestors of the Gothic <b>rib</b> <b>vault</b> can be found in early Gothic constructions at Cefalù, Caen, Durham, and elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The present bath ruins {{constitute}} {{about one-third}} of a massive bath complex that {{is believed to have}} been constructed around the beginning of the 3rd century. The best preserved room is the frigidarium, with intact architectural elements such as Gallo-Roman <b>vaults,</b> <b>ribs</b> and consoles, and fragments of original decorative wall painting and mosaics.|$|R
60|$|Well; he, or {{he and his}} son together, painted {{these four}} {{quarters}} of {{the roof of the}} Spanish Chapel. They were very probably much retouched afterwards by Antonio Veneziano, or whomsoever Messrs. Crowe and Cavalcasella please; but that architecture in the descent of the Holy Ghost is by the man who painted the north transept of Assisi, and there need be no more talk about the matter,--for you never catch a restorer doing his old architecture right again. And farther, the ornamentation of the <b>vaulting</b> <b>ribs</b> is by the man who painted the Entombment, No. 31 in the Galerie des Grands Tableaux, in the catalogue of the Academy for 1874. Whether that picture is Taddeo Gaddi's or not, as stated in the catalogue, I do not know; but I know the <b>vaulting</b> <b>ribs</b> of the Spanish Chapel are painted by the same hand.|$|R
50|$|The vault of {{the nave}} is {{supported}} with cylindrical pillars {{standing on a}} circular plinth. There are probably located {{the foundations of the}} original pillars with square profiles under these pillars, similar to the shape of the arch of triumph’s supports’ feet, suggesting the same architectural concept. The pillars under the tower also show a later change of the vaulting plan, since the jugs of the <b>vault</b> <b>ribs</b> show the original plan of using the cross vault. They use a tracery <b>vault,</b> therefore these <b>ribs</b> had to be additionally turned and duplicated.|$|R

50|$|The eastern chapel has an {{irregular}} polygonal swallow tails, and reticulated <b>vault</b> with <b>ribs.</b> Southern oratory {{also has a}} vault with a simple conical consoles. West Chapel has a rectangular wall. The room is vaulted with simple rectangular <b>vault,</b> which <b>ribs</b> end on different kinds of brackets. The chapel is lightened by {{a window on the}} south side and geometric tracery.|$|R
50|$|The main nave {{space is}} unique {{because it is}} vaulted on the single middle slender {{cylindrical}} pillar which supports the vault. The pillar has a cylindrical pedestal, simple base and small ring in the upper part. The <b>vault</b> <b>ribs</b> {{are connected to the}} pillar through small corbels. The main nave is almost a square. The both west square fields have a cross-ribbed vault.|$|R
50|$|The Romanesque {{architectural}} {{details of}} the church's interior are emphasised by the decorative use of colour, with the voussoirs of the nave arcades being of alternately black and white marble, creating stripes, as seen at Orvieto Cathedral. The vault compartments are all painted with lapis lazuli dotted with gold stars, and the <b>vaulting</b> <b>ribs</b> are emphasised with bands of geometric decoration predominantly in red, white and gold.|$|R
50|$|Inside, the barrel-vaulted nave is {{separated}} from the vaulted aisles by an arcade of tall Corinthian columns; the vault springs from the entablature. All the <b>vaults,</b> <b>ribs</b> and arches are richly decorated with Florentine-style reliefs. The column capitals and fluting are also gilded. The center of the nave vault has trompe-l'œil paintings of the heavens; an elaborate Florentine-style floral pattern decorates {{the interior of the}} dome.|$|R
50|$|The main {{doors open}} into a vaulted {{vestibule}} with paneled wainscoting and a chair rail. Tall pilasters support a simple, molded entablature and {{connect with the}} <b>vault</b> <b>ribbing.</b> Fluted pilasters also frame the door from the interior. A staircase with turned newel posts leads downstairs on the west side. A much shorter stairway leads into the auditorium through an entrance with an elliptical arch, molded keystone and molded impost blocks.|$|R
6000|$|... [46] The entire {{development}} of this cross system in connexion with [...] the <b>vaulting</b> <b>ribs,</b> has been most clearly explained by Professor [...] Willis (Architecture of Mid. Ages, Chap. IV.); and I strongly [...] recommend every reader who is inclined to take pains in the matter, [...] to read that chapter. I have been contented, in my own text, to [...] pursue the abstract idea of shaft form.|$|R
60|$|The <b>vaulting</b> <b>ribs</b> {{have the}} {{simplest}} of all profiles--that of a chamfered beam. I call it simpler than even that of a square beam; for in barking a log you cheaply get your chamfer, and nobody cares whether the level is alike on each side: but you must take a larger tree, and use much more work to get a square. And {{it is the same}} with stone.|$|R
50|$|During the Romanesque period, {{many churches}} of the {{basilica}} form were constructed all over Europe. Many of these churches have wooden roofs with clerestories below them. Some Romanesque churches have barrel vaulted ceilings with no clerestory. The {{development of the}} groin <b>vault</b> and <b>ribbed</b> <b>vault</b> made possible the insertion of clerestory windows.|$|R
50|$|The Saint-André spring {{flowed from}} a Gothic shrine in the 14th century which was <b>vaulted</b> by a <b>ribbed</b> <b>vault.</b> It {{is named after}} the parish {{that existed in the}} 11th century and was {{destroyed}} in 1791.|$|R
50|$|The undercroft {{has three}} bays of quadrapartite <b>ribbed</b> <b>vaults.</b> The <b>ribs</b> are of simple {{decoration}} with excellent dressed infill. Illumination is from wide windows, externally lancet and internally square headed {{with the original}} oak lintels still in place. Originally the windows were fitted with iron bars, possibly for security to what was originally, and remained, a cellar.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{structure has}} a central nave separated from lateral aisles by brick columns and pilasters. The <b>vaults</b> are <b>ribbed</b> in Gothic-style.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ribbed</b> <b>vaults</b> {{came into}} general {{use in the}} 12th century. In <b>ribbed</b> <b>vaults,</b> not only are there <b>ribs</b> {{spanning}} the <b>vaulted</b> area transversely, but each vaulted bay has diagonal ribs, following the same course as the groins in a groin vault. However, whereas in a groin vault, the vault itself is the structural member, in a <b>ribbed</b> <b>vault,</b> it is the ribs that are the structural members, and the spaces between them can be filled with lighter, non-structural material.|$|R
50|$|The sacristy {{is located}} on the ground floor, {{in the area of the}} {{extension}} to the northern part of the presbytery. It has a rectangular floor plan and includes two fields of vaulting. In the bigger field there is a star net vault, in the smaller there is a simple cross <b>vault.</b> The <b>vault</b> <b>ribs</b> have a similar pear-shaped profile. In the south-western corner of the sacristy there is a spiral staircase, leading to the depository above the sacristy.|$|R
50|$|The kitchen, {{based on}} a square {{floorplan}} with a <b>vault</b> and <b>ribs</b> connecting on a chimney at the top, {{was built in the}} 1350s.|$|R
50|$|On the exterior, {{the south}} door and arch, west doorway, blocked north aisle window and string course are all Norman. The Romanesque arches of the nave were {{constructed}} on {{the foundation of}} the earlier Norman church, with the Transitional chancel being added {{at the end of the}} 12th century, probably being started around 1170, and the whole church being completed by the end of the century. The chancel has a quadripartite <b>ribbed</b> <b>vault,</b> with modern plaster between the ribs. The central boss is of the Lamb of God. There was a central tower,which was removed in 1659, the thrusting out of the responds between choir and nave being visible today, as are distortion in the <b>vault</b> <b>ribs</b> of the chancel.|$|R
5|$|Further {{development}} {{included the}} repetition of Curvilinear or flame-like forms that occur in {{a great number of}} windows of around 1320, notably in the retro-choir at Wells and the nave of Exeter Cathedral. This type of tracery is often seen in combination with <b>vaulting</b> <b>ribs</b> of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as is seen in the chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, uninterrupted by a central tower, for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|R
50|$|The church {{walls are}} {{whitewashed}} with colour underlined <b>ribs</b> of cross <b>vault.</b> <b>Ribs</b> are led in bundles and ended on brackets with mascaron or floristic motif. Ribs are connected {{in the middle}} of the vault with the circular keystone, which is thematically painted. In the central nave are also paintings of the saint patrons.Under the organ loft is a jump vault in the center field, which has ribs decorated with lacy tracery. These ribs converge into a circular keystone with the letter G (Gradec) - as Hradec.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the church was changed in the later 18th century, in French Neoclassical style. [...] created the stucco designs. He added Corithian columns, a Neoclassical sill and covered the Gothic <b>vaulting</b> <b>rib</b> with stucco garlands. Walls and ceiling were covered by white and yellow stucco. Stucco reliefs show scenes {{from the life of}} Jesus (nave) and from the life of Bernard of Clairvaux (choir). Oil paintings {{on the walls of the}} side aisles show saints or beatified members of the Cistercian order.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} feature added to both churches in about 1120 was the <b>ribbed</b> <b>vault,</b> {{used for the}} first time in France. The two abbey churches are considered forerunners of the Gothic. The original Romanesque apse was replaced in 1166 by an early Gothic chevet, complete with rosette windows and flying buttresses. Nine towers and spires were added in the 13th century. The interior vaulting shows a similar progression, beginning with early sexpartite <b>vaulting</b> (using circular <b>ribs)</b> in the nave and progressing to quadripartite <b>vaults</b> (using pointed <b>ribs)</b> in the sanctuary.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of a groin vault can be understood most simply by visualising two barrel vault sections at right angles merging to form a squarish unit. The resulting four ribs convey the stress loading to the four corners, or piers. The more complex groin vault is intrinsically a stronger design compared to the barrel vault, since the barrel vault structure must rest on long walls creating less stable lateral stress, whereas the groin vault design can direct stresses almost purely vertically on the piers. A common association of vaulting in cathedrals of the Middle Ages involves a nave of barrel vault design with transepts of groined <b>vaulting.</b> <b>Rib</b> <b>vaults</b> resemble groin vaults but introduce structural ribs running along the angles which carry much of the weight, making possible much greater variations of proportion.|$|R
