The house was built in 1769 and {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1973.

5|$|Fauxlivia (Anna Torv), still {{posing as}} the prime universe's Olivia (Torv), informs Newton of this development. Newton {{contacts}} a second shapeshifter, Ray (Marcus Giamatti), to infiltrate the secured location where Van Horn's body is being held to remove the data disc that Walter will ultimately find. Ray regrets the possibility of having to leave his current identity, a police officer with a wife and son. Meanwhile, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Fauxlivia discover that <b>Van</b> <b>Horn</b> has acquired a number of records on the personnel of the Fringe team, and likely has used the information to aid the parallel universe's Walternate (Noble).|$|E
5|$|During the 2005–06 season, Duncan {{suffered}} from plantar fasciitis {{for most of}} the season, which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances. The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA Playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense. But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith <b>Van</b> <b>Horn,</b> Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.|$|E

The parallel universe also featured Andre Royo as Henry Higgins, Amy Madigan as Marilyn Dunham, and Philip Winchester as Frank Stanton, all for three episodes. Ryan McDonald played two versions of Brandon Fayette for twelve episodes, and Orla Brady guest starred as Elizabeth Bishop for one episode. Sebastian Roché returned from the second season to play one of the season's antagonists Thomas Jerome Newton for two episodes, along with Gerard Plunkett as Senator <b>Van</b> <b>Horn.</b> Kevin Corrigan depicted Samuel Weiss for three episodes, Karen Holness played Diane Broyles for two, Clark Middleton played Edward Markham and J.

Others early settlers included George Drake, Reverend John Drake, and Captain Francis Drake, kinsmen of the famous explorer.

5|$|The {{second season}} marked {{a large number}} of {{recurring}} guest appearances. Michael Cerveris played September/The Observer, a mysterious man that observes important events and appeared in every episode of the season, often merely in brief glimpses. Further Observers were revealed, including August (Peter Woodward) and December (Eugene Lipinski). Ryan McDonald portrayed Massive Dynamic scientist Brandon Fayette, while its founder, Dr. William Bell was played by Leonard Nimoy, despite the actor's recent retirement.

25|$|SH 54 {{begins at}} I-10 Exit 140A in <b>Van</b> <b>Horn.</b> From I-10 the route runs {{concurrently}} with US 90 north along <b>Van</b> <b>Horn</b> Dr. At Broadway Blvd., US 90 terminates and SH 54 turns east along Bus.

25|$|Over {{the next}} several years, many changes to the route were spurred by the {{creation}} of the United States Highway system. In 1927, US 90 was newly designated in Texas over a route that replaced the portion of SH 54 between Alpine and the combined route of the new US 80 and SH 1 in <b>Van</b> <b>Horn.</b> In 1932, US 62 was created along SH 54 from the state line to SH 130 and then along SH 130 to El Paso. By 1933, SH 3 was realigned westward concurrently with US 90 to <b>Van</b> <b>Horn.</b> SH 54 and SH 130 kept their designations as concurrent routes to US 62. Between 1936 and 1940, US 90 was extended northward through <b>Van</b> <b>Horn</b> to US 62. On September 26, 1939, SH 54 and intersecting routes SH 1, SH 3, and SH 130 were all decommissioned in favor of their redundant U.S. highway routes. The decommissioning of SH 54 was short lived as US 90 was shortened on August 16, 1940 back to its previous terminus at US 80 in <b>Van</b> <b>Horn,</b> and SH 54 was again designated between <b>Van</b> <b>Horn</b> and US 62. In 1943, US 180 was designated over the route of US 62 at the northern terminus of SH 54. In 1953, construction began on FM 2185 from SH 54 in <b>Van</b> <b>Horn</b> into northeastern Culberson County. On July 30, 1976, SH 54 extended westward over Loop 519 (US 80 Business) (now BI 10-D) and southward over US 90 to I-10.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{recorded}} permanent settlers were John and William Van Voor Haze (Voorhees), who purchased [...] {{of land in}} the area in 1720.

In 1940 the population was just under 4,000 consisting of roughly 100 families with 30% of the land devoted to farming. By 1969 the number of farms had dropped to 13 covering , 6% of the township. By 2012, only two farms remain: Abma's Farm and Goffle Road Poultry Farm, which is Bergen County's only remaining live market. Rail service by the New Jersey Midland Railway began in 1870.

40|$|IN RECENT years much {{research}} has been done to determine the qualitative and quantitative requirements of manga-nese in poultry nutrition. It seems to be an established fact that manganese is essen-tial in the prevention of perosis as shown by Wilgus, Norris, and Heuser (1936), in normal embryonic development as shown by Lyons and Insko (1937), and by young chicks for maintenance and normal bone formation as shown by <b>Van</b> der <b>Horn,</b> Bra-nion, and Graham (1938). But it is not yet quite clear what the role of manganese is in adult fowls, and what is the effect of some variations in the manganese content of the rations on laying hens, their produc-tion, and on the egg quality. Gallup and Norris (1939) reported that a deficiency of manganese in the diet of hens resulted in low egg production, high mortality of embryos, and decreased fertility, but this was observed when the ration contained 13 parts per million (milligrams per kilo-gram) of manganese. Lyons (1935) ob-served that poor egg shell quality resulted when the ration contained 7 p. p. m. of man-ganese. On the other hand, however, the com-mercial rations for laying hens usually con-tain 31 to 76 p. p. m. of manganese, with an average of 40 - 50 p. p. m. according to Smith (1938), which is much above the level pointed out as deficient by the authors cited...|$|R
