Railway main line. A quick survey was made and Khandwa on the G.I.P. line was chosen as junction point. The alignment was to pass through Sanawad, Kheree Ghat on the Narmada and then by way of the Choral Valley up the slopes of the Vindhyas to Indore. Maharaja Holkar’s contribution accelerated the construction of rail-lines in Malwa region. During 1870s, a Metre gauge line of Holkar State Railway was sanctioned between Khandwa and Indore passing the MHOW Ghat. The Holkar Railway required <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>works</b> due to <b>very</b> steep gradients(up to 1 in 40) on the Vindhya Ghats. It also involved digging of 4 tunnels aggregating 510 yards in length, deep cuttings and heavy retaining walls. River Narmada was crossed by a bridge of 14 spans, 197 feet each and piers 80 feet above low water level. There are 14 other large bridges with high piers, the highest pier being 152 feet above the bottom of the ravine. The first section Khandwa-Sanawad was opened for traffic on 1.12.1874. The Narmada Bridge was opened for traffic on 5.10.1876 by His Highness the Maharaja of Holkar who named it ‘Holkar-Narmada Bridge’.|$|R

40|$|In {{a variety}} of supersymmetric {{extensions}} of the Standard Model, the scalar partners of the quarks and leptons are predicted to be <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> and {{beyond the reach of}} next-generation colliders. For instance, the realization of electroweak baryogenesis in supersymmetry requires new sources of CP-violation, which can only be naturally accommodated with electric dipole moment constraints if the first and second generation scalar fermions are beyond the TeV scale. Also in focus-point supersymmetry and split supersymmetry the scalar fermions are <b>very</b> <b>heavy.</b> In this <b>work,</b> the phenomenology of scenarios with electroweak baryogenesis and in the focus point region at the LHC and ILC is studied, which becomes challenging due to the presence of heavy scalar fermions. Implications for the analysis of baryogenesis and dark matter are deduced. It is found that precision measurements of superpartner properties allow an accurate determination of the dark matter relic density in both scenarios, while important but only incomplete information about the baryogenesis mechanism can be obtained.

First year Biology was taught from a state-level prescribed curriculum on every one of the fifteen campuses. However, using Earth Observation Data in that curriculum was difficult.

40|$|International audienceThe {{understanding}} of gene-environment interaction {{is a crucial}} issue in plant breeding. For this objective, mechanistic models of plant growth can help disentangle the genotypic and environmental effects. Each genotype {{is characterized by a}} specific vector of model parameters and ideally, these parameters are stable for a certain range of environments. Each parameter can be seen as resulting from the influences of several genes (epistasis), while the same gene can influence several parameters (pleiotropy). As a consequence, in a family of genotypes (for a same species), there may be strong correlations between parameters. Moreover, {{in order to be able}} to use plant models to characterize and differentiate genotypes, the parametric estimation methods should be precise enough so that the estimation uncertainty remains small and so that statistically significant differences can be detected between the parameters of different genotypes. For this purpose, sensitivity analysis was shown to be a very helpful method in the estimation process, specifically for screening non influential parameters that can be fixed to some nominal values (thus common to all genotypes, the model parameter is thus considered as non-genotypic parameter). Therefore, when performing sensitivity analysis of plant growth models with the specific objective of characterization of genotypes, we need to use a method able to take into account correlated inputs. For example, the classical Sobol method can not be applied straightforwardly. The objective of this paper is thus to introduce a method adapted to the sensitivity analysis for correlated inputs and to apply it to a plant model. The SUNFLO model of sunflower growth is used for this purpose. The model parameters for a family of 20 genotypes have been estimated or measured with <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> experimental <b>work</b> and this set of parameter vectors is used to compute the statistical distribution in the parameter space...|$|R

40|$|Orissa {{is one of}} {{the most}} flood prone states of India. The floods in Orissa mostly occur during monsoon season due to <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> {{rainfall}} caused by synoptic scale monsoon disturbances. Hence a study is undertaken to find out the characteristic features of <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall (24 hours rainfall ≥ 125 mm) over Orissa during summer monsoon season (June–September) by analysing 20 years (1980 – 1999) daily rainfall data of different stations in Orissa. The principal objective of this study is to find out the role of synoptic scale monsoon disturbances in spatial and temporal variability of <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall over Orissa. Most of the <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall events occur in July and August. The region, extending from central part of coastal Orissa in the southeast towards Sambalpur district in the northwest, expe-riences higher frequency and higher intensity of <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall with less interannual vari-ability. It is due to the fact that most of the causative synoptic disturbances like low pressure systems (LPS) develop over northwest (NW) Bay of Bengal with minimum interannual varia-tion and the monsoon trough extends in west–northwesterly direction from the centre of the system. The <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall occurs more frequently with less interannual variability on the western side of Eastern Ghat during all the months and the season except September. It occurs more frequently with less interannual variability on the eastern side of Eastern Ghat during Sep-tember. The NW Bay followed by Gangetic West Bengal/Orissa is the most favourable region of LPS to cause <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall over different parts of Orissa except eastern side of East-ern Ghat. The NW Bay and west central (WC) Bay are equally favourable regions of LPS to cause <b>very</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall over eastern side of Eastern Ghat.
