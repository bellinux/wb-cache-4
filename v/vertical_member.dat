500|$|The {{main lines}} of battle now formed an [...] "L" [...] shape, with Hardee's attack forming {{the lower part}} of the [...] "L," [...] and Cheatham's attack on the Union front as the <b>vertical</b> <b>member</b> of the [...] "L". Hood {{intended}} to attack the Union troops from both east and west. The fighting centered on a hill east of the city known as Bald Hill. The Federals had arrived two days earlier, and began to shell the city proper, killing several civilians. A savage struggle, sometimes hand-to-hand, developed around the hill, lasting until just after dark. The Federals held the hill while the Confederates retired to a point just south of there. Meanwhile, two miles to the north, Cheatham's troops had broken through the Union lines at the Georgia railroad. In response, twenty artillery pieces were positioned near Sherman's headquarters at Copen Hill, and shelled the Confederates, while Logan's XV Corps regrouped and repulsed the Southern troops.|$|E
2500|$|The Blériot XI, largely {{designed}} [...] by Raymond Saulnier, was {{a development}} of the Blériot VIII, which Blériot had flown successfully in 1908. Like its predecessor, it was a tractor-configuration monoplane with a partially covered box-girder fuselage built from ash with wire cross bracing. [...] The principal difference {{was the use of}} wing warping for lateral control. [...] The tail surfaces consisted of a small balanced [...] "all-moving" [...] rudder mounted on the rearmost <b>vertical</b> <b>member</b> of the fuselage and a horizontal tailplane mounted under the lower longerons. This had elevator surfaces making up the outermost part of the fixed horizontal surface; these [...] "tip elevators" [...] were linked by a torque tube running through the inner section. [...] The bracing and warping wires [...] were attached to a dorsal, five-component [...] "house-roof" [...] shaped cabane consisting of a pair of inverted V struts with their apices connected by a longitudinal tube, and an inverted four-sided pyramidal ventral cabane, also of steel tubing, below. [...] When first built it had a wingspan of [...] and a small teardrop-shaped fin mounted on the cabane, which was later removed.|$|E
2500|$|The core of {{the flat}} frame {{fuselage}} was formed with a horizontal beam about [...] long, to which two other [...] converging struts were attached, making overall a vertical A-frame. The downward sloping extremities of these beams carried a slightly deeper horizontal box structure below the cross beam, with the open pilot's seat and controls upon it. On some later aircraft there was an extra <b>vertical</b> <b>member</b> for the lower cross beam to the wing root to provide the pilot with a backrest. [...] Others enclosed him or her in a simple, light, short nacelle between the nose and the backrest strut. The rear part of the fuselage frame was based on two longer beams reaching to the tail. [...] The upper one was horizontal and attached to both converging A-frame beams, near but not at its apex. The lower one sloped upwards and {{was attached to the}} rear sloping part of the A-frame just below the cross-member. [...] These two rear fuselage beams were cross braced with three more struts, one vertical about halfway to the tail, forming two bays which were crossed diagonally by the other two struts. [...] There was another, short vertical strut in the rear bay between the upper and diagonal members. [...] For landings a skid ran between three projecting ends of the forward and lower A-frame.|$|E

Here is {{the door of}} the Baptistery at Pisa, again by Mr. Severn delightfully enlarged for us from a photograph. [1] The general idea of it is a square-headed opening in a solid wall, faced by an arch carried on shafts. And the ornament does indeed follow this construction so that the eye catches it with ease,--but under what arbitrary conditions! In the square door, certainly the side-posts of it are as important members as the lintel they carry; but the lintel is carved elaborately, and the side-posts left blank. Of the facing arch and shaft, it would be similarly difficult to say whether the sustaining vertical, or sustained curve, were the more important member of the construction; but the decorator now reverses the distribution of his care, adorns the <b>vertical</b> <b>member</b> with passionate elaboration, and runs a narrow band, of comparatively uninteresting work, round the arch. Between this outer shaft and inner door is a square pilaster, of which the architect carves one side, and lets the other alone. It is followed by a smaller shaft and arch, in which he reverses his treatment of the outer order by cutting the shaft delicately and the arch deeply. Again, whereas in what is called the decorated construction of English Gothic, the pillars would have been left plain and the spandrils deep cut,--here, are we to call it decoration of the construction, when the pillars are carved and the spandrils left plain? Or when, finally, either these spandril spaces {{on each side of the}} arch, or the corresponding slopes of the gable, are loaded with recumbent figures by the sculptors of the renaissance, are we to call, for instance, Michael Angelo's Dawn and Twilight, only the decorations of the sloping plinths of a tomb, or trace to a geometrical propriety the subsequent rule in Italy that no window could be properly complete for living people to look out of, without having two stone people sitting on the corners of it above? I have heard of charming young ladies occasionally, at very crowded balls, sitting on the stairs,--would you call them, in that case, only decorations of the construction of the staircase? ...|$|E

40|$|Axial {{shortening}} {{of columns}} and walls is inevitable in any reinforced concrete or hybrid steel-concrete structure. As the building increases in height, <b>vertical</b> <b>members</b> {{are subjected to}} large axial displacements, as they are cumulative over {{the height of the}} structure. The consequent differential length changes in the adjacent <b>vertical</b> <b>members</b> represent the so-called differential axial shortening phenomena and produce a distortion of the geometry of the structure that can seriously affect the horizontal elements, such as beams and slabs. In order to avoid the problems related to differential shortenings of the <b>vertical</b> <b>members,</b> the elastic and inelastic shortenings should be predicted and mitigated accurately and properly compensated for. The compensation can be obtained by adopting a compensation programme during the construction which adjusts the lengths of the <b>vertical</b> <b>members</b> with respect to the nominal values. The present work discusses a compensation procedure which applies a detailed modelling and incorporates the influence of construction sequences and stiffness changes in relation to time-dependent properties.

40|$|Adjacent <b>vertical</b> <b>members</b> (columns and shear walls) {{in a tall}} {{building}} undergo {{differential time}} dependent deformations due to creep and shrinkage in concrete. These differential deformations in adjacent <b>vertical</b> <b>members</b> produce shear and moments in the connecting beams or slabs which further result in a redistribution of forces among <b>vertical</b> <b>members.</b> Shear walls in composite frame-shear wall systems are of concrete and properties of these will affect creep and shrinkage behaviour of these composite frame-shear wall systems. In this paper, behavioural studies are reported for these systems with varying shear wall properties. In these studies, the creep and shrinkage effects on deflections, differential deflections and axial forces in various members are evaluated. It is shown that significant change occurs in net change in elastic forces when volume to surface ratio is varied...|$|R
40|$|An {{earthquake}} resisting {{building is}} one that has been deliberately designed {{in such a way that}} the structure remains safe and suffers no appreciable damage during destructive earthquake.

50|$|The forward {{fuselage}} frame consisted of two, parallel horizontal members, one above the other. They were {{connected by a}} vertical pair of members and two diagonal ones, attached at two points on the lower frame and three on the upper. The rear <b>vertical</b> <b>member</b> was lighter than the forward three uprights, which formed a distorted N; together with the parallel horizontals, this core frame formed a cross braced trapezium. The forward vertical supported the wing at its front spar and the two diagonals met on the rear one. The lower frame extended forwards, with the pilot's seat projecting either side of it immediately ahead of the forward vertical frame. Underneath it, a curved skid was mounted and faired in, forming a long, deep, narrow box, reaching aft to the rear vertical frame. From the trailing edge rearwards the upper frame member was split into two, running {{parallel to each other}} and cross braced in the horizontal plane. This provided extra stiffness against sideways flexing and further reduced the wire bracing. Aft of the second <b>vertical</b> <b>member</b> the lower frame sloped upwards, meeting the upper member at the tail. Here, the triangular tailplane was mounted on the upper frame with a trapezoidal fin below. Parallel chord elevators projected behind with a cut-out for the movement of the tall rudder, which was hinged on the extreme frame and was rectangular apart from a cropped under edge. The BS.16 sat with its tail well clear of the ground, so no tail bumper was required, though there was a short aft horizontal extension of the main skid.|$|E
50|$|It is {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} multiple diagonal members projecting down {{from the top of the}} end posts at a variety of angles. These diagonal members extend to the bottom of each of the vertical members of the truss with the longest diagonal extending to the center <b>vertical</b> <b>member.</b> Many Fink trusses do not include a lower chord (the lowest horizontal member). This gives the bridge an unfinished saw-toothed appearance when viewed from the side or below, and makes the design very easy to identify. If the bridge deck is carried along the bottom of the truss (called a through truss) or if a lightweight lower chord is present, identification is made solely by the multiple diagonal members emanating from the end post tops.|$|E
5000|$|The I.C.1 had a straight, {{constant}} chord, {{thick section}} wing built around two spruce box spars with plywood webs. The I-section ribs were also made from spruce and ply, {{the leading edge}} from ply and the trailing edge form dural. [...] It had outboard ailerons but neither flaps nor airbrakes. [...] The fuselage was an open frame structure with two horizontal, parallel booms that ran rearwards from the wing spars to the tail, where two cross braces carried the tailplane. A pair of N-form struts converged below the wing onto a third boom, horizontal below the wing then angled upwards to the tail, joining the rear cross brace via a short <b>vertical</b> <b>member</b> and two angled ones. The three long booms formed a triangular section girder that did not require further wire bracing.|$|E

50|$|The Brown truss is a box truss {{that is a}} {{through truss}} (as contrasted with a deck truss) and {{consists}} of diagonal cross compression members connected to horizontal top and bottom stringers.

50|$|Although not as sceptical or rigorously investigative as Brunel, Stephenson {{had a deep}} {{understanding}} of the different strengths of wrought- and cast-iron. Both girders are formed of wrought iron tubes, 6 cm in diameter. The unusual feature of this bridge is that because the deck is above the truss, the <b>vertical</b> <b>members</b> are placed in compression, rather than the more normal tension. This allowed Stephenson to use cast iron for the <b>vertical</b> <b>members,</b> rather than the more expensive wrought iron needed for bridges in tension. The truss achieves an efficient symmetry of the load distribution between the two members, giving an economical and balanced appearance that is in great contrast to Brunel's heavily unbalanced designs that (for Chepstow at least) are barely recognisable as lenticular.|$|R

It is a single-story rectangular wood-frame structure with a gabled roof, weatherboard exterior, and granite foundation. The roof is capped by two square cupolas, each of which has paired windows on each side, with chamfered corner posts and a bellcast hip roof. The front facade faces south (away from the road, from which it is screened by trees), and is dominated by a large tracked board-and-batten door with a transom window above. There are two sash windows above the door, with hooded moulding and cornices, and there is a decorative truss in the gable above, whose <b>vertical</b> <b>member</b> extends above the roof to form a sort of finial. The rake edge of the gable is adorned with modillions. The interior of barn, although utilitarian in nature, features turned posts and tongue-and-groove paneling in some of the stalls.|$|E
50|$|The Macfie Monoplane's {{undercarriage}} {{consisted of}} two main wheels (diameter approx. 26 in. (0.66m)) mounted below the engine, and a rear skid mounted on the sixth triangular brace {{from the front of}} the main body frame, i.e. about two-thirds of the distance back from front to tail. The two main wheels were attached, by two forked brackets, to the vertical members of a transverse rectangular chassis made of steel tubing, which transferred the weight of the engine at rest through the wheels to the ground. Each wheel was mounted behind its respective <b>vertical</b> <b>member</b> via two swivelling forked brackets, one horizontal and one sloping upwards at approximately 30 degrees, so that the two brackets and the vertical frame member formed a right-angled triangle. A helical compression spring on the vertical tube above the diagonal bracket provided a degree of sprung suspension while allowing the wheels, which were not steerable, to swivel independently.|$|E
50|$|In {{the bridge}} {{illustrated}} in the infobox at the top, vertical members are in tension, lower horizontal members in tension, shear, and bending, outer diagonal and top members are in compression, while the inner diagonals are in tension. The central <b>vertical</b> <b>member</b> stabilizes the upper compression member, preventing it from buckling. If the top member is sufficiently stiff then this vertical element may be eliminated. If the lower chord (a horizontal member of a truss) is sufficiently resistant to bending and shear, the outer vertical elements may be eliminated, but with additional strength added to other members in compensation. The ability to distribute the forces in various ways {{has led to a}} large variety of truss bridge types. Some types may be more advantageous when wood is employed for compression elements while other types may be easier to erect in particular site conditions, or when the balance between labor, machinery and material costs have certain favorable proportions.|$|E
