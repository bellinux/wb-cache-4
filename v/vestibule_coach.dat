5000|$|LMS {{third class}} gangwayed <b>vestibule</b> <b>coach</b> No. 27249. {{awaiting}} overhaul ...|$|E
50|$|It {{was again}} the <b>vestibule</b> <b>coach</b> which {{received}} {{the bulk of}} attention during this second phase. The first were a series of spacious 60 ft long 42 seaters. Some of these, which were classified as dining vehicles were built as firsts but were downgraded {{a few years later}} on the advent of the Stanier 65 ft firsts. They were followed by a 56 seater for general service. More 42 seat coaches followed which, although identical to the original 42 seaters, were not classed as diners. All these 60 ft coaches had the new low waist and were wood panelled with full outside beading. However, a much larger group of low-waisted vestibule coaches was the 57 ft, 56 seat version of which 300 were built in 1931-2 and differed from the 60 ft version in that they were steel clad with simulated external beading in paint. They did, however, follow the Period II style in all other respects and retained the raised window edge mouldings.|$|E
50|$|These 10 {{vehicles}} were followed in 1929 by a similarly styled batch of 25 neutral <b>vestibule</b> <b>coaches</b> for either first or third class passengers. These were 42 seaters with seven bays arranged two and one and again designated as dining vehicles. With these, the single window style could finally {{be said to}} have 'arrived' in LMS gangwayed coaches.|$|R
50|$|The NER {{had limited}} need for <b>vestibuled</b> <b>coaches</b> but from 1900 built {{a series of}} <b>vestibuled,</b> {{corridor}} <b>coaches</b> with British Standard gangways, for their longer distance services. The company introduced clerestory corridor dining trains on services between London and Edinburgh. The initial trial was run between York and Newcastle in 1 hour 30 minutes on 30 July 1900. The new train consisted of eight coaches and was 499.5 ft long (excluding the engine), and had seating for 50 first-class and 211 third-class passengers. At {{the same time they}} built (in conjunction with their partners) similar coaches for the East Coast Joint Stock (GNR/NER/NBR) and the Great Northern and North Eastern Joint Stock.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{characteristic}} Midland Railway {{features were}} {{incorporated in the}} design of early LMS coaches which distinguished them from those of other lines. Most noticeable of these was the twin-window arrangement in each seating bay of the <b>vestibule</b> <b>coaches.</b> This took the form of two rectangular windows side by side (one fixed and one drop-light), rather than a single window or centre drop-light with two flanking quarterlight arrangement. There was generally a Stones pattern ventilator in the eaves panel above the fixed light of these window pairs.|$|R
50|$|The first {{indication}} of changing ideas were some very handsome corridor vehicles in 1927. For the first time, the LMS abandoned outside compartment doors in corridor coaches and introduced larger windows in their stead. At first {{there were two}} such windows in each compartment (one fixed and one frameless droplight) {{in the manner of}} the characteristic Midland pattern <b>vestibule</b> <b>coaches</b> already considered. They differed from the normal twin-window style in having frameless droplights and Stones ventilators over both windows and the style soon became adopted for other vehicles. By 1930 it had made its appearance in some composites, this time with but one Stones ventilator centrally over the window pair and with large 4 ft 6 in wide corridor side windows.|$|R
2500|$|Commission {{concluded}} that [...] "there {{was a conspiracy}} to burn coach S-6 of the Sabarmati Express train to cause harm to the Karsevaks travelling in that coach." [...] As per the Commission, the “conspiracy” was hatched by some local Muslims at the Aman guest house in Godhra the previous night and the conspirators immediately made arrangements for collecting about 140 litres of petrol from a nearby pump {{on the night of}} 26 February 2002, the next day when the train arrived in Godhra, Hasan Lala, after forcibly opening the <b>vestibule</b> between <b>coaches</b> S-6 and S-7, entered S-6 and threw burning rags setting it on fire.|$|R
50|$|Ed Bommer gave a {{presentation}} {{based on an}} undated picture of a B&O steam freight locomotive backing a string of five wooden coaches into a terminal on Staten Island which was served by multiple unit electric (MUE) equipment, in which he gave identified the picture as a train to the Mount Loretto Orphanage. From close examination of details in the photo, Bommer explained how {{he was able to}} date it. Also, a second steam powered train was discovered in the background. The wooden coaches were rarely seen Class A-14 B&O cars built in 1910. The locomotive was a B&O Class E-13b camelback 2-8-0, used on Staten Island from 1905 until 1945. The train and ferry terminal building dated the photo before 1946, when that 1895 structure was demolished in a huge fire. The position of a stand-by ferry in the background indicated a weekend or holiday. Vegetation and a jacketless crewman in the <b>coach</b> <b>vestibule</b> hinted at warm or hot weather. The angle of the shadows set the time at about mid afternoon. The use of steam and MUE cars indicated a date between 1925 and 1946. This was narrowed to 1935-1946 by the way two MUE cars in the background were painted and lettered. The tracks on which the two steam trains were set helped determine their destination. It would be on the Staten Island Rapid Transit's Perth Amboy subdivision to a branch line that did not have third rail. Only one such branch offered a possible reason. A little over a mile long with curves and a 2% grade, it served a large Catholic orphanage at Mount Loretto. A search of New York Times on-line archives from 1935-1946 set the actual date as Sunday, June 19, 1938. A special celebration at the home's huge Gothic style church was held on that day. It was the 50th anniversary of the death of the home's founder. It brought over 1,000 visitors, with some 680 of them would arrive on these two special trains. The event ran for about three hours, starting at 4:00 PM. Bommer then described how both five car specials may have been turned on the branch's confined trackage which included a wye. Citing SIRT rules and noting the length of the trains, locomotives and the track space available, each step in the process was described. For departure after the event, both trains had {{to be in the same}} locations at which they arrived with their cars, but facing the opposite direction. Turning had to be done with hand signals, hand thrown switches, hand setting brakes on the coaches, uncoupling and recoupling equipment as each loco was wyed. Then, going through all the coaches to turn the seats around. It would be a time consuming process. Both trains arrived about 10 minutes apart. So turning took place after all passengers had left the trains.|$|R
