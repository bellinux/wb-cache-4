50|$|<b>Viminol</b> (marketed {{under the}} brandname Dividol) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{developed by a}} team at the drug company Zambon in the 1960s. <b>Viminol</b> {{is based on the}} α-pyrryl-2-aminoethanol structure, unlike any other class of opioids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Viminol</b> {{has both}} {{antitussive}} (cough suppressing) and analgesic (pain reducing) effects. <b>Viminol</b> has additional effects {{similar to other}} opioids including sedation and euphoria. It has six different stereoisomers which have varying properties. Four are inactive, but the 1S-(R,R)-disecbutyl isomer is a μ-opioid full agonist around 5.5 times more potent than morphine and the 1S-(S,S)-disecbutyl isomer is an antagonist. Since vimonol is supplied as a racemic mixture of isomers, the overall effect is a mixed agonist-antagonist profile {{similar to that of}} opioids such as pentazocine, although with somewhat fewer side effects.|$|E
50|$|However, since <b>viminol</b> is {{supplied}} as a racemic mixture of agonist and antagonist isomers, the abuse potential and respiratory depression {{tends to be}} less than that of μ-opioid full agonist drugs.|$|E

Naltrexone, an opiate antagonist, also fails to change the cortical and hippocampal TRAl, but it antagonizes the decrease in cortical and hippocampal TR, elicited by the four analgetics.
