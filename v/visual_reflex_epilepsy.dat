40|$|AbstractWe present five {{patients}} of epilepsy in which seizures were triggered by playing or watching the traditional Chinese gambling game “Mah-Jong. ” One patient also experienced seizures while playing a computer {{version of the}} Mah-Jong game. This condition appeared to have a predominance of males (80 %) and middle-aged onset (39. 4 years). Four patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and one patient had partial seizures with secondary generalization. No spontaneous seizure occurred in these patients. Three patients had been receiving antiepileptic drug therapy, but without effective control over their seizures. Mah-Jong-induced epilepsy is a very peculiar form of complex <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> that involves the higher mental activities. This phenomenon may consist of distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms from other <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> induced by thinking and spatial tasks in idiopathic generalized <b>epilepsies.</b> This unusual <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> is relatively benign in nature and antiepileptic drug therapy has uncertain benefits.

40|$|Background and Purpose: There are {{currently}} few studies on clinical profiles of <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> induced by thinking and spatial tasks. We studied the clinical characteristics of <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> induced by playing oriental card and board games. Methods: This study included 17 patients who presented with seizures that occur predominantly while playing games. We collected clinical data via protocol-based interviews. EEGs and brain MRI were performed. Results: All {{of the subjects}} were men, {{and all of them}} were older than 30 years at the onset of seizure. Thirteen patients (76 %) experienced their seizures while playing the oriental card game “Go-stop ” and the remaining four patients (24 %) experienced them while playing the oriental board game “Baduk”. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were frequently preceded by prodromal symptoms, but myoclonus was not evident. Most patients had no spontaneous seizures and generalized epileptiform discharges on EEGs, and infrequent seizures that were well controlled. Conclusions: Our patients exhibited some features that differ from those described previously in the literature, suggesting that the clinical spectrum of <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> induced by thinking and spatial tasks is wide...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeSeizures can be {{triggered}} by complex mental activities. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the clinical characteristics of <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> induced by playing Go-stop or Baduk games. MethodsThe study comprised 11 patients with this type of <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> identified from our patient database. We collected data on clinical features, EEG, and brain MRI as well as seizure outcomes. ResultsThe patients had a late age of onset (range, 43 – 65 years, except for one patient with an age of onset of 11 years). An MRI abnormality and interictal EEG abnormalities were found in one patient respectively. The seizures exhibited diverse semiological features suggesting a focal or generalized onset. No myoclonic seizures were observed. Individualized strategies such as avoiding the precipitating game or reducing exposure to the stimulus were most effective in preventing the seizures. ConclusionThe pathophysiological mechanisms underlying Go-stop- or Baduk-induced seizures may be different from other cognition-associated reflex epileptic phenomena. This type of <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> may be a heterogeneous syndrome manifesting in a range of diverse semiological features...|$|R

RE may have different subtypes depending on the stimulus characteristic. There are significant clinical and electrophysiologic differences between different RE types. Visual stimuli-sensitive or photosensitive epilepsies constitute {{a large proportion of}} the RE and are mainly related to genetic causes. <b>Reflex</b> <b>epilepsies</b> may present with focal or generalized seizures due to specific triggers, and sometimes seizures may occur spontaneously. The stimuli can be external (light flashes, hot water), internal (emotion, thinking), or both and should be distinguished from triggering precipitants, which most epileptic patients could report such as emotional stress, sleep deprivation, alcohol, and menstrual cycle. Different genetic and acquired factors may play a role in etiology of RE. This review will provide a current overview of the triggering factors and management of reflex seizures.

40|$|Chantier qualité GAPhotosensitive <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> {{is caused}} by the {{combination}} of an individual's enhanced sensitivity with relevant light stimuli, such as stroboscopic lights or video games. This is the most common <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in humans; it is characterized by the photoparoxysmal response, which is an abnormal electroencephalographic reaction, and seizures triggered by intermittent light stimulation. Here, by using genetic mapping, sequencing and functional analyses, we report that a mutation in the acceptor site of the second intron of SV 2 A (the gene encoding synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A) is causing photosensitive <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in a unique vertebrate model, the Fepi chicken strain, a spontaneous model where the neurological disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive mutation. This mutation causes an aberrant splicing event and significantly reduces the level of SV 2 A mRNA in homozygous carriers. Levetiracetam, a second generation antiepileptic drug, is known to bind SV 2 A, and SV 2 A knock-out mice develop seizures soon after birth and usually die within three weeks. The Fepi chicken survives to adulthood and responds to levetiracetam, suggesting that the low-level expression of SV 2 A in these animals is sufficient to allow survival, but does not protect against seizures. Thus, the Fepi chicken model shows that the role of the SV 2 A pathway in the brain is conserved between birds and mammals, in spite of a large phylogenetic distance. The Fepi model appears particularly useful for further studies of physiopathology of <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> in comparison with induced models of epilepsy in rodents. Consequently, SV 2 A is a very attractive candidate gene for analysis in the context of both mono- and polygenic generalized epilepsies in humans...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – Bathing epilepsy, {{also known}} as water-immersion epilepsy, refers to a rare form of benign <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in which {{seizures}} are precipitated by the nor-mal process of domestic bathing. This condition has been confused with true hot water epilepsy, even though bathing in water at normal temperature is the trigger. Focal seizures predominate with a staring gaze, pallor and generalised features followed by prolonged postictal somnolence. A variable percentage of patients may also show unprovoked seizures. The prognosis is usually favourable, and modifying bathing habits may prevent further seizures. We report two Caucasian patients with bathing epilepsy. In one, seizures were provoked by water immersion. In the other, we noted an unusual triggering factor; pouring of lukewarmwater over the genitalia.

In all three cases of rub epilepsy, cutaneous stimuli in a particular body area on the left side initially induced a sensory jacksonian march in the middle of, or in close vicinity to, the trigger zone, which led to subsequent unilateral tonic contractions with intact consciousness. By contrast, a motor jacksonian seizure without sensory aura was induced in the patient with tooth brushing epilepsy. A review of cases with rub epilepsy, including those in this paper, disclosed a striking consistency in clinical manifestations. The symptomatology of the induced seizures indicates a propagation of epileptic discharges from the postcentral gyrus to the supplementary motor area.

40|$|Purpose: {{to report}} {{a new form of}} <b>reflex</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in which the {{seizures}} are repeatedly and exclusively triggered by answering the telephone. Methods: Three patients with a history of telephone-induced seizures were studied in detail by means of clinical, EEG, and neuroradiologic investigations.

Results: The patients (two men, one woman, aged 21 to 30 years) had the onset during early adulthood of complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures exclusively triggered by answering the telephone. The seizures were stereotyped, with Subjective auditory or vertiginous auras and inability to speak or understand the spoken voices. In one patient., a telephone-induced seizure arising from the dominant temporal lobe was recorded by means of video-EEG technique.
