5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E

5|$|Early {{improvement}} {{was carried out}} with the traditional tools, but new technology was increasingly important. Lighter ploughs were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board. It was first adopted in the south-east and spread to {{rest of the country}} in the 1770s. From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated threshing mill speeded up a <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of the harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.|$|E

5|$|Particularly for kings, itineration was a <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of governance, and in {{many cases}} kings would rely on the {{hospitality}} of their subjects for maintenance while on the road. This could be a costly affair for the localities visited; there was not only the large royal household to cater for, but also the entire royal administration. It was only {{towards the end of the}} medieval period, when means of communication improved, that households, both noble and royal, became more permanently attached to one residence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{non-destructive}} testing methods adapted to railway vehicles permit timely repair or discarding of built-in parts, and, consequently, reliable operation. Rapid advances in testing equipment for railway vehicles {{make it possible}} to employ them in practice although purchasing options are very limited. Users, i. e. operators, shall have good knowledge of theory and practical experience in using these techniques. The paper focuses on the employment of ultrasonic testing methods developed for and adapted to testing of railway vehicles. For timely detection of initial cracks at <b>vital</b> <b>parts</b> such as king bolts, spring suspensions and particularly axles and shafts of bogies for locomotives and coaches, good testing equipment and software support shall be provided. This is a basis of quality testing and assessment of the state of <b>vital</b> <b>parts</b> of railway vehicles, which will eventually assure safe and reliable railway traffic. Recently ultrasonic testing has shown exceptional advances in apparatuses for measurement, storage, and processing of ultrasonic signals. The advances in equipment shall be accompanied by advances in software since {{this is the only way}} to provide adequate graphical representations and support in an analysis to result in reliable assessment of the state of <b>vital</b> <b>parts</b> of railway vehicles. Adequate software will allow checking of the state of individual <b>vital</b> <b>parts</b> between periodic checks, good statistical processing of the data obtained, and quality assessment of the momentary state of railway vehicles resulting in efficient and rational scheduling of periodic checks. Some recent approaches to testing of <b>vital</b> <b>parts</b> railway vehicles such as locomotives and coaches will be described. 1...|$|R

It is the only motorway in Shropshire, and forms a <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of the county's road network. The motorway handles an AADT of between 50,300 (J2-3) and 41,800 (J4-5) vehicles.|$|E
5|$|French fur traders from Canada {{were the}} first Europeans to enter Indiana, {{beginning}} in the 1670s. The quickest route connecting the New France districts of Canada and Louisiana ran along Indiana's Wabash River. The Terre Haute highlands were once considered {{the border between the}} two French districts. This made Indiana a <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of French lines of communication and trade routes. The French established Vincennes as a permanent settlement in Indiana during European rule, but the population of the area remained primarily Native American. As French influence grew in the region, Great Britain, competing with France for control of North America, came to believe that control of Indiana was important to halt French expansion on the continent.|$|E
5|$|In the Atlantic, escort {{carriers}} {{proved to}} be a <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap. Carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured. Submarines, which had {{proved to be}} an effective weapon during the First World War, were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics. Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh light, hedgehog, squid, and homing torpedoes proved victorious.|$|E

5|$|It {{was officially}} {{activated}} as an airborne division in April 1943 {{but was not}} immediately sent to a combat theater, remaining in the United States to complete its training. During this training process, the division took part in several training exercises, including the Knollwood Maneuver, in which it played a <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> in ensuring that the airborne division remained as a military formation in the U.S. Army. As such {{it did not take}} part in the first two large-scale airborne operations conducted by the Allies, Operation Husky and Operation Neptune, transferring to Britain only after the end of Operation Overlord.|$|E
5|$|Most {{crustaceans}} are free-living aquatic animals, {{but some}} are terrestrial (e.g. woodlice), some are parasitic (e.g. Rhizocephala, fish lice, tongue worms) and some are sessile (e.g. barnacles). The group has an extensive fossil record, reaching back to the Cambrian, and includes living fossils such as Triops cancriformis, which has existed apparently unchanged since the Triassic period. More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, the majority of it being shrimp and prawns. Krill and copepods are not as widely fished, but may be the animals with the greatest biomass on the planet, and form a <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of the food chain. The scientific study of crustaceans is known as carcinology (alternatively, malacostracology, crustaceology or crustalogy), and a scientist who works in carcinology is a carcinologist.|$|E
5|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} swiftness and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy. It {{has been suggested that}} the towns' doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the Gothic auxiliaries in the Byzantine army, but historians generally hold that Lombard success occurred because Italy was not considered by Byzantium as a <b>vital</b> <b>part</b> of the empire, especially {{at a time when the}} empire was imperilled by the attacks of Avars and Slavs in the Balkans and Sassanids in the east. The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's polices eastward.|$|E
