40|$|Text in EnglishCervical cancer {{remains the}} leading cause of cancer {{mortality}} among women worldwide, a burden in the developing countries and commonly detected through symptoms at later invasive stages. The study aimed at establishing knowledge and awareness of the importance of cervical cancer screening in the Makhuduthamaga Sub-district by exploring the perceptions of women and professional nurses and through the review of the National Cervical Cancer Screening Policy (2013). Recommendations to address the gap in knowledge and to inform the National Cervical Cancer Screening Policy were developed based on the study findings. A mixed-method approach was used in this study through a sequential explanatory design, which is quantitatively driven was used. Quantitative data were obtained by using a researcher developed checklist. The checklist was developed from variables stated in the National Cervical Cancer Screening Policy and was used to review its implementation. Qualitative data was obtained through in-depth interviews with individual women and focus group discussions with professional nurses. The study was conducted in ten randomly selected clinics of Makhuduthamaga Sub-district. Purposive sampling was done to obtain qualitative data. An average score of 9. 7 was obtained for all ten clinics that participated in the study with regard to the evaluation of the implementation of the National Cervical Cancer Screening Policy. Only 6 (60 %) clinics implemented the policy whereas 4 (40 %) clinics did not implement the policy. Women and professional nurses perceived cervical cancer screening as important. Lack of knowledge among women regarding cervical cancer screening contributed to the majority of women not screening for cervical cancer. Lack of resources, the 10 year interval of normal cervical cancer screening, the use of disposable <b>vaginal</b> <b>speculums</b> and brushes, lack of standardized cervical cancer screening training, centralization of cytology laboratories came out as factors that negatively influence the uptake of cervical cancer screening. Cervical cancer screening awareness campaigns, availability of resources and standardized in-service trainings on cervical cancer screening were recommended to enhance the cervical cancer screening uptake.

40|$|Background: Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} significant cause of cervical cancer. In view of the number of drawbacks associated with endocervical sampling, the gold standard for HPV detection, this study examined the utility and specificity of vaginal sampling as an alternative for endocervical sampling for the routine detection of HPV. Case study: The study comprised 51 women who tested positive and 54 women who tested negative for endocervical HPV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), confirmed by histopathology. At the time of specimen collection, both (speculum-assisted) endocervical and <b>vaginal</b> (no <b>speculum)</b> scrapings were isolated from HPVpositive and negative women, and HPV DNA was assessed by PCR using the MY 09 /MY 11 primer system; HPV type was identified by hybridization of PCR products with type-specific biotinylated DNA probes. Each participant served as her own control. HPV was detected in vaginal and cervical scrapes from all HPV-positive but not HPV-negative women. In HPV-positive women the same HPV type was found in vaginal and endocervical scrapings (positive predictive value = 1. 0). Conclusion: Correlation between vaginal and endocervical sampling methods was excellent in detecting the presence of HPV DNA and for identifying distinct HPV genotypes. Utilization of vaginal testing for routine HPV detection, and for the long-term follow-up of persistent HPV infection, is therefore recommended...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: From September 1996, all GP registrars {{completing}} {{vocational training}} in the United Kingdom must demonstrate competence {{by means of a}} four-part assessment procedure. AIM: To look at the accuracy of one of the components of vocational training: the trainer's report. METHOD: Seventy-five registrars completing their general practice training at the end of July 1997 were invited {{to take part in a}} practical skills workshop. Eight stations were designed to test practical skills and diagnostic interpretations that were included in the trainer's report, and a clinical vignette accompanied each task. The marking schedule used was developed from the minimum standards required in the trainer's report. Twenty-nine registrars (38 %) took part in the workshop. RESULTS: Only one registrar passed all eight stations. The maximum number of stations failed by any one individual was five and this doctor was the only one of the sample to ultimately fail summative assessment. The majority of registrars failed by being unable to interpret clinical findings. Twenty-five registrars (86 %) responded to the follow-up questionnaire. Of these, only six felt that the stations were unrealistic. All but two registrars had spent at least six months in their hospital training doing obstetrics and gynaecology but, in spite of this, only 31 % of registrars were above minimum competence for <b>vaginal</b> and <b>speculum</b> examination. CONCLUSION: With one exception, registrars passed all aspects of the trainer's report. Discrepancy was found between the trainer's report and the doctor's ability to carry out clinical procedures. There is an assumption that many of these clinical skills are being taught and assessed at undergraduate level and during the hospital component, but this cannot be taken for granted. Doubt must also be cast on whether the trainers are using the trainer's report appropriately, and whether this is a valid and reliable tool to identify skills deficient in registrars for summative assessment...|$|R

40|$|Jeffrey P Callen's {{excellent}} {{seminar on}} pyoderma gangrenosum, 1 prompts us {{to report the}} rare occurrence of pyoderma of the cervix in a patient who attended our hospital over many years. Pyoderma gangrenosum of the vulva 2 and of mucosal membranes of the mouth in patients with inflammatory bowel disease 3 are well recognised, but our patient had cervical lesions. In 1982, a 58 -year-old woman presented with a 5 -year history of chronic, non-healing skin lesions that first developed suprapubically, and then elsewhere. These were ulcerated lesions with a violaceous edge that were occasionally painful. Our investigations {{found no evidence of}} inflammatory bowel disease, arthritides, haematological/immunological disorders, or malignant disease. Biopsy samples and tissue cultures from four lesions over the years excluded infection, vasculitis, and cancer and showed neutrophilic infiltration, suppurative granulomas, and epidermal necrosis consistent with the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. The skin lesions were resistant to treatment, but after several stays in hospital and trials of different regimens the lesions eventually healed with courses of minocycline and systemic and topical steroids. Some recurrences occurred and scarring was evident, but by 1993 she did not have any acute skin lesions. In 1996, she developed blood-stained <b>vaginal</b> discharge. <b>Speculum</b> examination revealed an erythematous thickened lesion of the posterior vaginal vault and cervix. Two biopsy samples showed no evidence of infection or malignant disease, but review of all her histology showed changes identical to those seen in the skin biopsy samples taken years before. She was treated with prednisolone as sodium phosphate suppositories and enemas inserted into the vagina. The figure shows the appearance of the cervix after treatment for 1 month. The vaginal discharge slowly resolved and the lesions gradually disappeared over 6 months. We believe that this disorder was pyoderma gangrenosum of the cervix, although it has not been previously reported at this site, and were relieved that it responded so well to treatment with topical steroids...|$|R
40|$|A 15 -year-old Welsh pony mare {{presented}} to Cornell’s Equine Hospital three days following unplanned natural breeding by a horse sized stallion. Immediately following breeding the owner noticed frank {{blood from the}} vulva. In the following three days the mare exhibited mild signs of colic, fever, and lack of appetite. On presentation she was quiet, alert, and responsive. She was normothermic, tachypneic, and estimated at five percent dehydrated. Her phenotype was consistent with equine metabolic syndrome. Abnormalities on serum chemistry were consistent with inflammation, historical anorexia, and metabolic disease. Hemogram abnormalities were consistent with acute severe inflammation and low-grade hemorrhage. Abdominal ultrasound showed {{a small amount of}} free fluid with otherwise normal viscera. On transrectal ultrasound a large fluid filled mass consistent with a hematoma was visualized ventral to the rectum. A digital <b>vaginal</b> exam and <b>speculum</b> examination were performed. A large tear in the left cranial portion of the vagina caudal to the cervix was palpated. Just adjacent to the tear were loops of bowel herniating through torn peritoneum. Abdominocentesis was performed and peritoneal fluid sample was submitted for analysis. There was a high-nucleated cell count (451. 2 thous/uL) composed of mostly non-degenerate neutrophils, a number of erythrocytes (52. 3 thous/uL), and {{there was no evidence of}} infectious organisms or spermatozoa. These findings are consistent with suppurtive inflammation. The main problems identified on history and entering examination included a vaginal and peritoneal tear with secondary peritonitis, possibly septic, moderate dehydration, equine metabolic syndrome, and chronic laminitis increasing the risk of acute recrudescence. The mare was started on intravenous fluids and placed in the intensive care unit. She was managed medically on broad-spectrum antibiotics for traumatic peritonitis, anti-adhesion therapy, and preventatives to minimize the likelihood of acute laminitis. In addition she was tied in a standing position at all times to allow the vagina to heal without allowing bowel to be herniated into the vaginal canal. Lateral P 3 radiographs were obtained during hospitalization to assess for signs of chronic and acute laminitis. Serial hemograms, abdominal ultrasounds, vaginal exams, and peritoneal fluid analyses were performed to monitor response to therapy and degree of inflammation. With signs of resolution of peritoneal fluid and hemogram abnormalities the mare was discharged on broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and signs to monitor closely for signs of acute laminitis and colic secondary to visceral adhesions. She was readmitted two days later for an impaction colic and acute laminitis. She recovered and was discharged with a favorable prognosis...|$|R

50|$|After {{the syringe}} has {{been filled with}} semen, any {{enclosed}} air must be removed by gently pressing the plunger forward. The woman lies {{on her back and}} the syringe is then inserted into the vagina. Care is optimal when inserting the syringe, so that the tip is as close to the entrance to the cervix as possible. A <b>vaginal</b> <b>speculum</b> may be used to hold open the vagina so that the cervix may be observed and the syringe inserted more accurately through the open speculum. The plunger is then slowly pushed forward and the semen in the syringe is emptied deep into the vagina. The syringe (and speculum if used) may be left in place for several minutes before removal and the woman is advised to lie still for about half-an-hour to improve the success rate.|$|E
50|$|When a {{woman came}} to him with an injured pelvis and retroverted uterus from a fall off of a horse, he placed her in a knee-chest {{position}} and inserted his finger into the vagina; this triggered a full distention of the vagina with air, allowing Sims to see the vagina clearly. The distention inspired him to investigate fistula treatment further. Soon after he developed a precursor to the modern speculum out of a pewter spoon and strategically placed mirrors. From 1845 to 1849 Sims started doing experiments on slave women and these experiments were the basis for modern vaginal surgery. The Sims' <b>vaginal</b> <b>speculum</b> aided in vaginal examination and surgery. The rectal examination position, in which the patient {{is on the left}} side with the right knee flexed against the abdomen and the left knee slightly flexed, is also named after him.|$|E
5000|$|Mme Boivin {{invented a}} new pelvimeter, and a <b>vaginal</b> <b>speculum</b> {{which was used}} to dilate the vagina and the {{examination}} of the cervix. Her invention helped not only her female patients, but also medical practitioners. [...] She {{is one of the first}} to use stethoscope to listen to the fetal heart. [...] She was given credit for discovering the cause of certain types of bleeding, the cause of miscarriages and diseases of the placenta and uterus. [...] Radcliffe stated that she 'was undertaking surgical treatments which in other countries were the prerogative of the men.' Mme Boivin was also one of the first surgeons to amputate the cervix uteri for a cancerous growth. Because Mme Boivin was an innovative and skillful gynecological surgeon, German universities became more opened to the idea of women becoming skilled in gynecological surgery.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vaginal</b> <b>speculum</b> {{was first}} used in ancient Greece and some {{contemporary}} specula were found in Cyprus. A pure gold otoscope, {{very similar to those}} commonly used in the 1930s was also found. A known doctor of the period was Diagoras the Cypriot (3rd century BC). He was mentioned by Dioscorides with regards to opium use, also by Pliny, and Erotianus. Diagoras was famous outside Cyprus. He was specifically interested in pharmacology and he devised the ‘Great Collirio’ used for burns, exophthalmos, keratitis, eye ache (ponommatos), and discharge from the eye. The Collirio was also used to cure headache, with the addition of opium into the mixture. In the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia there is a stone ring with the inscription 'Diagorou', {{and the head of the}} medusa. According to legend, Athena gave to Asclepius the blood from the medusa, believed to have healing properties.|$|E

50|$|Sims' <b>vaginal</b> <b>speculum</b> is a double-bladed {{surgical}} instrument used for examining the vagina and cervix. It {{was developed by}} J. Marion Sims out of pewter spoon, but nowadays it is manufactured out of stainless steel or plastic. The plastic speculum is disposable, but the stainless steel one is not. Therefore, the stainless steel speculum should be sterilized before each use. Sims' speculum is inserted into the vagina to retract posterior vaginal wall. It gives more exposure of the vaginal walls than Cusco's Speculum and therefore is preferred for gynaecological surgeries. {{it is possible to}} slide the instrument around the vaginal wall to enable better visualization. The groove in the middle of Sims' speculum allows free flow of secretions and blood to the outside, thereby keeping the area dry. Sims' speculum is available in various sizes, and the size appropriate to the vaginal dimensions of the woman is chosen for use. The disadvantage of Sims' speculum {{is that it is not}} self-retracting. The examiner might want to use an anterior wall retractor in addition to Sims' speculum for better visualization of the cervix.|$|E
