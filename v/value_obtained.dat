5|$|A pKa <b>value</b> <b>obtained</b> in a mixed solvent {{cannot be}} used {{directly}} for aqueous solutions. The {{reason for this is}} that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E

Methods: Forced spirometry was performed, {{in accordance with the}} Brazilian Thoracic Society guidelines, in 643 nonsmoking adult Caucasians. The predicted <b>values</b> <b>obtained</b> by Brazilian researchers in 1992 and those obtained by four groups of foreign researchers were compared with the new Brazilian predicted <b>values</b> <b>obtained</b> in 2006.

25|$|The {{purchase}} of lottery tickets cannot {{be accounted for}} by decision models based on expected value maximization. The reason is that lottery tickets cost more than the expected gain, as shown by lottery mathematics, so someone maximizing expected value should not buy lottery tickets. Yet, lottery purchases can be explained by decision models based on expected utility maximization, as the curvature of the utility function can be adjusted to capture risk-seeking behavior. More general models based on utility functions defined on things other than the lottery outcomes can also account for lottery purchase. In addition to the lottery prizes, the ticket may enable some purchasers to experience a thrill and to indulge in a fantasy of becoming wealthy. If the entertainment value (or other non-monetary <b>value)</b> <b>obtained</b> by playing is high enough for a given individual, then the {{purchase of}} a lottery ticket could represent a gain in overall utility. In such a case, the disutility of a monetary loss could be outweighed by the combined expected utility of monetary and non-monetary gain, thus making the purchase a rational decision for that individual.|$|E
25|$|To {{prepare for}} an assay, the {{researcher}} fills each {{well of the}} plate with some biological entity that they wish to conduct the experiment upon, such as a protein, cells, or an animal embryo. After some incubation time has passed to allow the biological matter to absorb, bind to, or otherwise react (or fail to react) with the compounds in the wells, measurements are taken across all the plate's wells, either manually or by a machine. Manual measurements are often necessary when the researcher is using microscopy to (for example) seek changes or defects in embryonic development caused by the wells' compounds, looking for effects that a computer could not easily determine by itself. Otherwise, a specialized automated analysis machine can run a number of experiments on the wells (such as shining polarized light on them and measuring reflectivity, which can be an indication of protein binding). In this case, the machine outputs the result of each experiment as a grid of numeric values, with each number mapping to the <b>value</b> <b>obtained</b> from a single well. A high-capacity analysis machine can measure dozens of plates {{in the space of}} a few minutes like this, generating thousands of experimental datapoints very quickly.|$|E

25|$|Particle swarm {{optimization}} {{is another}} algorithm widely used {{to solve problems}} related to swarms. It was developed in 1995 by Kennedy and Eberhart and was first aimed at simulating the social behaviour and choreography of bird flocks and fish schools. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The system initially seeds a population with random solutions. It then searches in the problem space through successive generations using stochastic optimization {{to find the best}} solutions. The solutions it finds are called particles. Each particle stores its position as well as the best solution it has achieved so far. The particle swarm optimizer tracks the best local <b>value</b> <b>obtained</b> so far by any particle in the local neighbourhood. The remaining particles then move through the problem space following the lead of the optimum particles. At each time iteration, the particle swarm optimiser accelerates each particle toward its optimum locations according to simple mathematical rules. Particle swarm optimization has been applied in many areas. It has few parameters to adjust, and a version that works well for a specific applications can also work well with minor modifications across a range of related applications. A book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes some philosophical aspects of particle swarm optimization applications and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of applications is made by Poli.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond {{critical}} mass, {{the increasing}} number of subscribers generally cannot continue indefinitely. [...] After a certain point, most networks become either congested or saturated, stopping future uptake. [...] Congestion occurs due to overuse.

[...] However, at some point the addition of an extra user exceeds the capacity of the existing system. [...] After this point, each additional user decreases the <b>value</b> <b>obtained</b> by every other user.
