5|$|Printing in China {{initially}} had {{a similar}} development, starting with the printing of religious scriptures, prayers and popularly useful texts such as almanacs or calendars which were produced for local use by temples.

Consequently, the Chinese publishing industry took off during the Song Dynasty, several hundred years before the same happened in Japan.

Japanese visitors to Song China returned {{with a large number}} of printed books, on a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>subjects</b> such as history, philosophy, Buddhism, Confucianism, literature, medicine and geography, causing a revival of pure scholarship, which had been sidelined during the earlier obsession with poetry in the Heian period courtier society.|$|E

He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>subjects,</b> and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the early Church (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981).
