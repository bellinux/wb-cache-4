5000|$|Mark Knothe, the Technical Liaison Officer between Stern, Elles and Anley, {{contributed to}} the {{development}} of the tank, designing a longer Mark I with Williams-Janney hydraulic transmission; one of the Mark IIs used as test vehicles had used a hydraulic transmission. In October 1917 Brown Brothers in Edinburgh were granted a contract to develop this line of research further. In July 1918, the prototype was ready. Its drive system was very complex. The [...] Ricardo engine drove into <b>Variable</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Gear</b> Ltd. pumps that in turn powered two hydraulic motors, moving one track each by means of several chains. To ward off the obvious danger of overheating, there were many fans, louvres and radiators. However, steering was easy and gradual and the version was taken into production to equip one tank battalion. Three had been built, and only one delivered out of an order for 74 when war ended. It was passed over in favour over the VIII, which was ordered at the same time. The hull was slightly lengthened in comparison with the Mark V. No Mark VIIs survive.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective was to}} investigate the generation and collection of power generated in a distributed tidal generation site, and realise the most economic grid connection methodology for a practical installation. Current tidal steam prototype designs utilise <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> boxes, power frequency converters and variable pitch blades in the nacelle, thus requiring complicated, heavy and expensive equipment in the nacelle. Moreover the variable blade pitch mechanism has a large power demand, and has to operate day after day submerged in water at depths between 30 m – 80 m. The approach taken in this research is to replace major cost components with much cheaper ones, as well as locating as many components as possible onshore where costs are less. This thesis investigates a novel tidal stream power generation system referred to as “passive rectification to a common DC-bus” where an array of 3 -phase synchronous generators operating at diverse speeds are connected to a common DC bus via passive diode rectifiers. The proposed tidal stream topology shows that variable pitched blades, variable speed gearboxes and frequency converters in the nacelle can be replaced by a much simpler system that uses fixed pitch blades, a fixed ratio gearbox, generator excitation control system, and a diode bridge rectifier. These components are generally cheaper, lighter, have a lower power demand and are more reliable than the components they replace. Also some of the voltage and frequency conversion is carried out ashore where costs are less, in addition to the overall {{reduction in the number of}} components required as some of the components are shared by multiple devices. As a result system efficiency is maximised, in addition to facilitating a reduction in capital, installation and operational costs. Power conversion from the tidal generation power system to shore is achieved via passive rectification to a common DC-bus, thus system power regulation is achieved by individual generator field current control, to attain optimum system operation including, maximum power extraction, power limitation and stall control, in turn improving system reliability and controllability. Furthermore passive stall control via generator field current regulation eliminates the need for mechanical brakes which reduces cost and improves reliability. The feasibility of the proposed power generation system was carried out via computer simulations and later validated via small scale laboratory hardware simulations. ...|$|E
40|$|Microfin tubes {{have already}} been widely used for {{air-conditioning}} and refrigeration applications as they ensure a large heat transfer enhancement with a relatively low pressure drop increase. During condensation microfin tubes show a heat transfer enhancement, compared to equivalent smooth tubes under the same operating conditions, that {{is partly due to}} the mere increase in the effective exchange area, and additionally to the turbulence induced in the liquid film by the micro fins and to the surface tension effect on the liquid drainage. The performances of these microfin tubes during condensation of refrigerants have been studied experimentally and theoretically. In this work the authors present their own data when condensing R- 134 a inside two different tubes: a 9. 5 mm outer diameter microfin tube (7. 69 mm inside diameter at the fin tip and 60 fins with 0. 23 mm fin height and 13 ° helix angle) and a plain 8 mm inner diameter tube. Many authors use the so-called Wilson-plot method to measure the heat transfer coefficient of tubes; here, the experimental data have been taken by direct measurement of the wall temperature {{in a wide range of}} operative conditions: mass velocities ranging from 100 to 800 kg/(m 2 s) and vapour quality from 20 to 80 %; saturation temperature was kept constant at 40 °C. The experimental tests were run in a new test section set up at the Dipartimento di Fisica Tecnica of the University of Padova. The test section is a counter flow tube-in-tube condenser, with the refrigerant condensing in the inner tube, against the cold water flowing in the annulus. The measuring sections are 300 mm long and they are instrumented with thermocouples embedded in the tube wall, in the middle of the tube for the microfin tube and at inlet and outlet for the smooth tube. The thermocouples are soldered along the circumference to draw a cross shape. Refrigerant temperatures at inlet and outlet of the test section are measured by means of adiabatic sections, using thermocouples inserted into both the refrigerant flow and the tube wall. The refrigerant flow can be independently controlled by a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>gear</b> pump. Two digital strain gauge pressure (absolute and differential) transducers are connected to manometric taps to measure the refrigerant pressure upstream and downstream of the test tube. The refrigerant mass flow rate is measured by a Coriolis effect mass flow meter inserted downstream of the pump. The cooling water flow rate is measured by a magnetic flow meter and its temperature gain across the instrumented test tube is measured with a copper-constantan thermopile, installed into mixing chambers to assure perfect mixing of the water. There is agreement in the literature that the mechanisms of heat transfer and pressure drop are intimately linked with the prevailing two-phase flow regime. During condensation inside horizontal tubes, the two-phase flow may be dominated by vapour shear or gravity forces. While annular flow pattern is associated with high vapour shear, stratified, wavy and slug flows appear when gravity is the controlling force. In a fully developed annular flow pattern, there is a thin condensate film on the entire tube wall, while the gas phase flows in the central core, and heat transfer is governed by vapour shear and turbulence. Very poor evidence about the effect of microfins on the flow patterns during condensation is given in the open literature. Thus, to investigate the two phase flow pattern during condensation a new test section was built up; it consists of a large brass chamber equipped with three glass windows expressly designed to light and to observe the fluid. The test tube ends up in the chamber, in this way the fluid outlet pattern can be analyzed and recorded with a high shutter digital video camera. The same operative conditions set for heat transfer coefficient measurements are reproduced in the visualization section in order to investigate the specific flow pattern at the outlet vapour quality. For the study of the main flow patterns, in particular focusing on the stratified/annular mode transition, the visualization experimental data are analysed with reference to parameters like dimensionless vapour velocity, Martinelli parameter and void fraction, that are adopted in the main available flow pattern maps. The aim of this work is to link the heat transfer coefficients and in particular the heat transfer enhancement of the microfin tube with the flow pattern during the process. Microfin tube shows different heat transfer enhancement with different mass velocities. Since the available maps are designed only for smooth tubes, the results of this experimental work could be used as a starting point for drawing a new flow pattern map specifically dedicated to enhanced tubes...|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of rolling element bearing fault diagnosis, <b>variable</b> {{rotational}} <b>speed</b> and <b>gear</b> noise are main obstacles. Even though some effective algorithms have been proposed to solve the problems, their process is complicated {{and they may not}} work well without auxiliary equipment. So we proposed a method of faulty bearing feature extraction based on Instantaneous Dominant Meshing Multiply (IDMM) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The new method mainly consists of three parts. Firstly, IDMM is extracted from time-frequency representation of original signal by peak searching algorithm, which can be used to substitute the bearing rotational frequency. Secondly, resampled signal is obtained by an IDMM-based resampling algorithm; then it is decomposed into a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) based on the EMD algorithm. Calculate kurtosis values of IMFs and an appropriate IMF with biggest kurtosis value is selected. Thirdly, the selected IMF is analyzed with envelope demodulation method which can describe the fault type of bearing. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated by both simulated and experimental mixed signals which contain bearing and gear vibration signal...|$|R
