40|$|Filing Date: 1997 - 06 - 12 [...] Priority Data: ES PCT/ES 96 / 00130 (1996 - 06 - 13) The present {{invention}} {{is based}} on the isolation and characterization of a plant cell DNA sequence encoding for a retinoblastoma protein. Such finding {{is based on}} the structural and functional properties of the plant retinoblastoma protein as possible regulator of the cellular cycle, of the cellular growth and of the plant cellular differentiation. For this reason, among other aspects, it is claimed the use of retinoblastoma protein or the DNA sequence which encodes for it in the growing control of vegetable cells, plants and/or <b>vegetable</b> <b>virus,</b> as well as the use of vectors, cells, plants or animals, or animal cells modified through the manipulation of the control route based on plant retinoblastoma proteinPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The aphids {{are well}} known as the {{important}} vector of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>virus</b> diseases in Japan. The authors have observed the taxonomical and biological aspects of the aphids caught on some vegetables and in the yellow pan traps placed ground level of 50 cm. The results are as follows. 1. The aphids caught on each vegetable were, 663 aphids in 25 specues on the chinese cabbage, 479 aphids in 24 species on the raddish, and 294 aphids in 28 species on the spinach. It seems that many species of aphids collected {{are related to the}} surrounding vegetation in this experimental field. 2. The aphids caught in the yellow pan trap were 1, 100 aphids in 52 species, and 42 % of the trapped aphids were Spinaea aphids, Aphis spiraecola. 3. It was found that many species alight on vegetables in spite of non-host plants of its aphids. 4. The abundance of the many species recorded in the present observations probably represent the autumn migration of aphids to overwintering host plants [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Vegetable {{production}} for the export market makes {{a significant contribution}} to the gross domestic product (GDP) and is of economic importance to Zimbabwe. Both conventional and traditional vegetables are grown throughout Zimbabwe by smallholder and large-scale commercial farmers. Despite the importance of vegetables in the diets of the people and to the economy of the country, {{little is known about the}} type and distribution of viruses of most of the <b>vegetables.</b> Several <b>viruses</b> have been listed as occurring on some vegetables in Zimbabwe. However, the economic importance of these viruses has not been determined. Information is also lacking on the ecology and epidemiology of <b>vegetable</b> <b>viruses</b> under local conditions. Recommendations for the control of <b>vegetable</b> <b>viruses</b> is usually adapted from research results of developed countries and therefore tend to be general. This lack of information is due to the small number of trained plant virologists combined with the shortage of equipment and funds to purchase reagents and conduct countrywide virus surveys. Efforts should be made by the Ministry of Agriculture of Zimbabwe and organizations that represent Zimbabw...|$|R
40|$|Procedures of {{separation}} of virus particles from a plant material are multistage. Furthermore often they are difficult in terms of methodology and require use of expensive, highly specialist equipment and yield {{of separation}} is often low. The antigen obtained is often degraded and contains admixtures of other proteins. Therefore, generation of high quality and specificity antibodies based on such antigen is very difficult {{and quality of the}} antibodies has impact on reliability, sensitivity and unambiguity of results of immunodiagnostic tests (e. g. ELISA) that are currently conventionally used to detect <b>vegetable</b> <b>viruses.</b> In this study three conventionally-performed methods {{of separation of}} potato virus Y (PVY) were compared and a method of separation based on membrane chromatography, as an alternative separation technique, has been presented. It has been demonstrated that in proper process conditions good quality virus preparation can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Mesothelioma {{incidence}} varies markedly {{from one}} country to another. The highest annual crude incidence rates (about 30 cases per million) are observed in Australia, Belgium, and Great Britain. A lot of data indicate a relationship between mesothelioma and asbestos. The hot areas for mesothelioma exactly correspond to the sites of industries with high asbestos use, such as shipbuilding and asbestos-cement industry. However, in many countries with high asbestos consumption, mesothelioma incidence is low. The reasons for this fact are not clear. The latency periods elapsing between first exposure to asbestos and development of mesothelioma are mostly longer than 40 yr. An inverse relationship exists between intensity of asbestos exposure and length of the latency period. Mesothelioma generally develops after long-time exposures to asbestos. Some recent studies show that the risk increases with the duration of exposure. Possible co-factors in the pathogenesis of asbestos-related mesothelioma include genetic predisposition, diets poor in fruit and <b>vegetables,</b> <b>viruses,</b> immune impairment, recurrent serosal inflammation. The study of co-morbidity in mesothelioma could give an insight into the pathogenesis of the tumor. While a levelling-off in mesothelioma incidence has been registered in some countries, a worsening of the epidemic is predictable in large parts of the world...|$|R

40|$|Plant viruses infect many {{economically}} important crops, including wheat, cotton, maize, cassava, {{and other}} <b>vegetables.</b> These <b>viruses</b> pose {{a serious threat}} to agriculture worldwide, as decreases in cropland area per capita may cause production to fall short of that required to feed the increasing world population. Under these circumstances, conventional strategies can fail to control rapidly evolving and emerging plant viruses. Genome-engineering strategies have recently emerged as promising tools to introduce desirable traits in many eukaryotic species, including plants. Among these genome engineering technologies, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) / CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas 9) system has received special interest because of its simplicity, efficiency, and reproducibility. Recent studies have used CRISPR/Cas 9 to engineer virus resistance in plants, either by directly targeting and cleaving the viral genome, or by modifying the host plant genome to introduce viral immunity. Here, we briefly describe the biology of the CRISPR/Cas 9 system and plant viruses, and how different genome engineering technologies have been used to target these viruses. We further describe the main findings from recent studies of CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated viral interference and discuss how these findings can be applied to improve global agriculture. We conclude by pinpointing the gaps in our knowledge and the outstanding questions regarding CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated viral immunity...|$|R
40|$|The {{popularity}} in the consumption of fresh and fresh-cut vegetables continues to increase globally. Fresh vegetables {{are an integral part}} of a healthy diet, pro-viding vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other health-promoting compounds. The diversity of fresh vegetables and packaging formats (spring mix in clamshell container, bagged heads of lettuce) support increased consumption. Unfortunately, vegetable production and processing practices are not suffi-cient to ensure complete microbial safety. This review highlights a few specific areas that require greater attention and research. Selected outbreaks are pre-sented to emphasize the need for science-based ‘best practices’. Laboratory and field studies have focused on inactivation of pathogens associated with manure in liquid, slurry or solid forms. As production prac-tices change, other forms and types of soil amend-ments are being used more prevalently. Information regarding the microbial safety of fish emulsion and pellet form of manure is limited. The topic of global climate change is controversial, but the potential effect on agriculture cannot be ignored. Changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind can impact crops and the microorganisms that are asso-ciated with production environments. Climate change could potentially enhance the ability of pathogens to survive and persist in soil, water and crops, increas-ing human health risks. Limited research has focused on the prevalence and behaviour of viruses in pre and post-harvest environments and on <b>vegetable</b> com-modities. Globally, <b>viruses</b> are a major cause of foodborne illnesses, but are seldom tested for in soil, soil amendments, manure and crops. Greater atten-tion must also be given to the improvement in the microbial quality of seeds used in sprout production. Human pathogens associated with seeds can result in contamination of sprouts intended for human con-sumption, even when all appropriate ‘best practices’ are used by sprout growers...|$|R
40|$|Kniel, KalmiaThe {{presence}} of disease-causing microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa) on farmlands poses {{a serious threat}} to public health. Pathogens can cause surface water contamination by many processes, such as runoff, groundwater contamination through leaching, and food contamination through direct contact or irrigation with contaminated water. This is a critical national issue because of the widespread agricultural use of manures/biosolids, the growing problem of emerging viral diseases, and the limited research base on interactions between viruses in water with soils and food crops. It has been estimated that nearly 80 million dry tons of solid manure are generated annually by the beef, dairy, swine, and poultry industries in the U. S. Land application remains by far the most common and economic method to beneficially re-use these by-products of animal production. Properly treated manure is an effective and safe fertilizer, but untreated or improperly treated manure may contain pathogens that can reach fresh produce in the field, nearby surface waters and leach to ground waters; it is these affected waters that will be used for irrigation and for pesticide applications. Although viruses are not the only pathogens of concern, they are much smaller in size than other enteric pathogens, and can move better through the subsurface. Viruses also tend to survive longer than bacteria and protozoa in the environment and therefore pose greater threats for groundwater and produce contamination. Furthermore, viruses {{have been shown to be}} responsible for approximately 80 % of waterborne disease outbreaks for which infectious agents were identifiable and 75 % of the estimated cases of foodborne illness. Due to the recent attention given to foodborne disease outbreaks, especially with lettuce, there is a renewed desire to understand the origin of plant contamination by viruses. Transmission of human pathogens to plants through contaminated irrigation water and contaminated hands has been documented under both laboratory and field conditions. Viruses have previously been shown to survive on the surface of vegetables for more than 2 months under suitable conditions with the potential for survival for over 2 years based on laboratory calculations of the field environment, outlasting the normal shelf-life of some products. Considerable research has been devoted to the fate and transport of viruses in soils; there is evidence that viruses can move considerable distances in specific soil layers. Such findings have raised concerns about surface and ground water contamination. Generally, viruses have been found to survive longer under moist as compared to dry conditions. In addition, when viruses are associated to a solid surface, they are generally protected from being inactivated; however, association with certain metal and metal oxides has been found to reduce virus survival. The route of viral contamination often goes unidentified for a majority of foodborne outbreaks involving fresh produce. Nearly 75 % of these outbreaks are related to domestically grown produce with less than 10 % from imported produce and the rest unknown. As produce consumption has increased with increasing focus on a healthy diet, foodborne illness associated with these foods has as well. Viral contamination of produce has been associated with various types of fruits, leafy <b>vegetables,</b> and herbs. <b>Viruses</b> affect large numbers of people and different food products; the CDC estimates the incidence of foodborne illness attributed to fruit and vegetable consumption at 3 million cases in the U. S. annually. University of Delaware, Department of Animal and Food ScienceM. S...|$|R
