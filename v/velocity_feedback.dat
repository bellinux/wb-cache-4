40|$|A novel {{approach}} for the robust eigensystem assignment of flexible structures using full state or output feedback is developed. Using the second-order dynamic equations, the approach can assign the eigenvalues {{of the system}} via <b>velocity</b> and displacement <b>feedbacks,</b> or acceleration and <b>velocity</b> <b>feedbacks.</b> The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system are assigned, via the second-order eigenvalue problem for the structural system, in two steps. First, an orthonormal basis spanning the attainable closed-loop eigenvector space corresponding to each desired closed-loop eigenvalue is generated using the Singular Value or QR decompositions. Second, a sequential procedure is used to choose a set of closed-loop eigenvectors that are {{as close as possible}} to the column space of a well-conditioned target matrix.

This is intended to achieve a robust contact transition and force tracking performance for varying unknown environments, without any need of adjusting the controller parameters, A unified control structure is proposed for free motion, contact transition, and constrained motion in view of the consumption of the initial kinetic energy generated by a nonzero impact velocity. The influence of the <b>velocity</b> and acceleration <b>feedbacks,</b> which are introduced especially for suppressing the transition oscillation, on the postcontact tracking performance is discussed. Extensive experiments are conducted on the third joint of a three-link direct-drive robot to verify the proposed scheme for environments of various stiffnesses, including elastic (sponge), less elastic (cardboard), and hard (steel plate) surfaces. Results are compared with those obtained by the transition control scheme without the acceleration feedback.

Two primary goals are achieved: First, these results are proven without the imposition of strong geometric assumptions on the controlled portion of the boundary, thus extending earlier work which required that the domain be “star shaped. ” Second, the feedback is only a function of velocity, as opposed to also containing the tangential derivative of the displacement, resulting in a physically viable feedback.

It can improve excavation accuracy and greatly reduce the operator’s labor intensity. The 12 -ton backhoe bucket excavator has been utilized {{in this research}} work where this type of excavator is commonly used in engineering work. The kinematics model of operation device (boom, arm, bucket, and swing) in excavator is established in both Denavit-Hartenberg coordinates for easy programming and geometric space for avoiding blind spot.

50|$|The Mk.1 and Mk.1A {{computers}} were electromechanical, {{and many of}} their mechanical calculations required drive movements of precise speeds. They used reversible two-phase capacitor-run induction motors with tungsten contacts. These were stabilized primarily by rotary magnetic drag (eddy-current) slip clutches, similar to classical rotating-magnet speedometers, but with a much higher torque. One part of the drag was geared to the motor, and the other was constrained by a fairly stiff spring. This spring offset the null position of the contacts by an amount proportional to motor speed, thus providing <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback.</b> Flywheels mounted on the motor shafts, but coupled by magnetic drags, prevented contact chatter when the motor was at rest. Unfortunately, the flywheels must also have slowed down the servos somewhat.A more elaborate scheme, which placed a rather large flywheel and differential between the motor and the magnetic drag, eliminated velocity error for critical data, such as gun orders.|$|E

We study the tracking/migration problem for flocks and {{a theoretical framework}} for design and analysis of flocking algorithm is presented. The interactions between agents in the systems are denoted by potential functions that act as distance functions, hence, the design of proper potential functions are crucial in modelling and analyzing the flocking problem for multi-agent dynamical systems. Constructions for both non-smooth potential functions and smooth potential functions with finite cut-off are investigated in detail. The main contributions of this thesis are to extend the literature of continuous flocking models with impulsive control and delay. Lyapunov function techniques and techniques for stability of continuous and impulsive switching system are used, we study the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium of our models with impulsive control and discovery that by applying impulsive control to Olfati-Saber's continuous model, we can remove the damping term and improve the performance by avoiding the deficiency caused by time delay in velocity sensing. Additionally, we discuss both free-flocking and constrained-flocking algorithm for multi-agent dynamical system, we extend literature results by applying <b>velocity</b> <b>feedbacks</b> which are given by the dynamical obstacles in the environment to our impulsive control and successfully lead to flocking with obstacle avoidance capability in a more energy-efficient way.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} various experimental verifications for {{the theoretical}} analysis results of vibration suppression to a smart flexible beam bonded with a piezoelectric actuator by a <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> controller and an extended state observer (ESO). During the {{state feedback control}} (SFC) design process for the smart flexible beam with the pole placement theory, in the state feedback gain matrix, the <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> gain {{is much more than}} the displacement feedback gain. For the difference between the <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> gain and the displacement feedback gain, a modified <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> controller is applied based on a dynamical model with the Hamilton principle to the smart beam. In addition, the feedback velocity is attained with the extended state observer and the displacement is acquired by the foil gauge on the root of the smart flexible beam. The control voltage is calculated by the designed <b>velocity</b> <b>feedback</b> gain multiplied by the feedback velocity. Through some experiment verifications for simulation results, it is indicated that the suppressed amplitude of free vibration is up to 62. 13 % while the attenuated magnitude of its velocity is up to 61. 31 %.

40|$|The {{most popular}} control method in the {{industry}} is PID control due to its simple structure and effective performance. Although huge numbers of PID controller tuning methods have been proposed so far, existing ones still {{do not have the}} desired performances and the simplicity. Complex system dynamics make it challenging for engineers and students to apply these methods on their applications especially in the motion control and robotics areas. Such systems generally include nonlinearity, friction, varying inertia and unknown disturbances which make the conventional tuning methods ineffective and too complex to be used. There is need for simple and effective PID tuning methods in these areas. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes two novel practical PID tuning methods for motion control systems. These methods bring the superiority of the 2 degree of freedom control approach to simple PID controller structures analytically. They are very effective in motion control and robust both to parameter uncertainty and unknown disturbances, yet very simple. They can be easily used by the engineers {{in the industry}} and the students with very basic control knowledge, so little effort and time.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} margin of a vehicular formation with distributed control, {{in which the}} control at each vehicle only depends on the information from its neighbors in an information graph. We consider a D-dimensional lattice as information graph, of which the 1 -D platoon is a special case. The stability margin {{is measured by the}} real part of the least stable eigenvalue of the closed-loop state matrix, which quantifies the rate of decay of initial errors. In [1], it was shown that with symmetric control, in which two neighbors put equal weight on information received from each other, the stability margin of a 1 -D vehicular platoon decays to 0 as O(1 /N^ 2), where N is the number of vehicles. Moreover, a perturbation analysis was used to show that with vanishingly small amount of asymmetry in the control gains, the stability margin scaling can be improved to O(1 /N). In this paper, we show that, with judicious choice of non-vanishing asymmetry in control, the stability margin of the closed loop can be bounded away from zero uniformly in N. Asymmetry in control gains thus makes the control architecture highly scalable. The results are also generalized to D-dimensional lattice information graphs that were studied in [2], and the correspondingly stronger conclusions than those derived in [2] are obtained. In addition, we show that the size-independent stability margin can be achieved with relative position and relative <b>velocity</b> (RPRV) <b>feedback</b> as well as relative position and absolute <b>velocity</b> (RPAV) <b>feedback,</b> while the analysis in [1], [2] was only for the RPAV case.
