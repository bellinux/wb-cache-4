5|$|The Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus {{factory that}} {{produces}} refined vegetable oils, especially olive oil, and <b>vegetable</b> <b>butter</b> {{from the factory}} is exported to Jordan. The al-Huda Textiles factory is also located in Nablus. In 2000, the factory produced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production plummeted to 150–200 pieces daily in 2002. Al-Huda mainly imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel. There are eight restaurants {{in the city and}} four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. Nablus' once thriving soap industry has been largely isolated due to difficult transportation conditions stemming from West Bank closures and IDF incursions. Today, there are only two soap factories still operating in the city.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{cultivated}} in warm and humid regions for its oleaginous seeds (producing between 20 and 200 kg of seeds annually per tree, depending on maturity), flowers and wood. The fat (solid at ambient temperature) {{is used for}} the care of the skin, to manufacture soap or detergents, and as a <b>vegetable</b> <b>butter.</b> It can also be used as a fuel oil. The seed cakes obtained after extraction of oil constitute very good fertilizer. The flowers are used to produce an alcoholic drink in tropical India. This drink is also known to affect the animals. Several parts of the tree, including the bark, are used for their medicinal properties. It is considered holy by many tribal communities because of its usefulness.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{work and}} a series of {{successive}} works aim to subject various ratios of palm olein and palm stearin blends to chemical interesterification under different conditions of catalyst, temperature and time in order to obtain fat blends suitable for the production of <b>vegetable</b> <b>butter</b> (margarine) fortified with different natural vitamins and minerals and prepared by using nanotechnology. In this paper palm olein and palm stearin (70 : 30 w/w) fat blend was chemically interesterified using 0. 4 ml % of NaOH: glycerol: H 2 O (1 : 2 : 3 w/w) or 0. 3 % sodium methoxide catalysts under different conditions of time and temperature. The produced interesterified blends were used to prepare fortified <b>vegetable</b> <b>butter</b> samples using nanotechnology. Product evaluation was done before and after interesterification in order to determine its chemical and physical properties, fatty acid composition, trans fatty acids content, triglyceride structure and solid fat content of the fat blend, also prepared <b>vegetable</b> <b>butter</b> samples were evaluated for it’s chemical and physical properties. Results showed that chemical interesterification of palm olein and palm stearin blend modified its chemical and physical properties and its triglyceride structure. Also chemical interesterification by using both catalysts managed to give products with zero trans fatty acids. Using NaOH: glycerol: H 2 O (1 : 2 : 3 w/w) as a catalyst gave better results than using sodium methoxide catalyst regarding the product stability, melting point, triglyceride structure and solid fat content. Transmittence Electron Microscope (TEM) images showed that the particle size of all of the nanofortified <b>vegetable</b> <b>butter</b> samples lies in the nano-range...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{cross-sectional}} analysis provides up-to-date information about dietary patterns (DP) and their sociodemographic correlates in European elderly individuals. We studied 6686 enrollees aged 65 + (55 % women) {{in the ongoing}} French population-based NutriNet-Sante e-cohort. Diet was assessed via three 24 h records. The sex-specific correlates of factor analysis derived DP were identified with multivariable linear regression. Using 22 pre-defined food groups, three DP were extracted. The "healthy" DP (fruit, vegetables, grains, nuts, fish) was positively associated with education, living alone, and being a former smoker (women), and negatively associated with being overweight, current smoker (men), age 75 + years, having hypertension, and obesity (women). The "western" DP (meat, appetizers, cheese, alcohol) was positively associated with BMI (men) and being a former/current smoker; it was negatively associated with age 75 + years (women) and living alone. The "traditional" DP (bread, potatoes, milk, <b>vegetables,</b> <b>butter,</b> stock) was positively associated with age and negatively associated with being a former/current smoker, education (men), and residing in an urban/semi-urban area. The findings support the diversity of DP among the elderly, highlighting sex-specific differences. The "healthy" DP explained the largest amount of variance in intake.

The literature {{has shown the}} antioxidant potential of compounds existing in murumuru (Astrocaryum murmuru), cupuaçu (Theobroma grandiflorum) and cocoa (Theobroma cacao) butters that recommends further investigation. The objectives of this research were: (1) to develop bioactive photoprotective formulations containing cocoa, murmuru or cupuaçu butters in association with a physical sunscreen (titanium dioxide (TiO 2)) and (2) determine the possible photoprotective activity of butters and their interactions with the sunscreen. Cocoa, cupuaçu and murumuru butter were individually associated to TiO 2 in O / W emulsions. The anti-UVA and UVB efficacy in vitro was estimated by diffuse transmittance analysis in a Labsphere® UV 2000 S, using quartz plates and Transpore® tape to obtain the SPF (sun protection factor) and critical wavelength. Photoprotective formulations containing titanium dioxide and bioactive butters were obtained using Aristoflex® AVC and triglycerides of caprylic capric acid (GTCC). The SPF of the samples containing only TiO 2 and formulations containing cocoa, murumuru or cupuassu butters associated with TiO 2 ranged from 4 to 5. The critical wavelength values for these formulations ranged from 383. 0 to 386. 7 nm. The results indicated no increase in the SPF value for formulations containing <b>vegetable</b> <b>butters.</b> The critical wavelength values indicated their potential to absorb part of the UVA radiation...|$|R
