This plant is native to northern Spain, western France, central and southern Europe, and Caucasus. It has been recently cultivated for pharmaceutical purposes by Zardband Botanical Garden in Iran. Since the quality of herb material and alkaloid concentration is greatly influenced by environmental conditions, in this study, we report the isolation and identification of major alkaloids along with the quantification of <b>vincamine</b> as the pharmacologically most important component.

40|$|The ion-molecule {{reactions}} of ions from acetone, dimethyl ether, 2 -methoxyethanol, and vinyl methyl ether with <b>vincamine</b> were investigated. Reactions with dimethyl ether result in [M + 13]+ and [M + 45]+ products, reactions with 2 -methoxyethanol produce [M + 13]+ and [M + 89]+ ions, and reactions with acetone or vinyl methyl ether ions generate predominantly [M + 43]+ ions. Collision-activated dissociation and deuterium labeling experiments allowed {{speculation about the}} product structures and mechanisms of dissociation. The methylene substitution process was shown to occur at the hydroxyl oxygen and the phenyl ring of <b>vincamine</b> for dimethyl ether reactions, but the methylene substitution process was not favored at the hydroxyl oxygen for the 2 -methoxyethanol reactions, instead favored at the 12 phenyl position. The reaction site is likely different for the 2 -methoxyethanol ion due to its capability for secondary hydrogen-bonding interactions. For the [M + 45]+ and [M + 89]+ ions, evidence suggests that charge-remote fragmentation processes occur from these products. In general, the use of dimethyl ether ions or 2 -methoxyethanol ions for ionmolecule reactions prove highly diagnostic for the characterization of vincamine; both molecular weight and structural information are obtained.

The objective of the research was to study and evaluate the efficiency of complex therapy using choline alphoscerate and <b>vincamine</b> in patients during the early recovery period of ischemic stroke considering the processes of energy metabolism. Materials and methods. The study involved 66 patients in the early recovery period of primary hemispheric ischemic stroke being randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 received basic therapy for secondary prevention of stroke. Patients of Group 2 received choline alphoscerate and <b>vincamine</b> for 2 months in addition to basic therapy. The evaluation of neurological deficit and functional status of patients was carried out using the NIH Stroke Scale, the Scandinavian stroke scale (SSS) and the Barthel Index; the concentration of lactic and pyruvic acid in serum was determined.

There was detected a moderate correlation (r= 0. 34; p= 0. 031) between the lactate level and the NIH Stroke Scale score as well as a moderate inverse correlation between the lactate level and the SSS score (r=- 0. 42; p= 0. 032) one month after stroke.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{play an important}} role in neuronal damage and death that occurs in several neurodegenerative disorders, namely in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The observation that ROS neutralization may slow or reduce the neurodegenerative process associated with those pathologies stimulates the development of new drugs, more efficient and well tolerated, with antioxidant properties. Vinpocetine [14 -etoxicarbonyl- 3 alpha, 16 alpha-ethyl) - 14, 15 -eburnamine], a <b>vincamine</b> derivative, efficiently protects cells from ROS attack. Recently, the protective effect of vinpocetine was demonstrated using in vitro models of oxidative stress induced by the oxidant pair ascorbate/Fe 2 + and by synthetic peptides of the AD-associated b-amyloid protein (Abeta). Results obtained from these in vitro experiences support that additional clinical trials should be carried out using vinpocetine, or vinpocetine derivatives, in order to test its therapeutical or preventive effects in diseases where oxidative stress plays a crucial role...|$|E

Vinpocetine is safe and non-toxic with an amazing array of functional and structural benefits for improved health. Vinpocetine appears to improve a person's ability to acquire new memories and to restore memories that have been lost. Vinpocetine has several pharmacologic and biochemical actions, including stimulating cerebral vasodilation, increasing tolerance of cerebral tissue to hypoxic and ischemic insults, anticonvulsant activity, inhibitory effects on phosphodiesterase (PDE), improving hematologic flow properties, and inhibiting thrombocyte aggregation. It also appears to provide direct neuroprotective effects under in vitro and in vivo conditions. In a sense, Vinpocetine is Viagra ® for the brain. These effects appear {{to be related to}} the inhibition of voltage-dependent neuronal sodium channels, indirect inhibition of some molecular cascades initiated by the rise of intracellula...|$|E
40|$|Vinca minor {{alkaloid}} <b>vincamine,</b> {{has been}} used now for decades for prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases predisposing to development of dementia. Both vinpocetine and its main metabolite cis-apovincaminic acid (cAVA) exert a neuroprotective type of action. Bilateral N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -induced neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex of rat {{was used as a}} dementia model to confirm the neuroprotective action of these compounds in vivo. NMDA-lesioned rats were treated 60 min before lesion and throughout 3 postoperative days with a 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal dose of vinpocetine or cAVA. Behavioral tests started after termination of drug treatment and consisted of novel object recognition, social discrimination, and spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze, and spatial learning in the Morris water maze. At the end of behavioral testing brains were perfused with fixative {{and the size of the}} excitotoxic neuronal lesion and that of microglial activation around the lesion were assayed quantitatively on brain sections immunostained for neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) and integrin CD 11 b, respectively.

40|$|Vascular {{calcification}} is {{an active}} process of osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells; however, its definite mechanism remains unknown. Vinpocetine, a derivative of the alkaloid <b>vincamine,</b> has been demonstrated to inhibit the high glucose-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells; however, it remains unknown whether vinpocetine can affect the osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells. We hereby investigated the effect of vinpocetine on vascular calcification using a beta-glycerophosphate-induced cell model. Our results showed that vinpocetine significantly reduced the osteoblast-like phenotypes of vascular smooth muscle cells including ALP activity, osteocalcin, collagen type I, Runx 2 and BMP- 2 expression {{as well as the}} formation of mineralized nodule. Vinpocetine, binding to translocation protein, induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase and Akt and thus inhibited the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B into the nucleus. Silencing of translocator protein significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of vinpocetine on osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Taken together, vinpocetine may be a promising candidate for the clinical therapy of vascular calcification...|$|E
