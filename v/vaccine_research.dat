Other important advances that {{led to the development of}} polio vaccines were: the identification of three poliovirus serotypes (Poliovirus type 1 — PV1, or Mahoney; PV2, Lansing; and PV3, Leon); the finding that prior to paralysis, the virus must be present in the blood; and the demonstration that administration of antibodies in the form of gamma globulin protects against paralytic polio.|$|E

Others argue that, for compulsory vaccination to effectively prevent disease, there must be not only available vaccines and a population willing to immunize, but also sufficient ability to decline vaccination on grounds of personal belief.|$|E

25|$|Since CD4 {{receptor}} binding {{is the most}} obvious step in HIV infection, gp120 {{was among the first}} targets of HIV <b>vaccine</b> <b>research.</b> Efforts to develop HIV vaccines targeting gp120, however, have been hampered by the chemical and structural properties of gp120, which make it difficult for antibodies to bind to it. gp120 can also easily be shed {{from the surface of the}} virus and captured by T cells due to its loose binding with gp41. A conserved region in the gp120 glycoprotein that is involved in the metastable attachment of gp120 to CD4 has been identified and targeting of invariant region has been achieved with a broadly neutralising antibody, IgG1-b12.|$|E

25|$|As {{one of the}} {{fastest-growing}} research universities in the United States in the 21st century, Emory University has established a national reputation on the strength of the scholarly achievements of its faculty and students, its highly ranked professional schools, a long-term commitment to the arts and sciences, and the presence of more than seventy cutting-edge research centers that are addressing major social problems. Emory has extended its ties to the community, creating close links with Atlanta's neighborhoods, clinics, hospitals, nonprofit organizations, and boardrooms. To accommodate its growth, Emory has undergone a physical transformation that has increased classroom and research space. The latest additions to the campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, scientific computation, mathematics and science, <b>vaccine</b> <b>research,</b> and the performing arts.|$|E

500|$|Duke's faculty {{is among}} the most {{productive}} in the nation. Throughout the school's history, Duke researchers have made breakthroughs, including the biomedical engineering department's development of the world's first real-time, three-dimensional ultrasound diagnostic system and the first engineered blood vessels and stents. In 2015, Paul Modrich shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2012, Robert Lefkowitz along with Brian Kobilka, who is also a former affiliate, shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on cell surface receptors. [...] In the mechanical engineering department, Adrian Bejan developed the constructal theory, which explains the shapes that arise in nature. Duke has pioneered studies involving nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and complex systems in physics. In May 2006 Duke researchers mapped the final human chromosome, which made world news as the Human Genome Project was finally complete. Reports of Duke researchers' involvement in new AIDS <b>vaccine</b> <b>research</b> surfaced in June 2006. The biology department combines two historically strong programs in botany and zoology, while one of the divinity school's leading theologians is Stanley Hauerwas, whom Time named [...] "America's Best Theologian" [...] in 2001. The graduate program in literature boasts several internationally renowned figures, including Fredric Jameson, Michael Hardt, and Rey Chow, while philosophers Robert Brandon and Lakatos Award-winner Alexander Rosenberg contribute to Duke's ranking as the nation's best program in philosophy of biology, according to the Philosophical Gourmet Report.|$|E
2500|$|There are two serious {{technical}} {{problems associated with}} the development of a vaccine against H5N1. The first problem is this: seasonal influenza vaccines require a single injection of 15 μg haemagluttinin in order to give protection; H5 seems to evoke only a weak immune response and a large multicentre trial found that two injections of 90µg H5 given 28 days apart provided protection in only 54% of people [...] Even if it is considered that 54% is an acceptable level of protection, the world is currently capable of producing only 900million doses at a strength of 15 μg (assuming that all production were immediately converted to manufacturing H5 vaccine); if two injections of 90 μg are needed then this capacity drops to only 70million [...] [...] Trials using adjuvants such as alum, AS03, AS04 or MF59 to try and lower the dose of vaccine are urgently needed. [...] The second problem is this: there are two circulating clades of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia. <b>Vaccine</b> <b>research</b> has mostly been focused on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{issue that}} can lead {{researchers}} not to take part is whether the researcher would stand to gain any benefit from {{taking part in the}} experiment. [...] It is an ethical principle that volunteers must stand to gain some benefit from the research, even if that is only a remote future possibility of treatment being found for a disease that they only have a small chance of contracting. [...] Tests on experimental drugs are sometimes conducted on sufferers of an untreatable condition. [...] If the researcher does not have that condition then there can be no possible benefit to them personally. [...] For instance, Ronald C. Desrosiers in responding to why he did not test an AIDS vaccine he was developing on himself said that he was not at risk of AIDS so could not possibly benefit. [...] Against that, the early stages of testing a new drug are usually focused merely on the safety of the substance, rather than any benefits it may have. [...] Healthy individuals are required for this stage, not volunteers suffering from the target condition, so if the researcher is healthy, he or she is a potential candidate for testing. [...] An issue peculiar to AIDS <b>vaccine</b> <b>research</b> is that the test will leave HIV antibodies in the volunteers blood, causing the person to show HIV positive when tested even if they have never been in contact with an HIV carrier. [...] This could cause a number of social problems for the volunteers (including any self-testers) such as issues with life insurance.|$|E

In 1947, the university donated 15 acres of land to the United States Department of Health and Human Services {{for the construction of}} the CDC headquarters. The Emory University Prevention Research Center (EPRC) and Emory Center for Injury Control are funded by the CDC. Emory University's African Center of Excellence for Public Health Security, which seeks to improve preparedness and response to health threats in low-income countries, is a five-year, multimillion-dollar cooperative program with the CDC and International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI). The Emory University Center for Global Safe Water (CGSW), which conducts applied research, evaluation, and training to promote global health equity through universal access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, works in collaboration with the CDC. The Emory University Global Health Institute, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, partners with the CDC to enhance public health infrastructure in low-resource countries. The Emory University Hospital Isolation Unit and Quarantine Station was established by the CDC following the 2003 SARS outbreak. The isolation and treatment facilities at Emory University {{played a crucial role in}} ending the 2014 Ebola virus cases in the United States. CDC scientists and administrators hold memberships and frequently speak at Emory University's Vaccine Dinner Club (VDC), an association that holds monthly academic meetings to discuss and advance [...] <b>vaccine</b> <b>research.</b> In 2015, Emory was made a member of the CDC's Prevention Epicenters Program, a research program in which CDC’s Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) collaborates with academic investigators to conduct innovative infection control and prevention research.|$|E
