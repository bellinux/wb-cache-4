40|$|Among the {{machines}} which distribute fluid discharge in hydrostatic installations, valve distributors {{are the most}} important and differ in terms of a series of criteria related to the number of grooves, the distribution sketch, the nature of the switchboard etc. A <b>valve</b> <b>distributor</b> is comprised of a fixed part (the valve body), a mobile part (valve) and actuator elements. The operation of this type of distributors is based on the translation and shut down of the valve in the body in certain positions. These positions are fixed and the correspondence with certain paths from the body is specific for each type of distributor. This correspondence determines the transfer of the fluid according to the distribution sketch. The work presents the construction-functional analysis and CAD design in the CATIA graphic design environment of a basic distributor component – the valve, CAE analysis, with its finite element, as well as CAM simulation with the help of Sinumerik 840 D software and system control of machining operations and phases by cutting the valve...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} distributing fuel equally to a {{plurality}} of spray nozzles in a gas-turbine engine by means of balanced-diaphragm fuel distributors is presented. The experimental performance of three of eight possible distributor arrangements are discussed. An analysis of all eight arrangements is included. Criterions are given for choosing a fuel-distributor arrangement to meet specific fuel-system requirements of fuel-distribution accuracy, spray-nozzle pressure variations, and fuel-system pressures. Data obtained with a model of one distributor arrangement indicated a maximum deviation from perfect distribution of 3. 3 percent for a 44 to 1 range (19. 5 to 862 lb/hr) of fuel-flow rates. The maximum distributor pressure drop was 125 pounds per square inch. The method used to obtain the required wide range of flow control in the <b>distributor</b> <b>valves</b> consisted in varying {{the length of a}} constant-area flow path...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to digital pumps and motors with electronic controlled valves for each working chamber in positive displacement machines. The approach is focused on low speed operation of hydraulic pumps and motors. When applied to High Torque Low Speed radial piston units with eccentric shaft it offers increased efficiency, increased power capacity, more compact design, displacement control {{and a number of}} other control features. The proposed valve system has out-wards opening poppet-type valves on both the high- and low pressure side. This solution allows for a symmetric valve arrangement, enabling the units to operate as traditional motors/pumps with traditional <b>distributor</b> <b>valves</b> as well as to be used in simplified system layouts where full advantage is taken of the technology. This is opposed to current solutions having poppet type valves opening inwards on the low-pressure side and outwards on the high-pressure side, requiring dedicated high-and low pressure ports, also on motors. New opportunities and challenges are discussed, among which are four quadrant operation, displacement variation, start and stop, valve timing, overpressure protection and valve actuators...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a mixer {{is dependent on the}} size of the tank to be mixed, the characteristics of the waste, and the operating conditions. Waste tanks throughout the U. S. Department of Energy Complex require mixing and mobilization systems capable of (1) breaking up and suspending materials that are difficult to mix and pump, without introducing additional liquids into the tank; (2) complementing and augmenting the performance of other remotely operated and/or robotic waste retrieval systems; and (3) operating in tanks with various quantities of waste. The Oak Ridge Russian pulsating mixer pump (PMP) system was designed with the flexibility to permit deployment in a variety of cylindrical tanks. The PMP was installed at the Tanks Technology Cold Test Facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to assess the performance of the system over an extended range of operating conditions, including supply pressures up to 175 psig. Previously conducted cold tests proved the applicability of the PMP for deployment in ORNL gunite tank TH- 4. The previous testing and hot demonstrations had been limited to operating at air supply pressures of < 100 psig. The extended cold testing of the Russian PMP system showed that the system was capable of mobilizing waste simulants in tanks in excess of 20 -ft diam. The waste simulant used in these tests was medium-grain quartz sand. The system was successfully installed, checked out, and operated for 406 pulse discharge cycles. Only minor problems (i. e., a sticking air <b>distributor</b> <b>valve</b> and a few system lockups) were noted. Some improvements to the design of the air <b>distributor</b> <b>valve</b> may be needed to improve reliability. The air supply requirements of the PMP during the discharge cycle necessitated the operation of the system in single pulse discharge cycles to allow time for the air supply reservoir to recharge to the required pressure. During the test program, the system was operated with sand depths of 2, 4, and 4. 5 in.; at operating pressures from 100 to 175 psig; and elevations of 1 to 10 in. off the floor of the mock tank. The higher operating pressures resulted in larger values for the effective cleaning radius (ECR). The maximum observed ECR value, 144 in., occurred with the PMP elevated {approx} 4 in. off the floor of the mock tank; a 2 -in. layer of sand as the waste simulant, and 175 -psig air supply pressure. Tests were conducted both within the confines of the 20 -ft diam mock tank (confined) and with a portion of the tank wall removed (unconfined). The mixing mode during the confined tests changed from direct to indirect as the PMP was elevated above 4 in. off the floor of the mock tank. The direct mode of mixing pushes solids toward the wall of the waste tank, while the indirect mode tends to push solids toward the center of the tank. The mixing mode did not change during tests conducted in the unconfined tank. Changing the mode of mixing from direct to indirect should have a beneficial effect on the amount of solids mobilized and retrieved from a waste tank...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} hybrid control {{employs a}} primary expansion valve that provides {{most of the}} pressure drop, while small secondary balancing <b>valves</b> in the <b>distributor</b> lines to the evaporator circuits adjust the refrigerant flow to provide equal circuit exit superheats. This paper presents experimental results for application of hybrid control of expansion valves to a 5 -ton R 410 A domestic heat pump. Baseline performance data was taken with an electronic expansion valve (EXV) {{to determine the best}} possible performance without using individual circuit flow control. After that, secondary balancing valves were inserted into the distributor lines to complete the hybrid control scheme. The same tests as done with the EXV were repeated to determine the achievable performance improvement. Ice-up tests at high outdoor humidity were conducted to determine the influence of the control scheme on frost build up and system performance. For repeatable results, additional tests with a partially blocked evaporator coil were conducted. It was found that during operation with the EXV, even with a clean coil, substantial maldistribution occurred leading to individual circuits with significantly different refrigerant exit conditions. With the EXV control scheme maintaining an overall exit superheat, some circuits had two-phase refrigerant at the exit while other circuits had a high degree of superheat. As a result, the evaporation temperature was lower than would occur for more even distribution leading to a performance penalty. In addition, the maldistribution resulted in uneven ice build-up during the ice-up test. The tests with the hybrid control scheme indicated that the maldistribution can be avoided and better overall performance achieved. Similar tests as for the domestic heat pump have been conducted for a 3 -ton large room cooling system; refer to companion paper Bach et al. (2012) ...|$|R
40|$|The hybrid control, as {{proposed}} by Kim et al. (2008), employs a primary expansion valve that provides most of the pressure drop, while small secondary balancing <b>valves</b> in the <b>distributor</b> lines to the circuits of the evaporator adjust the refrigerant flow to provide equal circuit exit superheats. This paper shows the experimental results {{for the application of}} the hybrid control of expansion valves for a 3 -ton R 404 A large room cooling system. Data with the inbuilt expansion device, a pressure compensated TXV, was taken for a limited number of tests. Baseline data with an electronic expansion valve was taken to determine the best possible performance without using individual circuit flow control. After that, secondary balancing valves were inserted into the distributor lines to complete the hybrid control scheme. The same tests as done with the EXV were repeated to determine the achievable performance improvement. Ice-up tests at high indoor room humidity were conducted with all control schemes to determine the influence of the control scheme on frost build up and system performance. For repeatable results, additional tests with partially blocked evaporator coil were conducted with the hybrid and EXV control scheme. It was found that for TXV and EXV, even with a clean coil, substantial maldistribution occurs. This maldistribution lead to different usage of the individual circuits in terms of area fraction used for evaporation of, and area fraction used for superheating of refrigerant. With the EXV control scheme, the evaporation temperature had to be decreased to obtain sufficient superheat on the circuits that did not feed liquid into the suction header in order to evaporate the liquid of the circuits that fed liquid into the suction header. In addition, this resulted in uneven ice build-up and very poor controllability, which was especially noticeable as severe hunting when using the TXV in the ice-up test. With the hybrid control scheme, the surface usage for evaporation on all circuits was larger than 75 % for most of the time, which resulted in a higher evaporation temperature and by that in a greater COP and larger capacity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{a study of}} the performance of an industrial low-speed high-torque hydrostatic drive system. This type of hydrostatic transmission is commonly used in continuous operation {{in a wide range of}} heavy-duty drive applications. In many applications the transmissions have to compete with e. g. electromechanical drives, such as DC or AC electric motors combined with gearboxes. In such situations, energy efficiency is a key selection criterion in that even a small increase in the efficiency of high power industrial drives would give substantial savings. Apart from efficiency, lifetime and reliability requirements are important parameters for industrial drive systems, as unplanned stops in industrial working processes can be very costly. The work presented in this thesis is primarily focused on analysing the efficiency behaviour in the transmission, both on the system level and on the component level. Attention has also been paid to lifetime issues, with special emphasis on wear occurring in a sliding contact in a radial piston hydraulic motor. In Paper A the distribution of power losses in a variable axial piston swash plate pump is investigated. The pump under study is commonly used in stationary industrial hydrostatic transmission systems. The churning losses in the pump have been estimated experimentally by measurements in a test rig. The leakage flow and the power losses in the contacts between the piston and the cylinder and between the slipper and the swash plate respectively were simulated with the help of the simulation tool CASPAR. For the pump studied, the churning losses are significant under the operating conditions typically occurring in industrial drive applications. The simulation results indicate that the leakage to the pump casing mainly originates from the gaps between the pistons and their respective cylinders and between the slippers and swash plate. The aim of Paper B is to study two sliding contacts inside a radial piston hydraulic motor and investigate their influence on the torque and power losses. Moreover, it is investigated whether and when a change in the lubrication regime can be expected in these contacts. This is accomplished by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies, with a special focus on two lubricated sliding contacts: the <b>distributor</b> <b>valve</b> contact and the piston/cam roller contact. The theoretical analysis of the contacts indicates, among other things, that the piston/cam roller contact can enter the mixed lubrication regime at low motor speeds. At low running speeds, an increased wear rate has been noted in the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in a radial piston hydraulic motor. Paper C describes a comparative investigation into different hydraulic fluids' friction properties and wear protection abilities. To simulate the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in the hydraulic motor, tests were performed in a reciprocating test rig where the contact geometry was of the cylinder-plate type. In the model test a synthetic ester aimed at meeting the conditions in water turbine applications received a top ranking regarding both friction and wear protection properties.
