40|$|An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} attention has been drawn to international students’ academic development {{in the context of}} studying abroad; however, few studies shed light on students’ studying and lived experiences outside of school. This thesis explores how technology can enhance Chinese international students’ informal acquisition of second language (L 2) and their lived experiences in Canada. Through a qualitative case study, I describe what language difficulties newly arrived Chinese international students encounter, and how they cope with those language difficulties through technology-assisted informal L 2 learning. Data sources include in-depth interviews and follow-up interviews, participants’ personal narratives, and researchers’ reflective journals. Theories of multiliteracies, basic interpersonal communicative skills and cognitive academic language proficiency distinction, as well as a communicative competence framework have been adopted as the theoretical frameworks for data analysis. The findings show that newly arrived Chinese international students’ major language difficulties includes lack <b>of</b> non-academic <b>vocabulary,</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> sociocultural differences, and unfamiliarity with informal context embedded phrases. To overcome these language difficulties, they creatively design informal L 2 learning experiences through the combinational use of technology tools. The results have significant implications for newly arrived Chinese international students’ informal L 2 learning...|$|R
40|$|The study aims to {{find out}} students’ {{difficulties}} in speaking English, the causes of and solutions for the difficulties in one senior high school in Tangerang, Banten. This study employed a qualitative research design, implementing characteristics of a case study. The data were obtained through classroom observations, questionnaires and interviews. In terms of findings, the study revealed that students’ difficulties in speaking English were caused by both psychological and linguistic factors. The psychological factors include fear of making mistake, shyness, anxiety, lack of confidence and lack of motivation. With regard to the linguistic factors, aspects like lack <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary,</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> grammatical pattern and incorrect pronunciation have also been sources of students’ difficulties in speaking English. This finding suggests that the teachers should be more aware of their students’ difficulty to speak in English class. This also indicates {{that it is important}} for teachers to understand well their students psychologically {{and at the same time}} make an attempt to find a better way of teaching that encourages the students to speak in English class. All these may also reflect the urgency for teachers to teach explicitly important aspects of speaking in the future to overcome the problems or difficulties encountered by the students in speaking English so that they have a better command in speaking English...|$|R

40|$|Context. There {{are huge}} disparities between {{children}} for the acquisition of written language’s basic skills, with important consequences in terms of literacy development :in 2015, only 25 % {{of students in the}} 4 th primary had good reading skills in French-speaking Belgium (FW-B portal). Several risk factors can explain those reading difficulties :a language delay (Catts, Fey, Tomblin, & Zhang, 2002), a low socioeconomic background, and/or the school’s language as a second language for the child (Baye, 2010). Oral language and pre-literacy skills predict abilities in written language and can be stimulated thanks to storytelling and dialogic reading’s techniques (Justice, 2007). Language’s targets (such as <b>vocabulary,</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the story, phonological awareness and print knowledge), are presented in an explicit way during dialogic reading sessions and can improve the first acquisitions in written language (Justice and Kaderavek, 2004). Our study aims at examining whether dialogic reading sessions can improve language and pre-literacy skills of children with low economic background. Method. We recruited 8 schools from Brussels’city center, these schools benefited from “positive discrimination”. Children were randomly assigned to the control group (N= 84 from 9 classes of kindergarten), and experimental group (N= 177 from 10 classes of kindergarten). The teachers of the experimental group carried on 30 sessions of dialogic reading during a period of 3 months for their preschoolers (3 sessions a week). Those sessions were aiming at stimulation <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary,</b> story <b>understanding,</b> phonological awareness and print references (as specifics languages targets). The control group benefited from no specific intervention. All children were individually evaluated through pre- and post-intervention by standardized language tests. Results. Children from the experimental group showed significant differences in post-intervention for vocabulary, morphosyntax, phonological awareness and print knowledge. The improvement <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> was particularly and significantly beneficial for children who present a language delay. We observe the same tendency for morphosyntax. Conclusion. We experimented a new way of using dialogic reading techniques in the classrooms with “positive discrimination” from Brussels’city center. We demonstrated that this new intervention can positively enhance language development, including for children presenting a language delay. Dialogic reading allow them to improve their language skills and to « catch up » with their peers who do not present the same language delay. In this way, we can hope a better literacy development for these children. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
500|$|The strongest {{element of}} style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee's talent for narration, which {{in an early}} review in Time was called [...] "tactile brilliance". Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, [...] "Harper Lee has a {{remarkable}} gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition." [...] Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives. This narrative method allows Lee to tell a [...] "delightfully deceptive" [...] story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition. However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout's preternatural <b>vocabulary</b> and depth <b>of</b> <b>understanding.</b> Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic Granville Hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life.|$|R
