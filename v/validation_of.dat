5|$|After {{the flight}} test {{demonstration}} and <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> the prototypes, on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the USAF Donald Rice announced the YF-22 {{as the winner}} of the ATF competition. The YF-23 design was considered stealthier and faster, while the YF-22 was more maneuverable. The aviation press speculated that the YF-22 was also more adaptable to the U.S. Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992, the Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{forecasting}} {{is a way}} by {{some scientists}} are using to predict climate change. In 1997 the prediction division of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University began generating seasonal climate forecasts on a real-time basis. To produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed, including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> each model's accuracy level in simulating interannual climate variability.|$|E

5|$|Few Privy Counsellors are {{required}} to attend regularly. The settled practice is that day-to-day meetings of the Council are attended by four Privy Counsellors, usually the relevant Minister to the matters pertaining. The Cabinet Minister holding the office of Lord President of the Council, currently the Rt Hon. Andrea Leadsom , invariably presides. Under Britain's modern conventions of parliamentary government and constitutional monarchy, every order made in Council is drafted by a Government Department and has already {{been approved by the}} Minister responsible—thus actions taken by the Queen-in-Council are formalities required for <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> each measure.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup. Whether it {{should be seen as}} distinct from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study, and there are questions about the empirical <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E

Its Saturn IB was allocated to the dual mission, now redesignated AS-205/208 or AS-258, planned for August 1967. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were promoted to the prime AS-258 crew, and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the Apollo 1 backup crew.|$|E
40|$|The present {{review article}} focus on {{introduction}} and general overview on process validation in pharmaceutical industry. The word validation simply means “Assessment <b>of</b> <b>validation</b> or action <b>of</b> proving effectiveness”. The process is developed {{in such a}} way that the required parameters are achieved and it ensures that the output of the process will consistently meet the required parameters during routine production, the process is validated. The process validation process parameters are derived from the specifications for the device, component or other entity to be produced by the process. A manufacturer can assure through careful design of the device, processes, process controls and packaging that all manufactured units will meet specifications and have uniform quality. However, in-process and finished product testing still play an important role in assuring that products meet specifications Validation is defined as a collection and evaluation of data, from the process design stage through commercial production, which establishes scientific evidence that a process is capable of consistently delivering quality product. The validation protocol includes inventory control and equipment inspection in the preliminary steps and in-process controls in the subsequent steps. Process controls are mandatory in good manufacturing practices (GMP). The goal of a quality system is to consistently produce products that are fit for their intended use.

5|$|Christian {{missions}} established Western {{educational institutions}} in the Protectorates. Under Britain's policy of indirect rule and <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> Islamic tradition, the Crown did not encourage the operation of Christian missions in the northern, Islamic part of the country. Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education. By independence in 1960, regional differences in modern educational access were marked. The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present day. Imbalances between North and South were expressed in Nigeria's political life as well. For instance, northern Nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936 whilst {{in other parts of}} Nigeria slavery was abolished soon after colonialism.|$|E
5|$|Within a decade, the {{collection}} had expanded to 7,000 traditional and modern objects from across all of Africa. Under Walker's tenure, the museum expanded its contemporary art collection, opening a permanent gallery in 1997. That year, photographer Constance Stuart Larrabee gave the museum 3,000 photographs from South Africa. In 2005, the museum received the Walt Disney-Tishman Collection of 525 works spanning most major African art styles and 75 cultures. The acquisition was a <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> the museum's status, given the other institutions who vied for {{the collection}}. The museum's library also grew upon joining the Smithsonian, from 3,000 to 30,000 volumes in visual arts, anthropology, cooking, history, religion, and travel, especially works published in Africa. It now contains 50,000 volumes.|$|E
