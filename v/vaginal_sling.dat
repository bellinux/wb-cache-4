40|$|Introduction: Female {{urethral}} stricture secondary to erosion by suburethral sling is an unfrequent problem of difficult solution. Ventral vaginal rotation flaps or buccal mucosa dorsal grafts are not useful because {{this type of}} stricture is very proximal (close to the bladder neck) and the vagina is thinned. We present our experience to manage this problem using excision of disease urethral tract, associated to bladder mucosa flap and <b>vaginal</b> <b>sling</b> using transverse vaginal flap to repair the weakened vaginal wall. Material and methods: Three females with {{urethral stricture}} secondary to urethral erosion of their sling were treated with a technique of combined urethroplasty with bladder flap and vaginal reinforcement with pediculated vaginal flap transferred in a mini-sling fashion. Two of the patients suffered chronic urinary retention and preoperative placement of urethral catheter was not possible. The patients were evaluated 12, 36 and 55 months after surgery, respectively. Results: Surgery was performed without complications. Results were satisfactory in all the patients, reaching good micturition postoperative caliber and being without incontinence at follow-up. Conclusion: Patients with suburethral erosion by a synthetic sling and secondary severe urethral stricture need total extirpation of the mesh and complete reconstruction of the urethra-vaginal septum. Tension-free urethral suture and use of <b>vaginal</b> <b>sling</b> with the technique here described are two useful technical tips for this problem. 0. 455 JCR (2011) Q 4, 67 / 73 Urology & nephrolog...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Modest {{long-term}} success {{is one of}} the most disappointing issues facing patients undergoing anti-incontinence surgery. Herein we introduce a novel surgical modification of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>sling</b> to address the mechanisms that may lead to a reduction in the success rate at the long-term follow-up. Materials and Methods: Twenty-three female patients with mean age of 48. 2 years (range, 22 - 73 years) underwent anti-incontinence surgery to correct their stress urinary incontinence (SUI) between August 2006 and January 2008. The in situ anterior vaginal wall sling, reinforced with equi-size monofilament polypropylene tape, was used as an anti-incontinence surgical procedure. The mean follow-up period was 30. 2 months (range, 24 - 38 months). Results: The surgical technique was successful in 22 patients (95. 65 %); 20 of them were cured and 2 patients showed clinical improvements. Urinary retention was observed in one patient (4. 34 %), which was resolved after decreasing the tension of the suspension sutures. No significant post-voiding residue was detected postoperatively. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness and a low risk of urethral erosion, due to the presence of intervening vaginal mucosa, are important advantages of this technique. Long-term success is expected, because relaxation of the non-tension-free suspension sutures and dislocation of the midurethral sling are less likely.

40|$|CONTEXT: There {{are several}} controversies about {{which is the}} best form of {{surgical}} treatment for stress urinary incontinence in women. The <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling</b> in its original and modified form were presented by Raz as new options for treatment of these conditions, but {{there is a lack of}} comparative clinical trials using both techniques. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of the original and the modified <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling.</b> DESIGN: A comparative, prospective, non-randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Public and private health care units (Urology Division, Faculty of Medicine of the ABC Foundation, and Universidade Federal de São Paulo / Escola Paulista de Medicina). PARTICIPANTS: Twenty patients with anatomical and intrinsic sphincter deficiency stress urinary incontinence were surgically treated for evaluating the initial results of the <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling,</b> from February 5, 1994, to June 27, 1996. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were divided into two groups. Group A (n = 10) were treated with the original <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling.</b> Group B (n = 10) were treated with the modified <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling.</b> Both groups were statistically similar according to clinical and urodynamic parameters. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Cure and complication rates. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 19 to 43 months (median = 28) for group A. The overall cure rate was 70 %. Fifty per cent of the patients had urinary retention of 7 to 35 days. There were no major complications. Follow-up ranged from 14 to 26 months (median = 18) for Group B. The cure rate was 80 %.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} the efficacy, safety and urodynamic {{effects of the}} Martius flap and the anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling</b> in treating post-birth trauma {{in the form of}} urethra-vaginal fistula (UVF) associated with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Patients and methodsBetween July 2006 and August 2011, 19 patients underwent repair of UVF by interposition of a Martius flap and correction of associated SUI by a modified anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling.</b> The procedure was carried out 3 – 17 (mean 7) months after post-birth trauma. Pre-operative evaluation consisted of history, voiding diary, physical examination, routine laboratory work-up, abdominopelvic ultrasonography, intravenous urography (IVU), and cystourethrography. The patients were followed up for a mean of 34 months. Follow-up included history, physical examination, urine analysis and pelvic ultrasonography for the assessment of residual urine. Urodynamic evaluation was performed at 3 months post-operatively. ResultsNone of the patients developed recurrence of UVF. SUI was corrected in 16 patients (84 %). In the post-operative period, 3 patients (16 %) complained of an overactive bladder (OAB) with urodynamic detrusor overactivity (DO) and an obstructed flow. These problems were managed successfully using anticholinergics and urethral dilation. Three patients (16 %) complained of mild SUI, but refused further management. Within 3 years following the intervention, 3 patients complained of a recurrence of SUI which was managed successfully by a rectus sheath sling. ConclusionsPatients with a post-birth trauma in the form of UVF should be examined intra-operatively for the presence of associated SUI following correction of UVF. The use of the Martius flap and anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling</b> in treating such patients is safe, efficient and reproducible. An anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling</b> should be avoided in distal UVF to avoid recurrence of SUI...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the outcome of an innovative, minimally invasive sling technique with autologous tissue in women with concomitant incontinence and anterior vaginal wall prolapse (AVWP). Materials and Methods : Fifty-six women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) or mixed urinary incontinence and AVWP were randomly assigned into two groups: In Group A (26 patients), anterior colporrhaphy (Kelly placation) and sling placement using a strip of anterior vaginal wall were performed, and in Group B (30 patients), transvaginal mesh correction of AVWP and tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) insertion (retropubic - craniocaudal route) using polypropylene mesh were carried out. The patients were followed-up for over 18 months and were assessed objectively using a 48 h frequency-volume chart, a 48 h pad test and a standardized stress test. Related surgical complications and outcomes were recorded and compared. Results: Surgical cure rates for Group A and Group B at the first (3 days) and last (18 months) post-operative visits were 62 % and 84 %; and 54 %, and 72 %, respectively (P = 0. 09 and 0. 31). Complications occurred in 9 patients (44 %) of Group B, but only 3 patients (12 %) in Group A. Conclusion: <b>Vaginal</b> <b>sling</b> surgery using an anterior vaginal wall strip can improve SUI and in comparison with propylene mesh is associated with lower complication rates. Although, the surgical success rate of this technique is lower than T-Sling, larger studies with selected patients will help assess the suitable patients for this pelvic reconstructive surgery...|$|E

A qualidade de vida foi avaliada com o QuestionÃrio de Impacto de IncontinÃncia e o InventÃrio de Estresse Urogenital, formas reduzidas. CASUÃSTICA e MÃTODO:Durante o perÃodo de marÃo de 2001 a dezembro de 2002, quatorze pacientes foram submetidas Ã cirurgia de correÃÃo por tÃcnica de sling vaginal e doze pacientes realizaram uretrocistopexia de Burch. RESULTADOS: Com um seguimento pÃs-operatÃrio com mediana de nove meses (variaÃÃo de quatro a 22 meses) observou-se uma taxa de cura objetiva em vinte e cinco pacientes (96, 2 %), taxa de cura subjetiva em dezessete pacientes (65, 4 %), tendo vinte e cinco pacientes (96, 2 %) relatado cura ou melhora. Observaram-se no pÃs-operatÃrio trÃs casos de urgÃncia miccional, pacientes que realizaram cirurgia de Burch, duas pacientes com padrÃo miccional obstrutivo que haviam realizado cirurgia de sling e uma paciente que apresentou piora do quadro da incontinÃncia.

A paridade variou de zero a oito partos vaginais com mediana de trÃs partos. O tempo de internaÃÃo variou de dois a quatro dias com mediana de trÃs dias. No momento da alta hospitalar vinte e duas pacientes (84, 6 %) apresentaram resÃduo urinÃrio menor ou igual a 100 ml. Quatro pacientes apresentaram volume {{residual}} urinÃrio maior que 100 ml, uma que realizou cirurgia de Burch e trÃs que realizaram cirurgia de sling. A pressÃo de perda aos esforÃos no prÃ-operatÃrio apresentou mediana de 95 cmH 20 (variaÃÃo de 40 a 140). No pÃs-operatÃrio apresentou mediana de 150 cm H 20 (variaÃÃo de 60 a 213).

OBJECTIVE- to evaluate {{the impact on the}} quality of life of 26 patients with stress urodynamic incontinence that realized <b>vaginal</b> <b>sling</b> and urethrocystopexia of Burch. Quality of life was assessed with the Questionnaire of Impact of Incontinence and the Inventory of Urogenital stress, short forms. METHODS -During the period of March of 2001 to December of 2002 14 patients (group 1) realized <b>vaginal</b> <b>sling</b> and 12 patients (group 2) realized urethrocystopexia of Burch. RESULTS- After a median follow up of nine months (variation of four to 22 months) it was observed an objective cure rate of 96, 2 %,twenty five patients, a subjective cure rate of 65, 4 %, seventeen patients, twenty five patients related cure or improvement after the surgery. At the postoperative periodo it were observed three cases of de novo urgency, patients that realized surgery of Burch, two patients with obstructive urinary dysfunction that made sling and one patient that presented with worsening of incontinence. Some demographic characteristics of the patients : the median age of the patients were of 56 years (variation of 41 to 77 years), the median of the index of corporal mass was of 25 (variation of 20 the 34). The vaginal parity varied from zero to eight childbirths with a median of three childbirths. The hospital stay time varied from two to four days with a median of three days. At the moment of delivery twenty two patients (84, 6 %) presented with urinary residue equal or less than 100 ml. Four patients presented with urinary residue greater than 100 ml, one of them had done surgery of Burch and three had done <b>vaginal</b> <b>sling.</b> The median leak point pressure at the preoperative period was of 95 cmH 20 (variation of 40 to 140). At the postoperative period it was of 150 cm H 20 (variation of 60 the 213). The median score of the Questionnaire of impact of incontinence showed statistically significant difference (p= 0, 00) between the pre and postoperative period, median of 50 with variation of 10 the 95 and a median of zero with variation of zero to 81 respectively. The median score of the inventory of urogenital stress at the preoperative period was of 53 (variation of 17 the 94), after the surgery it was of six (variation of 16 the 35) wich was statistically significant (p= 0, 07). The coefficient of the questionnaire of impact of incontinence presented with excellent improvement in twenty-three patients (88, 5 %), moderate improvement in one patient (3, 8 %) and worsening in two patients (7, 7 %). The coefficient of the inventory of urogenital stress presented with excellent improvement in twenty-two patients (84, 6 %), moderate improvement in two patients (7, 7 %) and worsening in two patients (7, 7 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) compared with other surgical treatments for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and with other tension-free midurethral slings. METHODS: A systematic {{review of the literature}} was performed in January 2007 using MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. The searches used both "MeSH" and "free text" protocols. Meta-analysis was conducted using the Review Manager software 4. 2 (Cochrane Collaboration). RESULTS: Our search identified 37 randomized controlled trials. According to the Jadad score, the quality of the evaluated studies was limited in most papers. TVT outperformed Burch colposuspension in terms of postoperative continence rates (odds ratio [OR] from 0. 38 to 0. 59, according to the different end points), whereas success rates were similar after TVT and pubovaginal slings. Comparing TVT to the other retropubic tension-free midurethral <b>vaginal</b> <b>slings,</b> TVT was more efficacious than both intravaginal slingplasty (IVS; OR = 0. 47; p = 0. 007) and suprapubic arc (SPARC; OR from 0. 53 to 0. 56 according to the different evaluated end points). Indeed, the available data suggest similar efficacy for retropubic and trans-obturator tapes both in terms of subjective (OR = 0. 98; p = 0. 92) and objective (OR = 0. 81; p = 0. 34) cure rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed that TVT outperformed Burch colposuspension; efficacies of TVT and pubovaginal sling were similar. TVT was more efficacious than IVS and SPARC, whereas retropubic and trans-obturator tapes showed overlapping cure rates.

30|$|The {{results of}} this series should be {{considered}} in light of its limitations. There was no control arm as it was not easy to identify patients who had their surgery on two sittings. Several published studies did not include a control arm [4, 6 – 8, 13], and even the ones that included a control arm did not actually have a proper one. Some compared patients having TVT sling insertion alongside concomitant surgery to those having TVT sling insertion alone [3, 9, 11, 12, 14], and one compared them to those having the concomitant surgery without TVT sling insertion [10]. A proper comparison would be comparing single-sitting versus two-sitting approach to those in need of TVT sling insertion alongside other gynaecological procedures. The series, as well most published studies [3 – 14], only looked at the safety and effectiveness of the TVT sling complications and outcome rather than those of the other gynaecological procedure(s) carried out at the same time. The other side of the comparison, for example looking at hysterectomy alone versus hysterectomy and TVT sling insertion, is also needed to complete the picture. Only one study looked at mesh repair for pelvic organ prolapse with or without concomitant tension-free <b>vaginal</b> tape <b>sling</b> insertion [10].|$|R

The latest innovation in sling therapy is the use of minislings, which are short tape mesh implants inserted through a single <b>vaginal</b> incision; these <b>slings</b> may be placed in an office setting. Outcomes data are either lacking or suggest a considerable decrement of effectiveness of unstabilized minislings over full-length slings; however, the short-term efficacy of a stabilized, adjustable minisling is 97 %.

30|$|Patients having tension-free <b>vaginal</b> tape (TVT) <b>sling</b> {{insertion}} for urodynamic {{stress incontinence}} {{may also have}} other gynaecological condition(s) that necessitate additional gynaecological surgery. This particularly applies to pelvic organ prolapse {{as there is a}} recognised association between the two conditions [1]. Less commonly, patients may have other problems that require surgical management, such as abdominal hysterectomy for heavy periods [2]. In such situations, there is a choice between performing both procedures at the same time or in two separate settings. Although there are published reports on TVT sling insertions alongside other gynaecological procedures, all of these reports are limited to vaginal management of pelvic organ prolapse and vaginal or laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy [3 – 14]. Of these studies, one looked at prophylactic insertion of TVT sling insertion for occult stress incontinence {{at the same time as}} having vaginal surgery for severe (grade 3 or more) pelvic organ prolapse [3] and two included patients with urodynamic as well as occult stress incontinence [10, 13].|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>slings</b> (AVWS) {{have been}} used for decades in the {{treatment}} of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The main drawback of using the vaginal wall as a sling is its tendency to weaken and stretch over the course of years. The use of synthetic tapes for the treatment of SUI is effective but costly. For patients who cannot afford synthetic tapes, we describe the preliminary results of a modified AVWS technique for the treatment of SUI types II and III. Patients and Methods: In this series, a modification of the AVWS was applied in 35 female patients with SUI. A fortified and rolled flap is used to provide compression and support of the urethra. The vaginal mucosal surface of the flap is cauterized and two diagonal sutures are placed across it. The flap is then rolled on itself with a running 2 / 0 vicryl suture. Two sutures attached to both ends are passed retropubically to the anterior abdominal wall and tied over the rectus sheath. Results: All 35 female patients had type II/III SUI. After a median follow up of 43 months, 91 % of the patients were dry or used 0 - 1 pad per day. Only one patient suffered from transient retention for one week post-operatively. Conclusion: This is a simple method to reinforce vaginal wall flaps. It could offer a durable and effective option for the treatment of SUI in patients who can not afford synthetic tapes. Long-term follow up is required to evaluate the durability of the procedure. Key Words: Stress urinary incontinence, vaginal wall, slin...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{to analyze}} the {{surgical}} results after <b>slings</b> with <b>vaginal</b> wall, performed by the Urogynecology and Vaginal Surgery Sector of UNIFESP/EPM, {{for the treatment of}} incontinent women with hypermobility of the bladder neck, who show great risk of surgery failure with other techniques or in those with intrinsic sphincteric deficiency (ISD) and, also, surgery recurrence. Methods: we studied 21 patients submitted to surgery in order to correct urinary incontinence by the <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling</b> technique, in the period from December 1997 to February 1999, with postoperative follow-up which varied between 1 and 14 months (average 8. 2). The mean age of patients was 56 years (39 to 77 years), 15 (71. 4 %) were in menopause and 6 (28. 6 %) in menacme. All patients were evaluated before the surgery through medical interview, physical examination, ultrasound and urodynamic study, the grade of urinary loss being high in 66. 7 % and moderate in 33. 3 % of the patients. All patients showed hypermobility of the bladder neck (more than 10 mm) and 12 patients had previous surgery to correct the urinary incontinence. Regarding the urodinamic study, the patients manifested urinary loss with maximum pressure of urethral closure (MPUC) varying from 20 to 124 cmH 2 O (average 55. 2) and Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) varying from 18 to 128 cmH 2 O (average 60. 3). The indications of surgery were: ISD (11 patients [...] 52. 4 %), obesity (5 patients [...] 23. 8 %), ISD and obesity (2 patients [...] 9. 5 %), surgery recurrence (2 patients [...] 9. 5) and ISD and first grade womb prolapse (1 patient [...] 4. 8 %). Results: as complications, 6 patients (28. 6 %) showed temporary urinary retention after surgery, 1 patient (4. 8 %) infection in the urinary tract, 1 patient (4. 8 %) presence of polypropylene suture in the vagina, 1 patient (4. 8 %) infection of the surgery wound, 4 patients (19 %) developed urgency/incontinence, 1 (4. 8 %) urgency and 1 (4. 8 %) difficulty in urinating (high postvoiding residue). The grade of the patients' satisfaction was satisfactory, with 15 patients (71. 4 %) referring cure, 3 patients (14. 3 %) improvement, in 2 patients (9. 5 %) the urinary loss remained unchanged and in 1 patient (4. 8 %) the urinary loss got worse. Conclusions: the <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling</b> surgery is efficient for the treatment of specific cases of stress urinary incontinence, emphasizing intrinsic urethral sphincteric incompetence, surgery recurrence and predisposing factors to failure of other techniques.

Métodos: foram avaliadas 21 pacientes submetidas à cirurgia para correção de incontinência urinária pela técnica de <b>sling</b> <b>vaginal,</b> no período de dezembro de 1997 a fevereiro de 1999, com seguimento pós-operatório que variou de 1 a 14 meses (média de 8, 2). A média de idade das pacientes foi de 56 anos (39 a 77 anos), sendo que 15 (71, 4 %) encontravam-se na menopausa e 6 (28, 6 %) no menacme. Todas as pacientes foram avaliadas antes da cirurgia por meio de anamnese, exame clínico, estudo ultra-sonográfico e urodinâmico, sendo o grau de perda urinária acentuado em 66, 7 % e moderado em 33, 3 % das pacientes. Todas as pacientes apresentavam hipermobilidade da junção uretrovesical (superior a 10 mm) e 12 pacientes apresentavam cirurgia prévia para correção de incontinência urinária. Ao estudo urodinâmico, as pacientes apresentavam perda urinária com pressão máxima de fechamento uretral (PMFU) variando de 20 a 124 cmH 2 O (média de 55, 2) e Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) variando de 18 a 128 cmH 2 O (média de 60, 3). As indicações das cirurgias foram: defeito esfincteriano (11 pacientes - 52, 4 %), obesidade (5 pacientes - 23, 8 %), defeito esfincteriano e obesidade (2 pacientes - 9, 5 %), recidiva cirúrgica (2 pacientes - 9, 5 %) e defeito esfincteriano e prolapso uterino de 1 º grau (1 paciente - 4, 8 %).

In {{an effort to reduce}} this potential morbidity, we have devised a technique which provides the same suburethral support as a standard anterior <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>sling</b> (AVWS), but without a vaginal or suprapubic incision. We describe this minimally invasive technique. Methods: From April 1998 to February 1999, 85 women underwent an incisionless suburethral fascial sling procedure. A transvaginal bone drill was used to place a bone anchor loaded with # 1 prolene suture into the inferior aspect of the pubic bone {{on either side of the}} urethra. A subepithelial tunnel was created at the level of the bladder neck. A 2 x 7 cm segment of cadaveric fascia lata was placed through the subepithelial tunnel. The sutures were passed through the fascia 5 mm from either edge, effectively creating a 6. 0 cm sling. Finally, the sutures are tied up to the pubic symphysis. Results: Follow-up was via a self-administered questionnaire and patient interview. Recurrent SUI was noted in 2 / 85 (3 %). New onset urge incontinence was present in 4 / 85 (5 %). Permanent urinary retention has not occurred in either group. All procedures were performed on an outpatient basis and no operative complications occurred. Conclusions: Early results for the incisionless sling compare favorably with the long term results for the AVWS. This minimally invasive approach has thus far not been associated with any significant complications. Elimination of the vaginal and suprapubic incisions has not compromised efficacy, and appears to reduce the incidence of urge incontinence. Long term follow-up will establish the lasting efficacy of this novel surgical technique...|$|R
40|$|ABSTR ACT: Urinary {{incontinence}} {{in women}} is quite prevalent today and management can be costly. Urinary incontinence can be minimal or quite bothersome, limiting {{activities of daily}} living. It is subdivided into urgency urinary incontinence, stress urinary incontinence, and mixed urinary incontinence. As such, treatment can vary immensely depending on the clinical presentations, ranging from behavioral modification to medicinal thera-pies to surgical procedures. First-line management for all urinary incontinence includes lifestyle and behavioral modifications. Historically, treatment options for urgency urinary incontinence were predominantly antimuscarinics, while more recent therapies include oral beta- 3 agonist administration, sacral neuromodulation, onabotulinumtoxinA injection, and posterior tibial nerve stimulation. Stress urinary incontinence can be treated {{with a variety of}} urethral bulking agent injections or sling-based procedures using mesh, autologous fascia, or cadaveric fascia, as well as urethral intrasphincteric injec-tions of autologous muscle-derived cells in new clinical trials. These recent advances that have been developed to help better curb urinary incontinence are discussed in this review.

40|$|The {{advent of}} the mid-urethral sling (MUS) 15 years ago has {{drastically}} changed the surgical management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Both retropubic and transobturator MUS can {{be placed in the}} ambulatory setting with excellent results. The tension-free <b>vaginal</b> tape (TVT) <b>sling</b> has the most robust and long-term data, but more recent literature suggests that the transobturator tape sling may offer comparable efficacy in appropriately selected patients. Single incision sling (SIS) is the newest addition to the MUS group and was developed in an attempt to minimize morbidity and create an anti-incontinence procedure that could be performed in the office. The efficacy of SIS remains unknown as the current literature regarding SIS lacks long-term results and comparative trials. The suprapubic arc sling appears to have equally effective outcomes in at least the short-term when compared with TVT. Although evolution of the SIS has led to a less invasive procedure with decreased post-op pain and reduced recovery time, durability of efficacy could be the endpoint we are sacrificing. Until longer-term data and more quality comparison trials are available, tailoring one′s choice of MUS to the individual patient and her unique clinical parameters remains the best option...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the safety, {{effectiveness}} and pattern of inserting tension-free <b>vaginal</b> tape (TVT) <b>slings</b> alongside other gynaecological operations. It was a retrospective case note review of 116 patients who had a range of minor and major vaginal, laparoscopic and abdominal procedures at the same time as having TVT sling insertion at five district general hospitals in the UK. It showed an overall incidence of complications of 22.4 % and laparotomy was not required. A patient had bladder perforation, another had blood transfusion, a third had infection at the site of needle passing, and three patients had urinary tract infection. The overall incidence of complications in this series was significantly higher in those having major concomitant surgery than in the total group. Although 9.5 % of patients had catheters for more than a week, only two patients (1.7 %) required prolonged intermittent self-catheterisation. Development of overactive bladder symptoms was reported by 8.5 % of those who had pure urodynamic stress incontinence prior to surgery. Ninety-four per cent of patients were dry at 6  weeks. All major abdominal procedures were carried out under general anaesthesia prior to TVT sling insertion. A considerable variation was observed in operative and anaesthetic technique with all other concomitant procedures. These results demonstrated that TVT sling insertion alongside other minor and major gynaecological procedures did not undermine the safety or effectiveness of TVT sling insertion. Operative and anaesthetic practice varied considerably, calling for randomised controlled trials to provide evidence for best practice.|$|R
