5|$|The fallen Kabandha again {{asked for}} the names of his vanquishers. Lakshmana {{introduced}} himself and Rama and asked the demon who he was. Kabandha narrated his story to the brothers and declared that he recognized Rama by the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Rama had severed his arms. Kabandha requested that Rama perform his cremation rites, offered him what information he could, and died.|$|E
5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
5|$|He {{had also}} {{continued}} to play chess, competing in the 1952 and 1956 Olympiads. This 1956 Olympiad trip to Moscow was risky, since Britain and the USSR, which had been allies during World War II, were by then locked into the Cold War, and Milner-Barry's wartime codebreaking knowledge would have been {{of great interest to}} the Soviets; the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Britain had broken German codes on a massive scale was kept secret until 1974, when Frederick Winterbotham's book The Ultra Secret was published. He placed second in the British Chess Championship at Hastings 1953 (finishing behind only Daniel Yanofsky), with a score of 8/11; this would be his best result in British Championships.|$|E

5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I was able to travel here.|$|E
25|$|Although now {{regarded}} as a cult film, Sorcerer was not received as well by the public or film critics as Friedkin's previous two films had been. American movie reviewer D. K. Holm hinted that all criticisms might have stemmed from the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Friedkin even dared to reimagine a French classic.|$|E
25|$|In this game, if nature selects t1 as player 1's type, {{the game}} played {{will be like}} the very first game described, except that player 2 does not know it (and the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> this cuts through his {{information}} sets disqualify it from subgame status). There is one separating perfect Bayesian equilibrium; i.e. an equilibrium in which different types do different things.|$|E

25|$|The {{removal of}} the ban did not imply a genuine reconciliation, and no basis was gained for a {{settlement}} of the main question that divided Henry and Gregory: that of investiture. A new conflict was inevitable from the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Henry considered the sentence of deposition repealed along with that of excommunication. Gregory, on the other hand, was intent on reserving his freedom of action and gave no hint on the subject at Canossa.|$|E
25|$|When {{preliminary}} nibbana with substrate occurs (that is, nibbana of {{a living}} being), constructive consciousness, that is, the house-builder, is completely destroyed and no new formations will be constructed. However, sankharas {{in the sense of}} constructed consciousness, which exists as a 'karmically-resultant-consciousness' (vipāka viññāna), continue to exist. Each liberated individual produces no new karma, but preserves a particular individual personality which {{is the result of the}} traces of his or her karmic heritage. The <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there is a psycho-physical substrate during the remainder of an arahant's lifetime shows the continuing effect of karma.|$|E
25|$|However, this <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> (<b>that</b> the {{follower}} {{would play}} non-Stackelberg if the leader were to play Stackelberg) means that this profile {{is not a}} Nash equilibrium of the subgame starting when the leader has already played Stackelberg (a subgame off the equilibrium path). If the leader has already played Stackelberg, the best response of the follower is to play Stackelberg (and therefore {{it is the only}} action that yields a Nash equilibrium in this subgame). Hence the strategy profile - which is Cournot - is not subgame perfect.|$|E
60|$|The <b>very</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> Miss Miniver never stated an {{argument}} clearly, {{that she was}} never embarrassed {{by a sense of}} self-contradiction, and had little more respect for consistency of statement than a washerwoman has for wisps of vapor, which made Ann Veronica critical and hostile at their first encounter in Morningside Park, became at last with constant association the secret of Miss Miniver's growing influence. The brain tires of resistance, and when it meets again and again, incoherently active, the same phrases, the same ideas that it has already slain, exposed and dissected and buried, it becomes less and less energetic to repeat the operation. There must be something, one feels, in ideas that achieve persistently a successful resurrection. What Miss Miniver would have called the Higher Truth supervenes.|$|R
60|$|Neal was {{perfectly}} contented {{with such a}} view of the case, and he felt well satisfied that nothing could prevent them from doing as they wished; but unfortunately, he failed to take into consideration the <b>very</b> important <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> while it might be a simple matter to enter the city, they could not be certain of leaving it at will.|$|R

25|$|He is a harsh taskmaster, likes {{being the}} boss, {{and is not}} very forgiving. One of his former {{tactical}} trainees from Quantico, Liz Warner has proclaimed to this and, after Colby confided in her {{that he made a}} mistake, she told him that the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he still remains on Don's team means something. She also said that Don never spoke of his personal life while at the FBI Academy and was at the time fresh from the field in hunting fugitives (with friend Agent Cooper). Liz knows he has mellowed with age and he can hold a commitment with a woman for longer periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, in the Mycenaean Greek Linear B tablets, some Homeric names appear, {{including}} Achilles (Linear B: , a-ki-re-u), a name {{which was}} also common in the classical period, noted on tablets from both Knossos and Pylos. The Achilles of the Linear B tablet is a shepherd, not a king or warrior, but the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the name is an authentic Bronze Age name is significant. These names in the Homeric poems presumably remember, if not necessarily specific people, at least an older time when people's names were {{not the same as}} they were when the Homeric epics were written down. Some story elements from the tablets appear in the Iliad.|$|E
500|$|Kiarostami {{has said}} of his film making: [...] "An artist designs and creates a piece hoping to {{materialize}} some thoughts, concepts or feelings through his or her medium. The credibility of great Persian poets like Rumi and Hafez comes from the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they are composed {{in such a way}} that they are fresh and meaningful regardless of the time, place and conditions in which you read them—and this means reading them while doing divination or simply as literature." ...|$|E

60|$|Now {{after this}} {{look at our}} own side of the world, let us turn to the other; for it is this <b>very</b> {{psychological}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> mental progression implies an ever-increasing individualization, and that imagination is the force {{at work in the}} process which Far Eastern civilization, taken in connection with our own, reveals. In doing this, it explains incidentally its own seeming anomalies, the most unaccountable of which, apparently, is its existence.|$|R
40|$|We study Petri nets with Reset arcs (also Transfer and Doubling arcs) in {{combination}} with other extensions of the basic Petri net model. While Reachability is undecidable in all these extensions (indeed they are Turing-powerful), we exhibit unexpected frontiers for the decidability of Termination, Coverability, Boundedness and place-Boundedness. In particular, we show counter-intuitive separations between seemingly related problems. Our main theorem is the <b>very</b> surprising <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> boundedness is undecidable for Petri nets with Reset arcs...|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Hogg {{worked on a}} {{collection}} of her father's papers and speeches with his biographer, historian Robert C. Cotner; she became a guardian of his place in history, often writing to clarify or refute articles published about her father. According to Bernhard, [...] "the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Ima had been burdened with a name that made a lifetime of explanations necessary also made her anxious to defend her father from all detractors. By doing so, she defended herself as well, and she did so with considerable skill and unfailing politeness." ...|$|E

Describing her as [...] "a major personality in the development" [...] of Wicca, Hutton also expressed the view that [...] "her enduring greatness lay in the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she was so completely and strong-mindedly dedicated to finding and declaring her own truth, {{in a world in which}} the signposts to it were themselves in a state of almost complete confusion".|$|E

Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner noted in 1977, {{with reference to}} Harrison's commercial and critical dominance over his former bandmates following the break-up: [...] "The <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Beatles had kept George's flowering talents so under wraps proved to be his secret weapon." [...] Schaffner named [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] and [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] as the two [...] "most eloquent" [...] songs on All Things Must Pass, [...] "musically as well as lyrically", with [...] "mysterious, seductive melodies, over which faded strings and horns hover like Blue Jay Way fog".|$|E

500|$|Retrospective {{reception}} of Sega Channel praises its innovation and {{role in the}} development of online gaming, but criticizes its high subscription fees and timing into the market.

[...] Levi Buchanan, also writing for IGN, credits Sega Channel with its {{role in the development of}} modern gaming and content delivery services, such as Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network, stating [...] "SEGA and the entire industry learned important lessons from the SEGA Channel. SEGA was still committed to the idea of downloads and online, as evidenced by the Dreamcast's SegaNet... You can also see the DNA of early services like the SEGA Channel in modern portals like XBLA and PSN, where demos are now a staple." [...] The staff of UGO Networks also credits Sega Channel with being an important step in the development of both services.|$|E

Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the episode}} an 8.0/10 rating, IGN's Ramsey Isler thought the episode wasn't [...] "as hard-hitting {{as most of}} the {{previous}} 'mythology' episodes, but it still leaves a good impression". Isler enjoyed the [...] "tense and intriguing" [...] opening and ending of the episode, but kept waiting for more to happen in the middle. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall called the opening [...] "one {{of the best in the}} entire series" [...] and [...] "certainly the best television I've seen this year." [...] In addition, Stegall praised Olivia's dream sequence and subsequent accusation of Walter, the inclusion of Massive Dynamic as allies, Broyles' role as [...] "support" [...] rather than [...] "the usual role of Plot Obstacle," [...] and the science behind the episode ("The <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> we can have two different yet legitimate quantum physics explanations on a television drama is, in itself, cause for applause."). She concluded her review by noting Anna Torv has made [...] "the most progress" [...] in her performance, evolving from [...] "downright wooden in the first year" [...] to [...] "carrying the role with grace and strength." [...] Website blogger io9 listed [...] "Jacksonville" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E
