5|$|A plaque {{placed on}} the miller's house in 1973 to {{celebrate}} the 100th birthday of miller Gerardus van Hoorn commemorates both fires. Van Hoorn had known the Dutch painter Vincent <b>van</b> <b>Gogh,</b> who lived in nearby Nuenen from 1883 until 1885. <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> painted several paintings around the mill, including an 1884 painting of the mill itself, Water Mill at Opwetten (F48). In a video interview in 1973, Van Hoorn {{said that he had}} seen <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> paint and had supplied him with bird nests for his paintings.|$|E
5|$|Intrigued by {{an ominous}} figure {{in one of}} Vincent van Gogh's paintings, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) {{go back in time}} to meet <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> (Tony Curran) and discover that Provence has been plagued by an invisible monster, known as the Krafayis, which only <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> can see. The Doctor and Amy work with <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> to defeat the Krafayis, but in their attempt to have <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> realise his legacy through bringing him to the future they ultimately realise that not all of time can be rewritten and there are some evils which are out of the Doctor's reach.|$|E
5|$|Vincent Willem <b>van</b> <b>Gogh</b> {{was born}} on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the {{predominantly}} Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus <b>van</b> <b>Gogh,</b> a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> was given {{the name of his}} grandfather, and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), who received a degree in theology at the University of Leiden in 1811, had six sons, three of whom became art dealers. This Vincent may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).|$|E

5000|$|Theo, <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh's</b> brother, {{wrote in}} July 1889, that Camille and Lucien Pissarro, Père Tanguy, Erik Theodor Werenskiold and Octave Maus, {{secretary}} of the Les XX group in Brussels, had seen the paintings that he'd made in southern France. On <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh's</b> behalf, Theo accepted an offer from Maus to exhibit <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh's</b> work at the Les XX group's upcoming exhibition.|$|R

5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> and Gauguin both frequented. <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{inspired}} {{by the fact that}} <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> never knew he would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated, many reviewers agreed that Curran's performance as <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> was excellent, but that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster.|$|E

50|$|Lichtenstein {{says that}} he cleaned up <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh's</b> version and jokes {{that it would be}} to <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh's</b> liking, {{although}} he notes that the vast contrast between his cartoonish style and the original is in and of itself humorous. He notes that his work is meticulous, while <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh's</b> was spontaneous. He also notes that his translation is no more debasing to the master than were Pablo Picasso's translations of Diego Velázquez.|$|R

5|$|In 1892 Émile Bernard {{organised}} a small {{solo show}} of Van Gogh's paintings in Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. In April 1894 the Durand-Rue Gallery in Paris {{agreed to take}} 10 paintings on consignment from Van Gogh's estate. In 1896, the Fauvist painter Henri Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited John Peter Russell on Belle Île off Brittany. Russell had been {{a close friend of}} Van Gogh; he introduced Matisse to the Dutchman's work, and gave him a <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> drawing. Influenced by <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh,</b> Matisse abandoned his earth-coloured palette for bright colours.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{access to}} life outside the clinic {{resulted}} in a shortage of subject matter. <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> instead worked on interpretations of other artist's paintings, such as Millet's The Sower and Noonday Rest, and variations on his own earlier work. <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> was an admirer of the Realism of Jules Breton, Gustave Courbet and Millet, and he compared his copies to a musician's interpreting Beethoven.|$|E
5|$|Mauve took <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> on as {{a student}} and {{introduced}} him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas. He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. Within a month <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> could afford to hire only people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he {{was surprised at how}} good the results were.|$|E

5|$|When Gauguin {{agreed to}} visit Arles in 1888, <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> hoped for friendship, and the {{realisation}} of {{his idea of}} an artists' collective.

5|$|Alongside his {{television}} and film work, Castellaneta {{has appeared in}} a number of theatrical productions. In 1992, he starred in Deb & Dan's Show alongside his wife. In 1995, Castellaneta started writing Where Did Vincent <b>van</b> <b>Gogh?,</b> a one man play in which he portrays a dozen different characters, including artist Vincent <b>van</b> <b>Gogh.</b> He first officially performed the play at the ACME Comedy Theatre in Los Angeles in 1999. In 2007, he appeared in The Bicycle Men at The King's Head Theatre in London.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E

5|$|In Nuenen, <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> {{focused on}} {{painting}} and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined {{him on his}} forays; {{she fell in love}} and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh</b> rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.|$|E

5000|$|Gilman visited Scandinavia in 1912 and 1913, and {{may have}} {{travelled}} with the artist William Ratcliffe, who had relations there.

[...] Gilman had rejected <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh's</b> work when he first encountered it, but later became a strong admirer and, according to Wyndham Lewis, keeping postcards of <b>Van</b> <b>Gogh's</b> work on his wall and sometimes hanging one of his own works next to them, if he was especially satisfied with it.|$|R
