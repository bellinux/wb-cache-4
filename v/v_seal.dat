30|$|The {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} {{two types of}} seal coatings, nickel–graphite and aluminum–hexagon-boron nitride (Ni–Cg and Al–hBN, respectively) versus a Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade used in turbofan engines were investigated using a high-speed rubbing test. The wear status and damage mechanism of the friction couples were studied and the abradability of the seal coatings was evaluated. By analysis of the coating properties and damage mechanism of the seal couple, the friction heat effect was identified as the key factor influencing blade wear forms as well as coating abradability. A one-dimensional heat conduction model was established to estimate the effect of increasing temperature on the friction interface. The results indicated that in the Ni–Cg and Ti– 6 Al– 4 <b>V</b> <b>seal</b> couple, the temperature rising rate (TRR) of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was faster {{than that of the}} Ni–Cg coating, and so the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade softened earlier than the Ni–Cg coating, causing the blade to suffer severe wear. In the Al–hBN and Ti– 6 Al– 4 <b>V</b> <b>seal</b> couple, the TRR of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was slower than that of the Al–hBN coating, and so the Al–hBN coating softened first; thus, blade damage was reduced or even replaced by coating adhesion. The square root ratio of thermal diffusivity between the blade and the coating could be taken as an indicator of the ratio of TRR between the blade and coating to predict blade wear status as well as damage mechanism. The results of the model agreed well with the experiment results of the two seal couples used in this study.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a forecasting model designed using WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) to predict flood in rivers using simple and fast calculations to provide real-time results {{and save the}} lives of people who may be affected by the flood. Our prediction model uses multiple variable robust linear regression which is easy to understand and simple and cost effective in implementation, is speed efficient, but has low resource utilization and yet provides real time predictions with reliable accuracy, thus having features which are desirable in any real world algorithm. Our prediction model is independent of the number of parameters, i. e. any number of parameters may be added or removed based on the on-site requirements. When the water level rises, we represent it using a polynomial whose nature is used to determine if the water level may exceed the flood line in the near future. We compare our work with a contemporary algorithm to demonstrate our improvements over it. Then we present our simulation results for the predicted water level compared to the actual water level.

40|$|After CO 2 {{has been}} {{injected}} {{in the lower}} part of a dipping aquifer, it will continue to migrate, driven by buoyancy.

The purpose of this simulation study is to understand the effects of geomechanical structures, especially faults, on the dynamic behavior of the buoyancy-driven CO 2 plume and the amount of residual trapping. Using GEM (Generalized Equation-of-State Model Compositional Reservoir Simulator) we studied the behavior of CO 2 plumes (speed, direction, saturation at displacement front, residual phase trapping) in 2 D formations with a range of fault properties (conductive <b>vs.</b> <b>sealing,</b> angle relative to dip, distance from initial plume location). We developed an analytical approach for estimating plume movement based on Buckley-Leverett theory, which compares favorably with the simulation results; thus, it can explain the basic behavior of CO 2 plume in this simplified reservoir model, which is homogeneous, anisotropic and tilted. Smaller amounts of initially stored CO 2 migrates shorter distances, and in these cases the simple theory predicts the plume movement prior to encountering a fault.

40|$|Purpose – Prior {{research}} suggests that significant impediments to the growth in electronic commerce exist, particularly in relation to international exchanges. This paper aims to investigate the respective roles of vendor location (domestic vs international) and web assurance seals {{in the development of}} initial trusting beliefs about a vendor's web site, and to determine whether these beliefs ultimately influence online purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach – A model is developed and tested using a controlled laboratory experiment in which 181 subjects are randomly allocated to one of six web site treatments corresponding to two possible locations of the web site vendor (domestic vs international) and three web assurance states (no Web <b>seal</b> <b>vs</b> TRUSTe <b>seal</b> <b>vs</b> WebTrust <b>seal).</b> Data are analysed using ANCOVA and multiple regression analysis. Findings – As hypothesised, the results suggest that geographical location does appear to influence the formation of initial trusting beliefs (perceived trustworthiness) about a vendor's websites. In contrast, web assurance seals, in general, were found to have little influence on trusting beliefs; and accountants' seals, in particular, were found to be equally ineffective as those issued by other providers. Overall, trusting beliefs were seen to strongly influence online purchase intentions. Research limitations/implications – Future research aimed at evaluating the relative effectiveness of various trust-building mechanisms applicable to international vendors is warranted, as is research advancing the understanding of why assurance seals appear to be ineffective as trust-building mechanisms. The implications of using students as surrogates for online consumers and other limitations inherent in experimental analyses ought to be considered in interpreting the study's findings. Practical implications – The study's findings indicate that international vendors ought to consider implementing targeted trust-building mechanisms to compensate for being at a competitive disadvantage to their domestic counterparts. Suggested strategies are discussed in the paper. In relation to assurance seals, results suggest that the accounting profession can no longer assume to successfully leverage off its reputation for trustworthiness and integrity in extending its claims to expertise into new markets. Originality/value – No previous study has examined the role of vendor location in the development of initial trusting beliefs.

40|$|Background: Anastomotic leakage {{remains a}} major {{complication}} following colorectal surgery, with a largely unknown pathophysiology and limited treatment options. Previous clinical studies {{have revealed that}} many leakages on colo-rectal anastomoses remain subclinical. Prior attempts at prophylactic mechanical sealing of gastrointestinal anastomoses, i. e., the application of various forms of mesh and fibrin components, have been disappointing. We therefore decided {{to determine whether a}} collagen patch coated with fibrin glue components (TachoSil and reg;) is able to seal leaking colonic anastomoses and thereby prevent clinical leakage and peritonitis. Material and methods: Prospective study on 20 pigs operated with experimentally induced defects in colonic anastomoses randomized to <b>sealing</b> <b>vs.</b> no <b>sealing</b> with a collagen patch coated with fibrin glue components. The primary study endpoints were visible leakage at the anastomotic site, death or illness causing sacrifice and fecal peritonitis (local or diffuse). Results: A significant reduction in macroscopic anastomotic leakage in the group of pigs with sealed anastomoses was found (2 / 10 vs. 9 / 10, p= 0. 0055). Furthermore, macroscopic examination of the abdominal cavity (n= 20) showed a significant decrease in peritonitis in the <b>sealed</b> <b>vs.</b> non-sealed groups (2 vs. 9, p= 0. 0055). Additionally, a reduction, although non-significant, in dead and sacrificed animals {{before the end of the}} observation period (1 vs. 4) was found in the sealed group. Conclusion: A collagen patch coated with fibrin glue components efficiently seals leaking gastrointestinal anastomoses in pigs. Whether these results may be applied to humans in order to prevent clinical anastomotic dehiscence must be investigated in future randomized clinical studies.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} repeatability and stability of capnography interfaced with human exposure facility. Methods Capnographic wave signals were obtained from five healthy volunteers exposed to particle-free, filtered air during two consecutive 5 min intervals, 10 min apart, within the open and then the sealed and operational human exposure facility (HEF). Using a customized setup comprised of the Oridion Microcap ® portable capnograph, DA converter and AD card, the signal was acquired and saved as an ASCII file for subsequent processing. The minute ventilation (VE), respiratory rate (RR) and expiratory tidal volume (V TE) were recorded before and after capnographic recording and then averaged. Each capnographic tracing was analyzed for acceptable waves. From each recorded interval, 8 to 19 acceptable waves were selected and measured. The following wave parameters were obtained: total length and length of phase II and III, slope of phase II and III, area under the curve and area under phase III. In addition, we recorded signal measures including the mean, standard deviation, mode, minimum, maximum – which equals end-tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2), zero-corrected maximum and true RMS. Results Statistical analysis using a paired t-test for means showed no statistically significant changes of any wave parameters and wave signal measures, corrected for RR and V TE, comparing the measures when the HEF was open <b>vs.</b> <b>sealed</b> and operational. The coefficients of variation of the zero-corrected and uncorrected EtCO 2, phase II absolute difference, signal mean, standard deviation and RMS were less than 10 % despite a sub-atmospheric barometric pressure, and slightly higher temperature and relative humidity within the HEF when operational. Conclusion We showed that a customized setup for the acquisition and processing of the capnographic wave signal, interfaced with HEF was stable and repeatable. Thus, we expect that analysis of capnographic waves in controlled human air pollution exposure studies is a feasible tool for characterization of cardio-pulmonary effects of such exposures. </p...|$|R

Articulatory measurements include linguopalatal contact (by electropalatography) for both C and <b>V,</b> and <b>seal</b> duration; acoustic measurements include nasal duration and energy for /n/, VOT, burst energy and spectral {{center of gravity}} for /t/, and F 1, vowel duration and vowel amplitude for /ε/. Several specific points emerge. First, domain-initial articulation is differentiated from stress- or accent-induced articulations in many aspects; for the most part, prominence affects vowel measures while initial position affects consonant measures. Nonetheless, the vowel is also effectively louder domain-initially, suggesting that the boundary effect is not strictly local to the initial consonant. Second, the boundary (domain-initial) effect is not seen across-the-board, but is often constrained by stress and accent factors, revealing that domain-initial strengthening is more effective when a relevant phonetic dimension does not undergo a compelling strengthening coming from stress or accent. Third, some accentual effects {{can be seen on}} secondary-stressed syllables, suggesting that accentual influences spread beyond the primary-stressed syllable. But this spread is mainly seen with consonantal measures, showing an asymmetric accentual influence between consonantal and vocalic articulations. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{injected}} CO 2 in {{a target}} formation {{can continue to}} migrate through permeable pathways due to geological heterogeneity as well as buoyancy. This movement drives a countercurrent flow of brine leading to increased residual phase trapping. The purpose of this simulation study is to understand the effects of geological structures, especially faults, on the dynamic behavior of the buoyancy-driven CO 2 plume {{and the amount of}} residual trapping. We studied the behavior of CO 2 plumes (speed, direction, saturation at displacement front, residual phase trapping) in 2 D and 3 D formations with a range of fault properties (conductive <b>vs.</b> <b>sealing,</b> angle relative to dip, distance from initial plume location). Before CO 2 plumes enter the fault-influenced region of the aquifer, the reservoir properties determine the plume behavior. The analytical approach for estimating plume movement based on Buckley-Leverett theory compares favorably with the simulation results; thus, it can explain the basic behavior of CO 2 plume in this simplified reservoir model, which is homogeneous, anisotropic and tilted. If the plume encounters a fault within the reservoir, the fault can create new virtual source (CO 2 build-up at the plume/fault intersection) for migration. It also leads to more complicated fluid movement, including counter current flow and/or dissolution. A sealing fault, which acts as another boundary for CO 2 plume, divides the aquifer into two parts: fault-independent zone and fault dependent zone. The analytical solution can predict the properties of CO 2 plume in the first zone, but not in the latter one due to the countercurrent flow. In both cases of a declined and an inclined fault, CO 2 accumulates along the fault due to anisotropy causing dominantly parallel migration. The build-up continues until saturation approaches the endpoint dictated by the relative permeability curves (forming a virtual source), and then CO 2 moves upward along the fault. According to Land’s model the larger the gas saturation reached as gas invades, the larger the residual gas saturation when water invades. Therefore, the saturation of CO 2 plumes moving in the reservoir will determine the efficiency of residual saturation trapping. On the other hand, a conductive fault, which acts as a new pathway for migration, may cause considerable leakage of CO 2 toward the top boundary of the reservoir (inclined fault) or increase the width of CO 2 plume (declined fault). In the latter case, the CO 2 plume passes through larger area, which improves the efficiency of residual saturation trapping. To understand the dynamics of CO 2 behavior, especially countercurret flow, in the faulted reservoir we analyze flow vectors of both CO 2 and brine phases, which explain the process of CO 2 phase build-up and/or leakage due to structural heterogeneity...|$|R

The aim of this study was to compare suture fixation <b>vs.</b> fibrin <b>sealing</b> by using a new monofilament PTFE mesh, i. e. the Infinit® mesh by W. L. Gore & Associates. Methods: This study was designed as a controlled prospective single-centre two cohort study. A total of 38 patients were enrolled and operated in Lichtenstein technique either standard suture mesh fixation or fibrin sealant mesh fixation were used as described in the TIMELI trial. Primary outcome parameters were postoperative complications with the new mesh (i. e. seroma, infection), pain and quality of life evaluated by the VAS and the SF- 36 questionnaire. Secondary outcome was recurrence assessed by ultrasound and physical examination. Follow-up time was 1 year. Results: Significantly less postoperative pain was reported in the fibrin sealant group compared to the suture group at 6 weeks (P= 0. 035), 6 months (P= 0. 023) and 1 year (P= 0. 011) postoperatively. Additionally trends towards a higher postoperative quality of life, a faster surgical procedure and a shorter hospital stay were seen in the fibrin sealant group.
