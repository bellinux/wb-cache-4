40|$|Purpose: In {{the past}} few years there has been growing {{interest}} in memristive devices. These devices rely on thin metal oxide films with a peculiar structure and composition, making precise control of oxide features vital. To this end, anodic oxidation allows a very large range of oxides to be formed on the surface of <b>valve</b> <b>metals,</b> whose thickness, structure and functional properties depend on the process parameters introduced. This work reports how memristive anodic oxides were obtained on titanium and other <b>valve</b> <b>metals,</b> such as niobium and tantalum. Methods: Anodic oxidation was performed on <b>valve</b> <b>metals</b> by immersion in H 2 SO 4 or H 3 PO 4 electrolytes and application of voltages ranging from 10 to 90 V. The memristive behavior was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Results: The behavior of differently grown oxides was compared to identify the best conditions to achieve good memristive performances. High voltages were identified as not suitable due to the excessive oxide thickness, while below 20 V the film was not thick and uniform enough to give a good response. Surface preparation also {{played a major role in}} the observation of memristive properties. Conclusions: Optimal surface preparation and anodizing conditions were seen to give high memristive perfo- mances on both titanium and niobium oxides, while on tantalum oxides no reproducibility was achieved...|$|R

In particular, Lab-on-a-chip devices have the potentialto transform clinical analysis by offering a compact, inexpensive, and disposable method for carrying out many laboratory functions at the point of care. While current methods exist to transport droplets, they can be complex,both in terms of their manufacture and operation.

In addition, our device is simple to operate and requires only a single photolithographic step to manufacture.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>valve</b> <b>metal</b> oxides such as Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb and Si oxides in electronics is discussed. <b>Valve</b> <b>metal</b> oxides show outstanding dielectric properties, which {{make them a}} key component in many passive and active devices such as capacitors, resistors and IC´s. Nevertheless, the most important oxide system still is Si/SiO 2, which {{can be considered as}} the bench mark system. Consequently, one chapter of this book is dedicated to Si/SiO 2 with special emphasis on its use in DRAM (dynamic random access memory) microchip fabrication which can be considered the most advanced and demanding technology in microelectronics. Regarding their electronic properties the <b>valve</b> <b>metal</b> oxides are related to another class of oxides, namely the perovskite structured piezoelectrics: BaTiO 3, (Ba,Sr) TiO 3 (BST), Pb(ZrxTi 1 -x) O 3 (PZT), SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 (SBT). These advanced electroceramics outperform the simple <b>valve</b> <b>metal</b> oxides in many respects, such as, by their exceptional high relative dielectric constant (er) (sometimes also called relative permittivity). Therefore, both the <b>valve</b> <b>metal</b> and the perovskite oxides compete in many applications. For example, in passive component capacitor manufacturing Al/Al 2 O 3 and Ta/Ta 2 O 5 electrolyte capacitors share the market with multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) that are BaTiO 3 based. However, due to their more complex chemistry the integration of perovskite layers into devices is difficult when ultra thin nano-dielectric films are needed. Therefore, this treatise focuses on the less complex <b>valve</b> <b>metal</b> oxides as ultra thin nano dielectrics (< 100 nm). For application as a capacitor dielectric material, a high relative dielectric constant er is important but not sufficient. The anodically formed <b>valve</b> <b>metal</b> oxides differ in structure (some are amorphous, some crystalline), electronic behaviour (some oxides behave like an n-type semiconductor), and some oxides show a pronounced texture dependence of oxide growth, that is the oxide properties vary with the crystallographic orientation of the substrate surface. Depending on the desired {{application of}} the oxides, an optimum combination of these properties has to be found.

The initial step of anodic breakdown is clearly an ionic one. This was concluded from the strong correlation between film thickness and breakdown potential.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the electronic properties of amorphous semiconductor–electrolyte junction is reported for thin (Dox < 20 nm) passive film grown on Nb in acidic electrolyte. It will be shown that the theory of amorphous semiconductor–electrolyte junction (a-SC/El) both in the low band-bending and high band-bending regime is able to explain the admittance data of a-Nb 2 O 5 /El interface in a large range (10 Hz– 10 kHz) of frequency and electrode potential values. A modelling of experimental EIS data at different potentials and in the frequency range of 0. 1 Hz– 100 kHz is presented based on the theory of amorphous semiconductor and compared {{with the results of}} the fitting of the admittance data obtained in a different experiment. Some preliminary insights on the possible dependence of the density of state (DOS) distribution on the mobile defects concentration and mechanism of growth of anodic film on <b>valve</b> <b>metals</b> are suggested...|$|R

Three men stand right of a large engine, with one man's hand on {{what appears to be}} a wheel of sorts. The machine stands at center, a complex piece of <b>valves</b> and <b>metal.</b> Behind it, the windows of the factory can be seen, set into the wall...|$|R
