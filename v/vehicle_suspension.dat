25|$|Roughness: Deviations from a true planar {{pavement}} surface, {{which affects}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>suspension</b> deflection, dynamic loading, ride quality, surface drainage and winter operations. Roughness have wavelengths ranging from 500mm {{up to some}} 40 m. The upper limit may {{be as high as}} 350 m when considering motion sickness aspects; motion sickness is generated by motion with down to 0.1Hz frequency; in an ambulance car driving 35m/s (126km/h), waves with up to 350 m will excite motion sickness.|$|E
500|$|Smith's inerter {{has found}} an {{application}} in Formula One racing {{where it is}} known as the J-damper. [...] It is used {{as an alternative to the}} now banned tuned mass damper and forms part of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>suspension.</b> [...] It may have been first used secretly by McLaren in 2005 following a collaboration with Smith. [...] Other teams are now believed to be using it. [...] The inerter is much smaller than the tuned mass damper and smoothes out contact patch load variations on the tyres. [...] Smith also suggests using the inerter to reduce machine vibration.|$|E
2500|$|Wire wheels, wire-spoked wheels, tension-spoked wheels, or [...] "suspension" [...] {{wheels are}} wheels whose rims connect to their hubs by wire spokes. Although these wires are {{generally}} stiffer than a typical wire rope, they function mechanically {{the same as}} tensioned flexible wires, keeping the rim true while supporting applied loads. The term suspension wheel {{should not be confused}} with <b>vehicle</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{motion of}} a wheel set {{is much more}} {{complicated}} than this analysis would indicate. There are additional restraining forces applied by the <b>vehicle</b> <b>suspension</b> and, at high speed, the wheel set will generate additional gyroscopic torques, which will modify the estimate of the critical speed. Conventionally a railway vehicle has stable motion in low speeds, when it reaches to high speeds stability changes to unstable form. The main purpose of nonlinear analysis of rail vehicle system dynamics is to show the view of analytical investigation of bifurcation, nonlinear lateral stability and hunting behavior of rail vehicles in a tangent track. This study contains Bogoliubov method for the analysis ...|$|E
50|$|The {{component}} {{normal to}} the track acts together with the much larger component of gravitational force normal {{to the track}} and is generally neglected.

30|$|Since dynamic {{effects have}} been {{increasingly}} {{important in the}} prediction of pavement response, damage, and performance [14, 16, 18], it has become necessary to develop better mathematical models to account the effects of motion and fluctuation of contact forces caused by various types of <b>vehicle</b> <b>suspensions</b> [73]. The author has carried {{out a number of}} studies on deterministic and stochastic MSPs {{over the last two decades}} by providing a general approach that can include surface roughness and <b>vehicle</b> <b>suspensions</b> in the response of continuum media [54, 74].|$|R

50|$|Small <b>vehicle</b> <b>suspensions</b> using rubber (or other elastomers) {{can achieve}} the dual {{function}} of springing and damping because rubber, unlike metal springs, has pronounced hysteresis {{and does not}} return all the absorbed compression energy on the rebound.
