40|$|A Lane Departure Warning (LDW) {{system for}} trucks was {{developed}} and evaluated in an iterative design process. As the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> used {{by the majority of}} LDW systems are disliked by drivers, most effort was put in the design of haptic <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> The iterative design process resulted in two different haptic <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> displayed through vibration motors in the seat: a 2 ̆ 2 blinking 2 ̆ 2 signal for Medium Criticality departures and a continuously vibrating signal for High Criticality departures. In addition, the iterative design process also resulted in small modifications in the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> The effectiveness and user acceptance of the haptic and auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> were evaluated in an experiment with a driving simulator with 20 participants and in a road test with a truck with 5 participants. It was found that the haptic <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> were as effective as the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> in dealing with lane departures, both in normal driving situations and in a driving + secondary task situation. In addition, the participants clearly preferred the haptic signals over the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R
40|$|With semiautonomous {{vehicles}} and innovative assistance systems flooding the market, {{the characteristics of}} <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> for automotive human-machine interfaces determine their effectiveness and usage.

40|$|The {{potential}} use of non-visual <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> {{to present}} spatial information to car drivers {{has been successfully}} demonstrated in several recent studies (Ho & Spence, submitted, in preparation; Ho, Tan, & Spence, submitted). Among {{the three types of}} spatial <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> investigated (namely auditory, visual, and vibrotactile), spatial vibrotactile cues were found to be particularly effective in directing a driver’s visual spatial attention to potentially dangerous events on the road. We conducted the present study in order to examine the factors governing the relative effectiveness of auditory, visual, and vibrotactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> The speeded discrimination of <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> presented in the various different modalities was investigated in order to explore whether the differences found in our previous research were a result of the relative speed with which people can detect <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> presented in a given modality, or whether they were attributable to differences in the efficacy with which people can relate the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> to the subsequent visually-specified target driving events. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect that an auditory collision <b>warning</b> <b>signal's</b> pulse rate, pulse pattern, and onset distance had on subject braking responses in a simulated crane/overhead power line collision scenario. The experimental <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> alerted subjects of their proximity to overhead power lines. The experimental taks required subjects to monitor a simulated auditory collision <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> while simultaneously operating a single-axis driving simulation task. The driving task simulated an actual crane operator's mental workload required to navigate a crane and manipulate various loads. Subjects were required to initiate braking responses {{based on the information}} conveyed solely through the auditory collision warning system. No visual information was provided to the subjects to isolate the effects of the <b>warning</b> <b>signal.</b> Subjective ratings of the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> were obtained to compare subjects'actual performance using the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> versus their subjective preferences. Results indicate that subjects were able to initiate appropriate braking responses while using an auditory collision <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> with moderate onset distances and low pulse rates. The auditory pulse pattern did not have a large impact on subjects'braking responses except at extremely short onset distances. Overall, it was concluded that a pulsing auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> comprised of a moderate onset distance and low pulse rate could work effectively as a proximity warning device for mobile cranes. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{report a}} series of three {{experiments}} designed to assess the relative speed with which people can initiate speeded head-orienting responses following the presentation of spatial <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> Background: Recent cognitive neuroscience findings have shown that the human brain tends to treat stimuli occurring in peripersonal space as being somehow more behaviorally relevant and attention demanding than stimuli occurring in extrapersonal space. These brain mechanisms may be exploited in the design of <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> Method: Experiment 1 assessed the effectiveness of various different unisensory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> in eliciting a head-turning response to look at the potential source of danger requiring participants' immediate attention; Experiment 2 assessed the latency of a driver's responses to events occurring in the cued direction; Experiment 3 assessed the relative effectiveness of various <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> in reorienting a person's gaze back to a central driving task while he or she was distracted by a secondary task. Results: The results show that participants initiated head-turning movements and made speeded discrimination or braking responses significantly more rapidly following the presentation of a close rear auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> than following the presentation of either a far frontal auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> a vibrotactile <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> presented to their waist, or a peripheral visual <b>warning</b> <b>signal.</b> Conclusion: These results support the claim that the introduction of peripersonal <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> results in a significant performance advantage relative to traditionally designed warnings. Application: Warning systems that have been designed around the constraints of the human brain offer great potential in the future design of multisensory interfaces.

40|$|Abstract Aposematic organisms have <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> {{advertising}} their unpalatability to predators, {{and because}} signal efficiency is better in higher densities, positive frequency-dependent selection {{is expected to}} select against less common signals. The wood tiger moth (Parasemia plantaginis) occurs across the Holarctic and its conspicuous hindwings serve as <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> to predators.

We placed artificial moths with both local dominant and foreign forewing patterns in each of the two regions to test if predators select against the foreign forewing types, which would suggest the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> function of forewing patters.

40|$|Abstract- The {{primary cause}} for most {{accidents}} is vehicle’s excessive speed and delayed driver’s reaction. Road safety {{can be improved}} by early warning based on vehicle hazard detection and warning system. An innovative system called wireless local danger warning (WILLWARN), {{which is based on}} recent and future trends of cooperative driving, enables an electronic safety horizon for foresighted driving by implementing onboard vehicle-hazard detection. One of the key innovative features of the proposed system is the focus on low penetration levels in rural traffic by a new message management strategy that is based on storing warning information in the vehicle and distributing warnings through communication, particularly with oncoming traffic. The system timely warns the driver about a dangerous situation ahead by decentralized distribution of warnings and incident messages via Intervehicle communication. The WILLWARN system is based on a modular objectoriented architecture consisting of the warning messagemanagement module (WMM), the hazard-detectionmanagement module (HDM), the hazard-warning-management module (HWM), a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and various onboard sensors. In this paper, all system modules, as well as their interoperability, are presented in detail.

In general, however, the effect of a <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> and the effect of a second task were the same for both groups.
