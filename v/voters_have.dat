5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register <b>voters</b> <b>have</b> the ability to bail out. After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|The Kings County Association of Governments {{has plans}} to improve the state {{highways}} within the county. Developers are interested in building distribution warehouses in Kings County because of its strategic location midway between the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, but they are currently {{turned off by the}} lack of freeway access. For SR 198, the plan is to extend the freeway segment from Naval Air Station Lemoore to I-5. However, Kings County <b>voters</b> <b>have</b> shown little interest in passing any transportation taxes to fund these projects.|$|E

5|$|Polling {{stations}} {{are set up}} in public buildings throughout the country; voters may only vote at their assigned polling station (according to their permanent residence), but voters deployed abroad in the armed forces, voters on Croatian-flagged ships and imprisoned voters are allowed to vote elsewhere. Other voters residing in Croatia, but traveling abroad on election day may vote at Croatian diplomatic missions. Polling {{stations are}} open from 7:00am until 7:00pm, but all voters present at the polling stations at closing time are allowed to vote. Polling stations may be closed early if all registered <b>voters</b> <b>have</b> voted. Presidential election ballots contain a list of candidates verified by the State Electoral Commission, in alphabetical order. This entails the name and PIN of each candidate, {{and the names of}} political parties endorsing the candidate (or a note that the candidate is running as an independent. The names are preceded by ordinal numbers. Parliamentary election and European Parliament election ballots contain the name of the slate {{and the name of the}} person heading the list, in addition to candidates, who is not necessarily a candidate on the particular list, but may be included as a figurehead symbolizing specific political party or a coalition putting forward the listâ€”usually head of the party of coalition at the national level. The lists are in alphabetical order and preceded by an ordinal number. Voting is done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate. Ballots marked otherwise (but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast) are also considered valid. Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled (or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated) are invalid. Official results are announced and published by the State Electoral Commission.|$|E

According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American was 28%; {{hundreds of thousands of}} blacks had left the state in the Great Migration to the North and Midwest. New white residents arrived through migration and immigration. Following support from the national Democratic Party for {{the civil rights movement and}} especially civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority <b>voters,</b> <b>have</b> largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia.

50|$|Another {{method is}} to make it appear that the <b>voter</b> <b>has</b> spoiled his or her ballot, thus {{rendering}} it invalid. Typically this would be done by adding another mark to the paper, making it appear that the <b>voter</b> <b>has</b> voted for more candidates than entitled, for instance. It would be difficult to do this to a large number of paper ballots without detection.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{election}} of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, the majority of state <b>voters</b> <b>have</b> favored Republicans in presidential elections.
