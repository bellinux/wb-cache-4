40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTed C. SchroederThe {{livestock}} industry {{is susceptible to}} several diseases, of which Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is one. FMD is neither a fatal nor zoonotic animal disease, but most animals {{less than one year}} of age are killed in about 80 % of cases. FMD also causes reductions in yield and milk production. FMD is recognized as an economic disease because any outbreak will lead to a drastic reduction in the export market. This study is centered on livestock production in mid-western United States. The study incorporated the result from an epidemiology model into an equilibrium displacement model; this is used to determine the economic impact of the FMD outbreak on both consumers and producers. Three vaccination-to-die scenarios were simulated. Each scenario had 200 disease spread simulation runs. The economic impact results were presented with normal distribution curves in order to see how the economic impacts were distributed across the 200 runs in each scenario. Scenario 14 with 50 and 80 herds vaccination capacity at 22 and 40 days respectively, coupled with 50 km <b>vaccination</b> <b>zone</b> has the lowest negative impact on both consumer and producers. The diseases lasted for shorter period of time in scenario 14 than scenarios 2 and 12. Scenario 14 also has least number of animals killed. It can be concluded from the equilibrium displacement outcomes that the best mitigation strategy for the control of FMD is to have a large <b>vaccination</b> <b>zone</b> area, and increment in the vaccination capacity will also curb the disease on time...|$|E
40|$|The {{spread of}} H 5 N 1 avian {{influenza}} continues to pose an economic burden {{and a public}} health risk worldwide. Despite this, estimates of the transmissibility of infection exist in {{only a handful of}} settings and vary considerably. Using final size methods and flock-level infection data from a field trial of mass vaccination, we obtained the first estimates of the transmissibility of infection between and within flocks in Indonesia. We also found that outbreaks in areas designated as <b>vaccination</b> <b>zones</b> were less transmissible than in non-vaccination zones. However, this reduction is only comparable with a limited degree of protective vaccination coverage. Quantifying the overall effect of <b>vaccination</b> in these <b>zones</b> remains challenging. However, this result would appear to imply that, although the interventions applied in <b>vaccination</b> <b>zones</b> were not sufficient to completely prevent transmission in all areas, when outbreaks occur, they are less transmissible than those in areas where vaccination was not applied. This could be either a direct or an indirect effect of vaccination.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s, results of oral {{vaccination}} trials {{in several states}} have provided growing evidence that this vaccination method may be effective for controlling the spread of rabies in raccoons (Procyon lotor). This study examines the economic feasibility of using oral vaccination {{on a larger scale}} than previous trials. We analyze the benefits and costs associated with a hypothetical barrier that would stretch from Lake Erie to the Gulf of Mexico, combining natural geographic features provided by the Appalachian Mountains with oral <b>vaccination</b> <b>zones.</b> The goal of this barrier would be to prevent the raccoon rabies variant from moving west into broader geographic regions of the United States. The costs of establishing and maintaining this hypothetical barrier are compared to the avoided costs of not having to live with raccoon rabies west of its current distribution. The westward advance of raccoon rabies, if it is not contained, is projected using simple models based on constant rates of spread. Our results show that preventing the westward movement of raccoon rabies by combining an oral vaccination program with natural barriers may be economically feasible. Discounted costs of establishing and maintaining the barrier are estimated to total between US$ 58 million and US$ 148 million. Net benefits of program implementation range between US$ 48 million and US$ 496 million for a variety of models, including ones that exclude forgone pet vaccination expenditures. The analysis also provides a framework for developing future models to explore the benefits and costs of eliminating raccoon rabies from currently affected areas...|$|R

40|$|The central United States (U. S.) {{has a large}} {{livestock}} population including cattle, swine, sheep and goats. Simulation models were developed {{to assess the impact}} of livestock herd types and vaccination on foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks using the North American Animal Disease Spread Model. In this study, potential FMD virus outbreaks in the central region of the U. S. were simulated to compare different vaccination strategies to a depopulation only scenario. Based on data from the U. S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, a simulated population of 151, 620 livestock operations characterized by latitude and longitude, production type, and herd size was generated. For the simulations, a single 17, 000 head feedlot was selected as the initial latently infected herd in an otherwise susceptible population. Direct and indirect contact rates between herds were based on survey data of livestock producers in Kansas and Colorado. Control methods included ring vaccination around infected herds. Feedlots ≥ 3000 head were either the only production type that was vaccinated or were assigned the highest vaccination priority. Simulated vaccination scenarios included low and high vaccine capacity, vaccination zones of 10 km or 50 km around detected infected premises, and vaccination trigger of 10 or 100 detected infected herds. Probability of transmission following indirect contact, movement controls and contact rate parameters were considered uncertain and so were the subjects of sensitivity analysis. All vaccination scenarios decreased number of herds depopulated but not all decreased outbreak duration. Increased size of the <b>vaccination</b> <b>zone</b> during an outbreak decreased the length of the outbreak and number of herds destroyed. Increased size of the <b>vaccination</b> <b>zone</b> primarily resulted in vaccinating feedlots ≥ 3000 head across a larger area. Increasing the vaccination capacity had a smaller impact on the outbreak and may not be feasible if vaccine production and delivery is limited. The ability to vaccinate all the production types surrounding an infected herd did not appear as beneficial as priority vaccination of feedlot production types that have high numbers of indirect contacts. Outbreak duration, number of herds depopulated and the effectiveness of vaccination were sensitive to indirect contact transmission probability and movement restrictions. The results of this study will provide information about the impacts of disease control protocols which may be useful in choosing the optimal control methods to meet the goals of rapid effective control and eradication...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{timing of}} the {{biannual}} WHO influenza vaccine composition selection and production cycle has been historically directed to the influenza seasonality patterns in the temperate regions of {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres. Influenza activity, however, is poorly understood in the tropics with multiple peaks and identifiable year-round activity. The evidence-base needed to take informed decisions on vaccination timing and vaccine formulation is often lacking for the tropics and subtropics. This paper aims to assess influenza seasonality in the tropics and subtropics. It explores geographical grouping of countries into <b>vaccination</b> <b>zones</b> based on optimal timing of influenza vaccination. METHODS: Influenza seasonality was assessed by different analytic approaches (weekly proportion of positive cases, time series analysis, etc.) using FluNet and national surveillance data. In case of discordance in the seasonality assessment, consensus was built through discussions with in-country experts. Countries with similar onset periods of their primary influenza season were grouped into geographical zones. RESULTS: The number and period of peak activity was ascertained for 70 of the 138 countries in the tropics and subtropics. Thirty-seven countries had one and seventeen countries had two distinct peaks. Countries near the equator had secondary peaks or even identifiable year-round activity. The main influenza season in most of South America and Asia started between April and June. The start of the main season varied widely in Africa (October and December in northern Africa, April and June in Southern Africa and a mixed pattern in tropical Africa). Eight "influenza vaccination zones" (two each in America and Asia, and four in Africa and Middle East) were defined with recommendations for vaccination timing and vaccine formulation. The main limitation of our study is that FluNet and national surveillance data may lack the granularity to detect sub-national variability in seasonality patterns.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine and PathobiologyMichael W. SandersonThe last {{outbreak}} for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in the United States (U. S.) was in 1929. Since {{that time}} the U. S. has not had any exposure to the disease or vaccination, creating a very susceptible livestock population. The central U. S. has a large susceptible livestock population including cattle, swine, sheep, and goats. The impact of FMD in the U. S. would be devastating. Simulation modeling is the only avenue available to study the potential impacts of an introduction in the U. S. 	 Simulation models are dependent on accurate estimates of the frequency and distance distribution of contacts between livestock operations to provide valid model results for planning and decision making including {{the relative importance of}} different control strategies. Due to limited data on livestock movement rates and distance distribution for contacts a survey was conducted of livestock producers in Colorado and Kansas. These data fill a need for region specific contact rates to provide parameters for modeling a foreign animal disease. FMD outbreaks often require quarantine, depopulation and disposal of whole herds in order to prevent the continued spread of the disease. Experts were included in a Delphi survey and round table discussion to critically evaluate the feasibility of depopulating a large feedlot. No clearly acceptable method of rapidly depopulating a large feedlot was identified. Participants agreed that regardless of the method used for depopulation of cattle in a large feedlot, {{it would be very difficult}} to complete the task quickly, humanely, and be able to dispose of the carcasses in a timely fashion. Simulation models were developed to assess the impact of livestock herd types and vaccination on FMD outbreaks in the central U. S. using the North American Animal Disease Spread Model (NAADSM), a spatially explicit, stochastic state-transition simulation model. Simulation scenarios with large <b>vaccination</b> <b>zones</b> had decreased outbreak length and number of herds destroyed. Vaccination did not provide additional benefit to control compared to depopulation alone when biosecurity and movement controls were high, however the ability to achieve high levels of biosecurity and movement control may be limited by labor and animal welfare concerns...|$|R
30|$|Of late, however, {{outbreaks}} of FMD {{have been on}} the increase from 2006 to 2008, 2011 to 2012, to 2014 to 2015 (OIE 2015), even though some of these were in non-European Union (EU) export zones in northern Botswana. In order to realize accruable benefits derived from successful FMD control, Botswana together with other neighbouring states such as Namibia and South Africa has managed to secure OIE-certified FMD-free zones protected by a <b>vaccination</b> <b>zone</b> surrounding high-risk areas. Systems of elaborate networks of veterinary fences (approximately 10, 000  km) and quarantine camps as well as disease-surveillance programmes coupled with compulsory and free vaccination campaigns have been put in place throughout the country for decades (Letshwenyo et al. 2004). This has largely facilitated access to regional and international beef markets like South Africa {{and as far as the}} EU and Norway. These achievements, supported by a strong legal framework, have been anchored on the Diseases of Animals Act (1977) and other subsidiary legislation such as Movement of Stock (restriction) Order as well as Quarantine and Compensation regulations. Other pertinent legislation includes the Control of Livestock Industry Act as well as the Livestock and Meat Industries Act.|$|E

The national database of rabies outbreaks in Kazakhstan in the period 2003 - 2014 has been accessed in order to find which zones are consistently most exposed to the risk of rabies in animals. The database contains information on the cases in demes of farm livestock, domestic animals and wild animals. To identify the areas with the highest risk of outbreaks, we applied the maximum entropy modelling method. Designated outbreaks were used as input presence data, while the bioclim set of ecological and climatic variables, together with some geographic factors, were used as explanatory variables. The model demonstrated a high predictive ability. The area under the curve for farm livestock was 0. 782, for domestic animals - 0. 859 and for wild animals - 0. 809. Based on the model, the map of integral risk was designed by following four categories: negligible risk (disease-free or favourable zone), low risk (surveillance zone), medium risk (<b>vaccination</b> <b>zone),</b> and high risk (unfavourable zone). The map was produced to allow developing a set of preventive measures and is expected to contribute to a better distribution of supervisory efforts from the veterinary service of the country...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} wildlife {{reservoir of}} Mycobacterium bovis in Ireland is the European badger. Studies in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) {{have shown that}} badgers culled in association with cattle herd tuberculosis breakdowns (focal culling) have a higher prevalence of infection than the badger population at large. This observation is one rationale for the medium term national strategy of focal badger culling. A vaccination strategy for the control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in badgers is a preferred long-term option. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine {{has been shown to}} decrease disease severity in captive badgers under controlled conditions. As the vaccine has been tested in a controlled environment with precise information on infection pressure, it cannot be assumed a priori that the effects of vaccination are similar in the wild, where other environmental and/or ecological factors prevail. For this reason we have designed a vaccine field trial {{to assess the impact of}} vaccination on the incidence of TB infection in a wild badger population. The selected study area for the vaccine trial (approximately 755 square kilometers) is divided into three zones each of which has similar characteristics in terms of size, number of main badger setts, cattle herds, cattle and land classification type. Three vaccination levels (100 %, 50 % and 0 %) will be allocated to the three zones in a way that a gradient of vaccination coverage North to South is achieved. The middle zone (zone B) will be vaccinated at a 50 % coverage but zone A and C will be randomly allocated with 100 % or 0 % vaccination coverage. <b>Vaccination</b> within <b>zone</b> B will be done randomly at individual badger level. The objective of this paper is to describe the design of a field tuberculosis vaccination trial for badgers, the epidemiological methods that were used to design the trial and the subsequent data analysis.

40|$|Raccoon rabies is endemic in {{the eastern}} U. S.; however, an {{epizootic}} had not been confirmed on Long Island, New York until 2004. An oral rabies vaccination (ORV) program was initiated soon after the first rabies-positive raccoon was discovered, and continued until raccoon rabies was eliminated from the <b>vaccination</b> <b>zone.</b> The cost-effectiveness and economic impact of this rabies control program were unknown. A public health surveillance data set was evaluated following the ORV program on Long Island, and is used here {{as a case study}} in the health economics of rabies prevention and control efforts. A benefit-cost analysis was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the program, and a regional economic model was used to estimate the macroeconomic impacts of raccoon rabies elimination to New York State. The cost of the program, approximately $ 2. 6 million, was recovered within eight years by reducing costs associated with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and veterinary diagnostic testing of rabies suspect animals. By 2019, the State of New York is projected to benefit from the ORV program by almost $ 27 million. The benefit-cost ratio will reach 1. 71 in 2019, meaning that for every dollar spent on the program $ 1. 71 will be saved.

40|$|An {{epidemic}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) can have devastating effects on animal welfare, economic revenues, the export position and {{society as a}} whole, as occurred during the 2001 FMD epidemic in the Netherlands. Following the preemptive culling of 260, 000 animals during this outbreak, the Dutch government adopted emergency vaccination as preferred control policy. However, a vaccination-to-live strategy has not been applied before, posing unprecedented challenges for effectively controlling the epidemic, regaining FMD-free status and minimizing economic losses. These three topics are covered in an interdisciplinary model analysis. In this first part we evaluate whether and how emergency vaccination can be effectively applied to control FMD epidemics in the Netherlands. For this purpose we develop a stochastic individual-based model that describes FMD virus transmission between animals and between herds, taking heterogeneity between host species (cattle, sheep and pigs) into account. Our results in a densely populated livestock area with > 4 farms/km 2 show that emergency ring vaccination can halt the epidemic as rapidly as preemptive ring culling, while {{the total number of}} farms to be culled is reduced by a factor of four. To achieve this reduction a larger control radius around detected farms and a corresponding adequate vaccination capacity is needed. Although sufficient for the majority of simulated epidemics with a 2 km <b>vaccination</b> <b>zone,</b> the vaccination capacity available in the Netherlands can be exhausted by pig farms that are on average ten times larger than cattle herds. Excluding pig farms from vaccination slightly increases the epidemic, but more than halves the number of animals to be vaccinated. Hobby flocks – modelled as small-sized sheep flocks – do not {{play a significant role in}} propagating the epidemic, and need not be targeted during the control phase. In a more sparsely populated livestock area in the Netherlands with about 2 farms/km 2 the minimal control strategy of culling only detected farms seems sufficient to control an epidemi...|$|E
40|$|The thermostability of {{vaccines}} is {{of crucial}} importance in Africa, where the logistical process {{to get the}} vaccine from the manufacturer to the animal may take months, and in many remote regions transport and storage is {{in the absence of}} a cold-chain. Vaccines with improved stability and less reliance on a cold-chain are needed and could improve the longevity of immune responses elicited in vaccinated animals. In South Africa, cattle in the <b>vaccination</b> <b>zone</b> neighbouring the Kruger National Park have to be vaccinated thrice annually because of declining antibody responses at three months postvaccination. FMDV is known to be unstable, especially for O and SAT 2 serotypes in mildly acidic pH conditions or at elevated temperatures, leading to dissociation of the capsid (146 S particle) and loss of immunogenicity. The link between rapidly declining antibody responses and capsid stability have been reported by Doel and Baccarini, 1981. We hypothesized that more stable viruses, especially thermostability, will not only improve the protective immune response in animals but also require less frequent booster vaccinations. The residues at the capsid inter-pentamer interfaces, and their interactions, are important for the infectivity and stability of the virion and mutations adjacent to these interfaces have an effect on the conformational stability of FMDV. However, experimental studies on the relative importance of residues and molecular interactions in viral capsid assembly, disassembly, and/or stability are still very limited, especially for the SAT serotypes of FMDV. This study investigated the effects of potential residues at the pentameric interfaces that are responsible for increased thermostability and potentially improved stability candidates were tested in small (guinea pigs) and large (cattle) animal vaccination trials to understand the role of stabilised antigens on immune responses. The biological variation in biophysical stability in SAT 2 viruses in the southern Africa region was investigated to determine if any naturally occurring viruses have greater capsid thermostability. Naturally occurring stable viruses could be used as prospective candidates in vaccine production and therefore potentially result in increased duration of immune responses. Our first aim was to investigate the role of different amino acid changes at the interface and their effect on capsid stability using models derived by Oxford University. These changes were introduced by mutating the SAT 2 ZIM 7 / 83 infectious genome-length clone (pSAT 2) to derive mutated chimeric SAT 2 viruses. We quantified the stabilizing effects of these mutations by using various stability assays. We established the novel thermofluor shift assay that is able to quantify the capsid stability of viruses. The growth kinetics, antigenicity, genetic stability, pH and salt sensitivity were investigated for each of the genetically engineered viruses (Chapters 2 and 3). The second aim was to further our understanding on the correlation between improved stability and immune responses by performing small animal (Chapter 2) and large animals trials in cattle (Chapter 4) and comparing stabilised and wild-type antigens. This study for the first time for SAT vaccines, determined differences in IgG 1 and IgG 2 profiles, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) responses and differences in total and neutralising antibodies of stabilised and wild-type antigens over a six month period in cattle (Chapter 4). Animals were intra-dermolingually challenged with live virus to determine levels of protection the antigens have afforded. In addition, a third aim will be to better understand the inherent thermostability variation of SAT 2 viruses in the Southern African region (Chapter 5) by establishing a protocol for screening field isolates as potential vaccine strains and correlating their stability to amino acid residues at the interface of the 146 S particles.

To better {{understand some of the}} components necessary, I studied the habitat preferences and home range of skunks, an alternative skunk capture method, and surveyed the knowledge base of medical providers practicing across the state. I radiocollared 99 skunks from the Houston, Texas metropolitan area and monitored skunk movements from March 2004 ?June 2006. To accelerate progress of this study, I captured 93 of 99 skunks using a dip net. Dip netting allowed for an effective collection alternative to cage trapping. Movement data indicated a strong preference for short grass areas (82 %), however, habitat use changed to remote, brushy areas when temperatures were ? 7 C. Habitat use during the year was different (P = 0. 001), with December 2004, January 2005, and February 2005 significantly (P = 0. 001) different from one another. Additionally, habitat use during December 2005, February 2006, and March 2006 were significantly different (P = 0. 045, P = 0. 098, and P = 0. 003, respectively). Data from 20 skunks, covering multiple seasons, were analyzed for home range use. I found male home range use averaged 255 ha (217 ? 345), while females averaged 126 ha (60 ? 218). Male range use was significantly larger than females (P = 0. 005). No significant seasonal movements were observed. Lastly, I conducted a survey of 297 Texas primary care medical providers to assess their knowledge of rabies vaccine procedures and their experience with rabies vaccines. Small town providers within the oral rabies <b>vaccination</b> baiting <b>zone</b> were more aware of rabies prophylaxis (P 95 % of 297) rarely saw patients for rabies prophylaxis.

Learning from years of experience in the eradication of CSF using o. i. in Baden-Wurttemberg and other federal states, North Rhine-Westphalia incorporated o. i. as a further effective method into the CSF eradication program in addition to hunting and hygiene measures to combat epidemics, based on the eradication program of Rhineland Palatinate before the first CSF-virus (CSFV) -infection had been detected. Using a CSF attenuated live vaccine based on the “China-strain” (C-strain) in maize baits (RIEMSER Schweinepestoralvakzine, RIEMSER Arzneimittel AG, Greifswald, Isle of Riems), oral immunisation was performed as a continuous strategy using three double vaccination periods per year (except 2003). The questionnaire data allowed an evaluation of the eradication procedure of o. i. In combination with the data from the CSF-database it provided the basis of causal research into the re-emergence of CSF in 2005. Between 2002 and 2004, hunters had to fill out questionnaires on the distribution and placement of baits in each case. Questionnaire information was related to the nine concerned CSF-affected hunting communities and used for the assessment of other aspects such as respective soil conditions and meteorological data. Data from the CSF-database referring to serological and virological findings of all wild boars examined could also be classified according to the place where individual boars were killed or found dead and to their age. A descriptive analysis of the CSF-database serological data revealed {{a significant difference in the}} seroprevalence rates of different age groups. Piglets had low seroprevalences as opposed to sub-adults and adults. In addition, virusprevalence rates showed even greater differences between piglets and sub-adults as well as adults. The fact that virusprevalence is higher among the youngest age class underlines once again the crucial role of piglets in the perpetuation of a CSF-epidemic. Significant differences between hunting communities of the hot-spot-area (hunting communities with the highest number of positive CSF virus detection) and the other hunting communities were assessed by statistical analysis of serological and virological data. The hot-spot-area consists of the hunting communities of Bad Münstereifel and Euskirchen. The use of a conventional live vaccine did not allow distinguishing between antibodies resulting from field infection and vaccination. For that reason, the influence of o. i. could be evaluated only indirectly. In the near future, this differentiation could be brought about by the use of a DIVA-vaccine (differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals) in combination with a sensitive diagnostic technique. The influence of the herd immunity, however, could be verified. Also, the consequences of the missing summer immunisation of 2003 could clearly be ascertained. Furthermore, the analysis of the questionnaire data allowed inferences on possible causes of the less effective vaccination campaigns from 2002 until 2004. Especially in the hot-spot-area of Bad Münstereifel several shortcomings in the distribution of baits were revealed. Furtheron, insufficient observations of animals and the wrong size of the <b>vaccination</b> <b>zones</b> constituted major problems. The analysis of the hunting bag, classified for age groups and hunting communities, also shows that during the CSF eradication program, the quantity of pigs taken was not significantly increased as required; the proportion of piglets remained at an average of 54 %. The documentation of the course of the seroprevalence rates showed a significant increase in all age groups at the beginning of 2006, when the new immunisation phase had started. Differences in the seroprevalence rates between the piglets and the older though were maintained. In conclusion: The re-emergence of CSF in the county of Euskirchen in 2005 was caused by multiple factors, including shortcomings in the execution of the o. i., especially in the hot-spot-area, a missing summer immunisation in 2003 and a far too small hunting bag to effectively reduce the wild boar population. However, for the control of epidemics, a o. i. strategy with three double vaccination periods per year in combination with hunting and hygiene measures is an appropriate method for CSF eradication in wild boar populations. An area extensive, long-term and individual strategy for planning and executing an immunisation program is required, into which hunters have to be involved by constant interaction with officials. After the successful eradication of CSF, a directed and long-term examination of hunted wild boars of defined age groups is essential for the prevention and early detection of CSF re-emergence. Due to directed examinations of wild boars in 2005, it was possible to detect such re-emergence and start eradication at an early stage. In the northern part of the Eifel (North Rhine-Westphalia) the crucial role of young wild boars (piglets) in the perpetuation of CSF was again underlinded. In future, all efforts to eradicate CSF will have to be focused on this age group...|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (Fmd) Is an acute, highly {{contagious}} {{viral infection}} {{of domestic and}} wild cloven-hoofed animals. The virus is a single-stranded rna virus that has {{a high rate of}} nucleotide mutation and amino acid substitution. In southern africa the south african territories (Sat) 1 - 3 Sero-types of fmd virus are maintained by large numbers of african buffaloes (Syncerus caffer), Which provide a potential source of infection for domestic livestock and wild animals. During february 2001, an outbreak of sat- 2 was recorded in cattle in the fmd control zone of south africa, adjacent to the kruger national park (Knp). They had not been vaccinated against the disease since they form the buffer between the <b>vaccination</b> and free <b>zones</b> but {{in the face of the}} outbreak, they were vaccinated as part of the control measures to contain the disease. The virus was, however, isolated from some of them on several occasions up to may 2001. These isolates were characterized to determine the rate of genetic change in the main antigenic determinant, the 1 d/ 2 a gene. Nucleotide substitutions at 12 different sites were identified of which five led to amino acid changes. Three of these occurred in known antigenic sites, viz. The gh-loop and c-terminal part of the protein, and two of these have previously been shown to be subject to positive selection. Likelihood models indicated that the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes among the outbreak sequences recovered from cattle was four times higher than among comparable sequences isolated from wildlife, suggesting that the virus may be under greater selective pressure during rapid transmission event...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an ex-ante economic analysis, comparing six alternative control {{strategies for the}} eradication of Bluetongue virus 8 against five incursion scenarios in cattle and sheep populations. The economic analysis assumes a common baseline unavoidable cost {{of public and private}} measures that together contribute to prevention of incursion of BTV 8 into Scotland. These costs continue over the five year horizon of this analysis regardless of whether a BTV 8 epidemic ensues in Scotland and their total present value was found to be approximately £ 141 m over the 5 year period. The benefit of this investment is the costs of a BTV 8 outbreak avoided; which depends on the time, location and nature of the incursion, on the control strategies adopted to counter each incursion, on the persistence of the incursion and on the opportunities to mitigate the damage. Specific variations in all these aspects were explored. The benefit-cost ratios were ranked within each incursion scenario to evaluate the efficiency of control outlays. Although the economic model found that benefit-cost ratios were greater than 1 for all interventions strategies examined, the control strategy option with 100 % <b>vaccination</b> and protection <b>zone</b> set at Scottish Borders were economically preferable. This implies that if avoided this control option would deliver the greatest benefit from investment in baseline prevention costs. However, in terms of outbreak losses, this vaccination strategy was always most costly. On the other hand, the control strategy with 50 % vaccination and all Scotland as a protection zone often provides the lowest benefits in all control options examinedbluetongue virus, epidemiology, direct and indirect costs, benefit analysis, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R
