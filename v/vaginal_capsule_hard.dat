40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of two vaginal progesterone formulations, Crinone gel and Utrogestan capsules, for luteal phase support in blastocyst stage embryo transfers. Materials and MethodsWe analyzed 460 consecutive cycles in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) –blastocyst transfer (BT) treatment at our institution between January 2004 and December 2007. Patients applied either Crinone 8 % vaginal gel (90 mg, once daily) or Utrogestan <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> (200 mg, four times daily) for luteal supplementation. Progesterone was administered from the day of oocyte retrieval to pregnancy confirmation. Clinical pregnancy and implantation rates were the main outcome measures. ResultsThe clinical pregnancy rate (58. 7 % vs. 44. 3 %) and implantation rate (32. 04 % vs. 23. 89 %) were significantly higher in the Crinone group compared with the Utrogestan group after IVF/ICSI–BT treatment. ConclusionLuteal phase support with Crinone 8 % vaginal gel (90 mg daily) resulted in better clinical pregnancy and implantation rates than Utrogestan <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> (200 mg, 4 times daily) in IVF/ICSI–BT cycles...|$|R
40|$|Background In IVF, Luteal phase {{support is}} usually {{performed}} using vaginal progesterone. A part of patients using this route reports being uncomfortable with this route. We tried to study whether the rectal route {{could be an}} effective alternative and associated with less discomfort. Patients and Methods A prospective randomized controlled study. All patient were eligible for IVF treatment for infertility. After oocyte pickup, 186 patients were allocated to one the following protocols for luteal phase support: (i) rectal pessaries group: natural progesterone pessaries administered rectally 200 mg three times a day, (ii) vaginal pessaries group: natural progesterone pessaries administered vaginally 200 mg three times a day), and (iii) <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> group: natural micronized progesterone capsules administered vaginally 200 mg three times a day. On the day of pregnancy test, patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire conducted by an investigator {{in order to assess}} the tolerability and side effects of the LPS treatment taken. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of perineal irritation. Results Fifty eight patients were assigned to the rectal pessaries group, 68 patients to the vaginal pessaries group, and 60 patients to the <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> group. All patients adhered to their allocated treatment. Implantation and clinical pregnancy rates per transfer did not differ between the three groups. Perineal irritation, which was our primary endpoint, was the same for all the three groups (respectively 1. 7 % versus 5. 9 % versus 11. 7 %). Regarding the other side effects, more patients experienced constipation and flatulence with the rectal route, whereas more patients reported vaginal discharge in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> group.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Progesterone is {{essential}} to maintain a healthy pregnancy. Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and a Cochrane review called for a definitive trial to test whether or not progesterone therapy in the first trimester could {{reduce the risk of}} miscarriage in women with a history of unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM). The PROMISE trial was conducted to answer this question. A concurrent cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted. DESIGN AND SETTING A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international multicentre study, with economic evaluation, conducted in hospital settings across the UK (36 sites) and in the Netherlands (nine sites). PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS Women with unexplained RM (three or more first-trimester losses), aged between 18 and 39 years at randomisation, conceiving naturally and giving informed consent, received either micronised progesterone (Utrogestan(®), Besins Healthcare) at a dose of 400 [*]mg (two <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> of 200 [*]mg) or placebo <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules</b> twice daily, administered vaginally from soon after a positive urinary pregnancy test (and no later than 6 weeks of gestation) until 12 completed weeks of gestation (or earlier if the pregnancy ended before 12 weeks). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Live birth beyond 24 completed weeks of gestation (primary outcome), clinical pregnancy at 6 - 8 weeks, ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks, miscarriage, gestation at delivery, neonatal survival at 28 days of life, congenital abnormalities and resource use. METHODS Participants were randomised after confirmation of pregnancy. Randomisation was performed online via a secure internet facility. Data were collected on four occasions of outcome assessment after randomisation, up to 28 days after birth. RESULTS A total of 1568 participants were screened for eligibility. Of the 836 women randomised between 2010 and 2013, 404 received progesterone and 432 received placebo. The baseline data (age, body mass index, maternal ethnicity, smoking status and parity) of the participants were comparable in the two arms of the trial.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the dissolution rate and bioavailability, solid dispersions of evodiamine in PVP K 30 with different enriched samples of evodiamine to PVP K 30 ratios were prepared by solvent method. Our studies showed that the dissolution rate of evodiamine was significantly higher in the solid dispersion system in comparison with that in enriched samples of evodiamine or physical mixtures. The increase of the dissolution rate was evidently related to the ratio of evodiamine to PVP K 30. The solid dispersion system (enriched samples of evodiamine/PVP K 30 = 1 / 6, w/w) gave the highest dissolution rate: about 27. 7 -fold {{higher than that of}} enriched samples of evodiamine in <b>hard</b> <b>capsules.</b> Powder X-ray diffraction studies showed that enriched samples of evodiamine presented a total chemical stability after its preparation as solid dispersions.

40|$|Lactobacillus crispatus {{is one of}} the {{predominant}} hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) -producing species found in the vagina and is under development as a probiotic for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. In this study, we assessed whether DNA fingerprinting by repetitive element sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) can be used to distinguish the capsule strain of L. crispatus (CTV- 05) from other endogenous strains as well as other species of vaginal lactobacilli. Vaginal and rectal lactobacilli were identified to the species level by using whole-chromosome probe DNA hybridization. The DNAs from L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, and an as-yet-unnamed H 2 O 2 -negative Lactobacillus species designated 1086 V were subjected to rep-PCR. The results of gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining of the DNA fingerprints obtained were compared. L. crispatus CTV- 05 had a unique DNA fingerprint compared to all other lactobacilli. DNA fingerprints for 27 production lots of L. crispatus sampled from 1994 through 2001 were identical to that of the original strain isolated in 1993, suggesting strain stability. In a pilot study of nine women, this DNA fingerprinting method distinguished CTV- 05 from other endogenous vaginal lactobacilli prior to and after <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsule</b> use. rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting is useful for strain typing and for evaluating longitudinal loss or acquisition of vaginal lactobacilli used as probiotics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate if supplementary lactobacilli treatment could improve the initial cure rate after vaginal clindamycin therapy, and secondly, if lactobacilli as repeated adjunct treatment during 3 menstrual cycles could lengthen the time to relapse after initial cure. Methods Women (n = 100) with bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by Amsel criteria were after informed consent offered vaginal clindamycin therapy followed by <b>vaginal</b> gelatine <b>capsules</b> containing either 10 9 freeze-dried lactobacilli or identical placebo capsules for 10 days during 3 menstrual cycles in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Results The initial intent to treat (ITT) analysis for the one-month cure rate was 64 % in the lactobacilli group and 78 % in the placebo group (p > 0. 05). However, any patient with missing or unclassified smears at the initial visit who continued the study and whose next smear indicated a cure was included in the cured group; the study also excluded two of the patients in the lactobacilli group who reported that they did not take any <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsules.</b> With consideration to these population changes, the initial cure rate would be 77 % in the lactobacilli group. The 76 cured women were followed for 6 menstrual cycles or until relapse within that time span. At the end of the study, 64. 9 % (24 / 37) of the lactobacilli treated women were still BV-free compared to 46. 2 % (18 / 39) of the placebo treated women. Comparison of the two groups regarding "Time from cure to relapse" was statistically significant (p = 0. 027) in favour of the lactobacilli treatment. Adjuvant therapy with lactobacilli contributed significantly to avoidance of relapse with a proportional Hazard Risk ratio (HR) of 0. 73 (0. 54 – 0. 98) (p Conclusion The study shows that supplementary treatment combining two different strains of probiotic lactobacilli does not improve the efficacy of BV therapy during the first month of treatment, but for women initially cured, adjunct treatment of lactobacilli during 3 menstrual cycles lengthens the time to relapse significantly in that more women remained BV free at the end of the 6 -month follow up.

40|$|Background: Bacterial vaginosis is a {{condition}} of unknown etiology, associated with an imbalance of the normal vaginal microbiota, characterized by a high recurrence rate despite of classical therapy solutions. Probiotics are microorganisms, which taken in adequate amounts, are proven to bring health benefits in human and animal bodies, by re-establishing the normal flora at different levels. Objective: The present article studies {{the possibility of using}} probiotic treatment as an adjuvant therapy for nonspecific vaginosis and reducing its recurrence rate. Methods: We have evaluated the evolution of patients with bacterial vaginosis who received the classical antibiotic therapy and a probiotic product. The study group consisted of 173 non-pregnant, sexually active patients, 20 - 45 years old, with no additional health problems and no contraceptive undergoing treatment, which have been admitted to the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Bucharest Emergency University Hospital between 1. 01. 2012 - 31. 12. 2012. The bacteriological evaluation was made on cervical and vaginal cultures.

The most frequent causes are Candida albicans (85 - 95 %) or C. glabrata, and infrequently C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. pseudotropicalis, etc. Objective. The {{aim of the}} study was to investigate efficiency and safety of fenticonazole for vaginal candidiasis treatment. Methods. Therapeutic effect of a single 600 mg fenticonasole <b>vaginal</b> <b>capsule</b> was observed in 417 women, aged 16 - 67, in five centers in Serbia. In all women, before the treatment, vaginal candidiasis was confirmed by testing of vaginal smear. Based on smear findings and associated symptoms observed on the 7 th and 28 th day after therapy administration, treatment results were evaluated. On the next day after drug application the patients recorded by using a questionnaire their own feelings on withdrawal symptoms and possible side effects in the period prior to the first control. Results. Control after seven days showed a statistically significant decrease of symptoms. In 385 women, vaginal smear was found negative to yeast and yeast blastospores. Within the first seven days after treatment 84 women had to repeat therapy due to the persistence of symptoms or positive vaginal smear. After 28 days we recorded full recovery in 392 patients, clinical improvement in eight, no change in 16, and deterioration in one patient only. Side effects were very seldom, mostly in the form of a slight redness of the vulva and vagina, and mild itching during several days. Conclusion.

40|$|ABSTRACT – Purpose: The {{therapeutic}} equivalence {{of multiple}} registered fenofibrate formulations, several {{of which are}} suprabioavailable and therefore marketed at lower dosage strengths than their reference products, {{is based on the}} results of bioequivalence studies. Most of these formulations show a higher bioavailability when taken with a high-fat meal. The relative bioavailability of two of these formulations, the 200 mg Lidose <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> and the 145 mg nanoparticle tablets, was assessed when taken with a high-fat meal. Methods: In this single dose, 2 -way, randomized, crossover study, 24 healthy subjects received a 200 mg fenofibrate Lidose <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> (Test) and a 145 mg nanoparticle tablet (Reference) under high-fat fed conditions. Plasma concentrations of fenofibric acid were measured up to 72 hours by using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Results: The geometric mean ratios (Test/Reference) and the 90 % confidence intervals for AUC 0 -t and Cmax were 1. 37 (131. 58 – 142. 88) and 1. 38 (124. 60 – 152. 93), respectively.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{production of}} gelling agent agar mainb relies on marine algae {{of the class}} Rhodophyceae - Gracilariales and Gelidiales. Agar is hydrophilic colloidi composed of polysaccharides, agarose and agaropectine, which have strong gelling ability for many applications on pharmaceutical Industries. This study conductea th" potential of seaweed extracts Gracillaria venucosa from South Sulawesi based on the gel sirength characteristic for pharmaceutical purposes, particularly the rnaterial of <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> shells. Gracillaria verrucosa collected from Sinjai, Takalar and Palopo in South Sulawesi was extracted using acid extraction procedures and the gel strength of the extracts were determined using Nikhan Shee set. The gel strength values of Gracillaria verucosa extract from Sinjai, Takalar and Palopo are ll 0 g/cm 2, 163 g/cn*, 250 glcr* respectively. Among these three regions, the extract collected from Takalar and Palopo are eligible {{to be used as}} <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> shell material due to their gel strength characteristics. None of these e) ffracts meets the export standard requirements for widely-used industrial production...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) for improving oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drug, silymarin. The pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed using ethyl linoleate, Cremophor EL, ethyl alcohol, and normal saline to identify the efficient self-microemulsification region. The particle size and its distribution of the resultant microemulsions were determined using dynamic light scattering. The optimal formulation with the best self-microemulsifying and solubilization ability consisted of 10 % (w/w) of ethyl linoleate, 30 % of Cremophor EL, and 60 % of ethyl alcohol. The release of silymarin from SMEDDS was significantly faster than that from the commercial silymarin preparation <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> (Legalon®). The bioavailability results indicated that the oral absorption of silymarin SMEDDS was enhanced about 2. 2 -fold compared with the <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> in fasted dogs. It could be concluded that SMEDDS would be a promising drug delivery system for poorly water-soluble drugs by the oral route...|$|R
40|$|Poison baiting is used {{frequently}} {{to reduce the}} impacts of pest species of mammals on agricultural and biodiversity interests. However, baiting may not be appropriate if non-target species {{are at risk of}} poisoning. Here we use a desktop decision tree approach to assess the risks to non-target vertebrate species in Australia that arise from using poison baits developed to control feral house cats (Felis catus). These baits are presented in the form of sausages with toxicant implanted in the bait medium within an acid-soluble polymer <b>capsule</b> (<b>hard</b> shell delivery vehicle, or HSDV) that disintegrates after ingestion. Using criteria based on body size, diet and feeding behaviour, we assessed 221 of Australia’s 3, 769 native vertebrate species as likely to consume cat-baits, with 47 of these likely to ingest implanted HSDVs too. Carnivorous marsupials were judged most likely to consume both the baits and HSDVs, with some large-bodied and ground-active birds and reptiles also consuming them. If criteria were relaxed, a further 269 species were assessed as possibly able to consume baits and 343 as possibly able to consume HSDVs; most of these consumers were birds. One threatened species, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) was judged as definitely able to consume baits with implanted HSDVs, whereas five threatened species of birds and 21 species of threatened mammals were rated as possible consumers. Amphibia were not considered to be at risk. We conclude that most species of native Australian vertebrates would not consume surface-laid baits during feral cat control programs, and that significantly fewer would be exposed to poisoning if HSDVs wer...|$|R
50|$|Anaphes nitens is {{native to}} southeastern Australia. The adult wasps feed on nectar and honeydew, but the larvae are {{carnivorous}} and feed on the eggs of the gum tree snout beetle (Gonipterus scutellatus). Both this beetle and its larvae feed on the young leaves, buds and shoots of various species of Eucalyptus, causing a slowing of growth of the tree, a contortion of the twigs and sometimes a dieback of the branches. The female snout beetle lays batches of about ten eggs enclosed in <b>capsules</b> with <b>hard</b> shells. The female wasp deposits her eggs in the egg capsules and the developing wasp larvae feed on the snout beetle eggs inside the capsule.|$|R
