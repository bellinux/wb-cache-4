Factors which pose difficulty for license plate imaging cameras include {{the speed of the}} vehicles being recorded, <b>varying</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> ambient light, headlight glare and harsh environmental conditions. Most dedicated license plate capture cameras will incorporate infrared illumination in order to solve the problems of lighting and plate reflectivity.|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, a fixed frame-level {{quantizer}} (set by the user) does not deliver a constant level of quality. Instead, {{it is an}} arbitrary metric that will provide a somewhat <b>varying</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> quality, depending on the contents of each frame. Given two files of identical sizes, the one encoded at an average bitrate should look better than the one encoded with a fixed quantizer (variable bitrate). Constant quantizer encoding can be used, however, to accurately determine the minimum and maximum bitrates possible for encoding a given video.|$|E
