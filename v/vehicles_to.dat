It was developed by Rare, published by Nintendo, and released in March 1997 in Japan and North America. A wider release followed {{at the end of that}} year.|$|E

40|$|In {{a future}} {{scenario}} electric vehicles (EV) could be operated in <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid (V 2 G) mode {{to support the}} national and renewable energy electricity grid by providing ancillary services such as peak shaving and frequency regulation. While developing financial models to price these services {{it is important to}} include the impact of <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid operation on the power-delivery components of these Electric Vehicles. Considerable amount of academic research has been focused on understanding the impact of <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid operation on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). However, information about the impact of <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid operation on the fuel cells (FCs) of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) and Fuel Cell Range Extender Electric Vehicles (FCREEVs) is scarce. Long term tests are required to asses the impact of <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid operation on these fuel cells. The fuel tank volume limitation of the TU Delft Hyundai FCEV does not allow for long term <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid experiments using the operational <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid set-up at the TU Delft Green Village site. Furthermore, there exist limited control over the power management strategy programmed in the Hyundai FCEV; the power management strategy defining the load cycle it’s Fuel Cell undergoes in <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid operation. This study therefore proposes a method to conduct simulated long term <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid experiments on a laboratory test bench. The method has also been applied, and the impact of simulated <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid operation on the Fuel Cell of the PEMFC test bench estimated. Most importantly, the experimental conditions simulated on the laboratory test-bench were derived from data recorded in the Hyundai FCEV during actual <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid operation. Simulated <b>Vehicle</b> <b>to</b> Grid operation under three aging cycles: high constant load (CC 1), low constant load (CC 2) and cyclic load (CC 3), was found to cause a performance loss in the range of 31. 4 μV h 1 to 40. 9 μV h 1, 62. 5 μV h 1 to 63. 9 μV h 1 and 36. 1 μV h 1 to 92. 4 μV h 1 respectively...|$|R

5|$|In {{the final}} {{two weeks before the}} test, some 250 {{personnel}} from Los Alamos were at work at the Trinity site, and Lieutenant Bush's command had ballooned to 125 men guarding and maintaining the base camp.

They had enough <b>vehicles</b> <b>to</b> move 450 people to safety, and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation. Groves had warned the Governor of New Mexico, John J.
