5|$|The Mendip Hills are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous Limestone upland in Britain.

5|$|The {{island is}} formed of Carboniferous Limestone {{and is often}} {{described}} as geologically a continuation of the Mendip Hills at Brean Down; however, the dip is at a different angle to that on Brean Down.

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Devonian period (400 Mya) the sea was retreating from the Welsh Basin as the land was thrust up by the collision of land masses, forming a new range of mountains, the Welsh Caledonides. The strata were compressed and deformed, and in places, the clay minerals recrystallised, developing a grain that allowed parallel cleavage, making it easy to split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate. In the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 Mya), erosion of the mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones. A reinvasion of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone, and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of coal measures. Southwestern Wales, in particular, was affected by the <b>Variscan</b> <b>orogeny,</b> a period when continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata.|$|E

Cambro-Silurian deposition has been influenced by partly synsedimentary movements (among others Ordovician-Silurian uplift south of the Brabant/Condroz zone, such as the Stavelot-Venn Massif). Presence, respectively absence of important late Caledonian deformation has subdivided northwestern Europe into three major sedimentary environments during the Devono-Carboniferous: the Caledonian fold belt and the Cornwall-Rhenish Basin which are separated by the Belgo-Dutch platform. Subsequently, the Hercynian or <b>Variscan</b> <b>orogenies</b> have gradually reduced the sedimentary area and produced the overall withdrawal of the marine environment.

50|$|The post rift phase {{followed}} late Jurassic rift events {{during the}} late Mesozoic and Cenozoic thermal subsidence. As the rifting stopped, then regional subsidence occurred creating an intracratonic sedimentary basin. Subsidence occurred due to lithosphere cooling. Some of this uplift was along old lines of weakness from the Caledonian and <b>Variscan</b> <b>Orogenies</b> long before. Intraplate compression was caused when the Atlantic Ocean basin formed. the Mid-Atlantic spreading ridge has been busy separating east from west. Greenland separated from North America and the rifting altered direction during the Paleogene, which caused Northern Europe to separate from Greenland.

40|$|Abstract: The Celtic Sea, {{offshore}} southern Ireland, is underlain {{by several}} discrete rift basins, which {{are part of}} a larger set of such basins that developed marginal to the North Atlantic within the tectonic framework of Pangaean break-up and episodic opening of the North Atlantic Ocean. This paper documents he development of depositional systems within a rift basin setting by analysis of thesequence stratigraphic evolution of the North Celtic Sea Basin, the largest basin i the area, with particular emphasis on the influence of pre-existing structural fabric on that evolution. The Caledonian and <b>Variscan</b> <b>orogenies</b> each imprinted istinct structural grains on this area, and the intersecting pattern of their respective tectonic trends provided the structural framework which influenced subsequent Triassic, Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous phases of rifting. Detailed analysis of an extensive well and seismic database indicates that the mode of reactivation of pre-existing lines of structural weakness depended on the orientation of the principal extensional stress direction relative to these lineaments.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the impact of orogenic inheritance {{on the characteristics of}} hyperextended rift systems we develop new mapping methods highlighting the first-order architecture and timing of hyperextended rifts, as well as the distribution of heterogeneities inherited from previous orogenies. We use these to characterize the North Atlantic rift system and adjacent areas affected by the Palaeozoic Caledonian and <b>Variscan</b> <b>orogenies.</b> Comparison of these maps demonstrates major differences in the behaviour of the North Atlantic rift relative to both orogens, the Variscan front appearing to be a major limit. Indeed, the rift cuts through the Caledonian orogen and parallels its structural grain, while it circumvents the core of the Variscides. In addition, rifting is protracted and polyphase, and breakup is magma-rich North to the Variscan front, as opposed to the South where a single, apparently continuous extensional event lead to magma-poor breakup in less than 50 Myr. These observations point to a major influence of orogenic inheritance on the characteristics of hyperextended rift systems. On the other hand, our study supports that rifts reactivate sutures corresponding to former large (> 2 000 km) oceans, while leaving sutures of small (< 500 – 1 000 km) oceanic basins little affected, suggesting a significant impact of the pre-orogenic histories on subsequent extensional processes...|$|R

The results of those processes are large plains in the Sava River valley and the Kupa River valley.

40|$|The Lower Palaeozoic {{succession}} at Parys Mountain overlies a Precambrian basement (the Iona Series). This succession {{consists of}} Ordovician slates, overlain by, {{and in part}} interbedded with, Ordovician dacitic and rhyolitic volcanics, which in turn are unconformably overlain by Silurian slates. Both basement and Palaeozoic rocks have been deformed during Caledonian and <b>Variscan</b> <b>orogenies.</b> The resultant structure of Parys Mountain is interpreted as an east-north-easterly trending, single syncline overturned to the north. Many primary extrusive characters are retained by the volcanic rocks, despite {{the high degree of}} deformation. The lithologies and textures allow subdivision and interpretation of these rocks as dacite, lithic tuff, siliceous sinter, rhyolitic tuff, rhyolitic ignimbrite, rhyolitic tuff-lava, and rhyolitic lava. The results of 61 bulk chemical analyses are interpreted to show that the volcanism was of the orogenic calc-alkaline type from a continental margin/island arc environment. The magmas probably result from either partial melting of the crustal part of the oceanic lithosphere on a Benioff zone, or partial melting of the mantle, above a Benioff zone, under high load pressures and high water pressures. The mineral deposits are largely confined within the volcanic succession though some occur in the Ordovician and Silurian slates near to their contacts with the volcanics. The majority of the deposits form conformable lenses and tabular bodies, with subordinate deposits as veins and stockworks. The ore mineral assemblages are of chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite, and pyrite. The general paragenetic sequence (73 sections) is pyrite [...] chalcopyrite [...] galena-sphalerite. The main mineralization episode is interpreted to be syngenetic, genetically related to the volcanism. The veins and stockworks probably result from Caledonian and Variscan remobilization of the primary mineralization. Trace element analyses (Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Co, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ba, Sr), on 350 specimens, detected anomalous concentrations of these elements around the mineralized zones, though some occur where no mineralization was found.
