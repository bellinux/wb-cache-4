40|$|Because {{influenza}} <b>viral</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> {{in vitro}} is greatly {{enhanced by the}} addition of a primer dinucleotide, ApG or GpG, we have proposed that <b>viral</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> in vivo requires initiation by primer RNAs synthesized by the host cell, specifically by RNA polymerase II, thereby explaining the α-amanitin sensitivity of <b>viral</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> in vivo. Here, we identify such primer RNAs, initially in reticulocyte extracts, where they are shown to be globin mRNAs. Purified globin mRNAs very effectively stimulated <b>viral</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> in vitro, and the resulting transcripts directed the synthesis of all the nonglycosylated virus-specific proteins in micrococcal nuclease-treated L cell extracts. The viral RNA transcripts synthesized in vitro primed by ApG also directed the synthesis of the nonglycosylated virus-specific proteins, but the globin mRNA-primed transcripts were translated about 3 times more efficiently. The translation of the globin mRNA-primed, but not the ApG-primed, viral RNA transcripts was inhibited by 7 -methylguanosine 5 ′-phosphate in the presence of S-adenosylhomocysteine, suggesting that the globin mRNA-primed transcripts contained a 5 ′-terminal methylated cap structure. We propose that this cap was transferred from the globin mRNA primer to the newly synthesized viral RNA transcripts, because no detectable de novo synthesis of a methylated cap occurred during globin mRNA-primed <b>viral</b> RNA <b>transcription.</b> Preliminary experiments indicate that other purified eukaryotic mRNAs also stimulate influenza <b>viral</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> in vitro...|$|R
40|$|After {{interaction}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) virions with cell surface receptors, a series of poorly characterized events results in establishment of a <b>viral</b> reverse <b>transcription</b> complex in the host cell cytoplasm. This process is coordinated {{in such a way}} that reverse transcription is initiated shortly after formation of the <b>viral</b> reverse <b>transcription</b> complex. However, the mechanism through which virus entry and initiation of reverse transcription are coordinated and how these events are compartmentalized in the infected cell are not known. In this study, we demonstrate that <b>viral</b> reverse <b>transcription</b> complexes associate rapidly with the host cell cytoskeleton during HIV- 1 infection and that reverse transcription occurs almost entirely in the cytoskeletal compartment. Interruption of actin polymerization before virus infection reduced association of <b>viral</b> reverse <b>transcription</b> complexes with the cytoskeleton. In addition, efficient reverse transcription was dependent on intact actin microfilaments. The localization of reverse transcription to actin microfilaments was mediated by the {{interaction of}} a reverse transcription complex component (gag MA) with actin but not vimentin (intermediate filaments) or tubulin (microtubules). In addition, fusion, but not endocytosis-mediated HIV- 1 infectivity, was impaired when actin depolymerizing agents were added to target cell...|$|R

40|$|Measles is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} human disease caused by the measles virus (MeV). In this study, by proteomic analysis, we identified peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx 1) as a host factor that binds to the C-terminal region of the nucleoprotein (N; NTAIL) of MeV. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown experiments showed that the Prdx 1 -binding site overlapped with the MeV phosphoprotein (P) -binding site on NTAIL and that Prdx 1 competed for the binding to NTAIL with the P protein, which is a component of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Furthermore, RNA interference for Prdx 1 resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} MeV growth in HEK 293 -SLAM cells. A minigenome assay indicated that Prdx 1 suppression affected the <b>viral</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> and/or replication step. Relative quantification of viral RNA by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) showed that Prdx 1 suppression not only reduced <b>viral</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> and replication but also enhanced polar attenuation in <b>viral</b> mRNA <b>transcription.</b> Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the binding affinit...|$|R
40|$|For {{productive}} {{replication of}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) in host cells, the viral genome-encoded transactivator Tat and several cellular transcription factors are required for efficient <b>viral</b> gene <b>transcription.</b> However, it remains unclear how the <b>viral</b> genome initiates <b>transcription</b> before Tat is transcribed or when Tat is at suboptimal levels. Here, we utilized the human T-cell leukemia type 1 Tax protein as a molecular tool to investigate the mechanism of <b>viral</b> gene <b>transcription</b> that initiates the early phase of infection of HIV- 1. Tax alone does not significantly increase the activity of HIV- 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) in T lymphocytes, but it markedly enhanced the replication of an infectious HIV- 1 provirus with a truncated nef gene. This enhancement is preferentially mediated by the cooperation of Tax and Tat which is dependent on TAR and duplicated κB cis elements of the HIV- 1 LTR {{as well as the}} NF-κB activation domain of Tax. Furthermore, phorbol myristate acetate and membrane-targeted HIV- 1 Nef also enhanced the LTR activity in the presence of Tat in the TAR- and κB cis element-dependent manner. These data suggest that activated NF-κB can functionally interact with a suboptimal amount of Tat and the HIV- 1 LTR for efficient initiation of <b>viral</b> gene <b>transcription...</b>|$|R

This particular GEF has been identified as the specific binding partner of Nef proteins from HIV-1.

It uses the helicase ATP hydrolysis site to remove the γ-phosphate from the 5′ end of the RNA. The N-terminal domain of the NS5 is vital in producing mature RNA.

50|$|Regulation of HIV-1 {{transcription}} by Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1). It {{has been}} recognized that protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) serves as an important regulator of HIV-1 transcription. Researchers at Howard University showed that Tat protein targets PP1 to the nucleus and the consequent interaction is important for HIV-1 transcription. The protein also contributes to ebolavirus pathogenesis by dephosphorylating the <b>viral</b> <b>transcription</b> activator VP30, allowing it to produce viral mRNAs. Inhibition of PP1 prevents VP30 dephosphorylation, thus preventing manufacture of viral mRNA, and thus viral protein. The viral L polymerase is, however, still capable of replicating viral genomes without VP30 dephosphorylation by PP1.|$|E

50|$|Resistance {{mutations}} {{are found}} and become problematic in many viruses other than HIV. Notable {{examples of such}} viruses include the herpes simplex virus and hepatitis B virus. In the herpes virus, drugs mainly target the viral DNA polymerase.

In hepatitis B, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs are used to cause early termination of <b>viral</b> <b>transcription.</b> Mutations in viral reverse transcriptase can cause the enzyme to not incorporate these nonfunctional analogs, in favor for their natural counterparts.
