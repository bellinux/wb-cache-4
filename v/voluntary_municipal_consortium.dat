40|$|<b>Voluntary</b> <b>Municipal</b> Disincorporation: Creative Solutions for Counties of the Second Class {{examines}} the tool of disincorporation and its steps for implementation in Allegheny County. Municipal governments {{are being asked}} to deal with more and increasingly complex challenges at a time when local revenue sources are stagnant or declining. As a result, municipalities are finding it more challenging to deliver basic services. What is needed is a new paradigm that brings greater resources, efficiencies, professional expertise, and government responsiveness to municipalities. One mechanism that would enable communities to meet these needs is disincorporation. Disincorporation is a process by which an incorporated municipality voluntary terminates and transfers its governance to the county in which it is located. This report captures of the efforts of the <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Municipal</b> Disincorporation Task Force, led by former Allegheny County Executives Dan Onorato and Jim Roddey. The result of the task force’s effort is a clear and concise roadmap for municipal disincorporation. It is the consensus of the committee that, given the challenges facing Allegheny County municipalities, it makes sense to expand eligibility for disincorporation to allow more communities, beyond those in Act 47, access to this valuable tool...|$|R

40|$|We analyse free-riding {{behaviour}} of Finnish municipalities {{prior to}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>municipal</b> mergers. The merger process creates a temporary common pool problem, {{because of a}} delay from the initial decision to the actual merger during which municipalities stay autonomous. Using a difference-indifferences strategy, {{we find that the}} stronger free-riding incentive a municipality faced the more it increased its debt and spent its cash reserves. These funds were spent mostly on investments and current expenditures. The results {{can be attributed to the}} "law of 1 /n" rather than to responding to an anticipated loss of political power or voluntary transfers between merging municipalities. Besides providing a test of the law of 1 /n, our results suggest that local jurisdiction mergers are likely to involve a substantial (one-time) cost due to free-riding. This leads to two policy implications. First, during a merger process, some financial constraints on the local level may be a good idea to mitigate common pool problems. Second, for the merger policy to achieve the goal of decreasing public spending without reducing service quality, the scale economies need to be fairly large. Our results should be of wider interest, not only because mergers are used extensively in various countries, but also because common pool problems are present in many other contexts, such as (local) governments bail outs...|$|R

40|$|Outsourcing of {{municipal}} tasks {{from the core}} budget to municipal enterprises tends to distort {{the perception of the}} actual financial position, net assets and results of operations of the German local governments. Excess supply or -demand of/for local public services might be possible consequences of this development. Hence, this article attempts to develop a more comprehensive picture of the municipal budgetary position by a simultaneous analysis of selected indicators. Furthermore, the methodological problems of the calculations are illustrated. If these shadow budgets are taken into account, the total per capita revenues, -investments and -debts will increase by approximately one third to 50 %. However, the share of the municipal employees belonging to the core administration in the total number {{of municipal}} employees is 75 %. Although only about 22 % of the expenditures for certain <b>voluntary</b> <b>municipal</b> tasks have been outsourced, {{there seems to be an}} upward trend. The study also indicates that there are significant differences between Eastern and Western German cities. These include the higher revenues from municipal enterprises, the higher debts per capita and the higher expenditures on culture, sports, leisure services or the promotion of science in Eastern Germany. The results should be interpreted carefully due to some shortcomings of the official statistics. For example, internal cash flows cannot be totally eliminated. Moreover, indirect municipal majority holdings as well as the municipal savings banks are not included in the results. All in all, it remains to be seen whether the initiated reforms concerning the introduction of double-entry accounting into the local government budgeting system will help to achieve the ideal goal of a meaningful “consolidated financial statement” for the “city company”. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to fiscal constraint and introduction of quasi-market mechanisms {{into the public}} sector, in public policy {{there appears to be}} the acceptance of the increased use of voluntary labour in the delivery of public services.

Our exploratory study uses this model to analysis two municipal organisations mix of <b>voluntary</b> and <b>municipal</b> labour, one an Italian and the other a Swedish context. ∗ The research were partly financed by the Swedish Council for Research in Humanities and Social Sciences and by the University of Ferrara.

An earlier version was presented at the Public-Private Partnership conference, Cork, Ireland, 2000. 2 The research method used to collect empirical data was semi-structured interviews of local government employees within the two sites. This is linked with an analysis of the institutional context of the two municipalities to inform and test the proposed model of demand for volunteer labour in local government. Resource scarcity, presence of agency for voluntary work, type of production and state rules and norm are used to analyse the institutional invariant traits. The study concludes that traditional institutional theory has ignored voluntary activities. Our case-studies of actual practice indicates that different state norms and rules on citizen rights and equal opportunities are stronger influential factors, than the resources situation, in determining the demand for voluntary activities in municipalities...|$|R

Concordance was considered present if the discrepancy in birth weight was 30 g or less. HDVS birth tapes and the hospital charts of 3, 864 neonates were reviewed.

40|$|The 60 th {{anniversary of}} Britain's National Health Service finds it {{undergoing}} the most radical, rapid and continuous programme of reorganisation and `reform' in its history. While most services remain free at point of use, and the NHS is still funded publicly, a growing {{share of the}} NHS budget is now being spent on buying services from a private sector that has grown rapidly {{in the last ten}} years. Aneurin Bevan's bold stroke in 1948, of nationalising a collection of mostly tiny private, <b>voluntary</b> and <b>municipal</b> hospitals, swept away a failed market system, and created the most popular of all the public services. By contrast, New Labour reforms are reversing this historic modernisation, and spending more money to create a new, artificial `market' in health care which could never exist without government subsidy. The NHS After 60 takes a fresh look at the origins and evolution of the NHS, with the greatest emphasis on the `reforms' which, in its sixth decade, have begun to transform it into a European-style social health insurance fund, for the purchase of services from a variety of private and public sector providers. The NHS After 60 also examines the NHS in an international context, and discusses recent tendencies of Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments to follow alternative lines of policy. The conclusion looks at the alternatives for the future development of the NHS.

Results show that while polyethylene glycols (PEGs) were readily degraded by PAE acclimated microorganisms, most of the carboxylic acids tested were not degraded. Biodegradation of PEGs suggests that hydrophobe-hydrophile scission was the dominant pathway for PAE biodegradation in this wastewater community. Ethylene glycol (EG) and diethylene glycol (DEG) were not utilized by microbial populations capable of degrading higher molecular weight EGs. It is possible that EG and DEG may accumulate.
