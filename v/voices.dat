He wrote many of his motets for four <b>voices,</b> an ensemble size which had become the compositional norm around 1500, and he was also a considerable innovator in writing motets for five and six <b>voices.</b> No motets of more than six <b>voices</b> have been reliably attributed to Josquin.|$|E
