40|$|For {{cell culture}} based Influenza vaccine {{production}} processes <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> optimization is of crucial importance. A well characterized factor limiting Influenza replication in vivo {{is the type}} I interferon (IFN) response. Therefore, we want to analyse whether induction of type I IFN and subsequent expression of antiviral genes is also of importance in a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture based Influenza production process. qRT-PCR and luciferase reporter assays {{were used to determine}} the expression of IFN-beta and Mx 1 in MDCK cells infected with different Influenza viruses. All strains tested showed significant induction of IFN-beta, but levels, as well as kinetics of induction and the amount of resulting Mx 1 expression varied strain dependently. As a first approach to examine the influence of IFN-beta expression on <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> and virus replication dynamics, we transiently transfected MDCK cells with a plasmid containing the sequence of A/PR/ 8 / 34 NS 1, which acts as a type I IFN antagonists. Infection of these cells with different Influenza strains showed at least 5 fold reduced levels of IFN-beta induction. For A/PR/ 8 / 34 delNS 1 this inhibition of IFN induction resulted in faster virus production and slightly higher maximal <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> compared to control cells. However, for virus strains with functional NS 1 no significant effect of NS 1 -overexpression on <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> or replication kinetics was found. A possible explanation could be that in cell culture with MDCK cells and MDCK-adapted Influenza viruses, expression of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes is not a yield limiting factor. This is also supported by experiments showing that pre-treatment of MDCK cells with IFN-containing medium does not affect <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> in our system...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{two types}} of compounds for efficacy in inhibiting SARSCoV replication in vitro: calpain inhibitors (a class of cellular cysteine proteinases) {{and a number of}} nucleoside analogues. Cytopathic effect reduction assays visually determined with spectrophotometric verification by neutral red (NR) uptake assay were used to evaluate cytotoxicity and antiviral potency of the compounds. Significantly inhibitory compounds were then evaluated in <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> reduction assays. Two calpain inhibitors, Val-Leu-CHO (calpain inhibitor VI) and Z-Val-Phe-Ala-CHO (calpain inhibitor III), were the most potent inhibitors of SARSCoV. By <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> reduction assay, calpain inhibitor VI had a 90 % effective concentration (EC 90) of 3 µM and calpain inhibitor III had an EC 90 of 15 µM. β-D-N 4 -hydroxycytidine was the most selective nucleoside analogue inhibitor with an EC 90 of 6 µM by <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> reduction assay. These compounds or analogues warrant further evaluation as potential therapies for treating SARS or could be used as lead compounds for discovery of more potent SARSCoV inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Infection by {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) induces a {{persistent}} nuclear translocation of NFκB. To identify upstream effectors of NFκB and their effect on virus replication, we employed mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) -derived cell lines with deletions of either IKK 1 or IKK 2, the catalytic subunits of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. Infected MEFs were assayed for <b>virus</b> <b>yield,</b> loss of IκBα, nuclear translocation of p 65, and NFκB DNA-binding activity. Absence of either IKK 1 or IKK 2 resulted in an 86 to 94 % loss of <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> {{compared to that of}} normal MEFs, little or no loss of IκBα, and greatly reduced NFκB nuclear translocation. Consistent with reduced <b>virus</b> <b>yield,</b> accumulation of the late proteins VP 16 and gC was severely depressed. Infection of normal MEFs, Hep 2, or A 549 cells with an adenovirus vector expressing a dominant-negative (DN) IκBα, followed by superinfection with HSV, resulted in a 98 % drop in <b>virus</b> <b>yield.</b> These results indicate that the IKK-IκB-p 65 pathway activates NFκB after virus infection. Analysis of NFκB activation and virus replication in control and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-null MEFs indicated that this kinase plays no role in the NFκB activation pathway. Finally, in cells where NFκB was blocked because of DNIκB expression, HSV failed to suppress two markers of apoptosis, cell surface Annexin V staining and PARP cleavage. These results support a model in which activation of NFκB promotes efficient replication by HSV, at least in part by suppressing a host innate response to virus infection...|$|E

Microcarrier-grown cells, when compared to roller-bottle-grown cells, gave <b>virus</b> <b>yields</b> on a per-cell basis that varied from slightly greater with the Sindbis virus-Chinese hamster ovary cells and polio-WI- 38 combinations to approximately one-third with Moloney murine leukemia virus-Cl- 1 mouse cells and vesicular stomatitis virus-chicken embryo fibroblasts.

40|$|Recently, the {{suitability}} of the avian suspension cell line AGE 1. CR. pIX as a producer cell line for vaccinia virus in a chemically-defined process was demonstrated. Normally, {{one would expect that}} higher cell densities should lead to higher <b>virus</b> <b>yields.</b> However, for many viruses the so called cell density effect results in reduced yields at high cell densities and thus limits the production capacity. To understand whether a cell density effect occurs in this vaccinia production process, we monitored cell physiology of AGE 1. CR. pIX cells before and after virus infection. A recombinant modified vaccinia virus with an enhanced green fluorescence protein (egfp) insert was used. Cultures were infected after 3 or 5 days of batch growth at 4 x 106 cells/mL and 8 x 106 cells/mL, respectively, by adding an equal volume of production medium. We analyzed five parameters: i) cell viability, ii) cell cycle distribution by measuring DNA content, iii) apoptosis via annexin V staining, iv) infection status via detection of intracellular egfp and v) virus titer. Experimental data did not indicate a cell density effect. No significant alterations of the cell population neither in terms of cell viability, nor in cell cycle proportions or fraction of apoptotic cells were observed in high cell density cultures. Cell-specific <b>virus</b> <b>yields</b> were also not impaired. In contrast, although cell concentration was doubled, <b>virus</b> <b>yields</b> increased by a factor of three and a maximum concentration of 5 x 108 viruses/mL was reached. As a cell concentration of 8 x 106 cells/mL can easily be achieved in a batch process, the use of fed-batch or perfusion cultivations could lead to even higher <b>virus</b> <b>yields...</b>|$|R

On the contrary, the elongation inhibitors cycloheximide, anisomycin, and emetine, shown previously to inhibit viral protein synthesis preferentially, had a greater effect on <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> than on overall protein synthesis.

40|$|Production {{of animal}} cell culture derived {{influenza}} virus {{seems to be}} suitable for industrial scale production of human vaccines to prevent pandemics. The bioprocess engineering group at the MPI Magdeburg works on a process with MDCK cells focusing on different aspects like virus replication, cell physiology, proteomics a. o [...] For possible comparative studies {{the establishment of the}} alternative production process with Vero cells, as described in literature, was the aim of this work. Experiments regarding cell growth and virus replication were carried out in static and microcarrier systems. The influence of multiplicity of infection (moi) and trypsin concentration on infection in several media (serum containing/serum free) were experimentally investigated. It was seen, that the moi had an influence on the course of infection but not on the <b>virus</b> <b>yield.</b> The trypsin concentration for infection had to be adapted to each medium and cultivation system for optimization of the <b>virus</b> <b>yield.</b> A twofold higher concentration of trypsin was necessary in serum free media. By adapting the virus to the Vero cells, <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> as well as infection course could be improved. The comparison of two bioreactors (Wave Bioreactor/ 5 L stirred tank reactor) showed a higher <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> for cultivation in Wave Bioreactor. For standard cultivation (2 g/L microcarriers) in Wave, cell densities of 1. 0 * 106 cells/mL and <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> of about 2. 3 log HA units/ 100 µL were reached. The cultivations in 5 L stirred tank reactor showed higher cell densities (1. 7 * 106 cell/mL) but lower virus titers (1. 6 log HA unit/ 100 µL). Metabolic activity (Glucose, Lactat, Glutamine, Ammonia and Glutamat) was higher in Wave. A high cell density cultivation in Wave (4 g/L microcarriers) showed an increase of virus production with higher cell densities (2. 2 * 106 cells/mL, 2. 9 log HA units/ 100 µL). No cell density effect was detectable. The obtained data on cell growth, metabolism and virus production for the process with Vero cells were compared to the data on MDCK cells and can be used to set-up further experiments for comparative studies...|$|E
40|$|A flow cytometric (fluorescence-activated {{cell sorter}} [FACS]) assay was {{developed}} for analysis of the drug susceptibilities of wild-type and drug-resistant influenza A and B virus laboratory strains and clinical isolates for the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir carboxylate, zanamivir, and peramivir. The drug susceptibilities of wild-type influenza viruses and those with mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) and/or NA genes rendering them resistant {{to one or more}} of the NA inhibitors were easily determined with the FACS assay. The drug concentrations that reduced the number of virus-infected cells or the number of PFU by 50 % as determined by the FACS assay were similar to those obtained with the more time-consuming and labor-intensive <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> reduction assay. The NA inhibition (NAI) assay confirmed the resistance patterns demonstrated by the FACS and <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> assays for drug-resistant influenza viruses with mutations in the NA gene. However, only the FACS and <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> assays detected NA inhibitor-resistant influenza viruses with mutations in the HA gene but not in the NA gene. The FACS assay is more rapid and less labor-intensive than the <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> assay and just as quantitative. The FACS assay determines the drug susceptibilities of influenza viruses with mutations in either the HA or NA genes, making the assay more broadly useful than the NAI assay for measuring the in vitro susceptibilities of influenza viruses for NA inhibitors. However, since only viruses with mutations in the NA gene that lead to resistance to the NA inhibitors correlate with clinical resistance, this in vitro assay should not be used in the clinical setting to determine resistance to NA inhibitors. The assay may be useful for determining the in vivo susceptibilities of other compounds effective against influenza A and B viruses...|$|E

In vivo influenza replication {{is limited by the}} immune system, but for production cell lines the impact of defence mechanisms on <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> is unknown. Methods. Interferon (IFN) response and subsequent induction of the antiviral state was monitored in influenza-infected adherent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by real-time PCR. Stimulation and inhibition of the host cell defence were performed analysing its impact on virus yields. Results. <b>Virus</b> <b>yield</b> and host cell signalling intensity were strain-dependent. By over-expression of viral antagonists IFN-signalling could be reduced up to 90 %. However, maximum virus titre determined by real-time PCR and HA-assay was not altered significantly. Stimulation of the antiviral state by conditioned medium led to enhanced IFN-signalling, which initially slowed down virus replication but had only minor effects on final virus titres. Interestingly, minireplicon assays revealed that canine Mx proteins are lacking the antiviral activity against influenza of their human or mouse counterparts. Conclusions. For MDCK cell culture-based influenza vaccine production host cell defence mechanisms seem to play only a minor role for final virus yields. Antiviral mechanisms of these epithelial cells may slow down influenza replication, which in vivo gains time for the immune system to be activated, but do not reduce maximum virus titres obtained in the bioprocess...|$|E

Understanding the molecular basis of virus-host interactions might help clarify the largely unknown neuropathogenic mechanisms of EV 71. In this study, we showed that human annexin II (Anx 2) protein could bind to the EV 71 virion via the capsid protein VP 1. Either pretreatment of EV 71 with soluble recombinant Anx 2 or pretreatment of host cells with an anti-Anx 2 antibody could result in reduced viral attachment to the cell surface and a reduction of the subsequent <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> in vitro. HepG 2 cells, which do not express Anx 2, remained permissive to EV 71 infection, though the <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> was lower than that for a cognate lineage expressing Anx 2. Stable transfection of plasmids expressing Anx 2 protein into HepG 2 cells (HepG 2 -Anx 2 cells) could enhance EV 71 infectivity, with an increased <b>virus</b> <b>yield,</b> especially at a low infective dose, and the enhanced infectivity could be reversed by pretreating HepG 2 -Anx 2 cells with an anti-Anx 2 antibody.

In an experiment involving 10 serial passages of virus in both parasitized and nonparasitized larvae, restriction endonuclease analysis of viral DNA amplified in nonparasitized larvae revealed the presence of the wild-type virus as well as three additional variants (A, B, and C) diagnosed by the presence of novel submolar PstI fragments of different sizes. In contrast, analysis of viral DNA from parasitized larvae showed the presence of the wild-type virus and two other variants (E and F), each characterized by a different submolar BglII fragment.

The ca recombinants showed different degrees of cold adaptibility (DOCA) and different patterns of virus growth at 25 [deg]. All recombinants contained at most three genes from the cold variant A/Ann Arbor/ 6 / 60 virus (triple-gene recombinant) and most contained two or one gene from the cold variant parent (double-gene and single-gene recombinants, respectively). Further, the same three genes, RNA 2, RNA 3, and RNA 5 (NA) were the only ca A/Ann Arbor/ 6 / 60 genes found in the various recombinants.

In mammalian cells, RNAi can be triggered by 21 – 23 nucleotide duplexes of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Strategies to inhibit RNA virus multiplication based on the use of siRNAs have to consider the high genetic polymorphism exhibited by this group of virus.

Eleven plaque-purified stocks were prepared and characterized. Biologically, the plaque-purified virus induced tumor and viral antigens in HEK cells earlier and in {{a higher percentage of}} cells than uncloned virus. Cytopathic changes were also evident sooner and were more extensive. The DNA from uncloned as well as plaque-purified isolates was analyzed by restriction endonuclease cleavage followed by gel electrophoresis. The DNA from uncloned HEK-adapted virus was heterogeneous. Plaque-purified <b>virus</b> isolates <b>yielded</b> DNA which, although much less heterogeneous than the uncloned stock, still consisted of two or more species of viral DNA...|$|R

40|$|GDVII {{virus growth}} in BHK- 21 cells, a {{permissive}} host for the virus, resembled productive infections with other picornaviruses. <b>Virus</b> <b>yields</b> ranged from 100 to 600 plaque-forming units (PFU) /cell. Virus replication in HeLa cells, a nonpermissive host for GDVII virus, {{was characterized by}} <b>virus</b> <b>yields</b> of only 0. 1 to 5 PFU/cell. Similar low <b>yields</b> of <b>virus</b> have been obtained from HeLa cells at all multiplicities of input up to 6, 000 per cell. The progeny particles from HeLa cells were, like the infecting particles, restricted in the HeLa cell host. Despite the great difference in final <b>yields</b> of <b>virus</b> from BHK- 21 and HeLa cells, the times when maximal yields were reached were similar. GDVII virus stock grown in BHK- 21 cells was designated HeLa-. A variant of GDVII virus which is capable of extensive growth in HeLa cells was obtained. This variant, designated HeLa+ GDVII virus, was passaged serially in HeLa cells. <b>Virus</b> <b>yields</b> of 50 to 150 infective virus particles per cell were obtained from infection of HeLa cells with HeLa+ GDVII virus. The major species of HeLa+ virus-specific ribonucleic acid (RNA) produced was single stranded and sedimented with an S value of 35 S. The rate of accumulation of HeLa+ virus-specific RNA in HeLa cell cultures was about four times that of HeLa- RNA. The amount of virus-specific HeLa+ RNA formed in HeLa cells was several-fold {{greater than that of}} HeLa- RNA. With HeLa- parent GDVII virus undergoing productive replication in BHK- 21 cells or abortive replication in HeLa cells, the major species of virus-specific RNA produced was single stranded and sedimented with an approximate S value of 35 S. The amount of HeLa- virus-specific RNA extracted from BHK- 21 cells was several-fold greater than the amount obtained from HeLa cells...|$|R
40|$|CHIKV is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus {{responsible}} for the first autochthonous Italian outbreak in 2007. We previously analyzed 7 CHIKV isolates (5 imported and 2 autochthonous) {{with respect to the}} presence of A 226 V mutation in E 1 gp. All the isolates showed this mutation except the one imported from India in 2006. Since this mutation has been associated with enhanced replication and fitness in A. albopictus vector, we investigated the possible involvement of A 226 V mutation in enhanced infection capability in primate cells. To this aim,Vero E 6 and C 6 / 36 cells were infected with two CHIKV isolates, one carrying the A 226 V mutation and one wild type, using single replication cycle conditions. Progeny virus was measured by both quantitative real time RT-PCR and viral infectivity assay. No significant differences were observed between the two isolates either in terms of replication kinetic or in <b>virus</b> <b>yield,</b> on both Vero E 6 and C 6 / 36 cells. Moreover, experiment of inhibition of virus replication were performed for both isolates on Vero E 6 cells using increasing amounts of recombinant IFN-alpha and <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> was measured. A dose-dependent inhibition of <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> for both CHIK isolates was observed, with a different sensitivity to IFN-alpha between the isolate carrying the A 226 V mutation and the wild type one. Our results suggest i) that A 226 V mutation does not influence replication ability in both host species, when using single replication cycle conditions; ii) the differences between wild type and mutated strains may be due to different sensitivity and/or activation ability of innate immune mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Enterovirus A 71 (EV-A 71) in the Picornaviridae family causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease, aseptic meningitis, severe {{central nervous}} system disease, even death. EV-A 71 2 A {{protease}} cleaves Type I interferon (IFN) -α/β receptor 1 (IFNAR 1) to block IFN-induced Jak/STAT signaling. This study investigated anti-EV-A 7 l activity and synergistic mechanism(s) of a novel furoquinoline alkaloid compound CW- 33 alone and in combination with IFN-β Anti-EV-A 71 activities of CW- 33 alone and in combination with IFN-β were evaluated by inhibitory assays of virus-induced apoptosis, plaque formation, and <b>virus</b> <b>yield.</b> CW- 33 showed antiviral activities with an IC 50 of near 200 µM in EV-A 71 plaque reduction and <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> inhibition assays. While, anti-EV-A 71 activities of CW- 33 combined with 100 U/mL IFN-β exhibited a synergistic potency with an IC 50 of approximate 1 µM in plaque reduction and <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> inhibition assays. Molecular docking revealed CW- 33 binding to EV-A 71 2 A protease active sites, correlating with an inhibitory effect of CW 33 on in vitro enzymatic activity of recombinant 2 A protease IC 50 = 53. 1 µM). Western blotting demonstrated CW- 33 specifically inhibiting 2 A protease-mediated cleavage of IFNAR 1. CW- 33 also recovered Type I IFN-induced Tyk 2 and STAT 1 phosphorylation as well as 2 ', 5 '-OAS upregulation in EV-A 71 infected cells. The results demonstrated CW- 33 inhibiting viral 2 A protease activity to reduce Type I IFN antagonism of EV-A 71. Therefore, CW- 33 combined with a low-dose of Type I IFN could be applied in developing alternative approaches to treat EV-A 71 infection...|$|E
40|$|IMPACT OF INTERFERON SIGNALLING ON <b>VIRUS</b> <b>YIELD</b> IN MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURE-BASED INFLUENZA VACCINE PRODUCTION Background. A well {{characterized}} factor limiting Influenza replication in vivo is {{the type}} I interferon (IFN) response. We want to analyse whether induction of type I IFN is also a yield limiting factor in a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) based Influenza production process. Methods. Adherent MDCK cells were transiently electroporated with plasmids coding for several viral IFN antagonists or treated with IFN containing medium and subsequently infected with different influenza strains. Expression of IFN-β and Mx 1 was monitored by qRT-PCR,. and the impact on virus yields was analysed (qRT-PCR, HA activity). Results. In cells transfected with viral IFN antagonists, significant reduction of IFN signalling (up to 90 %) during Influenza replication was achieved compared to control cells. Cells treated with IFN prior to infection expressed higher levels of IFN-β and Mx 1 during the whole course of virus infection. Concerning <b>virus</b> <b>yield,</b> results indicate that for influenza strains lacking functional NS 1, IFN signalling and resulting expression of antiviral genes is a limiting factor for cell specific virus production. For delNS 1, an 8 -fold increase in <b>virus</b> <b>yield</b> was observed in cells transfected with Influenza NS 1 and in cells pre-treated with IFN growth was significantly reduced. However, for virus strains with functional NS 1 neither reduction of yield was found in IFN-treated cells nor an increase of yield was seen in cells transfected with IFN antagonists. Conclusions. Experimental data clearly indicate that Interferon expression during Influenza replication is not a yield limiting factor In a MDCK cell culture-based vaccine production processes...|$|E

40|$|Lysates of HEp- 2 cells productively {{infected}} with herpes simplex <b>virus</b> <b>yielded</b> two bands on isopycnic centrifugation in CsCl gradients, ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 6 g/cm 3. One band, designated α, {{had a mean}} buoyant density of 1. 27 g/cm 3 and contained herpes virions. Band β had a mean density of 1. 305 g/cm 3 and contained primarily complement-fixing viral antigens and little or no viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The products banding in the α and β bands were unstable; fivefold or higher amounts were recovered by treating the cell extract with formaldehyde prior to centrifugation. Formaldehyde treatment increased the buoyant density of viral products in both the α and β bands by about 0. 015 g/cm 3. In addition, it stabilized hitherto inapparent products, forming a broad band γ with a density range of 1. 37 to 1. 45 g/cm 3. The material in the γ band was heterogeneous; it contained viral DNA, cellular DNA, and viral antigen.
