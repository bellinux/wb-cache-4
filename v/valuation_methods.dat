5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities {{human beings}} are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic <b>valuation</b> <b>methods</b> to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{advances}} {{that have been}} made in relation to the valuation of Commercial, Industrial and retail property, there has not been the same progress in relation to the valuation of rural property. Although number of rural property valuations also require the valuer to carry out a full analysis of the economic performance of the farming operations, as well as the long term environmental viability of the farm, this information is rarely used to assess the value of the property, nor is it even used for a secondary <b>valuation</b> <b>method.</b> Over the past 20 years the nature of rural valuation practice has required most rural valuers to undertake studies in both agriculture (farm management) and valuation, especially if carrying out valuation work for financial institutions. The additional farm financial and management information obtained by rural valuers exceeds that level of information required to value commercial, retail and industrial by the capitalisation of net rent/profit <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> and is very similar to the level of information required for the valuation of commercial and retail property by the Discounted Cash Flow <b>valuation</b> <b>method.</b> On this basis the valuers specialising in rural valuation practice have the necessary skills and information to value rural properties by an income <b>valuation</b> <b>method.</b> Although the direct comparison <b>method</b> of <b>valuation</b> has been sufficient in the past to value rural properties the future use of the method as the main <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> is limited and valuers need to adopt an income <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> as at least a secondary <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> to overcome the problems {{associated with the use of}} direct comparison as the only rural property <b>valuation</b> <b>method,</b> especially in view of the impact that farm technical, financial and environmental. management can have on rural property values. This paper will review the results of an extensive survey carried out by rural property valuers and agribusiness managers in NSW, in relation to the impact of farm management on rural property values and rural property valuation practice. ...|$|R
25|$|PwC {{was also}} criticised by several {{witnesses}} {{during the investigation}} into AIG's collapse, after the insurer was unable to fulfil its collateral obligations to Goldman Sachs. The insurer was expected to cover the difference in value between the credit default swap contracts it had sold to Goldman Sachs, however {{the head of the}} unit at AIG disagreed with the valuation that Goldman presented. According to a memo published by Business Insider, witnesses wondered how PwC was signing off on the accounts for both AIG and Goldman Sachs, when they were using different <b>valuation</b> <b>methods</b> for the swaps contracts (and therefore booked different values for them in their accounts).|$|E
500|$|One {{criticism}} of time valuation concerns {{the choice of}} monetary levels. How should unpaid work be valued when more than one activity is being performed or more than one output is produced? Another issue concerns differences in quality between market and household products. Some feminist economists take issue with using the market system to determine values {{for a variety of}} reasons: it may lead {{to the conclusion that the}} market provides perfect substitutes for non-market work; the wage produced in the market for services may not accurately reflect the actual opportunity cost of time spent in household production; and the wages used in <b>valuation</b> <b>methods</b> come from industries where wages are already depressed because of gender inequalities, and so will not accurately value unpaid work. A related argument is that the market [...] "accepts existing sex/gender divisions of labor and pay inequalities as normal and unproblematic. With this basic assumption underlying their calculations, the valuations produced serve to reinforce gender inequalities rather than challenge women's subordination." ...|$|E
2500|$|The income {{approach}} relies upon the economic principle of expectation: {{the value of}} business {{is based on the}} expected economic benefit and level of risk associated with the investment. Income based <b>valuation</b> <b>methods</b> determine fair market value by dividing the benefit stream generated by the subject or target company times a discount or capitalization rate. The discount or capitalization rate converts the stream of benefits into present value. There are several different income methods, including capitalization of earnings or cash flows, discounted future cash flows ("DCF"), and the excess earnings method (which is a hybrid of asset and {{income approach}}es). The result of a value calculation under the income approach is generally the fair market value of a controlling, marketable interest in the subject company, since the entire benefit stream of the subject company is most often valued, and the capitalization and discount rates are derived from statistics concerning public companies. [...] states that earnings are preeminent for the valuation of closely held operating companies.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to examine how {{utilizing}} the contingent <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> could help or hinder the decision making process for the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Contingent valuation is a technique which uses surveys to measure people’s willingness {{to pay for a}} specific good or service. The ESA has been in effect since 1973 and its objective is to provide for the protection of endangered and threatened species and to aid in their recovery. The ESA has been criticized since there have not been many species who have recovered and been delisted. The argument has been made that the ESA should incorporate economics and a cost/benefit analysis when determining whether species should be listed as endangered. The contingent <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> is designed {{to address the issue of}} valuing a non-use benefit or cost; a challenge made difficult when applying economic considerations to protecting the environment. I conducted a contingent valuation survey at Bryant University to determine whether the contingent <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> would be helpful to the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) when deciding whether to list a species. After analyzing the survey results, I determined there are many potential problems with the use of the contingent <b>valuation</b> <b>method.</b> I came to the conclusion the FWS would be unlikely to derive any benefits from the utilization of the contingent <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> in the decision making process for the ESA...|$|R
40|$|The {{sand beach}} {{along the east}} coast of Korea offers {{beautiful}} scenery with high-quality sand for leisure, and is also famous for white-sand and pine-trees both of which are important scenic resources. Furthermore, the sand beach helps to maintain natural environment of the coastal area and has the function of a disaster prevention system against high waves. There are two major value evaluation methods, Travel Cost <b>Method</b> and Contingent <b>Valuation</b> <b>Method,</b> to assess the value of sand beach. Contingent <b>Valuation</b> <b>Method</b> is considered to be more appropriate for simultaneous evaluation on the usefulness and the uselessness of the beach. But in order to apply Contingent <b>Valuation</b> <b>Method</b> to coastal sand beach evaluation, close examination and investigation on the potential bias, such as on questionnaires, surveys and replies are required. In this study, the characteristic of amenities which sand beach visitors prefer the most is investigated, in prior to evaluating the usability of the beach measured by contingent <b>valuation</b> <b>method.</b> The characteristic of amenity of major sand beaches on {{the east coast of}} Korea is studied and compared by diverse value evaluation methods...|$|R

40|$|Organisational {{spending}} on IS/IT is continuously expanding. Investments in IS/IT are usually seen as necessary without leading to direct organisational benefits. Only direct and easy measured benefits are valuated when using traditional IT-valuation methods. This leaves out benefits {{that could be}} vital for organisations only because they are seen as difficult to measure. Organisations often fail in valuating IT-infrastructure components since they view this as strictly technical and separated from business. One such IT-infrastructure component is an ICC (Integration Competence Center). An ICC {{can be described in}} light terms as a central hub that handles communication between information systems in an organisation. This thesis is a continuation of a previously conducted research on the same subject. The previous research was conducted in collaboration with the IT-consultant company Zystems. Zystems delivers ICCs to their customers but were using an unfulfilling <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> for ICC-investments. One result of the previous research was six demands that were claimed as important to consider in an improved <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> for ICC-investments. The purpose of this thesis was to construct a new <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> for ICC-investments, based on these expressed demands. These six demands had to be investigated in relation to the intended environment where it would be applied. The <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> should be applied by Zystems when valuating benefits of an ICC on current and potential customers in the government sector. One of the results in this thesis was that the complexity of the studied environment had to be investigated. This was performed during empirical studies with Zystems and their current and potential customers in the government sector. The result from the empirical studies where areas of interest that defined the complexity of the investigated environment. Complexity of the environment affected how the six expressed demands could be fulfilled in the new <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> for ICC-investments. Final result of this thesis was a constructed <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> for ICC-investments that include the expressed demands. Except for fulfilling the six expressed demands, the new ICC-valuation method also enables two other factors that was not mention in the six demands. These factors are however important to consider and was therefore included in the new <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> for ICC-investments...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to gain understanding of the drivers behind sell-side analysts’ <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> choices for valuing a particular company, which have largely remained unknown. The phenomenon was explored through a renewable energy case company Neste Oyj. Additionally, due to the context of renewable energy valuations, the study sought to investigate how environmental, social and governance information influence valuations. The main research question of the study was: What affects analysts’ <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> choices directly linked to a firm's target price? The secondary research question, to address the context of renewable energy valuations, was: What is the role of environmental, social and governance information in the context of renewable energy valuation? This research followed a qualitative research approach. Empirical data was gathered from 6 in-depth semi-structured interviews of sell-side analysts covering the case company Neste Oyj. The interviews were based on the content analysis of the interviewed analysts’ latest valuation reports on Neste Oyj. Further, the interviews were constructed acknowledging prior research. The interviewees were based in the UK and the Nordics. Interviews were conducted either face-to-face or by phone. Thus, complimentary research material obtained from interviewees’ was considered. Further, the research approach was abductive. The findings of the research supported the acknowledgement that the decision-environment that analysts face is multidimensional, having various drivers affecting choices made. First, the findings corroborated prior empirical evidence on factors influencing <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> choices, such as client preferences. Secondly, the research found indications of theoretically suggested factors and thirdly, identified new factors. The factors influencing <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> choices were categorized under four groups of <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> drivers, constructing a framework for assessing the phenomenon: 1) employer related, 2) market deriving, 3) method characteristics and personal preferences and 4) firm specific drivers. Additionally, the research noted analysts’ changing <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> preferences: the shift from the dominance of PE to preference of enterprise value multiples. Secondarily, the research found ESG information to play a secondary role in the context of renewable energy valuations and noted UK and Nordic analysts differing perceptions on the valuation relevance of ESG-information. ESG did not influence <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> choices or target prices explicitly. However, for Nordic analysts, ESG-information could influence the stock recommendation and be present in screenings or reports...|$|R

In developed countries, payments are often requested in money, but the form of payment should be more flexible in developing countries that do not have extensive cash economies.
