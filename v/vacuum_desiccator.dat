40|$|This {{dissertation}} has two key objectives: {{the first}} {{objective is to}} develop a method of predicting and quantifying the amount of water that can enter into a pavement system by vapor transport; the second objective is to identify to which extent the fatigue crack growth of pavement would result from such moisture accumulation. To fulfill these two objectives, a diffusion model was first established to illustrate the wetting process of the surface asphalt layer due to the vapor migration from subgrade soil into the upper layer. Secondly, in order to quantify the degree of moisture damage induced by water vapor diffusion, fine aggregate mixture specimens were fabricated and conditioned at different levels of relative humidity in closed <b>vacuum</b> <b>desiccators</b> that allows little temperature fluctuation. Moreover, the moisture conditioned specimens were tested using a newly developed repeated direct tension test method to evaluate the fatigue crack growth. The RDT test greatly reduced the stress state complexity within the specimens by evenly distributing stress over the cross section area of the cylindrical specimen. Compared to the previous torsional test, the newly proposed test protocol was more efficient in characterizing the moisture susceptibility of the asphalt mixture. A major finding in this dissertation is that the higher level of RH in as asphalt surface layer will induce significantly higher crack growth rates...|$|R

PTCDI-C 7 thin films were prepared by spin-coating 0.4 mg/ml PTCDI-C 7 solution in 1 -tetradecene at a spin velocity of 1000 rpm, followed by rinsing with the solvent and drying in <b>vacuum</b> <b>desiccators</b> for 24 h. The film thickness was about 5 - 10 nm, which was determined by comparing the PL intensities of the PTCDI-C 7 thin films fabricated by the spin coating method with those fabricated by evaporation in vacuum with thicknesses of 5, 10, 15, and 20 nm, which were estimated using a thickness monitor. STM (Digital Instruments Co. Ltd., USA, Nanoscope IIIa) measurement was carried out at room temperature under ambient conditions and a mechanically sharpened Pt/Ir tip was used.

Several samples (each of the volume of 120  ml) of ZrO 2 nanopowder suspensions were prepared in distilled water in concentrations of 2 and 35.8  vol.% (10 and 77  mass%, respectively). One set of samples was prepared with and the others without addition of Dolapix CE 64 in the range of between 0.9 – 1.5  mass%. The resulting nanosuspensions were treated in 250  ml zirconia milling jars with 100  g of spherical 3 – 8  mm zirconia ceramic balls as milling media. Samples were then mixed in a planetary ball mill (Pulverisette 6, Fritsch, Germany) for a period of 30  min with 500  rpm [12]. Subsequently, after milling, the resulting suspensions were cooled to room temperature (23  °C), and de-agglomeration was additionally performed in <b>vacuum</b> (laboratory <b>desiccator)</b> for 5  min to remove gas bubbles. Suspensions were ultrasonicated under an output power of 200  W for a period of 5  min and again degassed for an additional 5  min for better homogeneity, which is essential prior to rheological and electrokinetic (ESA) measurements, as well as for slip casting application. At least ten suspensions were prepared for each different nanosuspension composition, {{in order to determine the}} optimal amount of dispersant which would give the lowest viscosity and control reproducibility of suspensions. Immediately, fresh nanosuspensions were evaluated with respect to their rheology (by means of viscosity measurement), ζ-potential (by means of ESA and pH measurements), and particle morphology (by using SEM and HR-TEM microscopes).|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to study the characteristics of mango chips drying using a double plated solar collector. The materials used were sliced mangoes with the thickness of 3, 6, and 8 mm.

The results of this study suggested that the use of double plated solar collector could increase the temperature and the amount of heat energy, thus speed up the drying process of the mango chips. The energy needed to evaporate the moisture content in mango decreased in proportion to the increase in drying time.

30|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{suitable}} core material we collected outcrop samples of the sedimentary succession in a field campaign (see Fig.  2 for location details). The outcrop samples might be affected by some weathering or diagenetic overprinting and therefore it cannot be guaranteed that they represent conditions of the subsurface rocks. The majority of outcrops are located close to the Al Khawd dam and only two samples of the Barzaman Formation were taken at the southern foothills of the Oman Mountains (Lat. 22.3041702; Long. 57.8264319), where the former alluvial stream deposits form complex systems of ‘raised’ or upstanding, sinuous, superimposed linear ridges and broad gravel sheets (Maizels 1987). To correlate T-logs with physical rock properties, it was necessary to obtain rock samples from the same stratigraphic intervals. Therefore, our sampling strategy focused on the sediments encompassing the uppermost 700  m of the succession. In total we took 25 samples of the Barzaman Formation, the Ma‘am reef sequence and the Seeb Formation. The thermal conductivity, effective porosity, permeability, and matrix density of each sample was determined. The rock thermal conductivity was measured with a thermal conductivity scanner (TCS, optical scanning technique). The underlying technique of the TCS has been described in detail by Popov et al. (1999). Samples were dried in an oven at 80  °C for 24  h before the thermal conductivity measurements were performed. A black acryl lacquer line was drawn on the polished and plain sample surface to avoid different mineral colors affecting the measurement. Additionally, we measured the thermal conductivity of water-saturated samples. For this, samples were saturated under <b>vacuum</b> in a <b>desiccator</b> for 3  days. The optical scanning technique is a transient method, which yields a continuous profile of thermal conductivity along the core axis of the sample. The mean thermal conductivity is determined as the arithmetic mean of all conductivities measured along the scanning line. To determine anisotropy measurements were made parallel and perpendicular to bedding planes, where developed.|$|R
