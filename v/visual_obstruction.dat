5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} occurs in several habitats, ranging from coastal salt marshes to {{mountain}} streams and clearings. It is semiaquatic, spending {{much time in}} the water, and usually occurs in wetland habitats. It prefers areas where the ground is covered with grasses and sedges, which protect it from predators. In southern Illinois, marsh rice rats are more likely to occur in wetlands with more herbaceous cover, <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction,</b> and nearby grasslands. The species also occurs in drier uplands, which serve as sinks for young, dispersing animals and as refuges during high tide. Rice rats are adept overwater dispersers; studies on islands off Virginia's Delmarva Peninsula show that they readily cross 300-m (1000ft) channels between islands.|$|E

An example might apply to a LOS path between a television broadcast antenna and a roof mounted receiving antenna.

If, instead, a large building was constructed in the path making it NLOS, the channel may be impossible to receive.|$|E
50|$|Major {{variables}} in habitat quality include average <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> and browse biomass. Snowshoe hares prefer young forests with abundant understories. The presence of cover {{is the primary}} determinant of habitat quality, and is more significant than food availability or species composition. Species composition does, however, influence population density; dense softwood understories support greater snowshoe hare density than hardwoods because of cover quality. In Maine, female snowshoe hares were observed to be more common on sites with less cover but more nutritious forage; males tended to be found on sites with heavier cover.|$|E
50|$|A Robel pole is {{a device}} {{consisting}} of a 1-2 metre vertical pole possessing alternating horizontal bands and a 4 m line of rope or cord. It is used by range ecologists, field biologists and other scientists to measure the density of vegetation and to quantify the volume of ground cover in a particular habitat using the <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> (VO) measurement method. The Robel pole is named for Dr. Robert J. Robel http://www.k-state.edu/biology/faculty_pages/robel.html, the scientist who developed the device and technique.

40|$|To develop {{relevant}} {{road safety}} countermeasures, {{it is necessary}} to first obtain an in-depth understanding of how and why safety-critical situations such as incidents, near-crashes, and crashes occur. Video-recordings from naturalistic driving studies provide detailed information on events and circumstances prior to such situations that is difficult to obtain from traditional crash investigations, at least {{when it comes to the}} observable driver behavior. This study analyzed causation in 90 video-recordings of car-to-pedestrian incidents captured by onboard cameras in a naturalistic driving study in Japan. The Driving Reliability and Error Analysis Method (DREAM) was modified and used to identify contributing factors and causation patterns in these incidents. Two main causation patterns were found. In intersections, drivers failed to recognize the presence of the conflict pedestrian due to <b>visual</b> <b>obstructions</b> and/or because their attention was allocated towards something other than the conflict pedestrian. In incidents away from intersections, this pattern reoccurred along with another pattern showing that pedestrians often behaved in unexpected ways. These patterns indicate that an interactive advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) able to redirect the driver's attention could have averted many of the intersection incidents, while autonomous systems may be needed away from intersections. Cooperative ADAS may be needed to address issues raised by <b>visual</b> <b>obstructions...</b>|$|R

The bomb receives data on its current location from GPS satellites, or from an inertial navigation system in the bomb itself, that has been fed, through the pylon datalink, with the dropping aircraft's coordinates {{a fraction of a}} second before drop, and can therefore calculate its own coordinates from the dropping time and on.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{the way a}} {{plane wave}} is {{affected}} by an obstruction depends {{on the size of}} the obstruction relative to its wavelength and the electrical properties of the obstruction. For example, a hot air balloon with multi-wavelength dimensions passing between the transmit and receive antennas could be a significant <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> but is unlikely to affect the NLOS radio propagation much assuming it is constructed from fabric and full of hot air, both of which are good insulators. Conversely, a metal obstruction of dimensions comparable to a wavelength would cause significant reflections. When considering obstruction size, we assume its electrical properties are the most common intermediate or lossy type.|$|E
50|$|Research on change {{blindness}} proceeded {{one step}} further into practical applications of this phenomenon. For example, there {{does not have to}} be a masking stimulus in order for individuals to miss a change in a scene. Individuals often take significantly longer to notice certain changes if there are a few small, high contrast shapes that are temporarily splattered over a picture. This method for testing change blindness is called “mudsplashes”. This method is particularly relevant to individuals driving in a car when there is a <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> on the windshield. This obstruction may impair an individual's ability to detect a change in their environment which could result in severe negative consequences while driving.|$|E

Erebus uses these animatronics to bypass the “no-touch” safety rules, {{as well as other}} techniques such as dropping fake bugs from the ceiling, making building structures move. Erebus also uses landscape changes throughout the walk-through including inclines, stairwells, narrow passages, low ceilings and trap doors.

5000|$|It is {{apparent}} {{that the effects of}} habitat fragmentation across all habitat types selected by sharp-tailed grouse are impacting this species. The management of sharp-tailed grouse habitat has changed over the years from observational (making sure current habitat is maintained) to more hands on approach. The management of lekking habitat and winter habitat are not as clearly defined in the literature as nesting and brood rearing habitat assessment and management. The development of the Robel pole and cover boards has become a key tool in habitat assessment providing land managers a means to inventory and study habitat preferences based on vegetation structure and density. The Robel pole has become the more favored of the two methods in recent years for habitat assessment. The United States forest Service (USFS) uses <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> readings (VOR) to set stocking densities for cattle based on the current years standing residual vegetation [...] This method is currently conducted on the USFS Little Missouri Grasslands, Sheyenne National Grasslands, Cedar River National Grassland, and Grand River National Grassland, all found in the Dakota Prairie National Grasslands in North and South Dakota(Forest Service, Northern Region (USDA).2001) [...]The Robel pole is a non-destructive method for inventorying vegetative biomass (Robel 1970; Benkobi et al. 2000). This method was used to create a habitat suitability index based on vegetation <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> (VO), ranging from 0-30.5 cm with a suitability index rating of 0-1.0 (Prose 1987). Studies of nesting habitat by Prose et al. (2002) in the Nebraska Sandhills found that nesting sharp-tailed grouse selected nest sites with <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> readings (VOR) of more than 4 cm. Similarly, Clawson and Rottella (1998) observed that 58% of nests (432 of 741) in Southwestern Montana were located in sites with an average VOR of 24 cm. The other nests in this study were located in sites with VOR’s of 11-18 cm. Reece et al. (2001) observed that sites with a VO of less than 5 cm near possible nesting locations indicated a decline in quality nesting habitat as average VO declined. The use of the Robel pole to assess habitat for sharp-tailed grouse has given managers a target height of vegetation structure to have {{at the end of the}} grazing season. This allows managers to set the appropriate stocking rate to best attain a desired vegetation height. As a rule of thumb, the average VOR reading for suitable grouse nesting habitat is 3.5in (8.89 cm). Lekking habitat can be managed by burning, mowing, clear cutting, and grazing across the entire range of the sharp-tailed grouse subspecies. Ammann (1957) found that leks that contained woody vegetation did not exceed 30% of the total lek area. Similarly, Moyles (1989) found a negative correlation with increased in aspen trees (Populus tremuloides) on lekking sites and the number of displaying males present. Trees may provide perches for avian predators but further work needs to be done on the effects of tree encroachment (Manzer and Hannon 2005).|$|E
50|$|TV Ears uses {{infrared}} {{technology that}} covers up to 600 {{square feet of}} sound at a time. SoLIT, Speed of Light Infrared Transmission, sends television audio from the transmitter to the headset without delay or interference. SoLIT operates at 2.3 million cycles per second, is safe with pacemakers, does not experience television interference, {{and can be used}} by multiple people at once. However, because the system relies on light, <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> has the ability to severely disrupt the signal, which can cause problems with sound quality. The audio frequency response spans a wide range of 20-20,000 Hz with a transmission frequency of 2.3 MHz and a max volume of 125 dB. However, it has been noted that infrared systems are known for exhibiting glitches with the quality of their sound, producing low wavelengths of noise, which can be a problem for those with hearing impairments. With their wireless capabilities, TV Ears may be used with many different kinds of plasma and LCD flat screen televisions, cable, or satellite boxes with audio analog port capabilities.|$|E

50|$|By definition, line {{of sight}} is the visual {{line of sight}}, that is {{determined}} by the ability of the average human eye to resolve a distant object. Our eyes are sensitive to light but optical wavelengths are very short compared to radio wavelengths. Optical wavelengths range from about 400 nanometer (nm) to 700 nm but radio wavelengths range from approximately 1 millimetre (mm) at 300 GHz to 30 kilometres (km) at 10 kHz. Even the shortest radio wavelength is therefore about 2000 times longer than the longest optical wavelength. For typical communications frequencies up to about 10 GHz the difference is more like 60,000 times so it is not always reliable to compare <b>visual</b> <b>obstructions,</b> such as might suggest a NLOS path, with the same obstructions as they might affect a radio propagation path.|$|R

5000|$|Research {{conducted}} before 1950 on sharp-tailed grouse habitat {{assessment was}} done visually. Hamerstrom (1939) reported sparse vegetation was seldom selected for nesting {{due to lack}} of adequate cover. Habitat generalizations were formed {{based on the number of}} individuals found at a given local. These assumptions were if more birds were present at one location and less at another, then the first must be the better habitat. Hamerstrom (1963) observed 119 of 207 (57%) grouse broods frequenting savannah style habitat. He concluded that the savannah style habitat was the habitat needed for best management. As the research on habitat for grouse species matured, so did the techniques used for assessment. Cover boards and Robel poles were developed to measure <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> (VO) and create habitat indices. Cover boards were developed as early as 1938 by Wight (1938) to study white-tailed deer habitat. Wight’s (1938) cover board was 6 feet in height, marked and numbered every foot. Visible marks were counted to measure obstruction by plants. Kobriger (1965) developed a 4×4-foot board marked at 3-inch intervals with alternating white and black squares. He placed a camera in the center of the breeding ground at a height of 3 feet. He then placed the cover board 30 feet away taking photographs of the cover board. After compiling all the photographs, they were analyzed with a hand lens to assess the number of squares visible. This number gave him a vegetation index of cover classes. This method has been modified by Limb et al. (2007). Instead of taking photographs 30 feet away like Kobriger (1965), Limb et al. (2007) took photographs of vegetation back-dropped by a 1×1-meter cover board at a height of 1 meter, 4 meters away. These digital photographs were uploaded to Adobe Acrobat and digitized to the 1×1-meter backdrop (Limb et al. 2007). Robel et al. (1970) developed a pole to determine height based on correlated vegetation weight. The pole was duly named the Robel pole. Robel et al. (1970) found that VO measurements taken at a height of 1 m and a distance of 4 m from the pole gave a reliable index of the amount of vegetation production at a location. Hamerstrom et al. (1957) were quoted as saying [...] "Height and density of grass were clearly more important to the prairie chickens than species composition" [...] as reported by Robel et al. (1970). This was also believed to be true for the sharp-tailed grouse. These key aspects can now be assessed using the Robel pole, Nudds cover board, and Limb et al. digital photography method effectively and efficiently.|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of above ground biomass {{is important in}} managing natural resources, like assessing habitat conditions. Direct, destructive measurements by clipping, drying, and weighing plant matter is time consuming and labor intensive. It is of interest to develop non-invasive methods to complement or replace direct vegetation harvest. Two non-invasive methods were evaluated, light penetration and <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction,</b> in the Purdue Wildlife Area prairie. Light penetration in the grassland plots were measured using a Decagon light stick (LP- 80), 5 cm {{from the ground and}} above the plants. Estimation of <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> was done using a Robel pole, which focuses on the height and density of the vegetation. Plots were also clipped to provide direct measurements. The relationship between clipped and estimated biomass was significant for both non-invasive methods. However, <b>visual</b> <b>obstruction</b> had higher correlation (R 2 = 0. 74) than light penetration (R 2 = 0. 41). This could provide a basis for future interest in predicting biomass using the Robel pole method as a complement to direct clipping of vegetation.
