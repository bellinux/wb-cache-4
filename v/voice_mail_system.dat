25|$|Under the Department of Labor, the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) {{offers a}} variety of {{programs}} targeted at ending homelessness among veterans. The Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program (HVRP) is the only national program that is exclusively focused on assisting veterans as they reenter the workforce. In addition, the VETS program also has an Incarcerated Veterans' Transition Program as well as services that are unique to female Veterans. Mainstream programs initiated by the Department of Labor have included the Workforce Investment Act, One-Stop Career Centers, and a Community <b>Voice</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>system</b> that helps to connect homeless individuals around the United States with local resources. In addition, targeted labor programs have included the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Project, the Disability Program Navigator Initiative, efforts to end chronic homelessness through providing employment and housing projects, Job Corps, and the Veterans Workforce Investment Program (VWIP).|$|E

50|$|A <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system,</b> on {{receiving}} a message addressed to mailbox {{it did not}} handle, would initiate an AMIS call to the target <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system</b> and relay the message information along with the message itself.

50|$|Another {{limitation}} {{is that the}} device does not work well with <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>systems.</b> This is because <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> reroutes the call from a physical line to the <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> service without the phone ever picking up.|$|R
40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>mail</b> is {{certainly}} {{one of the most common}} interactive voice response applications in telephony. And, when we talk of designing these systems to be easy to use, there is much overlap with general IVR system design, but there are also significant special characteristics to <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>systems.</b> This chapter discusses designing <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>systems</b> for usability with particular emphasis on the special characteristics, demands, conventions, and standards associated with <b>voice</b> <b>mail.</b> In addition to coverage of the ubiquitous touch-tone user interfaces, this chapter also discusses the state of the art in <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> user interfaces: novel prompt and menu structures, the use of automatic speech recognition, unified messaging (“universal mailbox”), and multimedia mail. 1...|$|R
50|$|Simplified Message Desk Interface (SMDI) is a {{protocol}} {{that defines the}} interface between a <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system</b> and a phone system such as a PBX or public telephone switch. It was developed by Bell Labs. It is used to provide the <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system</b> the information it needs to process the call. Each time a call {{is sent to the}} <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system,</b> a message is sent using SMDI over a serial interface that identifies the line, the type of call, and the calling/called party numbers. The SMDI protocol also specifies a method for turning the message-waiting indicator (MWI) on and off on individual telephones.|$|E

50|$|Routing of {{messages}} is typically achieved through dedicated AMIS trunks which are just unpublished phone numbers or back doors into a <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system,</b> {{set up to}} receive AMIS messages.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} {{is also used}} in number change announcements, <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>systems,</b> or most telephony applications that provide dynamic feedback to the caller (e.g. moviefone, tellme, and others).|$|R

50|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>systems</b> have {{employed}} time-compressed speech since {{as far back}} as the 1970s. IN this application, the technology enables the rapid review of messages in high-traffic systems, by a relatively small number of people.|$|R

50|$|In the 1980s, <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>systems</b> with IVR-like {{features}} were {{recognized as an}} access mechanism to corporate information for mobile employees, before the explosion of cell phones {{and the proliferation of}} PCs.

5000|$|Abbreviated and {{regularly}} {{referred to as}} AMIS, the Audio Messaging Interchange Specification is a standard that allows the transmittal of intact voice mail messages between voice mail systems of different vendors - allowing a user to [...] "forward" [...] a voice mail message to a user on a different <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system</b> (in a different geographic area, or conceivably, at a different company).|$|E
50|$|Night {{service in}} {{telephony}} is {{a feature of}} private branch exchanges and other business telephone systems, whereby for a set period during the day (usually those hours outside of normal office or work hours, when normal operator services are not provided), all incoming calls are automatically redirected by the switchboard to a specific extension or to equipment such as an answering machine or other <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Follow-me, {{also known}} as find-me: Determines the routing of {{incoming}} calls. The exchange is configured {{with a list of}} numbers for a person.

5000|$|Barbe was {{selected}} {{to be the first}} voice on the Octel Communications <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>systems</b> and retained that role for many years. Her voice was used on all the prompts (which numbered in the thousands). People often referred to the voice on Octel systems as [...] "Jane", and Barbe and her husband John were named honorary life employees of Octel in 1992. Over 150 million people used Octel systems prior to the company being acquired in 1997 by Lucent Technologies. By 2000, Barbe's voice was heard by about 300 million people each week. Through the years, Barbe's voice became well-known through the phone companies' use of her recordings, as well as her messages recorded for customized greetings for various corporations who bought Octel <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>systems.</b> The time announcements she recorded for NBS (now NIST) are still used on radio station WWVH. Her voice was also heard on hotel wake up calls and commercial elevator messages.|$|R

50|$|Pocket dialing (also {{known as}} pocket calling or butt dialing) {{refers to the}} {{accidental}} placement of a phone call while a person's mobile phone or cordless phone is in the owner's pocket or handbag. The recipient of the call typically hears random background noise when answering the phone. If the caller remains unaware, the recipient will sometimes overhear whatever {{is happening in the}} caller's vicinity. A pocket-dialed call can continue for many minutes, or until the recipient's <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system</b> ends the call.|$|E

Call processing in this sense may include the initial greeting of the call (perhaps time-of-day or other factor dependent) to routing the call based on dialed digits or lack thereof. The automated treatment may include routing the call to an Interactive Voice Response System (IVR), sending the call to a <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system,</b> queuing the call, etc. {{or a combination of}} steps and real-time decisions.

40|$|Abstract—Traditional {{answering}} {{machines and}} <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> services are closed systems, tightly coupled {{to a single}} end system, the local PBX or local exchange carrier. Even simple services, such as forwarding <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> to another user outside the local system, are hard to provide. With the advent of Internet telephony, we need to provide <b>voice</b> and video <b>mail</b> services.

This study examined the opinions of 357 Indiana chief executive officers regarding <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>systems</b> [...] based on a random sample of the 4, 697 members of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce as of November 18, 1992. A 100 percent response rate was achieved. The CEOs generally did not like calling into systems. The study concluded that 20 percent of Indiana businesses have <b>voice</b> <b>mail.</b> The major advantage [...] as cited by CEOs [...] to calling into systems was that they can leave detailed messages at anytime. The major disadvantage was that <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> is cold and impersonal [...] CEOs want to speak to a real person.
