50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>tweezers</b> use {{differences}} in atmospheric pressure to grasp items from 100 micrometres in size up to parts weighing several pounds. Special vacuum tweezer tips are manufactured {{to handle a}} wide variety of items such as surface-mount electronics, optics, biological material, stamps and coins. They may be used to handle parts that are so small that conventional mechanical tweezers may cause parts to be damaged or dropped and lost.|$|E

40|$|Success {{has been}} {{achieved}} using a radiation pressure gradient to levitate microscale particles in air {{for as long as}} four hours. This work is performed as a precursor {{to the development of a}} <b>vacuum</b> based optical <b>tweezers</b> interrogation tool for nanotechnology research. It was decided to first proceed with solving the problem of achieving optical levitation of a micro-scale particle in air before trying the same in a vacuum environment. This successful optical levitation in air confirms the work of Ashkin and Dziedzic. Levitation of 10 and 13. 8 microns diameter polystyrene spheres was achieved, as well as the levitation of 10 and 100 microns diameter glass spheres. Particles were raised and lowered. A modicum of success was achieved translating particles horizontally. Trapping of multiple particles in one laser beam has been photographed. Also, it has been observed that particles, that may be conglomerates or irregular in shape, can also be trapped by a focused laser beam. Levitated glass beads were photographed using laser light scattered from the beads. The fact that there is evidence of optical traps in air containing irregular and conglomerate particles provides hope that future tool particles need not be perfect spheres...|$|R
40|$|FRAGILE! The MAG*I*CAL ® {{calibration}} {{reference standard}} {{that you are}} receiving now looks like Figure A, below. If not handled carefully, it will look like Figure B. This standard is only about 50 μm thick (about the diameter of a human hair) even at the thicker outer edge. It is held safely in place in a strong titanium grid, but if you touch the central silicon portion with your tweezers, the standard can shatter. Please be careful! <b>Vacuum</b> <b>tweezers</b> on the standard edge are recommended. If not available, use very fine regular tweezers VERY carefully and gently. Good luck!

40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed at}} {{calibrating}} {{a new set}} of GR- 200 A thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) in low and medium kilovoltage energy photon therapy beams and in a diagnostic beam of known beam quality, in order to determine their response and to establish if the same set of TLDs could be used across both environments for in-vivo dosimetry purposes. Methods and Materials: A set of 20 TLDs was used for this study. An Oven type PCL 3 was used to anneal the TLDs. The response of the TLDs was read using the Reader type LTM manufactured by Harshaw Bicron, United State of America. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>tweezers</b> were used to transfer the TLDs at the time of measurements and calibration. TLDs were kept in a subdued ultra-violet environment between the annealing and irradiation process. TLDs were placed on a 30 x 30 x 17. 6 cm³ Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) phantom during irradiation. A calibrated Orthovoltage machine was used to deliver a known absorbed dose to the TLDs. A cylindrical ionization chamber (PTW 30001) and an electrometer (PTW 10008) were used to confirm the absorbed dose delivery of the orthovoltage machine at the time of measurement. Likewise, a calibrated LX 40 radiotherapy Simulator was used to deliver a known diagnostic absorbed dose to the TLDs. A TM 77334 ionization chamber was used similarly to confirm the absorbed dose. The TLDs were also irradiated on the PMMA phantom. The accepted variation in raw response of the individual TLDs from the average of the batch was compared and a deviation of less than ± 20...|$|E
