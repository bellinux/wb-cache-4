40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} of {{electric}} <b>vehicles</b> <b>charging</b> {{with the use of}} large truck/bus vehicles moving along national highways and provincial roads is proposed and described. The method relies on <b>charging</b> <b>vehicles</b> from trucks while moving either with plug in electric connection or by electromagnetic induction via loosely coupled coils. Open research challenges and several avenues or opportunities for future research on Electric <b>Vehicles</b> <b>Charging</b> are outlined. The proposed method overcomes the disadvantages of the so far known techniques. The advantages of this method compared to the so far proposed methods are a) economical, easy and safe procedure, b) increase of the energy transfer efficiency factor, c) minimization of the delay in vehicle movement during the charging procedure and d) reduction of the environmental contamination with CO 2 or electromagnetic radiation. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the utilisation of PV systems for electric <b>vehicles</b> <b>charging</b> for transportation requirements of smart cities. The gap between PV power output and <b>vehicles</b> <b>charging</b> demand is highly variable. Therefore, {{there is a}} need for additional support from a public distribution grid or a storage device in order to handle the residual power. Long term measurement data retrieved from a charging station for 15 vehicles equipped with a PV system were used in the research. Low and high irradiation seasons influenced the PV output. The charging demand of electric vehicles varied over the course of a year and was correlated to weather conditions. Therefore, the sizing and performance of a supportive storage device should be evaluated in a statistical manner using long period observations...|$|R

25|$|About 6 a.m. on 17 November 2010 a fire {{broke out}} on the vehicle deck of the MS Pearl of Scandinavia on its way from Oslo to Copenhagen. The ferry's fire {{sprinkler}} system {{put out the fire}} before any of the crew or the 490 sleeping passengers were injured and the ship could dock in Copenhagen under its own power. It was determined that the cause of the fire was a short circuit in the plug of an extension cord used to charge a rebuilt Nissan Qashqai, converted into a battery electric vehicle by the Sakskøbing based company A Future EV. The company owner was returning from Norway where the vehicle had started the approval process for general sale there, and had used an extension cord to charge the vehicle from a general purpose power outlet on the ferry. The ferry operator DFDS Seaways consequently prohibited <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> on board its ferries while the investors withdrew their support for the vehicle company forcing it into bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|The ESB eCar {{electric}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> network {{serves as}} the main charging network for the island of Ireland and has rapidly expanded in recent years. Currently the network is free to use with an RFID card provided by ESB to EV owners who wish to use the network. The network aims to provide rapid charging every 30km on major routes and as of 2015 has almost 2000 standard charging points (all provide connection via IEC 62196 Type 2 Mennekes, around half are 22kW with the remainder a mix of 3.6kW and 7.4kW). There are around 100 CHAdeMO rapid chargers with over 70 located outside the Dublin Metro area. All rapid chargers installed since mid-2014 have been triple standard CHAdeMO/Combined Charging System/AC 43kW. Four rapid chargers in Dublin and two rapid chargers in Belfast were co-funded by the EU {{as part of the}} UK/Ireland RCN program.
