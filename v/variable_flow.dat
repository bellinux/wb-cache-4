40|$|Using data {{available}} for small rotameters that use spherical floats in gas flow, a linear relationship is derived. It is {{noted that the}} relationship provides {{a good fit for}} <b>variable</b> volumetric <b>flow,</b> density, and viscosity at constant flow height. With low Reynolds numbers (Re being less than 1), the product of the <b>variable</b> volumetric <b>flow</b> and the viscosity becomes constant; at high Reynolds numbers (Re being greater than 2000), the product of the <b>variable</b> volumetric <b>flow</b> and the square root of the density becomes constant. It is pointed out that the equation given here can be used to obtain an indirect calibration with any gas of known density and viscosity. The constancy of the product of the <b>variable</b> volumetric <b>flow</b> and viscosity at low <b>variable</b> volumetric <b>flows</b> is seen as suggesting the development of simple, inexpensive gas viscometers using rotameter technology...|$|R

25|$|The rivers flowing {{east to the}} Atlantic are {{generally}} shallower and have more <b>variable</b> <b>flow</b> than the other rivers. Many empty into lagoons in the coastal plain. The largest coastal lagoon, Laguna Merín, forms part of the border with Brazil. Six smaller lagoons, some freshwater and some brackish, line the coast farther south.|$|E
25|$|The Canal du Midi {{still had}} {{shortcomings}} {{because it did}} not pass through Carcassonne nor Narbonne and did not join the Rhône. In addition, to reach Bordeaux, it was necessary to take the Garonne which has <b>variable</b> <b>flow</b> rates and violent floods. The Canal de Jonction or 'junction canal', built in 1776, gave access to Narbonne via the Canal de la Robine de Narbonne. The same year the Canal de Brienne allowed the bypass of Bazacle - the ford on the Garonne in Toulouse which blocked the river. The connection between the étang de Thau and the Rhone was also completed in 1808. In 1810 a diversion canal allowed Carcassonne to be connected. Finally in 1857 the Canal latéral à la Garonne was opened between Toulouse and Castets-en-Dorthe, completing the link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea that Riquet had dreamt of.|$|E
500|$|The river's {{catchment}} area of approximately [...] {{is the largest}} of any waterway within the Adelaide region. The upper reaches are {{used to create a}} potable water supply for metropolitan Adelaide with the river supplying three of Adelaide's eight reservoirs. The upper catchment has an average annual rainfall of between [...] at its eastern end to [...] near Uraidla. The Torrens has a very <b>variable</b> <b>flow</b> leaving early settlers to use trial and error in determining bridge heights, with many bridges consequently being washed away. Due to the variability of Adelaide's climate, flow rates can change from a trickle to flood conditions quickly. On 5 June 1889, prior to major flooding, the flow rate before it entered the suburbs was , rising to , eight days later.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of variable stormwater and wastewater flows, mostly precipitation driven, brings {{with them the}} challenge of both peak flows and pollutant loads. Wastewater treatment systems {{can be divided into}} those that are specifically designed and operated to deal with <b>variable</b> <b>flows,</b> and those that presume more steady-state operation, only coping with peak flows as anomalies for short periods of time. To date, the different types and scales of variability and the impact of this variability on functioning and treatment performance have neither been well characterised nor properly dealt with for the design of suitable treatment systems. In this book, ecotechnologies are defined as processes for the treatment of <b>variable</b> wastewater <b>flows</b> that harness ecological processes involving microbes, plants, animals, natural soils and media or recycled materials; have a low reliance on mechanical machinery or external energy sources; and {{have a positive impact on}} the quality and biodiversity of the surrounding environment.

50|$|The effects a <b>variable</b> <b>flow</b> {{system had}} on the {{selection}} of control valves, was not initially realized. A control valve was selected by using the same Kv calculation and the bypass on a 3-port valve blocked, giving a 2-port valve. Unfortunately it wasn’t that simple. This is because our Kv calculationKv = Flow Rate (m3/h) / Δ P (Bar)was based upon a constant pressure and a constant Kvs, delivering a constant flow. However, as areas of the <b>variable</b> <b>flow</b> system closed down the differential pressure increased, stepping up the delivery flow and causing overflow in the open circuits.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} threats to the {{integrity}} of the wetlands in the park comes from possible future regulation of flows of the Paroo River flows. The ecosystems of the wetlands of the Paroo River are adapted to the highly <b>variable</b> <b>flow</b> regime that is characteristic of this river. Changes to this naturally <b>variable</b> <b>flow</b> regime will impact on the ecological characteristics and the extent of these wetland ecosystems. These impacts could include genetic isolation of populations, fragmentation of breeding populations, removal of breeding cues for waterbird and fish species, changed species composition and loss of habitat diversity. The natural flow regime could be affected by water extraction or by the building of levee banks which divert flows.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{conventional}} {{analysis of}} communication over graphical networks {{assumes that the}} energy received by a node on its incoming links cannot be reused by the latter for transmission on its outgoing links. Motivated by the emerging applications of wireless energy transfer to communication networks, a frame-work is studied in which the received energy can be (partially) reused. The framework leads to optimization problems over both standard information <b>flow</b> <b>variables</b> and energy <b>flow</b> <b>variables</b> that generalize the conventional formulation in terms of information <b>flow</b> <b>variables</b> only. Both unicast and multicast models are studied, and numerical results are presented that bring insight into {{the roles of the}} energy <b>flow</b> <b>variables</b> and of network coding in the presence of energy reuse.
