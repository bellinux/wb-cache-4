In the CBL the <b>virtual</b> potential <b>temperature</b> and the vertical velocity fields are dominated by horizontal scales {{on the order of}} the boundary layer depth.

It is found that mesoscale fluctuations are negligibly small only for conserved variables that have an entrainment to surface flux ratio close to 20. 25, which is about the flux ratio for the buoyancy. In the CBL the moisture and potential temperature flux ratios can have values that significantly deviate from this number.
