We find a significant but declining association between the home market of the Eurobond 2 ̆ 019 s currency of denomination {{and that of the}} lead underwriter. These bonds underwritten by underwriters 2 ̆ 018 local 2 ̆ 019 to the currency also carry significantly lower underwriter gross spreads vis- 0 -vis other Eurobonds. The amalgamation of the European currencies into the Euro resulted in a significant shift in the competitive landscape for underwriting services. We find a significant portion of market shares shifted from the 2 ̆ 018 local 2 ̆ 019 European underwriters to non- 2 ̆ 018 local 2 ̆ 019 U. S. underwriters with the introduction of the Euro. Moreover, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> rose and the gross underwriter spread declined significantly. Our empirical results suggest that Eurozone underwriters responded to the increased entry of U. S. and other Eurozone underwriter with aggressive discounting of the underwriter gross spread...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{initial public offerings}} {{generated}} extensive academic research first in the U. S. during the 1970 ’s and 1980 's. This early theoretical and empirical work produced interesting theoretical explanations {{on the most important}} empirical finding about IPOs, namely, the persistence of underpricing. Subsequent work also uncovered other puzzling phenomena, as for example, the long-term stock price underperformance <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> and the existence of "hot market" periods, when the underpricing is excessively high. The significant <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> work on <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> conducted on foreign markets was built on this earlier research and was due to two important developments. First, the wave of privatizations of previously state-owned enterprises, which intensified in the late 1980 's and continued through the 1990 's, and second, the world-wide raising of substantial sums of equity in public markets by privately owned corporations. This special issue on IPOs contains five papers that report empirical findings from different countries. An important feature of the market for IPOs, documented in several capital markets, is the tendency of the market to undergo periods of concentrated activity, whereby the number <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> coming to the market and the extent of underpricing both appear to substantially increase. These "hot issue " periods generate strong interest and attention because of their perceived potential for short term trading profits. Yet, little attention has been directed towards the formal identification of ho...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the levels <b>of</b> under-pricing for <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> in a developing country, Malaysia, over {{a more recent}} period, January 1990 -December 1998, than reported in prior studies. Three types <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> were examined, namely public issue, offer for sale and combination or hybrid of offer for sale and public issue. Comparisons of initial return between types <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> and between different board of listing were made. The results of independent t -tests for difference in mean initial returns indicate that, in general, there are significant differences in mean initial returns between types <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> and between boards of listing. The results of step-wise regression reveal that on average, only over-subscription ratio contributes significantly to the initial returns. However, caution should be taken when interpreting the models formed because the Durbin-Watson rest indicate that some models are not free from problem of auto-correlation of the residuals. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{puzzle of}} {{hot and cold}} issue markets has {{attracted}} substantial interest in the academic community. The behavior <b>of</b> IPO <b>volume</b> and initial returns over time is well documented respectively (see, Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975), Ritter (1984), Rock (1986), McGuinness (1992), Lee, Taylor, and Walter (1999) and Lowry (2003)). Few studies, however, investigate the dynamic interrelationship between IPO volume and initial returns. This paper uses a simultaneous equations approach to study the endogenous interrelationship between IPO volume and initial return. We find that higher IPO volume causes higher initial returns, but not vice versa. Furthermore, lagged IPO volume is significantly negatively related to initial returns. In other words, the underpricing <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> <b>issue</b> is affected by not only the concurrent number <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> at the mean time {{but also by the}} numbers <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> in prior periods. Another purpose of our study is to test the hypothesis that technological innovation is the main driver behind hot issue markets. Welch (1989) and Hoffmann-Burchardi (2001) suggest that the clustering <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> is caused by IPO volume spikes in industries that have recently experienced technological innovations or favorable productivity shocks. Through analysis of the industry correlation matrix <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>issue</b> activity and a fixed-effects model based on industry level data, we find evidence against the technological innovation hypothesis...|$|R
