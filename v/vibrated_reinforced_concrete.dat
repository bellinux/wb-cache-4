The plants were designed to ensure a treatment capacity of 5, 10, 20 and 30 equivalent inhabitants (PE). The main aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the incidence of construction, disposal and operation phases on the total impacts evaluated with three different methods: ReCiPe 2008, Ecological Footprint and IPCC 2007 100 years. The most significant phase for both treatment lines was the use phase, which contributed more than 80 % to the total impacts. The construction phase was the second most impactful phase with an incidence less than 25 % for both systems and for all the considered impacts assessment methods. The plant in LLDPE was more eco-friendly than that in (VRC). The plant in VRC was always most impactful, even comparing each single phase of the life cycle and for all the treatment capacities taken into consideration. Finally, the obtained results were not dependent on the impact assessment method considered...|$|E

40|$|Although a {{great deal}} of work in {{investigating}} the possibility of using linear vibration techniques to detect damage in bridges has been carried out over the past 25 years, there are still some major concerns, such as poor sensitivity of modal parameters to damage, requirement of baseline data, need of measuring excitation force as well as environmental effects. Nonlinearity in the vibration characteristics when the structure is damaged further complicates the problem and causes doubts on the feasibility of applying these techniques on actual structures. Understanding of the nonlinear behaviour is therefore crucial. The aim of the work presented herein is to improve the current understanding of the nonlinear vibration characteristics of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams and to assess its importance to the subject of structural health monitoring of bridges. These non-linear vibration characteristics were studied by conducting harmonic excitation vibration tests on <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams at various damage levels. In order to detect and characterise the nonlinear behaviour, both linear and nonlinear system identification techniques were used. Results indicated that the responses of the tested beams showed marked softening behaviour and that this non-linear vibration behaviour varied with increasing damage. The restoring force surface technique was applied to the test data and results suggested that cracks in <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams never fully closed in the vibration cycle. Existing phenomenological models suggested by other researchers were investigated and compared with the experimental results. The study confirmed that a bilinear crack model would not be sufficient to replicate the observed <b>vibrating</b> cracked <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams' behaviour. Based on these phenomenological models, an empirical model was derived. Using the empirical crack model proposed, the author suggested a means of estimating the ratio of cracked and uncracked stiffness of a <b>vibrating</b> cracked <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beam. The author further suggested a possible routine for structural health monitoring for <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beam and stressed that it could be extended for more complicated structures, like bridges. To improve understanding of the nonlinearities in the vibration characteristics, a damage mechanics model of cracked <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beam was suggested. Based on strain softening behaviour of concrete material under tensile force, the model is capable of including damage {{in the form of a}} moment rotation relationship over the cracked region. Results from the vibration analysis of the model were compared with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Self-compacting fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> (SCFRC) {{combines}} {{the benefits of}} SCC in the fresh state with an enhanced postcracking performance in the hardened state thanks to the fibres. The main properties of SCFRC in the fresh state {{will be affected by}} the fibres. The beneficial effect of the fibres in the hardened state (i. e. postcracking resistance) will, among other factors, depend on their orientation in the cracked section. One could suppose that fibres orient along the flow due to the effect of the walls and the velocity profile in the concrete flow. To investigate the influence of hooked-end fibres on the fresh and hardened behaviour of SCFRC, a research program is started at the Reyntjens Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, K. U. Leuven. The following parameters are investigated: length of the fibre, flow distance of the concrete and type of concrete (SCFRC and traditionally <b>vibrated</b> fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> (TFRC)). Both the fresh properties of SCFRC and the mechanical characteristics in the hardened state (bending test according to EN 14651 : 2005, orientation analysis by X-ray detection and fibre counting) are determined. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> is {{a common}} {{structural}} material since it is strong, durable and relatively cheap. Of the various deterioration mechanisms of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structures, chloride-induced corrosion of steel reinforcement is of great importance since numerous <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structures are exposed to chlo-ride sources [129]. ASCE 2005 Report Card estimates a cost of $ 9. 4 billion a year for 20 years to eliminate deficiencies of 590, 750 bridges in the United States, almost half of which are <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete.</b> A 1998 survey states that 9 % of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> bridges in the United States are structurally deficient, primarily due to corrosion of steel reinforcement [196].
