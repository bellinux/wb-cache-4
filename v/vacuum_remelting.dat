50|$|Most {{grades of}} steel are melted once and are then cast or teemed into a solid form prior to {{extensive}} forging or rolling to a metallurgically sound form. In contrast, VIM-VAR steels go through two more highly purifying melts under vacuum. After melting in an {{electric arc furnace}} and alloying in an argon oxygen decarburization vessel, steels destined for <b>vacuum</b> <b>remelting</b> are cast into ingot molds. The solidified ingots then head for a vacuum induction melting furnace. This <b>vacuum</b> <b>remelting</b> process rids the steel of inclusions and unwanted gases while optimizing the chemical composition. The VIM operation returns these solid ingots to the molten state in the contaminant-free void of a vacuum. This tightly controlled melt often requires up to 24 hours. Still enveloped by the vacuum, the hot metal flows from the VIM furnace crucible into giant electrode molds. A typical electrode stands about 15 feet (5 m) tall and will be in various diameters. The electrodes solidify under vacuum.|$|E
50|$|The most {{efficient}} separation routine for terbium salt from the rare-earth salt solution is ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions {{present in the}} resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. As with other rare earths, terbium metal is produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal. Calcium and tantalum impurities can be removed by <b>vacuum</b> <b>remelting,</b> distillation, amalgam formation or zone melting.|$|E
40|$|Certain {{difficulties}} {{have been}} encountered {{in attempts to}} substitute a 'one-step' casting process, developed at Iowa State College, for the 'normal' process generally used {{for the production of}} extrusion billets. In the 'one-step' process molten metal is delivered from the reduction bomb to the billet mold instead of allowing the metal to solidify in the bomb with subsequent <b>vacuum</b> <b>remelting</b> of the biscuit metal before casting in the billet mold. Routine analyses had failed to establish significant differences in the composition of normal and one-step metal. The one-step billets had been extruded satisfactorily, and finished slugs were prepared and subjected to the usual canning operation. In subsequent tests however, it was found that {{a large percentage of the}} canned slugs were badly defective. An investigation was requested to determine the differences in composition or structure of the X-C and normal metal which would account for the failure of the X-C slugs. Samples of the failed slugs and of metal from various stages of both the one-step and normal processes were supplied by Madison Square Area, for comparison on the basis of analyses, microstructure, or such other tests as seemed desirable...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} of unconventional welding methods and influence of remelting {{in the quality of}} the welded joints of the 02 Cr 10 Ni 10 Mo 2 TiAl steel. Besides usual experimental techniques the correlation of the fracture toughness with other mechanical properties is used. Amount of residual stresses is observed using the neutron diffraction. There is possible to place the methods with high energy density among unconventional methods of fusion welding, especially both, plasma arc welding and electron beam welding, used in present work. In comparison these methods with conventional methods of fusion welding, the electron beam welding appears to be the most favourable process. The remelting ensures higher homogenity of the base metal and consequently results in the higher quality of welded joints. The most common <b>vacuum</b> <b>remelting</b> method had not introduced improvements into the desired increase of the mechanical properties. The electroslag remelting with the specially designed slag positively influenced the toughness and ductility of the experimental steel. This process also eliminated the difficulties of impurities segregation {{in the area of the}} edge and the heat affected zone. Thus, the quality of the welds is defined by the solidification process of the weld metal. In some cases, it is not possible to remove a sample to conduct a standard fracture touhgness test. Also the financial aspect and the experimental seriousness do not play negligible role. Accordingly it is not advantageous to state correlation of fracture toughness with additional mechanical properties. The predicted values of fracture toughness, calculated by the correlations coefficients, showed out good agreement with the experimental values. The level of residual stresses, in the both conducted welding methods, remains low below the allowable level. The electron beam welds are characterized by only the compressive stresses. In the case the plasma arc welding is used, the maximal tensile stresses are to 6 -times lowered. The results showed good usability of the both welding methods for welding of 02 Cr 10 Ni 10 Mo 2 TiAl steel grade. For the both, plasma arc and electron beam welding methods,it is necessary the optimization of welding parameters as well as improvement of the whole welding process, including the preparation of the welded constituents. The use of the electroslag remelted basic metal conducts to the increase in toughness and ductility of welds. The final distribution and reached level of the resudual stresses are in the case of electron beam welds extraordinary promising.

50|$|For VIM-VAR steels, {{the surface}} of the cooled {{electrodes}} must be ground to remove surface irregularities and impurities before the next <b>vacuum</b> <b>remelt.</b> Then the ground electrode is placed in a VAR furnace. In a VAR furnace the steel gradually melts drop-by-drop in the vacuum-sealed chamber. <b>Vacuum</b> arc <b>remelting</b> further removes lingering inclusions to provide superior steel cleanliness and further remove gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen. Controlling the rate at which these droplets form and solidify ensures a consistency of chemistry and microstructure throughout the entire VIM-VAR ingot. This in turn makes the steel more resistant to fracture or fatigue. This refinement process is essential to meet the performance characteristics of parts like a helicopter rotor shaft, a flap actuator on a military jet or a bearing in a jet engine.|$|R

50|$|Crankshafts {{can also}} be {{machined}} out of a billet, often a bar of high quality <b>vacuum</b> <b>remelted</b> steel. Though the fiber flow (local inhomogeneities of the material's chemical composition generated during casting) doesnâ€™t follow {{the shape of the}} crankshaft (which is undesirable), this is usually not a problem since higher quality steels, which normally are difficult to forge, can be used. These crankshafts tend to be very expensive due to the large amount of material that must be removed with lathes and milling machines, the high material cost, and the additional heat treatment required. However, since no expensive tooling is needed, this production method allows small production runs without high costs.|$|R
