The geometry of this valve is described by a 3 D model and hybrid mesh elements [...] -tetrahedron and hexahedron [...] -are applied to generate the necessary computational meshes for the further calculation. Using the CFD commercial code FLUENT, the internal flow was studied for the turbulent flow situation.

40|$|AbstractHeart valve {{dysfunction}} is {{a significant}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} around the world. Sustainability of the artificial heart valves such as either mechanical or biological (homo-graft, xeno-graft) is not proved yet. Requirement for anti-coagulation medication and calcification within a short time are the major defects of artificial valves which may lead to re-replacement of the valve. Whereas, the bio prosthetic valves are not currently useful in clinical application, so, the valve sparing surgery with shorter convalescence and economical aspect can be the best alternative for valvular disease treatment. This research attempts to model the geometric dimension of aortic heart valve through a complex calculation. The objective of this research is to define the parameters such as angle between leaflets and <b>valve</b> <b>base</b> (resp. leaflet and wall of the valve) in close (resp. open) position of the valve and also the angle of leaflet free-edge in open position which are hardly measurable in reality. These parameters can be used for calculating the required dimensions of the valves’ leaflet according to the other dimension of the valve for a successful sparing surgery...|$|E

40|$|Left {{ventricular}} aneurysm (LVA) remains a poorly understood entity, often resulting in congestive failure {{that is not}} consistently improved by standard resection with linear closure. Although other surgical approaches have been proposed, current methods to assess their effect on left ventricular function are not adequate. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to quantitatively define regional systolic function in patients with LVA and to assess acute changes in regional function after standard repair. Seven patients underwent resection of an anteroa-pical LVA. Intraoperative two-dimensional echocardiography was performed off cardiopul-monary bypass immediately before and after resection. In all patients, short-axis views at the papillary muscle (apex) level showed anteroseptal paradox and distorted geometry, whereas at the mitral <b>valve</b> (<b>base),</b> symmetric wall motion and geometry were preserved. Videotaped echo images were divided into octants by a floating axis fitted to internal landmarks. Myocardial area and midwall perimeter were obtained for each octant, and wall thickness was calculated at end diastole (ED), isovolumetric systole (IS), and end systole (ES). Wall thickening (A t) for each segment was calculated as the percent increase in thickness from ED and averaged for all seven patients.

30|$|The valve {{level control}} {{is the main}} {{difference}} of control system between MMC, HVDC Flexible, conventional HVDC and two-level HVDC Flexible. The <b>valve</b> <b>base</b> controller (VBC) in the HVDC Flexible is the middle connector to realize the station level control system and low-level sub-module control. It is used to realize the control, protection and monitoring of the valve arms and the communication between the station control system and converter valve. Meanwhile it {{is also used to}} realize the balance function of the sub-module capacitor voltage and circulation control function, which is the key to ensure the normal operation of the MMC HVDC Flexible system. Because the valve arm in the system with high voltage and large capacity is generally made up of hundreds of sub-modules, in order to ensure the voltage balance between each sub-module, VBC has a high requirement on the data disposal speed of the sub-modules, usually less than 100  μs. It is a huge challenge for the valve control design to achieve this high speed control balance technique of large-scale sub-modules. The unique circulation phenomenon of modular multi-level technique will cause the increase of the converter valve current stress and the loss level. If serious enough, it may make the system lose the balance and be unable to operate normally. For this reason, the design of circulating current control strategy is also a key factor in valve control.|$|E
40|$|Objective—To map {{aspects of}} the {{innervation}} of the mitral valve complex and determine any association with the development or progression of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in dogs. Sample Population—Septal mitral valve leaflets from 11 dogs aged 6 months to > 10 years. Procedures—Expression of protein gene product 9. 5 (general neuronal marker), tyrosine hydroxylase (adrenergic innervation marker), vasoactive intestinal peptide (parasympathetic innervation marker), and calcitonin gene–related peptide (sensory innervation marker) was assessed by use of a standard immunohistochemical technique. Innervation was assessed qualitatively and semiquantitatively. Differences between valvular zones and between groups were analyzed statistically. Results—MMVD was present in leaflets of all dogs ≥ 5 years of age. Innervation was confirmed in all leaflets but was markedly reduced in leaflets of dogs > 10 years of age. Innervation was most dense {{at the base of}} valves and mainly associated with the epimysial, perimysial, and endomysial layers of the muscle and blood vessels within the valve. Innervation was reduced within the middle zone of the valve and lacking at the free edge. Innervation was not identified {{at the tip of the}} leaflet, the free edge, or the chordae. Nerve fibers were mostly sympathetic, with the remainder being parasympathetic or sensory. Existence of MMVD did not alter the pattern or density of innervation. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Mitral valve leaflets in the study dogs were innervated, with most of the nerve fibers associated with the myocardium in the <b>valve</b> <b>base.</b> Development of MMVD appeared to precede the reduction of innervation associated with advancing age. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} wave generator {{is a critical}} component of a pulse tube refrigerator. Conventionally either a solenoid operated electromagnetic valve or a rotary valve driven by a hermetically sealed motor is used for this. In this article, we present a novel {{pressure wave}} generator design based on cam operated valves for use with pulse tube refrigerators. This, when coupled with an inverter drive (variable frequency drive), forms a versatile pressure wave generator in the range between 1 and 10 Hz. In a single stage double inlet pulse tube using this type of pressure wave generator, refrigeration power of about 6 W at 77 K and a no load temperature of about 42 K were obtained. The above results are comparable to those obtained with pulse tube systems based on other two types of pressure wave generators. While the rotary <b>valve</b> <b>based</b> pressure wave generator is prone to developing leaks at the rotating seal, the solenoid <b>valve</b> <b>based</b> system cannot be operated continuously due to coil failure. The cam operated <b>valve</b> <b>based</b> pressure wave generator overcomes the above shortfalls of rotary valve and solenoid valve type pressure generators and is well suited for continuous operation of the refrigerator...|$|R

In addition, achievable control bandwidths are typically lower than throttle <b>valve</b> <b>based</b> control approaches. We have recently begun a project to achieve the functionality of a variable displacement pump by combining a fixed displacement pump, a pulse width modulated (PWM) on/off valve under closed loop feedback control, and an accumulator.

40|$|BackgroundBetter {{understanding}} of aortic root geometry could improve diagnosis and reconstruction of pathologic aortic valves. In this study, a previous model of hemispheric aortic valve leaflets nested within a cylindrical aorta was refined in humans with normal aortic valves. MethodsUsing 1 -mm axial slices, high-resolution computed tomographic angiograms from 10 normal aortic roots {{were used to}} generate high-density X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates of valve structures using Mathematica software. Three-dimensional least squares regression analyses of leaflet and sinus coordinates were employed to compare multiple geometric models of aortic valve and root geometry. Shapes and dimensions of all root structures were evaluated and compared. ResultsAortic valve geometry was roughly hemispherical, but the <b>valve</b> <b>base</b> was elliptical (minor–major diameter ratio = . 66). Dimensional fits of the leaflet–sinus complexes also were better using ellipsoidal geometry, with taller leaflets than predicted by hemispheres. The commissure between the left and noncoronary cusps was located uniformly at the posterior junction of the base minor diameter and circumference, with {{the center of the}} right coronary cusp opposite. The subcommissural post areas flared outward by 5 ° to 10 °, and the volume of the right coronary leaflet–sinus complex was 12. 4 % and 10. 7 % larger than the noncoronary cusps and left cusps, respectively. ConclusionsThe normal human aortic valve is an elliptical structure, and ellipsoidal refinements improve representation of leaflet geometry. The left and noncoronary cusps commissure is located posteriorly; the right coronary cusp is located anteriorly. This model could be useful in quantifying pathologic geometry and in engineering devices for aortic valve reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|Echocardiography is {{the current}} method of choice in equine {{cardiology}} to assess valvular function, cardiac dimensions and myocardial thickness. M-Mode allows an assessment of myocardial function. However, despite new techniques in equine diagnostic cardiology such as tissue doppler imaging, prognosticating equine patients with cardiologic findings remains challenging. The current study evaluated rotational deformation of the equine left ventricle (LV) by two-dimensional speckle tracking on three different scan planes. The rotational deformation was derived from three left parasternal short-axis images recorded {{at the level of}} the mitral <b>valve</b> (<b>base),</b> the medial level and the apical level. In these gray scale loops, natural acoustic markers (speckles) were tracked and traced by a dedicated software package (EchoPac PC, GE Healthcare) to determine myocardial deformation in the circumferential plane. Thirty-eight horses were included in the study. To establish reference values and to evaluate the reproducibility of our method, 16 healthy warmblood horses were examined (control group). Data was acquired on three consecutive days by two observers. Then, 22 horses of different breeds with cardiac problems were examined. In 8 horses diagnosed with valvular dysfunction, a deviation in cardiac dimensions could be identified. No alteration of cardiac dimensions was found in 9 additional patients with the same diagnosis. All horses underwent a standard echocardiographic examination with B-Mode, M-Mode and colour doppler echocardiography. All B-Mode recordings of the healthy horses were of adequate quality. We identified a similar systolic rotational motion with different amplitudes at the three myocardial levels. As seen from the base, the motion starts with an initial (or early systolic) clockwise rotation (positive rotation angle) followed by a counterclockwise rotation (negative rotation angle). There was a significant difference between the rotational amplitudes at each level. We found an increase in left ventricular rotation from the basal to the apical level. The results of the group with cardiac findings also showed a significant difference in rotational amplitude between the scan levels. There was no significant difference between the group of horses with cardiac findings and the healthy group on each scan level. Horses with cardiac findings and a deviation of the left atrium and / or the left ventricle had a significant decrease in rotational amplitude compared to the healthy group (p < 0, 0001). Also the timespan to the systolic rotational peak increased from the basal to the apical level without significant differences between the groups. The coefficient of variation on the medial level was low to moderate (5, 99 % bis 19, 28 %) whereas the apical and basal level showed low to high variability (4, 66 % - bis 31, 64 %). In conclusion, we were able to show that left ventricular rotational motion can be evaluated noninvasively using two-dimensional speckle-tracking-based wall motion analysis applied to standard two-dimensional echocardiographic recordings of the LV in a right-parasternal short-axis view, especially {{at the level of the}} papillary muscles. We found a difference in left ventricular rotation between horses, humans and dogs. Additionally we showed that left ventricular rotational deformation is affected by changes in left ventricular and atrial size. Further studies are necessary to prove the validity of this method in horses with cardiac dysfunction. Additionally this method should be evaluated at rest and in exercise...|$|E
