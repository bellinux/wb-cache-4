40|$|The {{characteristics}} of microbubble distillation of binary system of ethanol and water have been investigated. The study describes {{the use of}} a fluidic oscillator used to generate microbubbles. The effects of air temperature and liquid level on separation performance have been studied. The results demonstrate that ethanol concentration in the distilled phase decreases with the increasing liquid level. Increasing air temperature enhances the separation efficiency of the two components.

Furthermore, the concentration of ethanol in the residual liquid shows a corresponding decrease.

40|$|Isooctane {{can be used}} {{to replace}} methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) as a fuel additive. Isooctane is {{hydrogenated}} from isooctene, which is produced by dimerizing 2 -methylpropene. In dimerization, two 2 -methylpropene molecules react on ion-exchange resin catalyst to produce isooctene isomers (2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 1 -pentene, 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 2 -pentene). Presence of 2 -methyl- 2 -propanol (TBA) improves reaction selectivity. Trimers and tetramers are formed as side products. Water and alkenes have reaction equilibrium with corresponding alcohols. The process configuration for isooctene production is a side reactor concept, and consists of reactor part, separation part (distillation tower) and a recycle structure (Figure  1). Units of miniplant at Helsinki University of Technology imitates the actual units of the isooctene production line in smaller scale, providing valuable information about the process and about the behaviour of individual units, as well as about the dynamics and operability of the process.

The observed point efficiencies on overall gas basis seemed to vary markedly with composition in low and high concentrations. It was demonstrated that these variations could not be attributed to lack of precision in the equiibrium data, interference with the column operation by sampling, variation in physical properties with composition, or a variation in stripping or rectifying factor mV/L with concentration.

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} modelling {{of phase}} equilibrium is of central importance in chemical engineering applications. The design, operation and develop- ment of new chemical processes is based {{to a large}} extent on the knowledge of the equilibrium that occurs between co-existing fluid phases. Where re- liable experimental data at required process conditions is unavailable, an understanding of the molecular description of condensed phase matter is key to predicting the thermodynamic properties of these fluid systems. To this end, numerous models and theories have been developed that seek to link microscopic intermolecular interactions with bulk macroscopic thermo- dynamic properties. In this thesis, two such constructs for the prediction of phase equilibrium are considered. The empirical linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) that relates specific/unspecific intermolecular interac- tions to infinite dilution solute properties, and equations of state (EoS) for the prediciton of <b>vapour-liquid</b> and liquid-liquid <b>equilibrium.</b> The LSER model utilises hydrogen bond acceptor/donor parameters (A and B) alongside polarisability (S), volume (V) and molar refraction (E) param- eters to describe various solute properties. In this study, the prediciton of solute infinite dilution partititon coefficient is of particular interest. While the V and E parameters can be obtained from molecular structure calcula- tions that account for the number of atoms and bonds in a molecule, the re- maining LSER parameters are usually derived from chromatographic experiments. However, successive studies have successfully correlated and pre- dicted the hydrogen bonding parameters from quantum mechanical (QM) calculated molecular properties, enabling the rapid calculation of infinite dilution solute properties in the so-called QM/LSER approach. In this the- sis, two independent linear regression relationships that relate theoretically calculated hydrogen bond stabilisation energies at a donor and/or acceptor site(s) to experimental hydrogen bonding ability of a solute molecule have been determined. Once obtained, the solute hydrogen bonding parameters are used in conjunction with dispersion and volume parameters in the LSER to obtain solute partition coefficients. Using this approach,the octanol/wa- ter partition coefficients of various molecules have been estimated, of this, the absolute average error of a sub-set of straight chained, mono-functional solute molecules has been determined to be 23. 04...|$|R
