40|$|We discuss <b>the</b> {{possibility}} <b>of</b> thermal flares in <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> AGNs and microquasars. We present {{preliminary results}} of an ongoing study trying to assess <b>the</b> feasibility <b>of</b> a hypothesis suggesting that certain flares observed in these sources originate in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems {{and not in the}} relativistic jets. Using a simple toy model we reproduce optical flares with lightcurves very similar to those observed in the sources.

25|$|While Ben Gurion Airport is {{conveniently}} {{located in}} the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, this fact also means that the airport is surrounded by various residential communities who often complain of noise pollution caused by the airport.

25|$|This {{relationship}} {{means that}} certain key features {{can be observed}} in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to sorbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), {{it can be seen that}} the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the antinode in all sorbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.|$|E

2500|$|During the La Tène Period (Late Iron Age, Celtic Period, 450 BC– 1 BC [...] ), {{the castle}} hill became a <b>very</b> {{important}} <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Celts.

A great number and diversity of findings (including coins, house equipment, two Roman buildings, castle entrance gate etc.) testifies this.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} foundation, a theater, a chamber of commerce, meeting clubs, public {{libraries}} and dance halls were erected as well. The {{position of the}} city, almost in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, made it as a perfect halt and a great communication link, east-west and north-south, creating a slow but unstoppable growth. By the 19th century, Santa Clara was bigger and more populated {{than the rest of}} the towns around, including what was once Remedios. As a necessary stop between Havana and the east of the country, the city gained the title of Las Villas province capital.|$|E
25|$|A {{change has}} also come over Voigt's voice lately, though it's {{hard to tell}} if it's from weight loss or normal aging—controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas's drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet {{exhibits}} any of Callas's technical problems: Her voice continues to be reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable, however—earlier this season in Verdi's La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality at the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.|$|E
25|$|The nave is {{the main}} body of the church where most of the worshippers stand, and the {{sanctuary}} is the area around the altar, east of the nave. The sanctuary is usually one to three steps higher than the nave. The Iconostasis does not sit directly on the edge of the sanctuary, but is usually set a few feet back from the edge of the top step. This forms a walkway in front of the iconostasis for the clergy, called a soleas. In the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soleas is an extension (or thrust), often rounded, called the ambon, on which the deacon will stand to give litanies during the services.|$|E

25|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} put forth to explain the existence of blue stragglers. The simplest is that blue stragglers formed later {{than the rest of}} the stars in the cluster, but evidence for this is limited. Another simple proposal is that blue stragglers are either field stars which are not actually members of the clusters to which they seem to belong, or are field stars which were captured by the cluster. This too seems unlikely, as blue stragglers often reside at the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clusters to which they belong. Another theory is that blue stragglers are the result of stars that come too close to another star or similar mass object and collide.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the new Minister of Transportation Avigdor Lieberman {{announced}} that in July 2005, work would {{start on the}} renewal of the line. Plans for a national infrastructure project were presented tjat would further alter the rail route, due to changes on the ground since the 1988 plans. These changes included relocating the Afula section to a partially underground route between Afula and Afula Illit, instead of its previous location in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. By the end of 2005, many of the plans were approved by the Construction and Planning Committees, which called for {{the completion of the}} line by 2010. Five stations were approved: Haifa East, Nesher, Kfar Yehoshua (in a different location from the historical one), Afula and Beit She'an. Israel Railways also proposed a completely new route to connect the Beit She'an station to Jordan, via the Sheikh Hussein bridge, as well as a future revival of the historical extension to Jenin to serve the Palestinian Authority.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter {{finally gave}} up and in 1961 sold the stadium for $600,000 {{to a group of}} New York real estate investors, losing over a million dollars after his 7-year ownership; he secured a 3-year lease and an option to stay through 1967 while he pursued his Torresdale stadium plan. The New York buyers quickly flipped the {{property}} to another New York consortium who, assuming the Phillies would be gone by 1967, began planning the demolition of the stadium and construction of a bowling alley and discount store on the site. Then in May 1964, Jerry Wolman, who had just bought the Philadelphia Eagles in February, brought the stadium ownership back to town, paying $757,000 for it {{as part of a larger}} real estate deal. Wolman's motivations for the purchase are in dispute – all the mortgage shuffling did not slow the decay out at the park – but he claimed he wanted to help the Phillies; the move also put him at the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emerging fight over a new stadium in Philadelphia, which would likely affect his Eagles.|$|E
50|$|Critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a mixed review {{not so much}} for the music or for Newley's performance, both of which he praised, but for <b>the</b> <b>very</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>centering</b> <b>the</b> film on the evil money-lender and failing to make the story {{compelling}} enough to hold interest.|$|R

25|$|Because of the relics they contained, wooden pagodas {{used to be}} the {{centerpiece}} of the garan, the seven edifices considered indispensable for a temple. They gradually lost importance and were replaced by the kondō (golden hall), because of the magic powers believed to lie within the images the building housed. This loss of status was so complete that Zen schools, which arrived late in Japan from China, normally do not have any pagoda in their garan. The layout of four early temples clearly illustrates this trend: they are in chronological order Asuka-dera, Shitennō-ji, Hōryū-ji, and Yakushi-ji. In the first, the pagoda was at the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garan surrounded by three small kondō (see the reconstruction of the temple's original layout). In the second, a single kondō {{is at the center of}} the temple and the pagoda lies in front of it. At Hōryū-ji, they are one next to the other. Yakushi-ji has a single, large kondō at the center with two pagodas on the sides. The same evolution can be observed in Buddhist temples in China.|$|E
25|$|Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in {{recognition}} of the gallantry of First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, of the Revenue-Cutter Service, commanding the revenue cutter Hudson, his officers and the men of his command, for their intrepid and heroic gallantry in the action at Cardenas, Cuba, on the eleventh day of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, when the Hudson rescued the United States naval torpedo boat Winslow {{in the face of a}} most galling fire from the enemy's guns, the Winslow being disabled, her captain wounded, her only other officer and half her crew killed. The commander of the Hudson kept his vessel in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hottest fire of the action, although in constant danger of going ashore on account of the shallow water, until finally he got a line made fast to the Winslow and towed that vessel out of range of the enemy's guns. In commemoration of this signal act of heroism it is hereby enacted that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized and directed to cause to be and to present to First Lieutenant Frank H.
