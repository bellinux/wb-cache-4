40|$|We {{measure the}} flow of water through mixed {{packings}} of glass spheres and soft swellable hydrogel grains, at constant sample <b>volume.</b> <b>Permeability</b> values are obtained at constant sample volume and at porosities smaller than random close packing, for different glass bead diameters $D$ and for variable gel grain diameter $d$, as controlled by the salinity of the water. The gel content is also varied. We find that the permeability decays exponentially in $n(D/d) ^b$ where $n=N_{gel}/N_{glass}$ is the gel to glass bead number ratio and $b$ is approximately 3. Therefore, flow properties are determined by the volume fraction of gel beads. A simple model based on the porosity of overlapping spheres is used to account for these observations...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vascular parameters, such as {{vascular}} <b>volume,</b> flow, and <b>permeability,</b> {{are important}} disease biomarkers for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, {{it is essential}} to develop approaches to monitor the changes in pancreatic microvasculature non-invasively. METHODS: Here, we describe the application of the long-circulating, paramagnetic T 1 contrast agent, protected Graft Copolymer bearing covalently linked gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid residues and labelled with fluorescein (PGC-GdDTPA-F) for the non-invasive semi-quantitative evaluation of vascular changes in diabetic models using magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: We observed a significantly higher accumulation of protected graft copolymer bearing covalently linked gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid residues and labelled with fluorescein in the pancreata of BBDR rats induced to develop diabetes, as compared to non-diabetic controls at 1 h post-injection. No differences were seen in the blood pool, kidney, or muscle, indicating that the effect is specific to the diabetic pancreas. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a marked increase in contrast agent availability in the pancreas with the development of the pathology. Similar changes were noted in the homozygous Leprdb mouse model of type 2 diabetes. This effect appeared to result both from the increase of vascular <b>volume</b> and <b>permeability.</b> CONCLUSIONS: High-molecular weight paramagnetic blood volume contrast agents are valuable for the in vivo definition of pancreatic microvasculature dynamics by magnetic resonance imaging.

40|$|Fluid flow {{behaviour}} in porous media is a conundrum. Therefore, {{this research is}} focused on filtration-volumetric characterisation of fractured-carbonate sediments, coupled with their proper simulation. For this reason, at laboratory rock properties such as pore <b>volume,</b> <b>permeability</b> and porosity are measured, later phase permeabilities and oil recovery in function of flow rate are assessed. Furthermore, the rheological properties of three oils are measured and analysed. Finally based on rock and fluid properties, a model using COMSOL Multiphysics is built in order to compare the experimental and simulated results. The rock analyses show linear relation between flow rate and differential pressure, from which phase permeabilities and pressure gradient are determined, eventually the oil recovery under low and high flow rate is established. In addition, the oils reveal thixotropic properties as well as non-Newtonian behaviour described by Bingham model, consequently Carreau viscosity model for the used oil is given. Given these points, the model for oil and water is built in COMSOL Multiphysics, whereupon successfully the reciprocity between experimental and simulated results is analysed and compared.

In this study, a noninvasive imaging technique was developed to characterize the delivery as well as interstitial transport of a macromolecular agent, albumin-GdDTPA, in the MCF- 7 human breast cancer model in vivo, using magnetic resonance imaging. The transport parameters derived included vascular <b>volume,</b> <b>permeability</b> surface area product, macromolecular fluid exudate volume, and drainage and pooling rates. Immunohistochemical staining for the lymphatic endothelial marker LYVE- 1 was done to determine the contribution of lymphatics to the macromolecular drainage. Distinct pooling and draining regions were detected in the tumors using magnetic resonance imaging. A few lymphatic vessels positively stained for LYVE- 1 were also detected although these were primarily collapsed and tenuous suggesting that lymphatic drainage played a minimal role, and {{that the bulk of}} drainage was due to convective transport through the ECM in this tumor model...|$|E

Sediment samples {{for the current}} study were collected at 48 stations in the Gulf of Gdańsk in May 2006, and the following sediment parameters were analysed: grain size distribution, water <b>volume,</b> <b>permeability,</b> organic matter content, chlorophyll a and EPS carbohydrate concentrations. The spatial distributions of the different parameters varied distinctly, which suggested a strongly diversified bottom environment.

40|$|AbstractA clot's {{function}} is to achieve hemostasis by resisting fluid flow. Permeability is the measurement of a clot's hemostatic potential. It is sensitive {{to a wide range}} of biochemical parameters and pathologies. In this work, we consider the hydrodynamic phenomenon that reduces the mobility of fluid near the fiber surfaces. This no-slip boundary condition both defines the gel's permeability and suppresses nanoparticle diffusion in gel interstices. Here we report that, unlike previous work where steric effects also hindered diffusion, our system—nanoparticles in fibrin gel—was subject exclusively to hydrodynamic diffusion suppression. This result enabled an automated, high-throughput permeability assay that used small clot <b>volumes.</b> <b>Permeability</b> was derived from nanoparticle diffusion using the effective medium theory, and showed one-to-one correlation with measured permeability. This technique measured permeability without quantifying gel structure, and may therefore prove useful for characterizing similar materials (e. g., extracellular matrix) where structure is uncontrolled during polymerization and difficult to measure subsequently. We also report that PEGylation reduced, but did not eliminate, the population of immobile particles. We studied the forces required to pull stuck PEG particles free to confirm that the attachment is a result of neither covalent nor strong electrostatic binding, and discuss the relevance of this force scale to particle transport through physiological clots...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} and transport properties of porous rocks {{can be altered}} {{by a variety of}} diagenetic, metamorphic, and tectonic processes, and the changes that result are of critical importance to such industrial applications as resource recovery, carbon dioxide sequestration, and waste isolation in geologic formations. These inter-relationships between rocks, pore fluids, and deformation are also the key to understanding many natural processes, including: dynamic metamorphism, fault mechanics, fault stability, and pressure solution deformation. Here, we propose work to investigate the changes of permeability and pore geometry owing to inelastic deformation by solution-transfer, brittle fracturing, and dislocation creep. The work would study the relationship of deformation and permeability reduction in fluid-filled quartz and calcite rocks and investigate the effects of loading configuration on the evolution of porosity and permeability under hydrothermal conditions. We would use a combination of techniques, including laboratory experiments, numerical calculations, and observations of rock microstructure. The laboratory experiments provide mechanical and transport data under conditions that isolate each particular mechanism. Our apparatus are designed to provide simultaneous measurements of pore <b>volume,</b> <b>permeability,</b> axial and volumetric strain rates while being loaded under isostatic or conventional triaxial loading. Temperatures up to 1400 K may be obtained, while confining pressures and pore pressures are maintained independently up to 500 MPa. Observations of the structure will be made with standard optical, scanning electron, and laser confocal scanning optical microscopes. The data obtained will be used to quantify changes in surface roughness, porosity, pore dimensions, and their spatial fluctuations. The results of the experiments and the image data are then used in network, finite-difference and other numerical models to verify the validity of experimentally established relations between permeability and other rock properties...|$|E

However, evidence of progressive tumor growth and resistance to antiangiogenic treatment has been observed. To counter the unwanted effect of vatalanib on GBM growth, we have added a new agent known as N-hydroxy-N&# 39;-(4 -butyl- 2 methylphenyl) formamidine (HET 0016), which is a selective inhibitor of 20 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20 -HETE) synthesis. The aims of the studies were to determine 1) whether the addition of HET 0016 can attenuate the unwanted effect of vatalanib on tumor growth and 2) whether the treatment schedule would have a crucial impact on controlling GBM. Methods: U 251 human glioma cells (4 × 105) were implanted orthotopically. Two different treatment schedules were investigated. Treatment starting on day 8 (8 – 21  days treatment) of the tumor implantation was to mimic treatment following detection of tumor, where tumor would have hypoxic microenvironment and well-developed neovascularization. Drug treatment starting {{on the same day}} of tumor implantation (0 – 21  days treatment) was to mimic cases following radiation therapy or surgery. There were four different treatment groups: vehicle, vatalanib (oral treatment 50  mg/kg/d), HET 0016 (intraperitoneal treatment 10  mg/kg/d), and combined (vatalanib and HET 0016). Following scheduled treatments, all animals underwent magnetic resonance imaging on day 22, followed by euthanasia. Brain specimens were equally divided for immunohistochemistry and protein array analysis. Results: Our results demonstrated a trend that HET 0016, alone or in combination with vatalanib, is capable of controlling the tumor growth compared with that of vatalanib alone, indicating attenuation of the unwanted effect of vatalanib. When both vatalanib and HET 0016 were administered together {{on the day of the}} tumor implantation (0 – 21  days treatment), tumor volume, tumor blood <b>volume,</b> <b>permeability,</b> extravascular and extracellular space volume, tumor cell proliferation, and cell migration were decreased compared with that of the vehicle-treated group. Conclusion: HET 0016 is capable of controlling tumor growth and migration, but these effects are dependent on the timing of drug administration. The addition of HET 0016 to vatalanib may attenuate the unwanted effect of vatalanib.

40|$|Despite their global {{acceptance}} as {{a sustainable}} and cost-efficient technology for water pollution control including urban wastewater contaminated with hydrocarbons, treatment performance of vertical-flow constructed wetlands can be hampered by clogging of the substrate media pores of the wetland filters. This clogging usually leads to blockage of filter substrate, progressive diminution of porosity and reduction of active pore <b>volume,</b> <b>permeability</b> and substrate hydraulic conductivity subsequently leading to poor water quality production by the wetland filters. This operational problem hinders the wider application and acceptability {{of these systems}} worldwide. In this study, different laboratory-scale vertical-flow constructed wetlands filled with gravel and planted with common reed were constructed and operated between June 2011 and March 2014 to assess treatment performances and their relationship with clogging, and diesel spill treatment {{as a function of}} hydraulic and organic loading rates, media size, and contact and rest time. Furthermore, to evaluate the hydrocarbon spill, approximately 130 grams of diesel fuel was poured into each of four wetland filters. This is the equivalent of a one-off inflow concentration of 20 g/l. A range of hydraulic loading rates was applied across the systems using real urban wastewater. Analysis of total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations of outflow waters along with other water quality parameters was carried out to monitor both clogging and treatment performance variations. Overall, all constructed wetland systems have shown relatively high removal efficiencies for the key water quality parameters regardless of filter set-up before the hydrocarbon spill and no clogging observed. The removal efficiencies dropped for those filters impacted by the diesel spill. The filter with the highest COD loading but no diesel contamination performed the best in terms of COD and BOD removal. Furthermore, filters contaminated by diesel performed worse in terms of COD and BOD, but considerably better regarding nitrate-nitrogen removal without any apparent negative impact of within bed clogging Pertaining to seasonal variability, findings show that COD, nitrate-nitrogen and ammonia-nitrogen have shown a seasonal trend with high removal in summer compared to other seasons, while BOD removal was efficient in winter compared to summer and turbidity was greatly removed in autumn compared to other seasons. However, no clear seasonal pattern of ortho-phosphate-phosphorus and SS removal were noted. Furthermore, in the hydrocarbon contamination period, all filters regardless of the pollution, design or operation had higher removal in winter than autumn for COD, BOD, ammonia-nitrogen and ortho-phosphate-phosphorus while no seasonal trend was observed for other water quality parameters. Investigation regarding treatment performance and clogging evolution revealed that none of the systems has shown any signs of clogging after about three years of operation even with high rate Filters 7 and 8. The simulation model confirms the empirical findings that considerable filter clogging restricting the operation has not occurred. However, a small aggregate diameter, a short contact time, a long resting time and a low COD inflow concentration were most beneficial in reducing SS accumulation within the wetland filters. Treatment of the hydrocarbon pollutants was also assessed, and the investigation revealed that all the hydrocarbon components treated in the wetland filters were highly degraded (> 80...|$|E

40|$|Modeling of flow in porous {{media is}} an {{important}} scientific research area, and has been so for decades. It {{is also one of}} the major topics within applied mathematics. Models for flow in porous media are for example important in the oil industry, in groundwater hydrology and in geothermal energy extraction. In this thesis we are building both a mathematical and a numerical geothermal model. To understand the processes that happens in geothermal reservoirs far below the earth's surface, good models are needed. The long term reservoir behavior is important when the economical feasibility of a geothermal project is determined. Good models are needed to determine the long term behavior. To model flow in porous media, there are several steps that needs to be done. The first step is to obtain and understand the background knowledge, such as theory from reservoir mechanics, that is needed to build a model. Some of this knowledge is common for all the different topics that use flow in porous media models. Other parts of the theory are more specific and connected to an application. When sufficient knowledge has been obtained, the next step is to use it to create a mathematical model for flow in porous media. When this has been done, it is time to implement a numerical model that is based on the mathematical model. To obtain a numerical model, it is common to discretize the continuous model expressions in the mathematical model. We try to retain the essential properties of the continuous model expressions when we discretize them. Discretizing model expressions often leads to a linear system that can be solved by numerical equation solvers. The main focus in this thesis is the discretization of the equation terms, both spatial and in time. We will use a finite element method to spatially discretize the diffusion term in our model equations. A finite difference method will be used to discretize the advection term in space. An equation term can be solved with either explicit or implicit time discretization. When a term is solved explicitly it is solved at the start of each time step, using the the previous equation values. Solving the term implicitly, the term is calculated at the end of each time step. We will try to create an adaptive strategy that decides which terms that should be solved with explicit time discretization. The thesis is split into 6 chapters. Chapter 1 will work as a background for the rest of the thesis, and is dedicated to geothermal energy extraction. As we build a model for geothermal energy extraction, it is important to have some knowledge of how a geothermal reservoir works. In Chapter 2 we will go through the theory from reservoir mechanics that is relevant for this thesis. We will explain the terms porous media, porosity, representative elementary <b>volume,</b> <b>permeability,</b> homogeneity, and isotropy. We will also explain Darcy's law and the general conservation law. At the end of the chapter we will look at the similarities and differences between the physical properties enthalpy and temperature. The mathematical model is built on a local and a reservoir scale conservation law for enthalpy, and we create this model in Chapter 3. We see our reservoir as blocks of rock, with fractures that are filled with water between them. The local conservation law will model the heat transfer in one block and the fractures near it. To do this we will split the block up into layers, and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} still the most common {{malignant}} tumor in men in Western countries and the second most common cause of cancer death in men. Histological examination is currently the only method that enables early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Clinical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging techniques do not allow reliable differentiation of prostate cancer from normal prostate tissue or benign processes. The lack of a reliable diagnostic tool may lead to a false-negative histological diagnosis in some patients because suspicious areas are missed by prostate biopsy. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a rat model for the differentiation of slow-growing, orthotopically implanted prostate cancer from healthy prostate tissue by means of contrast-enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 1. 5 -Tesla clinical whole-body scanner. Another aim was to test the capability of MRI in determining the blood volume of prostate cancer and healthy prostate tissue. This is the first study that uses MRI to determine the perfusion parameters interstitial <b>volume,</b> <b>permeability</b> surface area product, normalized permeability, and relative blood volume in prostate cancer and healthy prostate tissue and correlates the results with histologic parameters of vascularization. The tumor model successfully used in this study was the G-Dunning rat prostatic cancer. Tumors were induced in 17 Copenhagen rats by means of orthotopic implantation of 1 × 106 tumor cells per animal. The MRI studies were performed 56 to 60 days after tumor cell implantation using unenhanced T 1 -weighted SE and T 2 -weighted TSE sequences and a contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted GRE sequence. Two contrast agents were used, an extravasating low-molecular-weight gadolinium-based contrast agent (gadodiamide) for dynamic studies and an iron oxide particle agent (VSOP-C 184) with a long intravascular residence time for blood volume determination. Following dynamic MRI, signal intensity-time curves were generated for tumor and healthy prostate tissue and quantitatively analyzed using a pharmacokinetic model. The relative blood volumes of tumor and healthy prostate tissue were determined from the ratio of the signal intensity increase after VSOP-C 184 administration and the signal intensity of whole blood. The tissue specimens for histologic and morphometric analysis of tumor and prostate tissue were prepared using H&E and modified Van Gieson stain without nuclear staining and labeling of the vascular endothelium with BSL I. The unenhanced T 2 -weighted MR images depicted the tumors as low-signal-intensity areas relative to normal surrounding prostate tissue in all rats, which corresponds to the signal pattern of human prostate cancer. The mean tumor size determined on axial MR images was 10. 93 mm² and highly correlated (r = 0. 75; p < 0. 001) with the results of the histological determined size. On contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI the tumors enhanced much earlier and more intensely than healthy prostate tissue. The interstitial volumes and permeability-surface area products of the tumors were significantly higher compared with normal prostate tissue (482 % and 439 %, respectively; both p< 0. 001). The interstitial volumes, which were determined in the present study for the first time using both MRI and histology, suggest that the diffusion pathways in healthy prostate tissue are too long for distribution of the MR contrast agent throughout the interstitial space. As a consequence, MRI markedly underestimates interstitital volume even if a contrast agent with pronounced extravasation is used. The results show that the higher permeability surface area product of prostate tumors compared with normal prostate tissue is due to increased perfusion secondary to an increased blood volume rather than an increased vessel permeability, as suggested by some investigators. The relative tumor blood volumes determined by MRI and histologic examination were significantly higher than in healthy prostate tissue (1. 71 % versus 0. 69 % and 1. 03 % versus 0. 69 %, respectively). Analysis of vascular patterns revealed many small vessels in the tumor while there were fewer but larger vessels in the normal prostate. These patterns might suggest a higher proton exchange rate in prostate tumors and possibly explain the greater overestimation by MRI of the tumor blood volumes compared with normal prostate tissue. This study for the first time established a rat model that can be used to differentiate slow-growing orthotopic prostate cancer from healthy prostate tissue by using quantitative analysis of dynamic MRI data as well as MRI blood volume determination following administration of a contrast agent with a long intravascular half-life. The MRI technique investigated here might in the future improve the differentiation of prostate cancer from healthy prostate tissue and from the differential diagnosis of prostate cancer such as prostatitis or benign prostate hyperplasia in humans...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Coal Seam Gas (CSG) (sometimes called Coal Seam Methane or Coal Bed Methane) {{is a form}} {{of natural}} gas found in some coal deposits. This gas is mainly methane with small amount of carbon dioxide. The methane gas is {{generated}} from the organic matter under biologic and/or thermal processes over geologic time. In many geologies hydraulic fracturing is used to increase the permeability and extract the gas more efficiently from the coal seam. This study aimed to understand the effects of hydraulic fracturing on a coal seam aquifer, performed in the HB 02 gas well located in the north of the Sydney Basin at Broke, in the Hunter Valley, NSW, Australia. To do this, an observed pumping test response was used to compare the performance of three different groundwater models that simulate either single phase (water only) and multiphase (water and methane) conditions. This research posed four questions: (1) Are we able to realistically simulate the groundwater flow in a multiphase flow that includes a mixture of water and gas? (2) Can the extraction of both phases from an artificially fractured coal seam be simulated with enough accuracy that we can provide an adequate estimation of the coal and fracture properties? (3) What do the well functions for a fractured well look like? (4) How do these insights improve our understanding of a CSG well; particularly, how much water is produced? The methodology employed multiple stages of analysis. The key stages in this analysis provide insight into the development of the single phase groundwater simulation and they include a sensitivity analysis of the model to coal and fracture parameters using the GMS (Groundwater Modeling System) software. It was determined that a varying hydraulic conductivity with distance from the well (modeled by geology zonation with distance from the well) improved the realism of groundwater flow patterns and the match to the well drawdown curve. Following the confirmation of qualitatively correct flow patterns and drawdowns, subsequent calibration established that the conductivity and the specific storage of the unfractured coal seam were important parameters for which the model was highly sensitive. Despite obtaining reasonable agreement between the predicted and observed drawdown curves, some subtle but significant mismatches remained. To confirm the validity of the GMS simulations, an alternative single phase model was developed, using TOUGH 2 (Transport Of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat) with the single phase EOS 1 module, with functionally equivalent to the GMS model. Both GMS and TOUGH 2 /EOS 1 produced similar results, with the same subtle mismatches, though there were slight improvements using TOUGH 2. This established that the two models, with slightly different numerical formulations, could produce similar results, but were similarly unable to capture some important behaviours observed in the multiphase flow data from the HB 02 well. More refined simulations using the TOUGH 2 /EOS 7 C multiphase module, with the addition of gas modeling, revealed significant changes in model performance. For the same model parameters which gave the best simulations for the single phase flow simulations, the accuracy of the multiphase model was greatly reduced, requiring the model to be recalibrated. After recalibration, TOUGH 2 /EOS 7 gave slightly better results than both TOUGH 2 /EOS 1 and GMS, although the strong curvature evident in the observed drawdown curve could still not be adequately predicted. This implies that the application of single phase models to a multiphase problem may be associated with greater uncertainty than explicitly modeling gas flow. As such, in selecting a modeling approach for fracked gas wells, consideration should be given to the balance between computational efficiency and simplicity of the model, and ease of calibration, and ultimately the certainty (or uncertainty) constraints associated with the inferred coal seam properties. In answer to the second research question, the uncertainty and identifiability of the TOUGH 2 /EOS 7 C parameters was assessed by the use of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method. This provided insight into the values of the parameters likely to best represent the coal seam where the HB 02 well is located, and which parameters could not be reliably calibrated from the well test data. Most parameters were non-identifiable; however the model was sensitive to the half-length of the fracture and the permeability of the surrounding coal seam. Furthermore, it was discovered that there were high levels of interaction between these two parameters, suggesting a balance between the volume/conductivity associated with the fracture and surrounding coal seam was the key to providing a realistic simulation. This interaction was quantified and found to be robust against changes in the objective function used for model calibration. Furthermore it was found that information sometimes collected during fracking (total volume of sand injected and thus frack <b>volume,</b> <b>permeability</b> of the sand, length of the frack using microseismic) provided little incremental benefit in reducing overall parameter uncertainty other than for that characteristic directly measured. In answer to the third research question, the well test was best fit by a bilinear flow field, rather than a radial flow field, so that, at least for the first 11 days of the flow test, the well function of a bilinear flow is more appropriate than that of a radial flow field. In addition, there was strong evidence for a reduction with distance from the well of the unfracked coal permeability, which may reflect a non-trivial density of small subsidiary fracks around the well that are not modeled by using a single large frack. In answer to the fourth research question the aquifer water yield (i. e. as parameterised by the aquifer storativity or the coal matrix compressibility) was found to be unidentifiable from the well test meaning that the 11 day duration of the well test was insufficient to reliably assess the long term water yield of the well. Thus the well test was unable to improve on a priori estimates of the total long-term water yield for a production well field...|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal MRI {{was applied}} to monitor {{intracranial}} initiation and development of brain metastases and assess tumor vascular <b>volume</b> and <b>permeability</b> in a mouse model of breast cancer brain metastases. Using a 9. 4 T system, high resolution anatomic MRI and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI were acquired at different time points after an intracardiac injection of brain-tropic breast cancer MDA-MB 231 BR-EGFP cells. Three weeks post injection, multifocal brain metastases were first observed with hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted images, but isointensity on T 1 -weighted post contrast images, indicating that blood-tumor-barrier (BTB) at early stage of brain metastases was impermeable. Follow-up MRI revealed intracranial tumor growth and increased number of metastases that distributed throughout the whole brain. At the last scan on week 5, T 1 -weighted post contrast images detected BTB disruption in 160 (34 %) {{of a total of}} 464 brain metastases. Enhancement in some of the metastases was only seen in partial regions of the tumor, suggesting intratumoral heterogeneity of BTB disruption. DSC MRI measurements of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) showed that rCBV of brain metastases was significantly lower (mean=  0. 89 ± 0. 03) than that of contralateral normal brain (mean=  1. 00 ± 0. 03; p< 0. 005). Intriguingly, longitudinal measurements revealed that rCBV of individual metastases at early stage was similar to, but became significantly lower than that of contralateral normal brain with tumor growth (p< 0. 05). The rCBV data were concordant with histological analysis of microvascular density (MVD). Moreover, comprehensive analysis suggested no significant correlation among tumor size, rCBV and BTB permeability. In conclusion, longitudinal MRI provides non-invasive in vivo assessments of spatial and temporal development of brain metastases and their vascular <b>volume</b> and <b>permeability.</b> The characteristic rCBV of brain metastases may have a diagnostic value...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} testing {{procedures}} and the measured effects of suffusion, {{a type of}} internal erosion, on the geo-mechanical properties of soils. The objective of this thesis is to quantify the effects of suffusion on <b>permeability,</b> <b>volume</b> change, shear strength, and gradation. A poorly graded river sand soil {{with the addition of}} 10 % kaolinite clay was used to create three gap graded soils and an unaltered ???base soil. ??? Testing was performed using a modified triaxial apparatus that permits seepage through compacted specimens, and allows collection of effluent. Specimens, 5. 1 cm in diameter and 10. 2 cm in length, were monitored for changes in <b>volume</b> and <b>permeability</b> during seepage. After erosion, the specimens were sheared in a Consolidated-Undrained (CU) Triaxial Shear test. The collected effluent samples are dried to determine mass and tested for particle gradation. Companion control specimens are tested without erosion. Testing revealed that suffusion may cause lasting effects on geo-mechanical properties of soils. Permeability reduction was generally observed in all soils, indicating particle clogging within the specimens. The three gap graded soils each exhibited a greater degree of internal erosion (suffusion), <b>permeability</b> reduction, and <b>volume</b> change than the base soil. The experimental setup and test protocols developed herein pave the way for further research on the effects of suffusion on the geo-mechanical properties of soils.

40|$|Compaction {{occurs in}} many {{consolidated}} hydrocarbon reservoirs and {{is responsible for}} both improvement and loss of recovery. This study assesses the effects of rock compaction and the consequences on the production and recovery in unconsolidated shallow gas reservoir a topic of which little is known. The compaction behaviour in unconsolidated to weakly-consolidated reservoirs is studied by compiling a large data set from published laboratory experiments data. Analysis of the data set indicates that the initial porosity, the pre-consolidation stress {{and the degree of}} consolidation of the reservoir formation are the main controlling parameters on the rock compressibility. To account for compaction in unconsolidated sands, a set of equations describing plastic deformation is derived fromthe equations describing linear elastic compressibility. The pore <b>volume</b> reduction and <b>permeability</b> reduction calculated based on these equations tend to over predict the effects of compaction when compared to measured data. Empirical relationships are derived for pore <b>volume</b> and <b>permeability</b> reduction based on compaction behaviour trends which can be applied to unconsolidated reservoirs. With these derived empirical trends compaction is simulated on shallow gas reservoirs. A simplified reservoir model is built capturing the main characteristic of shallow gas reservoirs in the Netherlands. The integration of the effects of compaction within the simulations is done by incorporating the range observed in the pressure-dependent rock characteristics i. e. pore <b>volume</b> (porosity) and <b>permeability.</b> The assumption of a constant reservoir compressibility leads to an uncertainty in the recovery factor of up to 10 %when compared to the pressure-dependent assumption. Two effects of pore volume reduction are visible in P/Z plots (mass balance plots) of compaction-sensitive gas reservoirs: 1) the P/Z line decreases more gradually than when no pore volume reduction occurs, 2) P/Z line deflects downwards with ongoing production and deviates from the straight-line. The higher the pore volume reduction, the more pronounced is this bending of the P/Z-line. The effect of permeability reduction is not visible on the shape of the P/Z plot. In all cases, it is observed that the effect of reservoir compaction is, with respect to the no-compaction case, positive for the recovery of gas. The predicted recoveries show differences which can amount up to 20 % additional recovery. For a typical shallow gas reservoir of 1 BCM, these difference translate to a potential underestimation of 0. 2 Bcm of gas produced.

30|$|For {{the first}} time, {{we were able}} to both in vivo {{quantify}} and improve expression upon adenovirus delivery using angiotensin II. Fluoroscopic imaging demonstrated increased tumor blush consistent with increased blood flow to the tumor upon delivery with AII. This suggests improved adenovirus delivery. We previously found in a liver model that a 2.5  μg/ml dose of AII increased blood flow, blood <b>volume,</b> and <b>permeability</b> surface product suggesting that a strategy employing AII may improve delivery; however, it also decreased the mean transit time in VX 2 tumors compared to normal tissue [11]. The current study demonstrates that such a strategy employing AII can result in improved expression after adenovirus delivery. Our study is supported by Bilbao et al. who using adenovirus with a lacZ insert noted AII at one dose could increase lacZ expression detected by histology in larger rat hepatomas but not smaller hepatomas [29].|$|R

Oilfield well logs are processed together to give an estimate to factor logs by using an adaptive genetic algorithm.

Independent values of the relevant petrophysical properties are given by inverse modeling and well-known deterministic methods. Case studies including the evaluation of hydrocarbon formations demonstrate the feasibility of the improved algorithm of factor analysis.

The treatment also resulted in an increase of caspase- 3 activity and in a reduction of microvascular density.

40|$|PURPOSE: To provide {{additional}} functional information for tumor characterization, we investigated {{the use of}} dual-energy computed tomography for imaging murine lung tumors. Tumor blood <b>volume</b> and vascular <b>permeability</b> were quantified using gold and iodine nanoparticles. This approach was compared with a single contrast agent/single-energy CT method. Ex vivo validation studies were performed to demonstrate the accuracy of in vivo contrast agent quantification by CT. METHODS: Primary lung tumors were generated in LSL-Kras(G 12 D); p 53 (FL/FL) mice. Gold nanoparticles were injected, followed by iodine nanoparticles two days later. The gold accumulated in tumors, while the iodine provided intravascular contrast. Three dual-energy CT scans were performed-two for the single contrast agent method {{and one for the}} dual contrast agent method. Gold and iodine concentrations in each scan were calculated using a dual-energy decomposition. For each method, the tumor fractional blood volume was calculated based on iodine concentration, and tumor vascular permeability was estimated based on accumulated gold concentration. For validation, the CT-derived measurements were compared with histology and inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy measurements of gold concentrations in tissues. RESULTS: Dual-energy CT enabled in vivo separation of gold and iodine contrast agents and showed uptake of gold nanoparticles in the spleen, liver, and tumors. The tumor fractional blood volume measurements determined from the two imaging methods were in agreement, and a high correlation (R(2)  = 0. 81) was found between measured fractional blood volume and histology-derived microvascular density. Vascular permeability measurements obtained from the two imaging methods agreed well with ex vivo measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Dual-energy CT using two types of nanoparticles is equivalent to the single nanoparticle method, but allows for measurement of fractional blood <b>volume</b> and <b>permeability</b> with a single scan. As confirmed by ex vivo methods, CT-derived nanoparticle concentrations are accurate. This method could {{play an important role in}} lung tumor characterization by CT...|$|R
