40|$|ContextPublic health {{enabling}} authorities {{establish the}} legal foundation for financing, organizing, and delivering public health services. State laws vary {{in terms of}} the content, depth, and breadth of these fundamental public health activities. Given this variance, the Institute of Medicine has identified state public health laws as an area that requires further examination. To respond to this call for further examination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2 ̆ 019 s Public Health Law Program conducted a fundamental activities <b>legal</b> <b>assessment</b> on state public health laws. ObjectiveThe goal of the <b>legal</b> <b>assessment</b> was to examine state laws referencing frameworks representing public health department fundamental activities (ie, core and essential services) in an effort to identify, catalog, and describe enabling authorities of state governmental public health systems. DesignIn 2013, Public Health Law Program staff compiled a list of state statutes and regulations referencing different commonly-recognized public health frameworks of fundamental activities. The <b>legal</b> <b>assessment</b> included state fundamental activities laws available on WestlawNext as of July 2013. The results related to the 10 essential public health services and the 3 core public health functions were confirmed and updated in June 2016. ResultsEighteen states reference commonly-recognized frameworks of fundamental activities in their laws. Thirteen states have listed the 10 essential public health services in their laws. Eight of these states have also referenced the 3 core public health functions in their laws. Five states reference only the core public health functions. ConclusionsSeveral states reference fundamental activities in their state laws, particularly through use of the essential services framework. Further work is needed to capture the public health laws and practices of states that may be performing fundamental activities but without reference to a common framework.
