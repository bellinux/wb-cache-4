5|$|Herodotus {{reports that}} as the Allies {{approached}} the Persian camp, rumour spread amongst them of an Allied <b>victory</b> <b>at</b> Plataea; Diodorus also claims that Leotychides informed the Allies of <b>victory</b> <b>at</b> Plataea before the battle began. Their morale boosted by this omen, they set forth to win their own victory. Various explanations have been attempted to explain this occurrence, and also the alleged fact that Plataea and Mycale {{took place on the}} same day. Green suggests that following the <b>victory</b> <b>at</b> Plataea, the Allied commander Pausanias took control of the Persian beacon system that Xerxes had used to communicate with Asia, and used it to send tidings of Plataea to the Allied fleet. This would explain the rumour of victory and near simultaneous attack, but is only one possible theory.|$|E

On 2 December the decisive French <b>victory</b> <b>at</b> Austerlitz removed Austria from the war.

The generals who had been hostile to him could see that his luck had not abandoned him.

Moreau's <b>victory</b> <b>at</b> Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had {{put an end to the}} war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, and even of the Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition towards the restoration of the king. Thanks to the <b>victory</b> <b>at</b> Marengo, Napoleon could finally set about reforming France according to his own vision.|$|E
