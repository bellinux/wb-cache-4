2500|$|During {{the flight}} the {{loosened}} nut caused increasingly excessive <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> eventually allowing collision of the valve {{head with the}} rising piston fracturing the valve stem, which then allowed the inlet valve to drop open, resulting in the ignition by the spark plug of the pressurised fuel/air mixture within the inlet manifold and, eventually, the pumping of the ignited fuel outboard of the rocker cover and along {{the outside of the}} engine, leading to an extensive fire in the engine nacelle. Due to the fire [...] originating in the induction system, where the supercharged fuel/air mixture was at higher pressure than atmospheric, the heart of the fire was much hotter burning and intense than would be the case in a simple fuel fire.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical {{valve lash}} {{adjusters}} (solid lifters) replace hydraulic, improving <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> precision (durability).|$|E
50|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>clearance</b> {{refers to}} the small gap between a valve lifter and a valve stem that ensures that the valve {{completely}} closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too small <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> can result in the valves not closing properly, {{this results in a}} loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each 20000 mi with a feeler gauge.|$|E
5000|$|In automobiles, shims are {{commonly}} used to adjust the clearance or space between two parts. For example, shims are inserted into or under bucket tappets to control <b>valve</b> <b>clearances.</b> Clearance is adjusted by changing {{the thickness of the}} shim.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine is}} easily {{identified}} visually {{by the change}} from smooth polished cam covers to a more industrial [...] "ribbed" [...] appearance. It was de-tuned in the US with twin Strombergs and larger <b>valve</b> <b>clearances,</b> but in the UK retained triple SUs and the much tighter <b>valve</b> <b>clearances.</b> (Series 1½ cars also had ribbed cam covers). This detuned engine produced , a drop of 20 hp.|$|R
5000|$|The FZ750 uses an all-aluminium, liquid-cooled, transverse-mounted, four-{{cylinder}} engine. The complex {{cylinder head}} is constructed in two halves, with dual chain-driven overhead camshafts operating 20 valves, 3 inlet and 2 exhaust per cylinder. <b>Valve</b> <b>clearances</b> are adjusted with under-lifter shims.|$|R
50|$|The {{camshafts}} and {{injection pump}} {{are driven by}} duplex chain from the crankshaft. A separate single-row chain drives the oil pump. The camshaft operated the valves via hydraulic bucket tappets; <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> adjustment is automatic.|$|E
50|$|GM {{specified}} cast-iron {{cylinder liners}} and the cast aluminum pistons included <b>valve</b> <b>clearance.</b> Northstar is an interference engine, the valves will strike the pistons {{if they lose}} timing. It has bronze piston pin bushings and free-floating piston pins.|$|E
5000|$|... {{cylinder}} heads and valvetrain: cast aluminium alloy, four valves per cylinder, 40 valves total, low-friction roller cam followers with automatic hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> compensation, chain driven double overhead camshafts, continuously {{variable valve timing}} system both for intake and exhaust ...|$|E
5000|$|Technically the Taunus G73A {{was little}} {{changed from the}} 1939 G93A, {{retaining}} the familiar 1,172 cc side-valve engine first seen in the 1935 Ford Eifel. With gasoline/petrol availability in Europe restricted to low-octane fuels, the [...] maximum power output was also unchanged, supporting a claimed top speed of 105 km/h (65 mph). It {{was not possible to}} adjust <b>valve</b> <b>clearances</b> and engines typically lasted for 80,000 km.|$|R
50|$|The changes {{extended}} to the engine where Honda's late 1970s issues with cam chains were dealt with via the introduction of an automatic tensioner replacing the manual version on the earlier models. Other changes also meant that the standard <b>valve</b> <b>clearances</b> were reduced, possibly through tighter manufacturing control. Sports model engines are identifiable via {{the lack of a}} cam chain tensioner bolt and the revised valve covers which feature black painted stripes and satin alloy flat areas.|$|R
50|$|The V4 engine {{has proven}} itself highly reliable, with few known faults. The gear-driven {{camshaft}} system removed any lingering concerns about cam-chain maintenance, which had dogged the VF-series of Honda V4 engines. Valve adjustment on first-generation VFR750Fs was by screw and locknut, which changed in 1990 to shim-under-bucket, {{along with the}} valve-clearance inspection interval (to 16,000 miles). However, RC36 engines {{have been known to}} reach well over 50,000 miles without any need to adjust the <b>valve</b> <b>clearances.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Toyota and Volkswagen Group also used a {{directly}} actuated, SOHC parallel valve configuration with two valves for each cylinder. The Toyota system used hydraulic tappets. The Volkswagen system used bucket tappets with shims for <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> adjustment.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} valve lifter, {{also known as}} a hydraulic tappet or a hydraulic lash adjuster, is a device for maintaining zero <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> in an internal combustion engine. Conventional solid valve lifters require regular adjusting to maintain a small clearance between the valve and its rocker or cam follower. This space prevents the parts from binding as they expand with the engine's heat, but can also lead to noisy operation and increased wear as the parts rattle against one another until they reach operating temperature. The hydraulic lifter was designed to compensate for this small tolerance, allowing the valve train to operate with zero clearance—leading to quieter operation, longer engine life, and eliminating the need for periodic adjustment of <b>valve</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{duration}} can {{be increased}} until the closing flank of the cam lobe reaches the opening flank - a duration of 720 degrees. In a typical application the helical camshaft would have a continuous duration range from about average for a road-going general purpose engine (about 250 degrees measured at normal <b>valve</b> <b>clearance)</b> to about 100 or 150 degrees above this.|$|E
50|$|Mis-adjusted tappets {{can give}} rise to an audible 'tappet rattle' from the rocker cover, if the <b>valve</b> <b>{{clearances}}</b> are excessive. Over-tight clearances may, even worse, lead to bent pushrods. The adjusting screw was locked by a locknut. If the screw became loose, the adjustment would also work loose. Such a simple matter as a loose tappet locknut even led to an engine fire, then the aircraft crash {{that led to the}} death of WWII radar expert Alan Blumlein.|$|R
50|$|A top-hat shim (US: lash cap) is a small, inverted, hardened-metal cup, placed atop a {{valve stem}} in an {{internal}} combustion engine. Varying thicknesses of top-hat shims {{are used to}} adjust <b>valve</b> <b>clearances</b> {{in much the same}} way as standard flat disc shims (as used in Fiat SOHC/DOHC, Volvo, and early Jaguar engines), where the cam-lobe operates directly on the valve without an intermediate rocker arm. Top-hat shims offer a dramatic weight-reduction over standard disc shims, and are used where valve-train weight reduction is important (i.e. high-performance road- and race-orientated engines).|$|R
40|$|Gas leakage in the {{incomplete}} sealing of valves may {{significantly affect}} the volumetric and isentropic efficiencies of compressors. This paper describes a model developed to predict gas leakage in reed type valves of small reciprocating compressors commonly adopted for household refrigeration. Computations {{are carried out}} {{for a wide range}} of pressure differences that prevail in the <b>valve</b> <b>clearances</b> during the complete compression cycle. Results for mass flow rate in the suction and discharge valves are used to analyze the influence of geometric parameters on the leakage process. Reed deflection into the valve port due to pressure load is seen to be an important parameter of the analysis...|$|R
5000|$|The 2L-T II is {{an upgrade}} of the 2L-T. Of the same {{dimensions}} as all other 2L engines, {{the most significant}} change is that the camshaft lifts the valve directly via tappet instead of a rocker arm. The <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> is adjusted using shims. Compression rate is also 20:1. Output is [...] at 4000 rpm, 22.0 kgm Nm at 2400 rpm ...|$|E
50|$|The Honda AX-1 was a {{modified}} version of Honda NX-250 intended only for the Japanese market but was offered in Oceania. Using the same chassis as the NX-250, the AX-1 came standard with alloy rims, aluminum Pro-Link rear suspension this time with a rear disc brake, dual round headlights, taller cams, stainless steel exhaust and different carburetor settings. The <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> check interval is every 24000 mi.|$|E
5000|$|The 2L-II is {{an upgrade}} of the 2L. Bore and stroke remains the same. The most {{significant}} change {{is that the}} camshaft lifts the valve directly via tappet instead of a rocker arm. The <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> is adjusted using shims. Later L engines (3L and 5L) also use this method of valve operation. Maximum output is [...] gross at 4,200 rpm and maximum torque is 149 N·m net or 167 Nm gross at 2,400 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|This first Z650 had {{a single}} front 275 mm disc brake and a 250 mm rear drum. Although the Z650's engine {{was based on the}} [...] there were several differences: the 650 used a plain bearing {{crankshaft}} with a HyVo (or [...] "Morse") chain primary drive instead of a gear drive, which necessitated the installation of a third (intermediate) shaft in the transmission to drive the input side of the clutch. Another departure from the Z1 engine design was the use of a shim-under-bucket method of setting <b>valve</b> <b>clearances.</b> (The Z1 engine's shim-over-bucket design caused some mishaps when its camshafts flicked the shims out of position, with consequent damage).|$|R
50|$|The FJ1200 uses a four {{cylinder}} in-line {{layout and}} is air-cooled. Sixteen valves are {{operated by a}} chain-driven double overhead camshaft; <b>valve</b> <b>clearances</b> are adjusted using shims. The four constant-velocity carburettors are mounted in a bank behind the cylinders and feed each cylinder through short intake manifolds. Four exhaust downpipes join a box below the engine where the gases are split to exit through two silencers (mufflers). The crankshaft is geared directly to the clutch, no counter balancer shaft is used. Starting is by electric starter only. Lubrication is wet sump using a trochoid pump; an oil radiator assists with cooling. Both the FJ1100 and FJ1200 were fitted with an additional fuel vapour recovery system to comply with California emission regulations.|$|R
5000|$|Steam {{leaves the}} boiler and reaches the {{condenser}} after {{passing through the}} main valve, regulating <b>valves,</b> nozzles, <b>clearance</b> spaces between nozzles and moving blades, diaphragm and rotating shaft etc. Further there is large pressure difference between inside of steam turbine and the ambient and also from one location to another location across these devices. Therefore, steam leakage takes place through ...|$|R
50|$|A single {{timing belt}} drives the {{intake and exhaust}} {{camshaft}} along with the oil and water pumps. The cam journal is supported on 5 points between the valve lifters of each cylinder and {{on the front of}} the cylinder head. The cam journals are lubricated by oiler port located in the middle of the camshaft. To adjust the <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> in the first two generations, a shim over bucket system is employed. In the following generations a shim under bucket system is used.|$|E
50|$|The Apollo uses a 4163 cc {{bi-turbo}} intercooled {{version of}} the Audi V8 engine. The 90° V8 has a closed-deck light metal crankcase with dry sump lubrication. The light metal cylinder heads have five valves per cylinder, four overhead camshafts, VarioCam Direct variable valve timing on the intakes, and hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> compensation. The double-flow exhaust system has four oxygen sensors to monitor the gas mixture, and a 3-way catalytic converter. Modern controls include an on-board diagnostic system, eight-coil electronic ignition, sequential multipoint fuel injection, and an electronic (drive by wire) accelerator system.|$|E
50|$|The wasserboxer, as {{with all}} Volkswagen boxer engines, {{directly}} drives the three-bearing camshaft via a small steel gear on the crankshaft, and a large aluminium one on the camshaft, {{so there is no}} timing belt or timing chain. The entire mechanism is internal to the engine, so there should be no concerns regarding wear or replacements, as long as the engine oil is changed regularly. The overhead poppet valves each feature two concentric valve springs, and are operated by pushrods, with adjustable rocker arms to facilitate <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> adjustment.|$|E
5000|$|The engine {{features}} four inline cylinders inclined {{at an angle}} of approximately 45 degrees (hence the name), and this is because Vauxhall had originally planned to develop a whole family of engines all built on the same production line. There was to be slant four and V8 versions in both petrol and diesel versions, designed {{under the guidance of}} Vauxhall's then chief engineer, John Alden. Although several diesel 4-cylinder and a V8 petrol engine prototypes were built only the 4-cylinder petrol made it to series production. There is a single overhead camshaft operating two valves per cylinder. An ingenious valve train design incorporating an inclined socket head cap screw, allowed <b>valve</b> <b>clearances</b> to be adjusted with a feeler gauge and an Allen key. The block and crossflow head are both of cast iron. The layout makes good use of the cylinder inclination to lower the overall height of the engine, which allowed for more aerodynamic designs of cars to be achieved by lowering the bonnet line. It also means most of the engine is very easy to access for maintenance, {{with the exception of the}} exhaust manifold and spark plugs, which are [...] "underneath" [...] the slanted cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|In the Type 2, the Type 4 {{engine was}} {{an option for}} the 1972 model year onward. This engine was {{standard}} in models destined for the US and Canada. Only with the Type 4 engine did an automatic transmission become available {{for the first time}} in the 1973 model year. Both engines displaced 1.7 L, DIN-rated at [...] with the manual transmission and [...] with the automatic. The Type 4 engine was enlarged to 1.8 L and [...] DIN for the 1974 model year and again to 2.0 L and [...] DIN for the 1976 model year. The two-litre option appeared in South African manufactured models during 1976, originally only in a comparably well-equipped [...] "Executive" [...] model. The 1978 2.0 L now featured hydraulic valve lifters, eliminating the need to periodically adjust the <b>valve</b> <b>clearances</b> as on earlier models. The 1975 and later U.S. model years received Bosch L-Jetronic electronic fuel injection as standard equipment; 1978 was the first year for electronic ignition, utilizing a hall effect sensor and digital controller, eliminating maintenance-requiring contact-breaker points. As with all Transporter engines, the focus in development was not on power, but on low-end torque. The Type 4 engines were considerably more robust and durable than the Type 1 engines, particularly in Transporter service.|$|R
40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright British Institute of Non-destructive Testing [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]Internal combustion engine acoustic signatures are rich in information about the engine's operating parameters and physical condition. Unfortunately, these signatures are very complex and highly corrupted by background noise, therefore the extraction of diagnostic signatures is difficult and not straightforward. This article focuses on ways to extract quick information about the internal combustion engine's operating conditions by means of their induced acoustic signals in a normal, acoustically untreated laboratory environment, without any sound measurement precautions. The engine acoustic sources are briefly outlined and their fundamental characteristics are studied in time domain, frequency domain, and other statistical parameters analyses. Acoustic signals for a range of loads and speeds are considered in order to provide a baseline for normal engine characteristics. An analysis of a number of measured parameters from the engine test rig is then given for the purposes of detecting, diagnosing and assessing the severity of some seeded faults. Namely, these faults are decrease in compression ratio, change in injection pressure, and variation of exhaust and intake <b>valve's</b> <b>clearances.</b> Exhaust <b>valve</b> clearance-related faults were also detected and diagnosed by monitoring the spikeness level using the r. m. s. values of the acoustic signals kurtosis of each of the engine cylinders. Conclusions and concluded marks are also given...|$|R
50|$|This type {{of engine}} still has tappet noise even after adjustment. This noise is said {{to come from the}} cams due to {{incorrect}} valve setup (when setting <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> each cylinder must be set to TDC) or from age and use of incorrect oil grade. The correct oil grade is 5W-30 semi synthetic oil. Another reason is the large tappet clearance on the exhaust valve. This could of course be reduced to lower the noise level but the engine would then suffer from a rough idle and usually stalled.|$|E
50|$|The 603.96 engine has a {{capacity}} of 2996cc and was an engineering marvel in pre-chamber design and a technological leap forward from the earlier 5 cylinder OM617. It produced 143 hp at 4600 rpm (euro market without catalytic converter produced 148hp) and 195 ft.lb at 2400 rpm with a compression ratio of 22.0:1. Versions 603.96x and 603.97x are turbocharged. Only turbocharged models of the 603 series were available to the U.S. market. The single camshaft and injection pump are driven by duplex chain from the crankshaft. A separate single row chain drives the oil pump. The camshaft operated the valves via hydraulic bucket tappets; <b>valve</b> <b>clearance</b> adjustment is automatic.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by Aurelio Lampredi, the Fiat Twin Cam (also {{known as}} the Lampredi Twin Cam) was an {{advanced}} inline-four automobile engine produced from 1966 through 2000 as a Fiat/Lancia engine until it {{was replaced by the}} [...] "family B" [...] series of engines. The engine uses the block of the OHV engine found in the Fiat 124 with some modifications to accept the belt drive for the camshafts. The head itself is made in three pieces, one carrying the combustion chamber and valves and one separate casting for each camshaft in tunnel type bearings. The valves had an included angle of 65 degrees. The engine featured a revolutionary new method for adjusting the <b>valve</b> <b>clearance.</b> Usually at that time in DOHC engines like from Alfa Romeo or Jaguar, small shims were placed on the valve stem inside the bucket tappets, thereby necessitating the removal of the camshafts to get access to these shims to adjust the <b>valve</b> <b>clearance,</b> making for time consuming and very expensive maintenance work. Lampredi’s design placed the shims on top of the tappets where they could be removed with the camshaft in situ after the tappets were pressed down with a special tool. This design was patented for Fiat and was used in the engines of the 128 and 130, and even the (Ferrari/Fiat) Dino V6 engine was converted to this system.The engine was produced in a large number of displacements, ranging from 1,297 cc to 1,995 cc and was used in Fiat, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, SEAT and Morgan cars.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the {{camshaft}} can be advanced to produce better low RPM torque, or retarded for better high RPM power. Changing cam timing moves the overall power produced by the engine down or up the RPM scale. The amount of change is very little (usually < 5 deg), and affects <b>valve</b> to piston <b>clearances.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{air-cooled}} engine has a gear-driven counterbalancer {{as well as}} a proprietary cylinder wall plating similar to a Nikasil coating. The coating, marketed as Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material or SCEM, is nickel-phosphorus-silicon-carbide based, reducing weight (by eliminating a steel liner) and improving heat transfer, allowing for tighter and more efficient piston-to-cylinder <b>clearance.</b> <b>Valves</b> are adjustable via 'screw and locknut' type clearance adjusters.
