40|$|Education {{is often}} {{found to be}} a strong {{determinant}} of ethnic prejudice. However, there is preliminary evidence that this educational effect varies across countries. Moreover, there are also theoretical arguments to expect cross-national <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> educational effect on ethnic prejudice. From both a cultural and structural perspective, we set out to explain these cross-national <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> educational effect. Results of multilevel analyses on data from 11 European countries show that the cultural perspective is more fruitful to explain cross-national <b>variances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strength of the educational effect on ethnic prejudice than the structural perspective: a country’s democratic tradition and degree of religious heterogeneity are important for the strength of the educational effect on ethnic prejudice, whereas a country’s ethnic composition and unemployment rate are less relevant. ...|$|R

25|$|In nature, {{organisms are}} neither {{distributed}} uniformly nor at random, forming instead {{some sort of}} spatial pattern. This is due to various energy inputs, disturbances, and species interactions that result in spatially patchy structures or gradients. This spatial <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environment creates diversity in communities of organisms, {{as well as in}} the variety of the observed biological and ecological events. The type of spatial arrangement present may suggest certain interactions within and between species, such as competition, predation, and reproduction.

Analogously, collective intelligence research aims to explore reasons why certain groups perform more intelligent than other groups given that c is just moderately correlated with the intelligence of individual group members.

However, they claim that three factors were found as significant correlates: the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of speaking turns, group members' average social sensitivity {{and the proportion of}} females.

25|$|The models {{described}} {{on this page}} describe {{the evolution of a}} single site within a set of sequences. They are often used for analyzing the evolution of an entire locus by making the simplifying assumption that different sites evolve independently and are identically distributed. This assumption may be justifiable if the sites can be assumed to be evolving neutrally. If the primary effect of natural selection on the evolution of the sequences is to constrain some sites, then models of among-site rate-heterogeneity can be used. This approach allows one to estimate only one matrix of relative rates of substitution, and another set of parameters describing the <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> total rate of substitution across sites.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species have}} a sperm {{transplant}} mechanism. Crickets are one such species that can prematurely remove spermatophore after copulation, which terminates sperm transfer. In one study, males {{were randomly assigned}} to females to create half-sib families to determine the heritability of spermatophore retention time in females. The researchers found that there was additive genetic <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> timing of spermatophore removal by females. These results suggest that the timing of the spermatophore removal is determined partly by genotype and is independent of the quality of a female's mate. This shows no difference between the fitness of females who freely remove the spermatophore and the fitness of females that are forced to accept complete ejaculates.|$|E

25|$|The {{brain is}} never {{completely}} at rest. It never stops functioning and firing neuronal signals, {{as well as}} using oxygen {{as long as the}} person in question is alive. In fact, in Stark and Squire’s, 2001 study When zero is not zero: The problem of ambiguous baseline conditions in fMRI, activity in the medial temporal lobe (as well as in other brain regions) was substantially higher during rest than during several alternative baseline conditions. The effect of this elevated activity during rest was to reduce, eliminate, or even reverse the sign of the activity during task conditions relevant to memory functions. These results demonstrate that periods of rest are associated with significant cognitive activity and are therefore not an optimal baseline for cognition tasks. In order to discern baseline and activation conditions it is necessary to interpret a lot of information. This includes situations as simple as breathing. Periodic blocks may result in identical data of other <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> data if the person breathes at a regular rate of 1 breath/5sec, and the blocks occur every 10s, thus impairing the data.|$|E
25|$|As {{cited above}} from Ant. 1.18, Menander gave 155 {{years from the}} first year of Hiram's reign until the seventh year of Pygmalion, at which time Pygmalion's sister Dido, also known as Elissa, fled from Tyre, after which she founded Carthage in North Africa. This {{reference}} in Menander is unique not only for its chronological correlation of the time between Hiram and Pygmalion, but also because virtually all texts of Josephus/Menander that have come down to us, including the citations of Josephus's work in other writers, have preserved this total of 143 years and eight months from the start of construction of Solomon's Temple, in the 12th year of the reign of Hiram (Against Apion 1.18/126), until Dido's flight. This is in contrast with the lengths of reign for the individual monarchs between Hiram and Pygmalion, for which there is considerable <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> copies of the various texts. But the overall figure of 143 years has been preserved by a fortuitous circumstance: it is repeated in three instances in Josephus, and in one of these instances it is not given as simply 143 years, but as 155 years from the start of Hiram's reign until the time that construction began for the Temple, which was in Hiram's 12th year (Against Apion 1.17,18). This triple redundancy has preserved the total of years from Hiram to Dido as originally recorded, even though the various extracts of Menander found in Josephus, Eusebius, Syncellus, and Theodotion disagree in other matters, due to the error of copyists through the centuries of written transmission. Modern historians therefore have generally given considerable credibility to this figure, using it to measure back 155 years from the date for the founding of Carthage in order to arrive at the regnal years of Hiram.|$|E
