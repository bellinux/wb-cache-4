40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{mechanisms}} for an adaptive bandwidth allocation (ABA) based on border-to-border (b 2 b) bandwidth budgets. These budgets {{can be considered}} as virtual capacity tunnels binding a fraction of the network capacity and connecting different network border routers. Unlike MPLS label switched <b>paths</b> or ATM <b>virtual</b> <b>path</b> <b>connections</b> associated with a certain bandwidth, these tunnels support multi-path routing. Moreover, they can be used to implement resilient b 2 b budget-based network admission control. If static bandwidth allocation (SBA) based on peak-rate traffic assumptions is used to dimension the b 2 b budgets, fluctuations of the network traffic can lead to under- or overprovisioning of network capacity within these budgets. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we address this problem by two new ABA mechanisms – complete capacity reassignment (CCR) and selective capacity reassignment (SCR) – which adapt the sizes of the b 2 b budgets with regard to their current bandwidth requirements. Secondly, we investigate the bandwidth savings potential of these meachanisms by the construction of synthetically shifted but constantly loaded traffic matrices. Though focused on the above two aspects, the study of ABA based on b 2 b budgets is not finished and further investigations are currently in progress...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 81 - 83. The {{major source}} of errors in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM.) networks {{is expected to be}} buffer overflow during congestion, resulting in cell losses. The large ratio of the end-to-end propagation time for a typical connection to the cell transmission time makes lost cell recovery by means of retransmissionbased error control techniques impractical especially for delay-sensitive highspeed applications. As has been shown by many authors, forward error correction is a promising alternative since it can improve end-to-end reliability without requiring retransmissions. This thesis discusses the use of a two-level forward error correction scheme for virtual channel and <b>virtual</b> <b>path</b> <b>connections</b> in ATM networks. The performance of the scheme, which exploits erasure correcting simple and interleaved block codes simultaneously, is studied via both analyses and simulations. For a single-node virtual channel connection, a novel and accurate discrete-time analytical cell loss model is developed first. Based on this model, the reduction in the cell loss rate achieved by two-level coding is then investigated extensively via iterative computational methods. For the case of a four-node, long-distance virtual channel connection that cannot tolerate any loss, the use of the two-level coding scheme in conjunction with an automatic repeat request mechanism is considered, and detailed simulations are made to quantify the improvement achieved in the delay-throughput performance. The results obtained indicate substantial performance improvements even for very high network loads provided that an appropriate coding technique is chosen according to the traffic characteristics. Typically, bursty traffic requires code interleaving be used for effective loss recovery whereas small-latency simple block codes suffice for random traffic. Two-level coding, which is shown to effectively combine the fast and burst loss recovery capabilities of the individual coding techniques, is attractive for traffic streams of unpredictable or time-varying characteristics.
