40|$|Oncogenic viruses are the {{etiologic}} {{agents for}} {{a significant proportion of}} human cancers, but effective therapies and preventative strategies are lacking for the majority of virus-associated cancers. Targeting of virus-induced signal transduction or virus-host protein interactions may offer novel therapeutic strategies for viral cancers. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90) is a well-characterized, multifunctional molecular chaperone involved in regulation of signal transduction, transcriptional activation, oncogenic protein stabilization, and neovascularization—pathogenic elements relevant to <b>viral</b> <b>cancer</b> pathogenesis. This review will summarize mechanistic concepts involving regulation of viral oncogenesis by both intracellular and extracellular Hsp 90, as well as current therapeutic implications of these data...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of effective therapies for HIV requires a fundamental knowledge of retroviral infections. Research by the Public Health Service and collaborating organizations on oncogenic viruses, including retroviruses, has provided {{much of the}} basic understanding of retroviruses in general and anti-retroviral therapeutic strategies in particular. Early work by the <b>Viral</b> <b>Cancer</b> and Developmental Therapeutic Programs of the National Cancer Institute and the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has contributed much of the current understanding of AIDS and its therapy. This paper describes the progress {{that has been made}} in the treatment of AIDS and the programs that have been created to develop future therapies. These programs include efforts to screen existing compounds for activity against HIV, to design new anti-HIV therapies, and to test potential agents in controlled clinical trials. As a result of these activities, researchers have identified one drug, AZT, that has proven effective in prolonging the lives of some patients with AIDS, and are developing several other promising compounds. The key question no longer is whether HIV infection can be treated, but what is the best and fastest way to develop new therapies and improve existing ones...|$|E
50|$|Viral {{transformation}} {{can occur}} both naturally and medically. Natural transformations can include <b>viral</b> <b>cancers,</b> such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and T-cell Leukemia virus type I. Hepatitis B and C {{are also the}} result of natural viral transformation of the host cells. Viral transformation can also be induced for use in medical treatments.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to medical wisdom in the 1960s and 1970s, Huebner {{was confident that}} viruses were a cause of cancer in humans and convinced the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare to provide $60 million in grants to fund research on the connection {{as part of the}} War on Cancer. This led to the discovery of the role that cytomegalovirus plays in opportunistic infections in patients with immunodeficiency. Research on retroviruses {{led to the development of}} a vaccine for hepatitis B, which has led to major decreases in rates of liver cancer, rates of some <b>viral</b> <b>cancers,</b> like that of the liver, have been sharply reduced.|$|R
40|$|The {{human genome}} {{contains}} microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs that orchestrate {{a number of}} physiologic processes through regulation of gene expression. Burgeoning evidence suggests that dysregulation of miRNAs may promote disease progression and cancer pathogenesis. Virus-encoded miRNAs, exhibiting unique molecular signatures and functions, have been increasingly recognized as contributors to <b>viral</b> <b>cancer</b> pathogenesis. A {{large segment of the}} existing knowledge in this area has been generated through characterization of miRNAs encoded by the human gamma-herpesviruses, including the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Recent studies focusing on KSHV miRNAs have led {{to a better understanding of}} viral miRNA expression in human tumors, the identification of novel pathologic check points regulated by viral miRNAs, and new insights for viral miRNA interactions with cellular (“human”) miRNAs. Elucidating the functional effects of inhibiting KSHV miRNAs has also provided a foundation for further translational efforts and consideration of clinical applications. This paper summarizes recent literature outlining mechanisms for KSHV miRNA regulation of cellular function and cancer-associated pathogenesis, as well as implications for interactions between KSHV and human miRNAs that may facilitate cancer progression. Finally, insights are offered for the clinical feasibility of targeting miRNAs as a therapeutic approach for viral cancers...|$|E

30|$|Sophora flavescens Aiton is a {{traditional}} Chinese medicinal herb of the Fabaceae family with wild populations distributed mainly in East Asia. The dried roots of S. flavescens, which contain many alkaloids such as matrine and oxymatrine (Liu et al., 2011), are commonly used to treat <b>viral</b> hepatitis, <b>cancer,</b> <b>viral</b> myocarditis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and skin diseases (Chen et al., 2004; Ling et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2011). They also contain many flavonoids that have antioxidative potential and beneficial effects on human health (Piao et al., 2006; Jeong et al., 2008). S. flavescens is widely used in Taiwan, but the wild populations of S. flavescens grown in native vegetations are very limited. Therefore most S. flavescens plant materials are imported from China to meet the market demand. However, wild S. flavescens populations in China are threatened by over-harvesting (Zhao et al., 2004), thus the commercial-scale cultivation of S. flavescens is highly desirable.|$|R

Although patient survival rates for some forms of cancers are high due to clinical advances in treatment protocols, the search for effective cancer vaccines remains the ultimate Rosetta Stone in oncology. Cervarix®, Gardasil®, and hepatitis B vaccines are currently employed in preventing certain forms of <b>viral</b> <b>cancers.</b> However, they are, strictly speaking, not ‘true’ cancer vaccines as they are prophylactic rather than therapeutic, are only effective against the oncogenic viruses, and do not kill the actual cancer cells. On April 2010, a new prostate cancer vaccine Provenge® (sipuleucel-T) was approved by the US FDA, and it is the first approved therapeutic vaccine that utilizes antigen-presenting cell technology involving dendritic cells in cancer immunotherapy. Recent evidence suggests that the use of nanoscale particles like exosomes in immunotherapy could form a viable basis for the development of novel cancer vaccines, via antigen-presenting cell technology, to prime the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. Coupled with nanotechnology, engineered exosomes are emerging as new and novel avenues for cancer vaccine development. Here, we review the current knowledge pertaining to exosome technology in immunotherapy and also seek to address the challenges and future directions associated with it, in hopes of bringing this exciting application a step closer toward an effective clinical reality...|$|R
