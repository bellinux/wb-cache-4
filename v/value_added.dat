40|$|This paper {{begins with}} an {{assumption}} that many UK manufacturing organizations are inherently wasteful, with complex production systems divorced from the core task of <b>adding</b> <b>value.</b> This waste {{can be regarded as}} untapped potential which exists throughout the total <b>value</b> <b>adding</b> chain. Releasing this potential can greatly improve company performance. By focusing upon <b>value</b> <b>adding</b> activity and non <b>value</b> <b>adding</b> removal, waste, complexity and cost can be reduced progressively to achieve world class competitiveness. A time based <b>value</b> <b>adding</b> framework to direct development and continuous improvement is described. The total conversion chain from raw materials purchase to final goods assembly is examined using this approach.

The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts.

In order to test this claim, we use a stratified sample comprising 68 European early stage high tech venture capitalists.

5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, {{development}} of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population.

Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, Wales' economy depends on the public sector, light and service industries and tourism.

5|$|Over {{the last}} 250 years, Wales has been {{transformed}} first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy.

Total headline Gross <b>Value</b> <b>Added</b> (GVA) in Wales in 2010 was £45.5 billion, or £15,145 per head of population; 74.0 per cent of the average for the UK total, the lowest GVA per head in the UK.

The tax rate is therefore significantly lower than in Metropolitan Norway, including the absence of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> tax. The government summarizes its expenses on Svalbard in the Svalbard Budget. The taxation rules made Svalbard a tax paradise, and in 2009 the oil rig operator Seadrill established a subsidiary in Longyearbyen to exploit the lower taxes. In 2011, the tax rate for profits exceeding NOK10 million were raised from 16 to 28 percent—the same as on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>value</b> <b>added</b> tax (VAT) has {{not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E

Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had gotten away without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E
