25|$|In {{the pilot}} episode, {{and for the}} first season, Crockett pilots a Chris Craft Stinger 390 X - a 39-foot deep-v {{offshore}} racing boat. According to T. Rafael Cimino, marine director for Miami <b>Vice,</b> <b>a</b> total of five Stinger 390 Xs were used on the show. A white 390 X was selected for the pilot episode as it would show up better for the night scenes. For the other four Stingers, Chris-Craft showed the production crew a colour scheme that included the red - however, since Michael Mann decided that the colour red was to never show up on the show so a blue colour scheme was instead chosen. The Stingers used on the show were not free from Chris-Craft. In fact, the boats had some serious warranty issues. These issues caused the production team to switch to using Wellcraft 38 Scarab KVs {{for the remainder of the}} show. The Scarab 38 KVs were a 28-hued, twin 440-hp boat that sold for $130,000 in 1986.|$|E

2500|$|Following the American Civil War, {{during the}} Reconstruction era, {{lawlessness}} took hold in many frontier outposts, especially along the Mexican border. Smuggling operations {{as well as}} saloons and gambling houses became increasingly common. New settlements began to dot the western frontier of the state with gambling a popular form of recreation at the saloons for the numerous cowboys and buffalo hunters who passed through. Professional gamblers, such as [...] "Doc" [...] Holliday and [...] "Lottie Deno" [...] (Charlotte Thompkins), traveled circuits through these settlements preying on the unsuspecting. Unregulated gambling on the frontier reached its peak in the 1870s before communities began to establish more formal ordinances and more strictly enforce them. [...] The 1870s in particular were an economic boom period on the Texas frontier because of a spike in demand for bison hides. Towns and outposts from El Paso and San Antonio to Fort Griffin, Fort Worth, and Denison saw periodic arrivals of cowboys and traders flush with cash and frequently looking for entertainment including any form of <b>vice</b> <b>a</b> community might offer. For its part El Paso, which by this time was a relatively large community, was still predominantly a way station for commerce between the interior of Mexico and New Mexico. Its largest business sectors revolved around gaming, drinking, and prostitution. The small frontier outpost of Fort Griffin {{became one of the}} most notorious centers of vice and lawlessness.|$|E

2500|$|As in World War I {{and the war}} of 1870-1871, the Germans {{argued that}} those {{engaging}} in resistance were [...] "bandits" [...] and [...] "terrorists", maintaining that all Francs-tireurs were engaging in an illegal form of warfare, and, as such, had no legal rights. On 5 August 1942, three Romanians belonging to the FTP-MOI tossed some grenades into a group of Luftwaffe men watching a football game at the Jean-Bouin Stadium in Paris, killing eight and wounding 13, though the Germans claimed three killed and 42 wounded. The Germans wanted to minimize the number of dead suffered, but exaggerated the number of wounded so they could {{increase the number of}} hostages to execute as Field Marshal Hugo Sperrle demanded the three hostages be shot for every dead German and two hostages for every wounded German, thus making for a total of 93 if one accepted the false report of the German losses at the stadium. As it was, the Germans did not have that many hostages in custody and settled for executing 88 people on 11 August 1942. The majority of those shot that day were communists or relatives of communists, with the father and father-in-law of Pierre Georges and the brother of the communist leader Maurice Thorez among the victims. A number of those shot were Belgian, Dutch, and Hungarian immigrants to France, but all shot had gone before the firing squads singing La Marseillaise and/or shouting Vive la France!, which was a testament to how even the communists by 1942 saw themselves as fighting for France just as much as for world revolution. Torture of captured résistants was routine. The only way to avoid torture was to be [...] "turned", with the Germans having a particular interest in [...] "turning" [...] radio operators who could compromise an entire Resistance network. Captured résistants were held in filthy, overcrowded prisons full of lice and fleas and fed substandard food or were held in solitary confinement. Methods of torture included beatings, shackling, being suspended from the ceiling, being burned with a blowtorch, allowing dogs to attack the prisoner, being lashed with ox-hide whips, being hit with a hammer, or having heads placed in a <b>vice.</b> <b>A</b> particular favorite was to threaten family members of captured résistants with arrest and the baignoire, where the victim was forced into a bathtub full of freezing water and held nearly to the point of drowning before pulled out at the last moment, only for the process to be repeated. A common threat to a captured résistant was to have the wife, girlfriend, daughter, or sister of the résistant sent to the Wehrmacht field brothels. Only those with the strongest wills could hold out in the face of torture and the vast majority subjected to torture talked. [...] At least 40,000 French died in such prisons.|$|E
