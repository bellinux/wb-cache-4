Hafeez was accused, by Younis, of lying about his knee injury before the T20. He said it could have affected the teams poor performance. Despite bad performance during the T20I world cup 2016 Hafeez was picked for the England tour of 2016 Hafeez was out on 0 several times throughout the test series and during the ODI series in the first match he was out on 11 which then he was dropped for rest of the tour because of bad performance and not fit enough to play. After missing out of international cricket for months in which he missed the West Indies series in the UAE, Hafeez was then picked for the Australia tour 2017 to play the ODI series. As of the first ODI match Hafeez was out on 4. For the second ODI Azhar Ali was ruled out because of injury which promoted Hafeez to captain Pakistan, Hafeez did a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> as Pakistan won the match and first time in 12 years in Australian soil. Not only that Hafeez captaincy was appreciated but he also made 72 runs which earned him player of the match.|$|E

[...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone feels it is [...] "truly puzzling what Perry the secret agent is doing in this show in the first place."

500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he did a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E

[...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he did a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of stepping up to Pável.

[...] Adelson said two other instances which similarly have dominated the Digg main page in the past were the Virginia Tech Massacre {{in the aftermath of the}} incident and the [...] "7/7" [...] London bombings in 2005.

500|$|Critics lauded the {{development}} of the storyline between Shane and Rick. Writing for Best Week Ever, Dan Hopper stated that it presented a cold and eerie outlook {{on the future of the}} two men. Nate Rawlings of Time evaluated their physical confrontation as [...] "darn good", and Alex Crumb of The Faster Times called it [...] "wholly satisfying". Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich commended the fight scene; [...] "The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out with an air of boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal." [...] Goldman summated on the scene: [...] "Of course, it was also gratifying to finally see that conflict turn physical, with a fight we've been waiting to see for a long time. Rick vs. Shane was appropriately brutal and did a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of representing the two men's different tactics—Rick was no doubt a formidable and dangerous guy in a fight, wailing on Shane with a series of punches. But Shane was going for the kill, using anything he could grab as a weapon, as he shoved a motorcycle onto Rick at one point and then threw a massive wrench at him in an effective, 'Holy S**t!' moment." ...|$|E

The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian Monzon).

Poverty existed, but was concentrated among the migrant farm workers made famous in The Grapes of Wrath, where the Joad family, driven out of the Dust Bowl, searches for the California Dream.

It meant <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>jobs,</b> excellent roads, plentiful facilities for outdoor recreation, and the schools and universities that were {{the best in the world}} by the 1940s. James M.
