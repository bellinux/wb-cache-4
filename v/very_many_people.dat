This may seem an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand {{there are those who}} succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E

He asked Shindo to take his place, and Shindo got a job in Shinko Kinema's art department run by Hiroshi Mizutani.

McCoy said that if he were rated a first- or second-round draft pick, he might change his mind about staying. McCoy said, [...] "But at the same time, I want to play four years here.

In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are <b>very</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in Valhalla, and that Odin is a [...] "very great lord when he commands such a troop". Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and [...] "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." [...] High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla and sit down to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from Grímnismál.|$|E
500|$|Yuichi is accosted a {{few days}} after {{arriving}} in the city by Kanons third heroine Makoto Sawatari, a young girl who has lost her memories, but despite this she is sure that she holds a grudge against Yuichi from when he last visited the city. Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever.Translated quote: [...] "If only spring would come and stay forever." [...] Yuichi coincidentally runs into Shiori Misaka, another heroine and first-year high school student suffering from an unexplained illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. She tries to be strong in the face of her condition, and gets along well with others, even though she does not know <b>very</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> her age due to her condition. The fifth and final heroine in Kanon is Mai Kawasumi, a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She has a cold attitude towards almost everyone, but despite this, she is actually a very kind and caring person; she [...] "punishes" [...] someone who makes a playful joke about her by giving them a light karate chop to the head.|$|E

2500|$|The assassinations {{caused a}} split within the junta and repulsed world opinion. The killings damaged the public {{belief that the}} new regime would be an {{improvement}} over Diệm, throwing the generals into discord. Criticism over the killings caused the officers to battle one another for positions in the new government. The responsibility for the assassinations has generally been laid at the doorstep of Minh. Conein asserted that [...] "I have it on very good authority of <b>very</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> that Big Minh gave the order", as did William Colby, {{the director of the}} CIA's Far Eastern division. Đôn, however, was equally emphatic, saying [...] "I can state without equivocation that this was done by General Dương Văn Minh and by him alone." [...] Lodge believed Xuân was at least partly culpable, asserting: [...] "Diệm and Nhu had been assassinated, if not by Xuan personally, at least at his direction." [...] Some months after the event, Minh was reported to have privately told an American official that [...] "We had no alternative. They had to be killed. Diệm could not be allowed to live because he was too much respected among simple, gullible people in the countryside, especially the Catholics and the refugees. We had to kill Nhu because he was so widely feared — and he had created organizations that were arms of his personal power." ...|$|E
2500|$|During this period, he {{is known}} to have resorted to extreme {{measures}} of sense control which involve self-abnegation methods like fasting for months together (having just a cup of tea a day) while taking huge quantities of food at other times. During this time, he confined himself in a dark room with a lamp that used to be lit up at all times. He would often be found lying on bed while facing the wall. He did not allow <b>very</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in his room during this period. Whole room and his bed used to be covered with a lot of dust and one could find cobwebs and spiders around the room but he wouldn't bother cleaning it or let anyone else clean it. A rat is said to have nibbled a hole into one of his heels during this time though he {{is said to have been}} oblivious to its pain. His only constant companion in the room besides the burning lamp was his pipe. During this time he would take intoxicants like opium and sometimes vomit a lot of blood. His whole body had swollen and had become weak. On one occasion his sister reminded him of the financial difficulties they were going through but he is said to have responded by saying (translated here into English) [...] "our boat is in the middle of ocean right now, either we would reach ashore safe or drown". Some religious writers think he might have practised some form of tantric spiritual practice like pranabhasya during this time. After seven such years of his spiritual practice, his devotees affirm that he had become, what they call in Hinduism, a siddha purusha (one who attains spiritual powers) as it was right after this period that people started flocking him to get their worldly problems solved.|$|E
2500|$|In 1689 he undertook, in a {{primitive}} pirogue, a daring journey of over 6,000 kilometers down the Amazon to Pará, {{where he went}} for medical treatment, probably for malaria. [...] "I fell sick {{of the most violent}} attacks of fever and dropsy that began in my feet, and other complaints," [...] he later wrote in an account of his journey. Fritz set off downstream [...] "in the hope of getting some remedy for my sufferings," [...] reaching the mouth of the Rio Negro after three weeks.There he met a group of Tupinambarana warriors who escorted him to the Mercedarian mission, where he was treated with bloodletting and therapeutic fumigation, [...] "but instead of being benefitted, I was made worse than before." [...] Fritz was taken by some Portuguese missionaries to the Jesuit College in the city of Pará, but when he felt well enough to return to his mission, he was detained and imprisoned for eighteen months by , the Governor of the State of Maranhão, on the accusation of being a Spanish spy. In fact, the Portuguese were concerned that Spanish missions on the Upper Solimões River would lead indigenous communities to support Spain against Portugal. Fritz made use of this time to prepare a map of the river. In 1691, after a complaint was made before the Council of the Indies, his release was authorized by the King of Portugal, who also reprimanded and dismissed the governor. Fritz was accompanied for part of his return journey by a contingent of Portuguese soldiers, with whom he visited fortresses at Gurupá and Tapajós. After leaving Fritz {{at the mouth of the}} Coari River in October 1691, the soldiers [...] "cruelly killed <b>very</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> and took the rest away as slaves," [...] as Fritz later learned.|$|E
