50|$|After an HLR {{receives}} an Update Location request from a <b>visiting</b> <b>network,</b> the HLR {{must be able}} to identify whether the new and old <b>visiting</b> <b>networks</b> are Super-Charged or not. If the old <b>visiting</b> <b>network</b> is Super-Charged, the HLR does not send a Cancel Location message. If the old <b>visiting</b> <b>network</b> is not Super-Charged, the HLR sends the Cancel Location message. If the new <b>visiting</b> <b>network</b> is Super-Charged and has previously received the subscriber information and it is not outdated, the HLR does not send an Insert Subscriber Data request. Otherwise, the HLR will send the Insert Subscriber Data request.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>visiting</b> <b>networks</b> are {{maintaining}} subscriber {{information for}} all subscribers that enter and then subsequently exit their coverage area, the <b>visiting</b> <b>networks</b> {{will have to}} maintain {{a significant amount of}} subscriber information. Therefore, <b>visiting</b> <b>networks</b> should implement database maintenance measures to ensure outdated and unused subscriber information is removed. This will free up memory for new subscriber information.|$|R
50|$|Further {{signalling}} traffic reductions {{can occur}} by not sending acknowledgements. Typically, when a HLR instructs a subscriber purge (via a Cancel Location message) to a <b>visiting</b> <b>network,</b> the <b>visiting</b> <b>network</b> purges the subscriber information and sends an acknowledgment {{back to the}} HLR. The networks can further cut back on signalling traffic by not returning an acknowledgment, and just having the HLR assume the purge was completed. However, since Super-Charged <b>visiting</b> <b>networks</b> can purge subscriber data on their own due to periodic database cleanups, the <b>visiting</b> <b>network</b> register must identify whether the subscriber purge is externally instructed. If the purge is externally instructed, no acknowledgment is returned. If the purge is internally instructed, an acknowledgment {{is sent to the}} HLR.|$|R
50|$|In {{order that}} a {{subscriber}} {{is able to}} register on to a <b>visited</b> <b>network,</b> a roaming agreement {{needs to be in}} place between the <b>visited</b> <b>network</b> and the home network. This agreement is established after a series of testing processes called IREG (International Roaming Expert Group) and TADIG (Transferred Account Data Interchange Group). While the IREG testing is to test the proper functioning of the established communication links, the TADIG testing is to check the billability of the calls.|$|E
5000|$|The {{differentiation}} between home network and <b>visited</b> <b>network</b> is technically {{given by the}} type of subscriber entry in a specific network. If a subscriber has no entry in the home subscriber register of the network (e.g. home location register (HLR) in GSM networks or local customer database in WLANs), the required subscriber data must first be requested by the <b>visited</b> <b>network</b> e.g. from the subscriber's home network in order that the subscriber can be authenticated and any authorization for using the network services can be checked. The [...] "visiting" [...] subscriber acquires an entry in a user database of the <b>visited</b> <b>network</b> (e.g. visitor location register (VLR)) and the authorized network services are enabled. For the roaming procedure in practice, the possibility of assigning the subscriber data is always indispensable in order that authentication, authorization and billing of the subscriber can be performed in the corresponding network. Thus, the term roaming is not linked to a specific network standard, but rather to the type of subscriber entry in the home subscriber register of the mobile radio network. If a subscriber can use their personal service profile, which they use in the home network, in the <b>visited</b> <b>network</b> as well, this is also referred to as Global Service Roaming Capability.|$|E
50|$|Roaming {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} mobility management procedures of all cellular networks. Roaming is defined as the ability for a cellular customer to automatically make and receive voice calls, send and receive data, or access other services, including home data services, when travelling outside the geographical coverage area of the home network, by means of using a <b>visited</b> <b>network.</b> This can be done by using a communication terminal or else just by using the subscriber identity in the <b>visited</b> <b>network.</b> Roaming is technically supported by a mobility management, authentication, authorization and billing procedures.|$|E
50|$|Outdated {{subscriber}} {{information is}} a concern if the UE does not re-enter the previous <b>visiting</b> <b>network</b> after {{an extended period of}} time. To prevent out dating of the subscriber data, an age indicator is associated with the subscriber information maintained in all location registers. If the HLR deems that the age indicator in a <b>visiting</b> <b>network</b> is too old, or determines the subscriber's information has changed since the <b>visiting</b> <b>network</b> last received the information, the HLR will send the subscriber data like normal.|$|R

40|$|International roaming is a {{hot topic}} in the {{telecommunications}} industry. Many countries have witnessed a downward trend in mobile domestic prices. On the contrary, international roaming prices remained reluctant to follow the domestic trend. In Europe, the service has been regulated with price cap since 2007, and regulation is maintained for years to come. The existing literature on the economics of international roaming has focused on theoretical modelling, which assumes a uniform retail price (i. e. common across <b>visited</b> <b>networks).</b> The main finding is that wholesale and retail prices rise {{with the number of}} <b>visited</b> <b>networks.</b> Additionally, vertical merger is found unprofitable; and home network steering does not cause downward pressure on wholesale prices. We found that the assumption of uniform retail pricing leads to results that are inconsistent with wholesale competition because <b>visited</b> <b>networks</b> appear in the demand as complements rather than substitutes. We present theoretical models that match the existing literature’s findings, and compare results to the case whereby the retail price is discriminatory (i. e. differs by <b>visited</b> <b>networks).</b> With discriminatory retail, substitutability of networks reduces prices, and the incentive for vertical merger exists. In a steering game, steering is found able to reduce wholesale prices; and networks alliances are formed in equilibrium. The empirical literature on international roaming is limited to few industry studies. We use an aggregated dataset on prices and quantities for <b>networks</b> <b>visited</b> by roamers from one major mobile provider whose subscribers travel a lot across the world, Etisalat. The study period witnessed a retail price shift from discriminatory to uniform. The main findings are: (1) competition, as measured by the number of <b>visited</b> <b>networks,</b> reduces wholesale price; (2) traffic steering is effective, especially towards preferred networks (alliance and cross-owned); (3) only alliance networks offer wholesale discounts; and (4) demand is more elastic than crude industry studies...|$|R

40|$|In {{a set of}} {{distributed}} wireless networks, such as globally distributed cellular systems, different networks {{could be}} administered by different operators. Mobile devices subscribed to one network may need to access networks administered by some other operators. An anonymous authentication protocol allows a roaming mobile device to anonymously authenticate itself to a <b>visiting</b> <b>network</b> {{in such a way}} that eavesdroppers in the <b>visiting</b> <b>network</b> and operators of other networks can only tell to which network the mobile device is subscribed but cannot tell the identity of the mobile device. The protocol is useful for protecting the privacy of the roaming mobile device. In this paper, we review two anonymous authentication protocols and point out some weaknesses and flaws of them. We show that these protocols are vulnerable to some practical attacks and the anonymity of a roaming mobile device could be compromised. ...|$|R
40|$|Even {{though the}} PMIP {{provides}} mobility solutions, {{there are many}} issues of user identity, mobility context of users from a home <b>network</b> to the <b>visiting</b> <b>network,</b> the assignment of home address to a user terminal in a <b>visiting</b> <b>network,</b> identification of the user terminal’s mobility, and identification of MPA and HA. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism with proxy mobile IPv 4, as a mobility solution in networks. In this mechanism during mobile node access authentication, MPA exchanges registration messages with the HA (Home Agent) {{to set up a}} suitable routing and tunneling for packets from/to the MN. In this method, the authentication request of the mobile node is passed through the NAS or AP of <b>visiting</b> <b>network,</b> this is then passed to the AAA (Authentication Authorization and Accounting) server, and the authentication server checks the realm and does start authentication procedure at the time of initialing authorizing module of the mobile terminal. It also initiates the mobility extension module, where the AAA server initiates MPA of the access network, which also informs the AAA server of the home network with information on the mobility extensions and request of the mobility parameters of the user terminal. The home AAA server interacts with the HA and collects mobile node parameters, as well as sending back details as a reply request to the visiting AAA server. After the mobility context transfer, the MPA conducts a mobility registration to the HA for that particular mobile node. Later in this paper, we will provide sequence of message exchanges during a mobility session of a user mobile node during handover...|$|R

40|$|Navigating {{security}} and privacy challenges {{is one of}} the crucial requirements in the vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) network. Since electric vehicles (EVs) need to provide their private information to aggregators/servers when charging/discharging at different charging stations, privacy of the vehicle owners can be compromised if the information is misused, traced, or revealed. In a wide V 2 G network, where vehicles can move outside of their home <b>network</b> to <b>visiting</b> <b>networks,</b> {{security and}} privacy become even more challenging due to untrusted entities in the <b>visiting</b> <b>networks.</b> Although some privacy-preserving solutions were proposed in the literature to tackle this problem, they do not protect against well-known security attacks and generate a huge overhead. Therefore, we propose a mutual authentication scheme to preserve privacy of the EV's information from aggregators/servers in the home as well as distributed visiting V 2 G networks. Our scheme, based on a bilinear pairing technique with an accumulator performing batch verification, yields higher system efficiency, defeats various security attacks, and maintains untraceability, forward privacy, and identity anonymity. A performance analysis shows that our scheme, in comparison with the existing solutions, significantly generates lower communication and computation overheads in the home and centralized V 2 G networks, and comparable overheads in the distributed visiting V 2 G networks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{increased}} demand in ubiquitous high speed wireless access has led integration of different wireless technologies provided by different administrative domains creating truly a heterogeneous network. Security {{is one of}} the major hurdles in such network environment. As a mobile station moves in and out of the coverage area of one wireless network to another, it needs to be authenticated. The existing protocols for authentication of a mobile station are typically centralized, where the home network participates in each authentication process. It requires home network to maintain roaming agreement with all other <b>visiting</b> <b>networks.</b> Moreover, the round trip time to home network results high latency. This paper is focused on developing authentication protocol for wireless network irrespective of the technologies or the administrative domain. We propose a secure protocol which adopts strong features of Kerberos based on tickets for rigorous mutual authentication and session key establishment along with issuance of token so that the mobile station can have access to not only the roaming partner of home network but also to the roaming partner of previous <b>visited</b> <b>networks.</b> The performance evaluation and comparative analysis of the proposed protocol is carried out with the already implemented standard protocols and most remarkable research works till date to confirm the solidity of the results presented...|$|R

This {{is because}} USSD services are well available in roaming networks {{and all the}} USSD messages are directed towards the subscriber's Home Network itself, thus, same set of services that are available in home network can be given in <b>visited</b> <b>network</b> too, giving subscribers a Virtual Home Environment (VHE).|$|E
5000|$|A Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is a SIP proxy that is {{the first}} point of contact for the IMS terminal.

The P-CSCF is at its core a specialized SBC for the User-network interface which not only protects the network, but also the IMS terminal. The use of an additional SBC between the IMS terminal and the P-CSCF is unnecessary and infeasible due to the signaling being encrypted on this leg. The terminal discovers its P-CSCF with either DHCP, or it may be configured (e.g. during initial provisioning or via a 3GPP IMS Management Object (MO)) or in the ISIM or assigned in the PDP Context (in General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)).|$|E
