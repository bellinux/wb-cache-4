There are three broad categories of causes: heart or blood vessel related, reflex {{also known as}} neurally mediated, and orthostatic hypotension.

Heart related causes may include an abnormal heart rhythm, problems with the heart valves or heart muscle and blockages of blood vessels from a pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection among others. Neurally mediated syncope occurs when blood <b>vessels</b> <b>expand</b> and heart rate decreases inappropriately. This may occur from either a triggering event such as exposure to blood, pain, strong feelings or a specific activity such as urination, vomiting, or coughing.

40|$|SUMMARY: Flow imaging with cardiac-gated phase-contrast MR has {{applications}} {{in the management of}} neurologic disorders. Together with computational fluid dynamics, phase-contrast MR has advanced our understanding of spinal CSF flow. Phase-contrast MR is used to evaluate patients with Chiari I malformation who are candidates for surgical treatment. In theory, abnormal CSF flow resulting from the abnormal tonsil position causes syringomyelia and other neurologic signs and symptoms in patients with Chiari I. CSF flow imaging also has research {{applications in}} syringomyelia and spinal stenosis. To optimize MR acquisition and interpretation, neuroradiologists must have familiarity with healthy and pathologic patterns of CSF flow. The purpose of this review is to update concepts of CSF flow that are important for the practice of flow imaging in the spine. ABBREVIATION: PCMR phase-contrast MR In the spinal canal, oscillatory CSF flow results primarily fromthe displacement of approximately 1. 5 mL of fluid 1 from the cranial cavity as intracranial blood <b>vessels</b> <b>expand</b> in arterial sys-tole (Monro-Kellie doctrine).

30|$|The {{risks of}} laparoscopic surgery {{can be divided}} into entry related complications, those that occur during the {{operation}} and those occurring post-operatively. New technologies such as the Endo tip device (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) allows direct inspection via the laparoscope of the various layers of the anterior abdominal wall, thereby theoretically reducing the risk of type 1 and type 2 a injuries [10]. The ‘STEP’ radially <b>expanding</b> <b>device</b> (Innerdyne, Salt Lake City, Utah USA) also avoids the use of sharp trocars. It is thought that in certain circumstances, some 2 a adhesions may be pushed out of the way by the blunt ended dilator rather than penetrated [11]. Alternative approaches have been used with the optical verres system, whereby the use of micro-laparoscopes inserted down the verres needle may theoretically reduce the risk of inadvertent trauma [12]. There are, however, no randomised controlled trials, using any of these trocars, in a large series to prospectively back this new technology up. Even with disposable shielded trocars, the evidence for their use is scanty [13].|$|R
