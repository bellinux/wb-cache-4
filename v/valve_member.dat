50|$|Ports are {{passages}} that allow fluid {{to pass through}} the valve. Ports are obstructed by the <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> or disc to control flow. Valves most commonly have 2 ports, but may have as many as 20. The valve is almost always connected at its ports to pipes or other components. Connection methods include threadings, compression fittings, glue, cement, flanges, or welding.|$|E
50|$|A disc or <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> is a movable {{obstruction}} {{inside the}} stationary body that adjustably restricts {{flow through the}} valve. Although traditionally disc-shaped, discs come in various shapes. Depending {{on the type of}} valve, a disc can move linearly inside a valve, or rotate on the stem (as in a butterfly valve), or rotate on a hinge or trunnion (as in a check valve). A ball is a round <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> with one or more paths between ports passing through it. By rotating the ball, flow can be directed between different ports. Ball valves use spherical rotors with a cylindrical hole drilled as a fluid passage. Plug valves use cylindrical or conically tapered rotors called plugs. Other round shapes for rotors are possible as well in rotor valves, as long as the rotor can be turned inside the valve body. However, not all round or spherical discs are rotors; for example, a ball check valve uses the ball to block reverse flow, but is not a rotor because operating the valve does not involve rotation of the ball.|$|E
40|$|A valve {{apparatus}} {{capable of}} maintaining a fluid-tight seal over a relatively {{long period of time}} by releasably bonding a <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> to its seat is described. The <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> is bonded or welded to the seat and then released by the application of the same energy to the bond joint. The <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> is held in place during the bonding by a clamping device. An appropriate force device can activate the opening and closing of the <b>valve</b> <b>member.</b> Various combinations of material for the <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> and valve seat can be utilized to provide an adequate sealing bond. Aluminum oxide, stainless steel, inconel, tungsten carbide as hard materials and copper, aluminum, titanium, silver, and gold as soft materials are suggested...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the storage tanks for {{petroleum}} products. The introductory part {{is devoted to the}} distribution of the storage tanks, associated standards and maintenance of tanks. Another part goes about the analysis of real case of a tank collapse. There was created a 3 D model of the collapsed tank according to the measured values in the tank. It was created a tank shell model by drawing documentation and analysis {{of the results of the}} accident investigation using the finite element method (FEM) by program ANSYS. Calculation was performed on the buckling resistance of the structure according to ČSN EN 1993 - 1 - 6 and its comparison with the results of FEM analysis in ANSYS. The aim of the study was to find the critical condition of the structure and determination of the critical internal underpressure and overpressure.

RECENT FINDINGS: 3 D echocardiography provides key information, aetiology, degenerative mitral valve disease vs. secondary MR, causes and mechanism, severity by measurements of effective regurgitant orifice area and regurgitant volume; likelihood of reparability and assessment of pre- and intra-mitral valve transcatheter procedures. 3 D echocardiography as a promising method for assessment of MR is useful and crucial for research, clinical practice and patient management in all heart <b>valve</b> team <b>members.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{control valve}} {{includes}} a body defining a central cavity arranged between a fluid inlet and outwardly-diverging {{first and second}} fluid outlets respectively disposed in a common transverse plane. A <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> is arranged in the cavity for rotation between first and second operating positions where a transverse fluid passage through the <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> alternatively communicates the fluid inlet with {{one or the other}} of the fluid outlets. To minimize fluid turbulence when the <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> is rotated to an alternate operating position, the fluid passage has a convergent entrance for maintaining the passage in permanent communication with the fluid inlet as well as an oblong exit opening with spaced side walls for enabling the exit opening to temporarily span the first and second fluid outlets as the <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> is turned between its respective operating positions...|$|E

50|$|A {{large part}} of the Finnish fleet were vessels {{inherited}} from the Imperial Russian Navy and in the early 1930s the Navy was strengthened by five submarines and two Väinämöinen-class coastal defence ships; the decision about purchasing the two heavily armed floating fortresses was made without listening to Väinö Valve. After this, the Navy got just a narrow slice of the annual budget of national defence. The head of the Defence Committee, Field Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim was not familiar with naval warfare. The situation changed in 1938 when <b>Valve</b> became <b>member</b> in the committee; new plans for the Navy development were in place in 1939, but they could not be executed before outbreak of the Winter War.|$|R

40|$|A {{device for}} {{controlling}} flow of fluid {{to and from}} a resilient inflatable cuff implanted about the urethra to control flow of urine therethrough. The device comprises a flexible bulb reservoir {{and a control unit}} that includes a manually operated valve that opens automatically when the bulb is squeezed to force fluid into the cuff for closing the urethra. The control unit also includes a movable valve seat member having a relatively large area exposed to pressure of fluid in a chamber that is connected to the cuff and which moves to a position in which the <b>valve</b> <b>member</b> is unseated by an abutment when fluid pressure in the chamber exceeds a predetermined value to thereby relieve excess fluid pressure in the cuff. The arrangement is such that the valve element is held closed against the seat member by the full differential in fluid pressures acting {{on both sides of the}} valve element until the seat member is moved away from the valve element to thus insure positive closing of the valve element until the seat member is moved out of engagement with the valve element by excess pressure differential...|$|E
5000|$|By this point, Imperial {{knew they}} had hit upon a strike. The company pressed Hunter to name a date when the well could come in. He later stated: [...] "The crew and I were experts at abandoning wells but we didn't know much about {{completing}} them. I named February 13 and started praying." [...] Imperial invited the public to witness as the well came in. However, the machinery broke down on that morning. The crew worked {{most of the day}} trying to fix the machinery, while some of guests began to leave, fearing another disappointment. Shortly before 4 p.m., the crew finally cleared the wellhead and the 500 people who remained despite the bitter cold bore witness Leduc No. 1 came to life. [...] People felt a rumbling in the ground, while roughnecks opened release <b>valves.</b> The youngest <b>member</b> of the crew was given the honour of [...] "flaring" [...] the well.

50|$|Toyota {{introduced}} its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an intermediate shaft to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The intermediate shaft has an actuating member for each cylinder. Each actuating member {{is made of}} two finger followers {{on either side of}} a roller bearing member. The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached {{to the end of the}} intermediate shaft. The gear threads of the roller member and finger followers are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the roller member and finger followers will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the intermediate shaft. Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of intermediate shaft, transferring the movement to both finger followers, then towards the roller rocker arms and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the finger followers is narrow with respect to the roller <b>member,</b> <b>valve</b> lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the finger followers in relation to the roller bearing member.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Myxomatous {{mitral valve}} {{is one of}} the most common heart valves {{diseases}} in human and has been well characterized at a functional and morphological level. Diseased valves are thickened as a result of extracellular matrix remodeling and proteoglycans accumulation accompanied by the disruption of the stratified structures of the leaflets. METHODS: Global transcriptomic analysis was used as a start-up to investigate potential pathogenic mechanisms involved in the development of the human idiopathic myxomatous mitral valve, which have been elusive for many years. RESULTS: These prospective analyses have highlighted the potential role of apparently unrelated molecules in myxomatous mitral <b>valve</b> such as <b>members</b> of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, aggrecanases of the "a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin repeats I" family, and a weakening of the protection against oxidative stress. We have integrated, in this review, recent transcriptomic data from our laboratory [A. Hulin, C. F. Deroanne, C. A. Lambert, B. Dumont, V. Castronovo, J. O. Defraigne, et al. Metallothionein-dependent up-regulation of TGF-beta 2 participates in the remodelling of the myxomatous mitral valve. Cardiovasc Res 2012; 93 : 480 - 489] and from the publication of Sainger et al. [R. Sainger, J. B. Grau, E. Branchetti, P. Poggio, W. F. Seefried, B. C. Field, et al.

J Cell Physiol 2012; 227 : 2595 - 2604] with existing literature and information issued from the study of monogenic syndromes and animal models. CONCLUSION: Understanding cellular alterations and molecular mechanisms involved in myxomatous mitral valve should help at identifying relevant targets for future effective pharmacological therapy to prevent or reduce its progression.
