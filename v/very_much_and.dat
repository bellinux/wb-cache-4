5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E

He has aged <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> has {{the look of a}} man who is going through torture... Seemingly anything is law in regard to John. I hope you will make the atrocity public. We must get him out of their clutches. It is nothing but slow murder...|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, the Central School of Speech and Drama {{announced}} that Pinter {{had agreed to}} become its president and awarded him an honorary fellowship at its graduation ceremony. On his appointment, Pinter commented: [...] "I {{was a student at}} Central in 1950–51. I enjoyed my time there <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> I am delighted to become president of a remarkable institution." [...] But he had to receive that honorary degree, his 20th, in absentia owing to ill health. [...] His presidency of the school was brief; he died just two weeks after the graduation ceremony, on 24 December 2008.|$|E

500|$|Åkerman {{attended}} {{many different}} schools, including Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario. She once attended a Catholic school, {{though she was}} raised as a Buddhist. She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> I only got to see him during the school holidays. But I {{think it was an}} advantage that they split up when I was very young, so I could get used to it." [...] She visited her father in Falsterbo, Sweden, during school breaks and talked to him regularly over the phone. She cites her parents as [...] "supportive, positive influences" [...] in her life.|$|E

500|$|At the 2014 Brit Awards on 19 February, Bowie {{became the}} oldest {{recipient}} of a Brit Award in the ceremony's history {{when he won the}} award for Best British Male, which was collected on his behalf by Kate Moss. His speech read: [...] "I'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male – but I am, aren't I Kate? Yes. I think it's a great way to end the day. Thank you very, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> Scotland stay with us." [...] Bowie's reference to the forthcoming September 2014 Scottish independence referendum garnered a significant reaction throughout the UK on social media. On 18 July, Bowie indicated that future music would be forthcoming, though he was vague about details.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America, author and scholar of {{religion}} J. Gordon Melton cites Inchon {{as an example}} when noting, [...] "Moon has attempted to project his ideas into all areas of American society." [...] Moon later said in a talk to church members: [...] "Why did we put so much effort into the movie Inchon? No matter what the result the motivation was {{for people to understand}} about MacArthur. I wanted to show how MacArthur loved God and loved people. MacArthur came to Japan after World War II and put the nation back together. He really respected and loved the people. He also loved God <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> fought with great strength against tyranny and communism. That is what I want the people to understand." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{criticism}} {{following the}} arrival of the French New Wave, career retrospectives of Clouzot's work have been positive. Twenty years after his death, film critic Noël Herpe wrote in the French film journal Positif that [...] "Les Diaboliques (just like Les Espions and La Verite) reveals a sterile and increasingly exaggerated urge to experiment with the powers of fiction". Film historian Philipe Pilard wrote, [...] "There is no doubt that if Clouzot had worked for Hollywood and applied the formulas of U.S. studios, today he would be lauded by the very critics who choose to ignore him". Clouzot today is generally known for his thriller films The Wages of Fear and Diabolique. Clouzot's ability in the genre led to comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock. Clouzot respected Hitchcock's work, stating, [...] "I admire him <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> am flattered when anyone compares a film of mine to his".|$|E

500|$|The {{investigation}} {{opened in}} London on 14 July 1307. The first {{three of the}} nine witnesses to Cragh's hanging to be heard were Lady Mary de Briouze, William Codineston, and the younger William de Briouze; his father had died in 1291. The commissioners were naturally curious {{about the details of}} the execution, because if Cragh had not actually been killed then there could clearly have been no miracle. William de Briouze was in no doubt that the hanging had been properly conducted, and pointed out it was customary that [...] "if any subterfuge or trickery were discovered... then the executioner himself would be hanged in turn". He added that any deception could be ruled out because of the hatred that he and his father had for Cragh, whom he described as [...] "the worst of malefactors". The same point was made by William of Codineston: [...] "the lord de Briouze and his justices, officials, and servants hated William Cragh <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> rejoiced greatly at his hanging and death".|$|E
500|$|Victoria's {{husband died}} in London in September 1921. After meeting {{her at the}} Naval and Military Club in Piccadilly, he complained of feeling unwell and Victoria persuaded him to rest in a room they had booked in the club annexe. She called a doctor, who {{prescribed}} some medicine and Victoria went out to fill the prescription at a nearby pharmacist's. When she came back, Louis was dead. On her widowhood, Victoria moved into a grace-and-favour residence at Kensington Palace and, {{in the words of}} her biographer, [...] "became a central matriarchal figure in the lives of Europe's surviving royalty". In 1930, her eldest daughter, Alice, suffered a nervous breakdown and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. In the following decade Victoria was largely responsible for her grandson Philip's education and upbringing during his parents' separation and his mother's institutionalisation. Prince Philip recalled, [...] "I liked my grandmother <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> she was always helpful. She was very good with children... she took the practical approach to them. She treated them in the right way—the right combination of the rational and the emotional." ...|$|E
500|$|Carla Alcorn {{responded to}} such {{criticism}} {{in an interview}} with CNN, stating [...] "we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy." [...] Although acknowledging that Leelah had requested transition surgery, Carla stated that she had never heard her child use the name [...] "Leelah", before reiterating her refusal to accept her child's transgender status, adding [...] "We don't support that, religiously." [...] She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a [...] "horrible person", but defended her actions in dealing with her child, stating for example that she had banned internet access to prevent access to [...] "inappropriate" [...] things. In an email to Cincinnati-based channel WCPO-TV, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, [...] "We love our son, Joshua, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> are devastated by his death. We have no desire to enter into a political storm or debate with people who did not know him. We wish to grieve in private. We harbor no ill will towards anyone. ... I simply do not wish our words to be used against us." ...|$|E

500|$|The idea of abdicating and {{returning}} to Portugal took root in his mind, and, beginning in early 1829, he talked about it frequently. An opportunity soon appeared to act upon the notion. Radicals within the Liberal Party rallied street gangs to harass the Portuguese community in Rio de Janeiro. On 11 March 1831, in {{what became known as}} the [...] "noite das garrafadas" [...] (night of the broken bottles), the Portuguese retaliated and turmoil gripped the streets of the national capital. On 5 April, PedroI fired the Liberal cabinet, which had only been in power since 19 March, for its incompetence in restoring order. A large crowd, incited by the radicals, gathered in Rio de Janeiro downtown on the afternoon of 6 April and demanded the immediate restoration of the fallen cabinet. The Emperor's reply was: [...] "I will do everything for the people and nothing [...] by the people." [...] Sometime after nightfall, army troops, including his guard, deserted him and joined the protests. Only then did he realize how isolated and detached from Brazilian affairs he had become, and to everyone's surprise, he abdicated at approximately 03:00 on 7 April. Upon delivering the abdication document to a messenger, he said: [...] "Here you have my act of abdication, I'm returning to Europe and leaving a country that I loved <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> <b>and</b> still love." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode, the {{character}} of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> <b>And</b> the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that we feel like we succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Michael Lange {{said that}} he [...] "liked the script <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> <b>and</b> I think I stayed fairly close to the {{original}} draft. I liked it because it had a good spookiness to it. To me, the intriguing part was the doctor's research into being able to reverse the aging process, which I wish we could have explored more." [...] Executive Producer Robert Goodwin considered the episode {{one of the most}} emotional episodes of the first season, due to the time spent working with Courtney Arciaga, the little girl with progeria. In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a C, being called [...] "far-fetched" [...] and criticised for its unoriginal themes. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "sloppy, poorly edited" [...] and [...] "thoroughly unexciting", pointing out the [...] "forced" [...] nature of the supporting characters' past involvement with Fox Mulder. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, expressed mixed feelings over the episode, comparing it to Quincy, M.E. and stating that it [...] "just wasn't weird enough" [...] for an episode of The X-Files. [...] "Young at Heart" [...] has been cited, along with the fourth season episode [...] "Paper Hearts", as representing [...] "the supreme irony and the hidden agenda of the series"—in both cases, Mulder, directly through his work on the X-Files, puts information permanently beyond reach by killing those who hold it, showing that [...] "despite the fact that Mulder drives the car, he frequently ends up—and goes—nowhere".|$|E
