5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a <b>vector</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of such a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> on TM {{is analogous to the}} canonical one-form on the cotangent bundle. Sometimes V is also called the Liouville <b>vector</b> <b>field,</b> or radial <b>vector</b> <b>field.</b> Using V one can characterize the tangent bundle. Essentially, V can be characterized using 4 axioms, and if a manifold has a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> satisfying these axioms, then the manifold is a tangent bundle and the <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> is the canonical <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> on it. See for example, De León et al.|$|E
25|$|For angular {{velocity}} tensor maps velocities to positions, it is a <b>vector</b> <b>field.</b> In particular, this <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> is a Killing <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> belonging to {{an element of}} the Lie algebra so(3) of the 3-dimensional rotation group SO(3). This element of so(3) can also be regarded as the {{angular velocity}} vector.|$|E
5000|$|For this reason, such <b>vector</b> <b>fields</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as curl-free <b>vector</b> <b>fields</b> or curl-less <b>vector</b> <b>fields.</b> They are also referred to as [...] longitudinal <b>vector</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{short report}} {{establishes}} some basic properties of smooth <b>vector</b> <b>fields</b> on product manifolds. The main results are: (i) On a product manifold there always exists a direct sum decomposition into {{horizontal and vertical}} <b>vector</b> <b>fields.</b> (ii) Horizontal and vertical <b>vector</b> <b>fields</b> are naturally isomorphic to smooth families of <b>vector</b> <b>fields</b> defined on the factors. <b>Vector</b> <b>fields</b> are regarded as derivations of the algebra of smooth functions...|$|R
25|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{geometric}} algebra, vector calculus implicitly identifies k-vector fields with vector fields or scalar functions: 0-vectors and 3-vectors with scalars, 1-vectors and 2-vectors with vectors. From {{the point of}} view of differential forms, vector calculus implicitly identifies k-forms with scalar fields or vector fields: 0-forms and 3-forms with scalar fields, 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields. Thus for example the curl naturally takes as input a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> or 1-form, but naturally has as output a 2-vector field or 2-form (hence pseudovector field), which is then interpreted as a <b>vector</b> <b>field,</b> rather than directly taking a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> to a vector field; this is reflected in the curl of a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> in higher dimensions not having as output a <b>vector</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{section of}} φ∗TN over M {{is called a}} <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> along φ. For example, if M is a submanifold of N and φ is the {{inclusion}}, then a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> along φ is just {{a section of the}} tangent bundle of N along M; in particular, a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> on M defines such a section via the inclusion of TM inside TN. This idea generalizes to arbitrary smooth maps.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of the curl is the axis of rotation, {{as determined by the}} right-hand rule, and the magnitude of the curl is the magnitude of rotation. If the <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> represents the flow velocity of a moving fluid, then the curl is the circulation density of the fluid. A <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> whose curl is zero is called irrotational. The curl is a form of differentiation for vector fields. The corresponding form of the fundamental theorem of calculus is Stokes' theorem, which relates the surface integral of the curl of a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> to the line integral of the <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> around the boundary curve.|$|E
50|$|Some modern {{techniques}} in analysing spacetimes {{rely heavily on}} using spacetime symmetries, which are infinitesimally generated by <b>vector</b> <b>fields</b> (usually defined locally) on a spacetime that preserve some feature of the spacetime. The {{most common type of}} such symmetry <b>vector</b> <b>fields</b> include Killing <b>vector</b> <b>fields</b> (which preserve the metric structure) and their generalisations called generalised Killing <b>vector</b> <b>fields.</b> Symmetry <b>vector</b> <b>fields</b> find extensive application in the study of exact solutions in general relativity and the set of all such <b>vector</b> <b>fields</b> usually forms a finite-dimensional Lie algebra.|$|R

25|$|A <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> on a {{manifold}} M can {{be defined}} as a function that inputs a point p of M and outputs an element of the tangent space of M at p. Equivalently, a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> is a section of the tangent bundle of M. In the case where M is a Euclidean space, this definition is equivalent to saying that a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> is a function that inputs points and outputs vectors.|$|E
25|$|Suppose that X is a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> on M, i.e., {{a section}} of TM. Then, {{applying}} the differential pointwise to X yields the pushforward φ∗X, which is a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> along φ, i.e., {{a section of}} φ∗TN over M.|$|E
25|$|Another {{definition}} {{is that a}} <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> on a manifold M is a derivation of degree zero on the algebra of smooth functions on M. This {{definition is}} usually motivated {{in terms of the}} first definition: if X is a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> according to the first definition, then the map sending a smooth function f to its derivative with respect to X is a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> according to the second definition. Although it is less intuitively clear than the first definition, the second definition has the advantage that it often easier to work with. In particular, it is much simpler to define the directional derivative of a function using this definition: the directional derivative of f with respect to the <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> X is simply the value X(f) that results from inputting f into X.|$|E

25|$|Now, if we're given a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> Y over M (but not the {{principal}} bundle) {{but we also}} have a connection over {{the principal}} bundle, we can define a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> X over the principal bundle such that its horizontal component matches Y and its vertical component agrees with the connection.

25|$|Once the tangent {{spaces of}} a {{manifold}} have been introduced, one can define vector fields, which are abstractions of the velocity field of particles moving in space. A <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> attaches to every {{point of the}} manifold a vector from the tangent space at that point, in a smooth manner. Such a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> serves to define a generalized ordinary differential equation on a manifold: A solution to such a differential equation is a differentiable curve on the manifold whose derivative at any point {{is equal to the}} tangent vector attached to that point by the <b>vector</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|A local <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> on M is a {{local section}} of the tangent bundle.

25|$|A {{more general}} {{situation}} arises when φ is surjective (for example the bundle projection of a fiber bundle). Then a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> X on M {{is said to}} be projectable if for all y in N, dφ'x(Xx) is independent of the choice of x in φ−1({y}).

25|$|In more {{advanced}} treatments, one further distinguishes pseudovector fields and pseudoscalar fields, which are identical to vector fields and scalar fields {{except that they}} change sign under an orientation-reversing map: for example, the curl of a <b>vector</b> <b>field</b> is a pseudovector field, and if one reflects a <b>vector</b> <b>field,</b> the curl points in the opposite direction.
