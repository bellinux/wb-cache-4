5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a <b>very</b> <b>fair</b> and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.|$|E

500|$|Mary was a {{precocious}} child. In July 1520, when scarcely {{four and}} a half years old, she entertained a visiting French delegation with a performance on the virginals (a type of harpsichord). A great part of her early education came from her mother, who consulted the Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives for advice and commissioned him to write De Institutione Feminae Christianae, a treatise on the education of girls. By the age of nine, Mary could read and write Latin. She studied French, Spanish, music, dance, and perhaps Greek. Henry VIII doted on his daughter and boasted to the Venetian ambassador Sebastian Giustiniani, [...] "This girl never cries". Also, as the miniature portrait of her shows, Mary had, like both her parents, a <b>very</b> <b>fair</b> complexion, pale blue eyes and red or reddish-golden hair. She was also ruddy cheeked, a trait she inherited from her father.|$|E

500|$|With {{the arrival}} of the mounted police, the whiskey trade around Fort Macleod collapsed, and the traders shifted into {{legitimate}} projects or moved elsewhere. The Blackfoot welcomed {{the arrival of}} the police and their leader, Crowfoot, promoted a policy of co-operation. After enduring a difficult winter with only limited supplies, the force broke up their main command, some remaining at Fort Macleod, with others establishing forts at Dufferin, Swan River, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Ellice, with Walsh and Calgary following soon after. Macdonald's newly returned Conservative government was critical of the way that the Liberals had stood up the force, ordering an inspection in 1875 that concluded that [...] "for a newly-raised force, hastily enrolled and equipped, it is in <b>very</b> <b>fair</b> order", but recommended a variety of improvements, including {{to the quality of the}} commissioned officers. Commissioner French was forced to resign the following year, and was replaced by James Macleod.|$|E

According to Gilliland, [...] "They threw a curveball at us this morning with the restrictor plate and (engine builder) Doug Yates wasn't worried at all. He put the super-tune on it and the thing ran great." [...] Earnhardt called the reduction in speed unnecessary: [...] "The track is safe... I don't feel (the late change in plate size) is a <b>very</b> <b>fair</b> situation for everybody. Once you're up around the 190s, what's two miles an hour? I don't see what the big deal is. The speed average is up because the corner speed remains better with the new asphalt. As far as running in a straight line, we're no faster than we've always run here." [...] Despite the mandated change, NASCAR did not schedule an additional practice session.|$|E

[...] Craig Young {{reviewed the}} book for GayNZ.com, and called Behind the Exclusive Brethren a [...] "comprehensive reference work on the sect", and a [...] "most incisive book". In her review of the book for Media/Culture Reviews, Sandra Hogan wrote, [...] "Bachelard has done his research very thoroughly. He has interviewed {{both sides of the}} story: people who left the Exclusive Brethren or were expelled from them and also, as much as possible, the current leaders of the group. He has witnessed Brethren documentation, and has spoken to politicians from major and minor parties as well as to lawyers and judges. The expose is written in a calm, clear style and the chapters relating to the broken families are deeply moving and respectful." ...|$|E

I saw Alan within a few hours of his death. He faced the last enemy with the same joyous confidence with which he started on what he called the very happiest part of his life.

Tyack said that [...] "the carved wooden panelling of the main rooms [...] a new standard of luxury for the heads of colleges". Pevsner commented that the panelling, set in three tiers with ovals placed vertically rather than horizontally, [...] "looks both dignified and splendid". In 1637, the lodgings were considerably changed with the installation of five [...] "studyes". The shell-hood over the doorway (which Pevsner and Casson both called [...] "beautiful") was added at some point between 1670 and 1740; Pevsner dates it to about 1700. It is elaborately carved on the inside with a decorated cartouche and a cherub-head. Casson called it the college's [...] "most engaging" [...] feature.
