All subjects performed a multistage maximal upright exercise with measurements of maximal oxygen consumption and heart rate; left ventricular ejection fraction and absolute <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> were measured at rest and during submaximal and maximal exercise using equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography. At rest, no effect of age or sex on any parameter was observed. At peak exercise, an age-related increase in mean blood pressure, end-diastolic and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>indexes,</b> and decrease in ejection fraction, cardiac index, heart rate and oxygen consumption were noticed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Left {{ventricular}} dilation after acute {{myocardial infarction}} (MI) is mainly determined by infarct size. In addition, this detrimental structural adaptation seems to be augmented in patients with the ACE DD genotype. The ACE DD genotype is associated with increased ACE activity. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate whether ACE activity per se may carry prognostic significance for subsequent left ventricular dilation as assessed by echocardiography during 1 -year follow-up after acute MI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> were assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography. In 102 consecutive patients, plasma ACE activity was determined 3. 7 +/- 0. 1 hours after the onset of MI. In 64 of these patients, left ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> obtained at baseline and 1 year after MI were used for the present analysis. Patients were divided ino a group having low ACE activity (12 IU/L, n = 49). Infarct size was a significant predictor of the increase in left ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> (P =. 0001) in these patients. Multivariate regression analysis, after correction for infarct size, demonstrated that elevated plasma ACE activity is a significant predictor of the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> (P =. 0006 and P =. 02, respectively) 1 year after MI.

25|$|BMI is {{particularly}} inaccurate {{for people who}} are very fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify them in the overweight category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 10–15% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a normal BMI number. Body composition for athletes is often better calculated using measures of body fat, as determined by such techniques as skinfold measurements or underwater weighing and the limitations of manual measurement have also led to new, alternative methods to measure obesity, such as the body <b>volume</b> <b>index.</b>|$|E

2500|$|An {{excess of}} visceral fat {{is known as}} central obesity, or [...] "belly fat", in which the abdomen {{protrudes}} excessively.

Excess visceral fat is also linked to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammatory diseases, and other obesity-related diseases.

Several studies have suggested that visceral fat can be predicted from simple anthropometic measures, and predicts mortality more accurately than body mass index or waist circumference.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess how}} a surgical correction of funnel chest modifies right ventricular structure and function. Methods: Before and 6 months after surgery in 42 patients (27 male and 15 female patients, aged 5 - 31 years), a pectus index was calculated and echocardiographic examinations of the right ventricle were performed, with calculation of systolic, diastolic, and stroke <b>volume</b> <b>indices.</b> Right ventricular <b>volume</b> was estimated by subtracting the left ventricular volume {{from that of the}} entire heart. The values of the right ventricular volumes and the pectus index before and after the operation, as well as the changes in the indices, were compared. Results: Statistically significant changes in the pectus index and the right ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>indices</b> after surgery were noted. No correlation was observed between the changes in the pectus index and the changes in any right ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>indices.</b> Conclusion: Surgical treatment of funnel chest causes an increase in right ventricular systolic, diastolic, and stroke volumes, although there is no correlation between these changes and the degree of sternocostal elevation.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough {{vascular}} endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) is elevated {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the clinical significance of its elevation remains unclear. The present {{study was designed to}} determine the relationship between VEGF and left ventricular dimension in patients with AMI. Methods and resultsPlasma VEGF levels were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay daily for one week and then weekly for four weeks in 38 patients with AMI (65. 4 ± 1. 7 years). Left ventriculography was performed at 14 days, 6 months, and 2 years after the onset of AMI. Plasma VEGF levels were significantly elevated and reached a peak on day 6. Peak plasma VEGF levels positively correlated with both end-diastolic and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>indices</b> at 14 days after the onset of AMI. When patients with AMI were divided into two groups according to plasma VEGF levels on admission, left ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>indices</b> were higher in the high VEGF group than in the low VEGF group at the subacute phase of AMI (14 days). These differences were no longer present in the chronic phase of AMI. ConclusionPlasma VEGF levels were increased in patients with AMI, and peak levels were associated with left ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>indices</b> in the subacute phase, suggesting an important role of endogenous VEGF in the left ventricular dimension in patients with AMI...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{strains of}} capsular type II Staphylococcus epidermidis, {{determined}} by the method of Ichiman, were obtained from clinical specimens. Among them, 5, 5, and 10 strains were 4 +, 3 +, and 2 + in the intensities of their reactions against fluorescent antibody, respectively. Strains exhibiting 4 + and 3 + intensities were mouse virulent and phage nontypable, while 2 + strains were mouse avirulent and phage typable. When three strains randomly selected {{from each of the}} mouse-virulent and mouse-avirulent strains were compared in terms of their cell <b>volume</b> <b>indices,</b> all mouse-virulent strains had significantly higher indices (average, 1. 86 times) than the mouse-avirulent strains. With intraperitoneal injection of the strains into mice, strains with higher cell <b>volume</b> <b>indices</b> resisted ingestion by peritoneal cells, while strains with low cell <b>volume</b> <b>indices</b> were sensitive to phagocytosis. When the capacity to absorb a definite amount of passive protective activity in rabbit antiserum prepared with capsular type II strains was compared among these strains, 10 to 20 mg of mouse-virulent strains was capable of completely absorbing the passive protective activity, whereas more than 80 mg of the cells was required for similar absorption by mouse-avirulent strains. In ultra-thin sections of three mouse-virulent strains stained with ferritin-conjugated rabbit antiserum, well-defined capsules were detected around cell walls; however, no capsule was seen around the walls of three mouse-avirulent strains...|$|R
