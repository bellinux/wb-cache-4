40|$|BACKGROUND: Maintenance therapy {{improves}} {{outcomes in}} various tumour types, but cumulative toxic effects limit {{the choice of}} drugs. We investigated whether maintenance therapy with <b>vinflunine</b> would delay disease progression in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who had achieved disease control with first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: We did a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 trial in 21 Spanish hospitals. Eligible patients had locally advanced, surgically unresectable, or metastatic transitional-cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract, adequate organ function, and disease control after four to six cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine (carboplatin allowed after cycle four). Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive <b>vinflunine</b> or best supportive care until disease progression. We initially used block randomisation with a block size of six. Four lists were created for the two stratification factors of starting dose of <b>vinflunine</b> and presence of liver metastases. After a protocol amendment, number of cisplatin and gemcitabine cycles was added as a stratification factor, and eight lists were created, still with a block size of six. Finally, we changed to a minimisation procedure {{to reduce the risk}} of imbalance between groups. <b>Vinflunine</b> was given every 21 days as a 20 min intravenous infusion at 320 mg/m 2 or at 280 mg/m 2 in patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1, age 75 years or older, previous pelvic radiotherapy, or creatinine clearance lower than 60 mL/min. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival longer than 5 · 3 months in the <b>vinflunine</b> group, assessed by modified intention to treat. Comparison of progression-free survival between treatment groups was a secondary endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01529411. FINDINGS: Between April 12, 2012, and Jan 29, 2015, we enrolled 88 patients, of whom 45 were assigned to receive <b>vinflunine</b> and 43 to receive best supportive care. One patient from the <b>vinflunine</b> group was lost to follow-up immediately after randomisation and was excluded from the analyses. One patient in the best supportive care group became ineligible for the study and did not receive treatment due to a delay in enrolment, but was included in the intention-to-treat efficacy analysis. After a median follow-up of 15 · 6 months (IQR 8 · 5 - 26 · 0), 29 (66 %) of 44 patients in the <b>vinflunine</b> group had disease progression and 24 (55 %) had died, compared with 36 (84 %) of 43 patients with disease progression and 32 (74 %) deaths in the best supportive care group. Median progression-free survival was 6 · 5 months (95 % CI 2 · 0 - 11 · 1) in the <b>vinflunine</b> group and 4 · 2 months (2 · 1 - 6 · 3) in the best supportive care group (hazard ratio 0 · 59, 95 % CI 0 · 37 - 0 · 96, p= 0 · 031). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (eight [18 %] of 44 in the <b>vinflunine</b> group vs none of 42 in the best supportive care group), asthenia or fatigue (seven [16 %] vs one [2 %]), and constipation (six [14 %] vs none). 18 serious adverse events were reported in the <b>vinflunine</b> group and 14 in the best supportive care group. One patient in the <b>vinflunine</b> group died from pneumonia that was deemed to be treatment related. INTERPRETATION: In patients with disease control after first-line chemotherapy, progression-free survival exceeded the acceptable threshold with <b>vinflunine</b> maintenance therapy. Moreover, progression-free survival was longer with <b>vinflunine</b> maintenance therapy than with best supportive care. <b>Vinflunine</b> maintenance had an acceptable safety profile.

40|$|<b>Vinflunine,</b> {{the most}} recent Vinca {{alkaloid}} in clinical development, demonstrated superior antitumour activity to other Vincas in preclinical tumour models. This study aimed to define its molecular mechanisms of cell killing in both parental sensitive and vinflunine-resistant P 388 leukaemia cells. <b>Vinflunine</b> treatment of these cells resulted in apoptosis characterized by DNA fragmentation and proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Apoptosis-inducing concentrations of <b>vinflunine</b> caused c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 stimulation, as well as caspases- 3 / 7 activation.

Interestingly, the apoptosis signal triggered by <b>vinflunine</b> in these P 388 cells was not mediated through Bcl- 2 phosphorylation. In addition, when <b>vinflunine</b> resistance was developed in P 388 cells, it was associated with resistance to vinflunine-induced apoptosis, as reflected by a loss of capacity to induce DNA fragmentation and PARP degradation, and characterized by increased levels of Bcl- 2 and Bfl- 1 /A 1.

40|$|Abstract Background Vinca {{alkaloids}} are {{an important}} class of anticancer agents and semisynthetic vinca alkaloids are developed to improve the therapeutic index of this class of drugs. In the present study, a direct comparison was made between <b>vinflunine</b> and vinorelbine regarding their radiosensitising and cell cycle effects. Methods Four human tumour cell lines were tested under identical experimental conditions, using equitoxic concentrations of <b>vinflunine</b> and vinorelbine. Results <b>Vinflunine</b> and vinorelbine induced a comparable radiosensitising effect (p-value never below 0. 01) when cells were incubated for 24 h immediately prior to radiation. Regarding the cell cycle effects, a statistically significant concentration-dependent G 2 /M block was seen after 24 h incubation with vinorelbine in all tested cell lines. Similar results, with small cell line-related differences, were observed with <b>vinflunine.</b> Conclusion The radiosensitising effects of both semisynthetic vinca alkaloids were comparable (not statistically different) and nearly always cell line-specific and concentration-dependent. The cell cycle effects {{could be related to}} the observed radiosensitising effects. Considering the more favourable toxicity profile of <b>vinflunine,</b> this agent might be more promising than vinorelbine for chemoradiation studies in the clinic. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: the {{efficacy}} of <b>Vinflunine,</b> after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent Transitional Cell Cancer of the Urothelial Tract, TCCU, has been demonstrated in an international, randomized, phase III trial comparing <b>Vinflunine</b> plus Best Supportive Care, BSC, with BSC alone. On {{the basis of that}} study <b>vinflunine</b> has been approved by the European Medicine Association, EMA, for treatment of TCCU patients after failure of a platinum treatment. However since data in clinical trials often differ from routine clinical practice due to unselected population and less strict monitoring, ‘real life’ experiences are very helpful to verify {{the efficacy}} of a new therapy. METHODS: this was a spontaneous, observational, retrospective study involving 43 patients with metastatic TCCU treated with <b>vinflunine</b> at our cancer center, data about demographics, disease characteristics and previous treatments were collected and outcome and toxicities of <b>vinflunine</b> were analyzed. RESULTS: 41 of 43 patients were eligible for RR analysis, the Overall RR was 12 %, the Disease Control Rate was 29 %; when including only patients treated in II line the DCR rose to 33 %; the median PFS and the median OS were 2. 2 and 6. 9 months respectively. CONCLUSION: our findings were consistent with the outcome data emerged in the phase III randomized trial and in the other observational studies conducted all around Europe in the last 2 - 3 years.

Cabazitaxel is a taxane with activity in docetaxel-refractory cancers. A randomized study was conducted to compare its efficacy versus <b>vinflunine.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase II/III study, following a Simon's optimal method with stopping rules based on an interim futility analysis and a formal efficacy analysis {{at the end of the}} phase II. ECOG Performance Status, anaemia and liver metastases were stratification factors. Primary objectives were overall response rate for the phase II and overall survival for the phase III. RESULTS: Seventy patients were included in the phase II across 19 institutions in Europe. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two arms. Three patients (13 %) obtained a partial response on cabazitaxel (95 % CI 2. 7 - 32. 4) and six patients (30 %) in the <b>vinflunine</b> arm (95 % CI 11. 9 - 54. 3). Median progression-free survival for cabazitaxel was 1. 9 versus 2. 9 [*]months for <b>vinflunine</b> (P[*]=[*] 0. 039).

In this work we first showed that the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF suppressed microtubule dynamics in living Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs), increased EB 1 comet length by 40 %, and induced EB 1 to bind all along the microtubules, without modifying its expression level. Such microtubule (+) end stabilization occurred close to the plasma membrane in the vicinity of focal adhesion as shown by TIRF microscopy experiments. <b>Vinflunine</b> completely abolished the effect of VEGF on EB 1 comets.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the recommended dose (RD) of <b>vinflunine</b> {{in combination with}} trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) -positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and to investigate potential pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In {{the first part of}} the study, two dose levels of <b>vinflunine</b> given every 3 weeks were explored (280 and 320 mg/m(2)) combined with trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose and 2 mg/kg weekly). For each level of dose, six patients were enrolled to {{determine the}} RD for phase 2 studies (RP 2 S). In the second part of the study, 18 additional patients at RP 2 S have been evaluated to confirm safety and investigate preliminary antitumor activity. RESULTS: The RD was 320 mg/m(2) according to the dose escalation plan. Eleven of 15 additional patients who received this dose experienced dose-limiting toxicities, leading to a reduction in the RD to 280 mg/m(2). When compared to prior trials when <b>vinflunine</b> was used as a single agent, neither <b>vinflunine</b> total blood clearance nor trastuzumab serum concentrations were modified when the drugs were combined. All patients were evaluable, and the overall response rate was 73. 3 % (95 % CI 54. 1 - 87. 7). The median progression-free survival was 11. 3 months (95 % CI 9. 4 - 21. 0). At the dose of 280 mg/m(2), grade 3 - 4 neutropenia were seen in 4 patients (44. 4 %) without febrile neutropenia.

Patients with Karnofsky performance status of 80 or 90, impaired renal function, prior pelvic irradiation, or age ≥ 75 years received an initial dose of 280 mg/m 2, which was escalated to 320 mg/m 2 in Cycle 2 if well tolerated. All other patients received an initial dose of 320 mg/m 2. The primary endpoint was response rate defined by an independent response review committee (IRRC). RESULTS: Per the IRRC, 22 patients achieved a partial response, with {{a response rate of}} 15 % (95 % confidence interval, 9 %- 21 %) with a median duration of response of 6. 0 months. Sixty-four (42 %) patients had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 2. 8 months, and the median overall survival was 8. 2 months. Myelosuppression was the most frequent adverse event, with grade 3 of 4 (adverse events were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2. 0] guidelines) neutropenia reported in 58 % of the patients. Grade 3 of 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 10 (7 %) patients. Nonhematologic treatment-related events (grade 3 of 4) were generally manageable and included constipation (17 %), asthenia/fatigue (13 %), ileus (5 %), and abdominal pain (5 %). No cumulative toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Vinflunine</b> demonstrates moderate activity in patients with platinum-pretreated UC. Toxicity is manageable and noncumulative.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with metastatic RCC were treated with <b>vinflunine</b> 350 mg/m 2 (n = 11) or 320 mg/m 2 (n = 22) administered intravenously every 21 days. RESULTS: Out of 33 patients included in this study, one partial response was observed in the group treated at 350 mg/m 2 and none in the group receiving 320 mg/m 2 resulting in a response rate in this population of 9. 1 % (95 % CI: 0. 2 - 41. 3). Median progression free survival was 5. 6 months (95 % CI: 2. 8 - 14. 4) for patients treated at 350 mg/m 2, and 3. 3 months (95 % CI: 1. 6 - 6. 4) for those treated at 320 mg/m 2. The median survival time was 10. 4 months (95 % CI: 6. 8 - 12. 4) for the whole study population. The principal toxicities were grade 3 / 4 neutropaenia - 90. 9 % at 350 mg/m 2 and 68. 1 % at 320 mg/m 2, febrile neutropaenia was recorded in 3 patients (27. 3 %) at 350 mg/m 2 and in 5 patients (22. 7 %) at 320 mg/m 2. One episode of thromboembolic event was reported in 1 patient at each dose level. CONCLUSION: <b>Vinflunine</b> given intravenously once every 3 weeks has not shown any clinically relevant activity {{in the management of}} patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma; tolerance of the treatment was better at a dose of 320 mg/m 2 than at 350 mg/m 2...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{biology and}} crystallographic studies have {{suggested}} a functional link between stathmin and microtubule targeting agents (MTAs). In a previous study we showed that stathmin increases vinblastine (VLB) binding to tubulin, and that conversely VLB increases stathmin binding to tubulin. This constituted the first biochemical evidence of the direct relationship between stathmin and an antimitotic drug, and revealed a new mechanism of action for VLB. The question remained if the observed interaction was specific for this drug or represented a general phenomenon for all MTAs. In the present study we investigated the binding of recombinant stathmin to purified tubulin {{in the presence of}} paclitaxel or another Vinca alkaloid, <b>vinflunine,</b> using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). These experiments revealed that stathmin binding to tubulin is increased in the presence of <b>vinflunine,</b> whereas no signal is observed in the presence of paclitaxel. Further investigation using turbidity and co-sedimentation showed that stathmin inhibited paclitaxel microtubule-stabilizing activity. Taken together with the previous study using vinblastine, our results suggest that stathmin {{can be seen as a}} modulator of MTA activity and binding to tubulin, providing molecular explanation for multiple previous cellular and in vivo studies showing that stathmin expression level affects MTAs efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Objective : {{to assess}} safety, {{responses}} rate and duration, progression-free and overall survival {{in patients with}} advanced urothelial carcinoma receiving <b>vinflunine</b> as second-line therapy in routine clinical practice, after additional patient recruitment. Materials and methods. This retrospective observational multicenter study included medical data of 34 patients with verified advanced urothelial carcinoma receiving <b>vinflunine</b> for tumor progression after first-line chemotherapy in 11 Russian clinical centers from March 23, 2013  to June 3, 2017. The median age of the patients was 60 (44 – 81) years. ECOG performance status was 0 in 2 (5. 9 %), ECOG 1 – in 21  (61. 7 %), ECOG 2 – in 9 (26. 5 %), and ECOG 3 – in 2 (5. 9 %) patients. Visceral metastases were present in 14 (41. 2 %), non-visceral – in 20 (58. 8 %) cases. Anemia was recorded in 20 (58. 8 %) patients. According to Bellmunt scale 2 (5. 9 %) patients had none risk factors, 6  (17. 6 %) had 1 risk factor, 18 (52. 9 %) and 8 (23. 5 %) had 2 and 3 risk factors, respectively. Initial <b>vinflunine</b> dosage was 320 mg/m 2 in 6  (17. 6 %) patients, 280 mg/m 2 in 22 (64. 8 %) or 250 mg/m 2 in 6 (17. 6 %). Patient received a median of 4 (1 – 10) cycles of therapy. Results. Adverse events (AE) were recorded in 33 (97. 1 %) cases. The most frequent were general (70. 6 %), hematologic (58. 8 %), and gastrointestinal AE (41. 1 %). Most AE were grades I–II and well-controlled. There were no deaths caused by adverse events. The best response was assessed as complete in 1 (2. 9 %), partial – in 5 (14. 7 %), stabilization – in 19 (55. 9 %), and progression – in 9 (26. 5 %) of the 34  patients. Complete response duration was 9. 0 months, median partial response duration was 8. 0 months (95 % confidence interval (CI)   5. 5 – 13. 0); median stabilization duration – 3. 5 months (95 % CI 0. 7 – 12. 8). Median progression-free and overall survival were 3. 9 (95 % CI 3. 5 ‒ 4. 3) and 6. 4 (95 % CI 0. 1 – 17. 0) months, respectively. Univariate analysis indicated that the low somatic ECOG status and the initial vinflunine dosage of 250 mg/m 2 had adverse impact on overall survival. Conclusion.

40|$|BackgroundVinflunine {{is a new}} {{microtubule}} inhibitor with preclinical {{activity in}} small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In this phase II trial, we evaluated <b>vinflunine</b> in patients with relapse-sensitive and refractory SCLC. MethodsThis trial aimed to achieve a 20 % objective response rate (ORR) in platinum-sensitive patients. Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2 and measurable disease received <b>vinflunine</b> (320 mg/m 2 IV) every 21 days (≤ 6 cycles; response evaluation every 6 weeks). ResultsPatient characteristics (N = 51) : median age 63 years (range, 37 – 85 years); male, 55 %; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2, 16 %; relapse-sensitive SCLC, 53 %. The overall ORR was 19. 6 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 10 – 33 %). Twelve (23. 5 %) patients had stable disease; 18 (35. 3 %) patients had progressive disease. Among relapse-sensitive patients, ORR was 22. 2 % (95 % CI 9 – 42 %). Among relapse-refractory patients, ORR was 16. 7 % (95 % CI 5 – 37 %). Median follow-up was 15 months (range, 12 – 18 months); median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1. 6 months (95 % CI 1. 3 – 3. 9 months); median overall survival (OS) was 4. 9 months (95 % CI 3. 2 – 6. 5 months). Among relapse-sensitive patients, PFS and OS were 1. 6 and 4. 9 months, respectively. Among relapsed-refractory patients, PFS and OS were 1. 4 and 4. 0 months, respectively. In general, <b>vinflunine</b> was well tolerated, although neutropenia was a notable toxicity. Grade 3 / 4 toxicities (> 5 %) : neutropenia (32 %), arthralgia/myalgia (16 %), fatigue (16 %), hyponatremia (12 %), leukopenia (12 %), nausea/vomiting (12 %), constipation (6 %), and thrombocytopenia (6 %). The rates of toxicities were relatively well balanced among relapse-sensitive and refractory patients; one patient died of sepsis that was possibly treatment related. ConclusionsVinflunine has activity in relapsed SCLC, including refractory relapsed patients. Neutropenia was common but associated with rare febrile episodes. Additional study in relapse-refractory SCLC is indicated...|$|E

As {{with the other}} vinca alkaloids, the main antineoplastic effects of VFL arise from its interaction with tubulin, the major component of microtubules in mitotic spindles. In contrast to other vinca alkaloids, VFL shows some distinctive properties in terms of tubulin binding, possibly explaining its superior antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo compared with vinorelbine {{as well as its}} excellent safety profile. In transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), two single-agent phase II trials were performed testing VFL in platinum-pretreated patients, showing moderate response rates and promising disease control rates. Therefore, the first phase III trial in modern times for second-line TCC of the urothelium was designed in order to further investigate the activity of VFL. First results were presented at the 2008 ASCO conference. VFL appears to be a possible treatment option for patients with TCC progressing after first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy.

40|$|A {{multicentre}} phase II {{trial to}} determine the efficacy of <b>vinflunine</b> as second-line therapy in patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder; secondary objectives were to assess duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and to evaluate the toxicity associated with this treatment. Patients had tumours that failed or progressed after first-line platinum-containing regimens for advanced or metastatic disease, or had progressive disease after platinum-containing chemotherapy given with adjuvant or neoadjuvant intent. Response and adverse events were assessed according to WHO criteria and NCI-CTC (version 2), respectively. Out of 51 patients treated with 320 [*]mg[*]m− 2 of <b>vinflunine,</b> nine patients responded to the therapy yielding an overall response rate of 18 % (95 % CI: 8. 4 – 30. 9 %), and 67 % (95 %CI: 52. 1 – 79. 3 %) achieved disease control (PR+SD). Of note, responses were seen in patients with relatively poor prognostic factors such as a short (< 12 months) interval from prior platinum therapy (19 %, including an 11 % response rate in those progressing < 3 months after platinum treatment), prior treatment for metastatic disease (24 %), prior treatment with vinca alkaloids (14 %) and visceral involvement (20 %). The median duration of response was 9. 1 months (95 % CI: 4. 2 – 15. 0) and the median PFS was 3. 0 months (95 % CI: 2. 4 – 3. 8). The median OS was 6. 6 months (95 % CI: 4. 8 – 7. 6). The main haematological toxicity was grade 3 – 4 neutropenia, observed in 67 % of patients (42 % of cycles). Febrile neutropenia was observed in five patients (10 %) and among them two were fatal. Constipation was frequently observed (but was manageable and noncumulative) and was grade 3 – 4 in only 8 % of patients. The incidence of grade 3 nausea and vomiting was very low (4 and 6 % of patients, respectively). Neither grade 3 – 4 sensory neuropathy nor severe venous irritation was observed. Moreover, and of importance in this particular study population, no grade 3 – 4 renal function impairment was observed. <b>Vinflunine</b> is an active agent {{for the treatment of}} platinum-pretreated bladder cancer, and these results warrant further investigation in phase III trials, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents as treatment of advanced/metastatic TCC of the bladder...|$|E

Materials and methods. This retrospective observational multicenter study included data on 25 patients with verified disseminated transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary tract who took <b>vinflunine</b> for tumor progression after first-line CT performed in 11 Russian clinical centers in 23 March 2013 to 26 June 2016. The median age of the patients was 60 (44 ‒ 81) years. Their baseline somatic status was rated as ECOG 0 in 1 (4. 0 %) patient, ECOG 1 in 13 (52. 0 %) patients, EGOG 2 in 9 (36. 0 %), and ECOG 3 in 2 (8. 0 %). The most common sites of tumor foci were bones (n = 14, 56. 0 %), lymph nodes of different groups (n = 14; 56. 0 %), and lung (n = 9; 36. 0 %). Results. Adverse reactions were recorded in 24 (96. 0 %) cases. The most common types of toxicity were asthenia (n = 19; 76. 0 %), anemia (n = 18; 72. 0 %), neutropenia (n = 13; 52 %), and nausea (n = 12; 48. 0 %). Most adverse events were grades I–II and well controlled. There were no deaths due to adverse events. The best treatment response was regarded as partial in 6 (24. 0 %) patients; stabilization and progression were observed in 10 (40. 0 %) and 9 (36. 0 %) patients, respectively. The median duration of partial response was 5. 1 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 6 – 15. 0) months; that of stabilization was 3. 4 (95 % CI, 1. 2 – 6. 3) months. In all the 25 cases, the median progression-free and overall survival rates were 3. 7 (95 % CI, 2. 1 ‒ 5. 3) and 6. 5 (95 % CI, 5. 2 ‒ 7. 8) months, respectively. The somatic status was a predictor of overall survival (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion.
