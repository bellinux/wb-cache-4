40|$|SummaryIn his {{monograph}} on Cirripedia from 1851 [1], Darwin {{pointed to}} a highly unusual, plateless, and most likely parasitic barnacle of uncertain phylogenetic affinity. Darwin’s barnacle was Anelasma squalicola, found on deep-water sharks of the family Etmopteridae, or lantern sharks [2]. The barnacle is uncommon and is therefore rarely studied. Recent observations by us have shown that they occur at an unusually high prevalence on the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> <b>lantern</b> <b>shark,</b> Etmopterus spinax, in restricted fjord areas of western Norway. A phylogenetic analysis based on ribosomal DNA data (16 S, 18 S, and 28 S) from 99 selected barnacle species, including all available pedunculate barnacle sequences from GenBank, shows that A.  squalicola is most closely related (sister taxon) to the pedunculate barnacle Capitulum mitella. Both C.  mitella and species of Pollicipes, situated one node higher in the tree, are conventional suspension feeders from the rocky intertidal. Our phylogenetic analysis now {{makes it possible to}} establish morphological homologies between A.  squalicola and its sister taxon and provides the evolutionary framework to explain the unprecedented transition from a filter-feeding barnacle to a parasitic mode of life...|$|E

40|$|Photogenic organs (photophores) of the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> (Etmopterus spinax) {{are under}} {{hormonal}} control, since melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL) trigger luminescence while α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) prevents this light to be emitted.

Immunohistochemical and pharmacological results collected in this work support these nerve fibres to be inhibitory GABAergic nerves since (i) GABA immunoreactivity was detected inside the photogenic tissue, where previous labelling detected the nerve fibre structures and (ii) GABA was able to inhibit MT and PRL-induced luminescence, which {{was on the other}} hand increased by the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline (BICU). In addition, we also demonstrated that BICU can induce light per se by provoking pigment retraction in the pigmented cells composing the iris-like structure of the photophore, attaining, however, only about 10 % of hormonally induced luminescence intensity at 10 (- 3) molL(- 1).

40|$|The <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> <b>lantern</b> <b>shark,</b> Etmopterus spinax (Squaliformes: Etmopteridae), is a small-sized squalid shark {{commonly}} found in deep waters off the Portuguese coast, mainly on soft bottoms. In this study, 67 research cruise bottom trawl tows (with 1 -hour duration) were carried out at depths that ranged from 84 to 786 m. A total of 396 specimens (192 males and 204 females) were caught, with total lengths and ages ranging, respectively, from 10. 2 to 32. 9 cm and 0 to 7 years for males and from 9. 8 to 41. 1 cm and 0 to 10 years for females. Size, age, sex and maturity stages {{were found to be}} correlated with depth, with the larger, older and mostly mature specimens occurring predominantly at greater depths. There seems to be a depth-related migration, where the pregnant females migrate from deeper mating grounds to shallower nursery grounds. The sex ratios were relatively similar in the shallower strata, but females dominated at more than 600 m and were exclusive at more than 700 m. Fishing-related mortality may have complex and significant repercussions on this species, given that commercial fisheries are impacting different segments of this population differently. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of luminous structures and {{the acquisition of}} luminescence competence during the ontogeny of the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> Etmopterus spinax, a deep-sea squalid species, were investigated. The sequential appearance of nine different luminous zones during shark embryogenesis were established, and a new terminology for them given. These zones form the complex luminous pattern observed in free-swimming animals. The organogenesis of photophores (photogenic organs) from the different luminous zones was followed, and photophore maturation was marked {{by the appearance of}} green fluorescent vesicles inside the photocytes (photogenic cells). Peroxide-induced light emissions as well as spontaneous luminescence analysis indicated that the ability of E. spinax to produce light was linked to the presence of these fluorescent vesicles and occured prior to birth. The size of photogenic organs, as well as the percentage of ventral body surface area occupied by the luminous pattern and covered by photophores increased sharply during embryogenesis but remained relatively stable in free-swimming animals.

40|$|The <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> (Etmopterus spinax) emits a blue {{luminescence}} {{from thousands}} of tiny photophores. In this work, we performed a pharmacological study to determine the physiological control of luminescence from these luminous organs. Isolated photophore-filled skin patches produced light under melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL) stimulation in a dose-dependent manner but did not react to classical neurotransmitters. The alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) had an inhibitory effect on hormonal-induced luminescence. Because luzindole and 4 P-PDOT inhibited MT-induced luminescence, the action of this hormone {{is likely to be}} mediated through binding to the MT 2 receptor subtype, which probably decreases the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP) because forskolin (a cAMP donor) strongly inhibits the light response to MT. However, PRL seems to achieve its effects via janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) after binding to its receptor because a specific JAK 2 inhibitor inhibits PRL-induced luminescence. The two stimulating hormones showed different kinetics as well as a seasonal variation of light intensity, which was higher in summer (April) than in winter (December and February). All of these results strongly suggest that, contrary to self-luminescent bony fishes, which harbour a nervous control mechanism of their photophore luminescence, the light emission is under hormonal control in the cartilaginous E. spinax. This clearly highlights the diversity of fish luminescence and confirms its multiple independent apparitions during the course of evolution...|$|E
40|$|Bioluminescence {{is known}} to be of great {{ecological}} importance to a luminous organism but extremely few studies investigate the ontogeny of luminous capabilities. The photogenic pattern of the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> Etmopterus spinax was investigated over ontogeny (14. 0 - 52. 5 cm total length) to determine the scaling of the surface area and the photophore density of different luminous zones as well as the ecological consequences of ontogenetic variations in bioluminescence efficiency. According to the luminous zone considered, different scaling patterns were found for the surface areas while the photophore densities of all zones scale with negative allometry, even though photophore insertion occurs. No sexual differences in these relationships were found. Luminous zones can be placed in two morphologically different groups: the "coverage" and the "isolated" zones. While counter-illumination is certainly the function of the former, the latter are probably involved in intraspecific behaviours. Due to the discrepancy between luminous capabilities of these two luminous zone categories, there is an ontogenetic increase in the luminescence heterogeneity of the luminous pattern as it was shown by luminescence modelling and confirmed by direct observations of spontaneous luminescence in living sharks. This heterogeneity certainly represents a trade-off between an efficient ventral camouflage and a strong identification tool for intraspecific behaviours such as coordinate hunting, which would be particularly useful when E. spinax become fish eaters (> 19 cm total length), and for sexual recognition in mature individuals...|$|E
