By the proposed algorithm, the line and surface coordinate points are decomposed by integer wavelet transform firstly, then watermark {{is embedded in the}} low frequency coefficients of integer wavelet transform, and the <b>vector</b> geo-spatial <b>data</b> with watermark is obtained by inverse integer wavelet transform finally. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm can effectively resist the attack of noise, data compressing, points deleting and format exchanging.

40|$|We {{introduce}} an optimized <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> {{of cosmic}} shear measures (N). This <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> has high information content, is not sensitive against B-mode contamination and only shows small correlation between data points of different angular scales. We {{show that a}} <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> of the two-point correlation function (2 PCF) in general contains more information on cosmological parameters compared to a <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> of the aperture mass dispersion. Reason {{for this is the}} fact that lacks the information of the convergence power spectrum (P_κ) on large angular scales, which is contained in the 2 PCF <b>data</b> <b>vector.</b> Therefore we create a combined <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> N, which retains the advantages of and in addition is also sensitive to the large-scale information of P_κ. We compare the information content of the three <b>data</b> <b>vectors</b> by performing a detailed likelihood analysis and use ray-tracing simulations to derive the covariance matrices. In {{the last part of the}} paper we contaminate all <b>data</b> <b>vectors</b> with B-modes on small angular scales and examine their robustness against this contamination. The combined <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> strongly improves constraints on cosmological parameters compared to. Although, in case of a pure E-mode signal the information content of the 2 PCF is higher, in the more realistic case where B-modes are present the 2 PCF <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> is strongly contaminated and yields biased cosmological parameter estimates. N shows to be robust against this contamination. Furthermore the individual data points of N show a much smaller correlation compared to the 2 PCF leading to an almost diagonal covariance matrix.

40|$|We study nonparametric {{identifiability}} of finite mixture {{models of}} k-variate data with M subpopulations, {{in which the}} components of the <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> are independent conditional on belonging to a subpopulation. We provide a sufficient condition for nonparametrically identifying M subpopulations when k ≥ 3. Our focus is on the relationship between the number of values {{the components of the}} <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> can take on, and the number of identifiable subpopulations. Intuition would suggest that if the <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> can take many different values, then combining information from these different values helps identification. Hall and Zhou (2003) show, however, when k = 2, two-component finite mixture models are not nonparametrically identifiable regardless of the number of the values the <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> can take. When k ≥ 3, there emerges a link between the variation in the <b>data</b> <b>vector,</b> and the number of identifiable subpopulations: the number of identifiable subpopulations increases as the <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> takes on additional (different) values. This points to the possibility of identifying many components even when k = 3, if the <b>data</b> <b>vector</b> has a continuously distributed element. Our identification method is constructive, and leads to an estimation strategy. It i...|$|R
