He was shot and killed in Piazza Marina in Palermo; two men were seen running from the crime scene. Petrosino had gone to Sicily to gather information from local police files to help deport Italian gangsters from New York as illegal immigrants. The two men were <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> of the danger to each other's survival; Petrosino carried a note describing Cascioferro as “a terrible criminal”, while Cascioferro had a photograph of the police officer.|$|E

He said [...] "We need {{to be concerned about the}} possibility of taking land or replacing arable land because of these biofuels", then he added [...] "While I am <b>very</b> <b>much</b> conscious and <b>aware</b> of these problems, at the same time you need to constantly look at having creative sources of energy, including biofuels. Therefore, at this time, just criticising biofuel may not be a good solution. I would urge we need to address these issues in a comprehensive manner."

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that church attendance figures in Great Britain fell consistently throughout the twentieth century {{and there is little}} sign of the trend abating {{at the beginning of the}} twenty-first century. There are scholars who argue that this decline in traditional religiosity has been accompanied by diverse expressions of alternative spiritualitites. This study explores and maps the contemporary quest for spirituality through an examination of the visitors to St Davids Cathedral in West Wales, the birthplace and home of the patron saint of Wales, St David. Within this context, four aspects of spirituality were investigated, characterised as: Spiritual Awareness, Spiritual Experience, participation in the Spiritual Revolution, and Spiritual Health. The study used both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection, employing a questionnaire survey(which yielded around 2700 responses), interviews, and case studies. The analysis of the questionnaire survey explored whether individual differences of sex, age, church attendance and psychological type preferences affect individual spirituality. Analysis of the data suggests that visitors to St Davids Cathedral are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> spiritually <b>aware</b> and undergo various spiritual experiences. The evidence presented in this study also concurs with Heelas and Woodhead(2005) that, while there is an undoubted increase in the participation of the holistic milieu, it is premature to suggest Britain is undergoing a spiritual revolution. It also shows that the visitors to St Davids Cathedral are in goods piritual health...|$|R
40|$|Women {{education}} has occupied {{a very important}} place in society. Various organizations of the Globe have launched various schemes and programmes to promote and educate in each and {{every corner of the}} world. Education is a fundamental right of human development; hence the present study was conducted on education of the tea tribe women in Udalguri district of Assam. The study is a descriptive type of study. The highlighting point of the study indicates that the education of women among Tea tribe women in the district is lacking behind but now they have become <b>very</b> <b>much</b> conscious and <b>aware</b> about their educational rights. Education of women among tea tribes {{plays an important role in}} the development in the district. They also play their role in the economic development. Tea tribe women play their role in the socio cultural development also. Tea tribe women and their management both have positive views towards education. Tea tribe women favor Sarva Shiksha Abhijan and its full implementation with Mid-day Meal, with free text books and qualitative support. Hence the author of this paper studied the need of education among the tea tribe women in Udalguri district...|$|R

Tuttle who was Assistant Engineer of The Water Supply of The City Works Department of The City of Brooklyn. Parfitt was the architect of these three homes. Johnson's house burned down before 1900, Parfitt's was demolished by a developer in 1928 and replaced with seven, run-of-the-mill, fully detached, single-family homes, and Tuttle's house was remodeled over 10 years ago and clad in bright-white and sky-blue brick.|$|E

The response was immediate, and a civilian organization was soon created to work on a partnership basis with the RCAF. As it later developed, this partnership was to be the main reason for the striking success of the Air Cadet Movement in Canada.|$|E

Although edited by a missionary, the magazine played down this aspect, focusing instead on promoting {{the superiority of}} Western culture and criticising the Chinese people's arrogant xenophobic attitude in three sections covering religion, morals and ethics and scientific thought. Gützlaff wrote in the prospectus:"The monthly periodical, which is now offered for the patronage of the foreign community of Canton and Macao, is published {{with a view to}} counteract these high and exclusive notions Chinese profess to be first among the nations on earth, and regard all others as 'Barbarians'., by making the Chinese acquainted with our arts, sciences, and principles. It will not treat of politics, nor tend to exasperate their minds by harsh language upon any subject. There is a more excellent way to show that we are not indeed 'Barbarians', and the Editor prefers the method of exhibiting facts, to convince the Chinese that they still have <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to learn. <b>Aware</b> also, of the relation in which foreigners stand to the native authorities, the Editor has endeavoured to conciliate their friendship, and hopes ultimately to prove successful.Gützlaff's pseudonym, [...] "One who loves the Chinese" [...] (爱汉者), appeared on the front cover of early issues of the magazine.|$|R

25|$|Schumacher cites that William Howard Taft, {{the head}} of the Second Philippine Commission and the first civil {{governor}} of the Philippine Islands, was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> of the need to defuse anti-friar feeling throughout the islands. He requested the Spanish friars be given leave of their parish posts. Many of the friars left voluntarily, and were replaced by native Filipino priests in lower ranks and American bishops in the ranks of the episcopacy. Negotiations also began for the compulsory sale of vast Roman Catholic Church holdings. Although the sale was affected by pressure from influential sectors like some bishops and certain delegates, it achieved Taft’s goal of sequestering all the Roman Catholic Church lands, something that the ill-fated Philippine Republic had failed to achieve. After taking the land, the governor intended to redistribute the land. This not only reduced the financial position of the Roman Catholic Church, but also diminished the influential clout it had during the Spanish colonial period.|$|E

2500|$|The German {{historian}} Eberhard Jäckel wrote {{a series}} of newspaper articles later turned into the book David Irving's Hitler: A Faulty History Dissected, attacking Irving and maintaining that Hitler was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> of and approved of the Holocaust. Jäckel attacked Irving for claiming that a note from Heinrich Himmler's notebook – [...] "Jewish transport from Berlin, not to be liquidated", dated 30 November 1941 – proved that Hitler {{did not want to}} see the Holocaust happen. Jäckel maintained that the order referred only to that train, and argued that if Hitler had ordered the people on that train to be spared, it must stand to reason that he was aware of the Holocaust. Jäckel went on to argue that because the [...] "Final Solution" [...] was secret, it is not surprising that Hitler's servants were ignorant of the Holocaust, and that anyhow, five of Hitler's servants interviewed by Irving later claimed that they believed that Hitler was aware of the Holocaust. Jäckel argued on the basis of Hitler's statements in Mein Kampf that the Führer was always committed to genocide of the Jews, and that because Hitler later attempted to execute the foreign policy he outlined in Mein Kampf, it is a reasonable assumption that Hitler was always committed to genocide, which in Jäckel's opinion disproves Irving's claim that Hitler was unaware of the Shoah. Jäckel used Hitler's tendency to involve himself in minutiae to argue that it is simply inconceivable that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust. As evidence against Irving, Jäckel used Hitler's [...] "Prophecy Speech" [...] of 30 January 1939, where Hitler declared: ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E
