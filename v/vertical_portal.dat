40|$|A Web portal is a {{site that}} {{aggregates}} information from multiple sources on the World Wide Web and organizes this material in an easy user-friendly manner. Portals usually consist of a search engine, e-mail, news, and interactive chat facilities. The two main types of portals are horizontal and vertical portals. A horizontal portal is a Web site that provides consumers access {{to a number of}} different sites in terms of content and functionality. A <b>vertical</b> <b>portal</b> focuses on a specific community of users who share a common interest. In this chapter we investigate the impact of user characteristics such as gender, age, experience, and Web use on user satisfaction with Web portals. In our study we are unable to detect any differences in satisfaction based on gender. We find that the users with seven to 10 years of work experience are most satisfied with Web portals, while users with more than 10 years work experience report least satisfaction with Web portals. We also find that users that use Web portals the least (30 to 60 minutes per week) are least satisfied with them.

40|$|Web portals {{have been}} one of the first web {{services}} that have helped users to find the information they need in the ever expanding World Wide Web. A web portal is basically a website that groups links to information available on the web. These links are selected based on certain criteria. Some web portals group links that pertain to a certain interest e. g. tennis sport. Such a portal is sometimes classified as a <b>vertical</b> <b>portal</b> since it may include several categories like history of tennis, biographies of players, manufacturers of sport attributes. Horizontal web portals, on the other hand, group links to a specific category of resources. Dictionary portals are a good example of that. In this chapter we will describe the present landscape of dictionary portals. First, we will look at the typology of dictionary portals that has been offered by Engelberg and Müller-Spitzer (2013). Then we present the results of a survey that has been conducted in the context of the COST Action ‘European Network of e-Lexicography’ (ENeL). In that survey we made an inventory of dictionary portals presently in operation (see 49. 2. 3. on Inventory of Dictionary Portals).

40|$|It {{has been}} an {{increasing}} trend for companies to migrate their businesses onto or publicize on the Internet. Business process reengineering (BPR) {{can be used to}} migrate the business processes of the supply chain onto the Internet. Such migration may cause some of the processes merged together, minimised, or transformed into other process within a supply chain. Therefore, careful planning for such migration with technical requirements is necessary. In this thesis, the business processes of supply chain are defined as marketing, sourcing, quotation, negotiation, transaction, and delivery. This thesis illustrates how each of these processes can be changed in order to migrate them onto the Internet and the measurement of Electronic Commerce (EC) impact on supply chain. Guidelines are provided from planning the changes for the migration of business processes onto the Internet, implementing the changes, and measuring the impact of Electronic Commerce (EC) on supply chain. In addition, a l 0 -step procedure includes stages of system analysis, decision-making, management, implementation, and maintenance, which gives guidelines from planning the changes for the migration of business onto the Internet and to implementing the changes with technical requirements is provided.

40|$|Persistent archival and {{user-friendly}} {{sharing of}} knowledge {{is one of the}} core components for good scientific practice. Over years, the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), has acquired a wealth of observational data by operating research vessels (Polarstern, Heincke and Uthorn), land-based stations (Neumayer, Kohnen, Koldewey and Dallmann), aircraft (Polar 2 and Polar 4), and, more recently, the ocean-based stations Hausgarten. To optimize mining of research platform related knowledge, a prototype for a <b>vertical</b> <b>portal</b> designed to serve the needs of science-, industry- and outreach-oriented users has been developed. It provides links to AWI publications related to a given expedition/campaign and to data sets extracted from onboard/in situ acquisition systems. Thus, we are taking the first step towards bridging the gap between AWI publications and data archives, f. e. PANGAEA and mass storage systems. In addition, various types of information about past and future expeditions/campaigns are available such as associated technology transfer material, project summary, cruise/campaigns reports, newsletters, press releases, multimedia material, webcam links etc. Knowledge query is made available according to research platform type, geographical location or coordinates, project title and discipline. We offer either a simple, user-friendly table-like interface or a fully graphical one using the OpenGIS MapServer systemThe discovery model presented is extensible and not limited to AWIs in-house data models. We believe that sharing of quality-controlled knowledge on research platforms fosters cross-discipline as well as cross-institutional cooperation and improves the scientific planning of future expeditions/campaigns and long-term observatory programs. We seek support from this community towards the development and consolidation of a web of service-oriented information systems archives and portals which provide a variety of views towards these - which allows for seamless access to distributed repositories worldwide. Such a federated system which would leave the stewardship of publications and data archives with their creators - could be accomplished based on the interoperability architecture of W 3 C Web Services protocols, combined with further, select standards for metadata, as for example the Dublin Core metadata element set [ANSI/NISO Z 39. 85 - 2001, ISSN: 1041 - 5653] and the richer ISO 19115 /TC 211 geospatial metadata scheme...|$|E

The number of <b>vertical</b> <b>portals</b> has rapidly increased over the last years, making {{the importance of a}} topic-driven (focused) crawler evident. In this paper, we develop a latent semantic indexing classifier that combines link analysis with text content in order to retrieve and index domain specific web documents.

Our implementation presents a different approach to focused crawling and aims to overcome the size limitations of the initial training data while maintaining a high recall/precision ratio. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} {{of the means of}} communication has led to significant changes in the functioning of science, as well as, in the way research findings are published. The paper deals with the subject of the academic blogosphere as an example of using new media in the process of the dissemination of science. Science communication with the use of Internet tools is beginning to operate in the paradigm of the convergence culture, combining the old with the new media in the process of knowledge distribution. The old media, not only has not been abandoned but it continues to be used and supported by new technologies (the role of social media in the process of science communication is discussed herein by using the examples of Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus). In addition to indicating basic historical and typological elements within the scope of functioning of science blogs, the paper presents the functions that a blog can offer to author-scientists, readers and the society. It examines the reasons and motivations behind starting a blog, as well as, the reasons for not blogging about science (e. g. a personal character of the blog, or an objective character of scientific information). The author attempts to draw the panorama of the Polish academic blogosphere (presenting an overview of projects and initiatives) and discusses blogging by using the example of his own blog, Communication researcher workshop (Warsztat badacza komunikacji). He presents blogs as a modern tool for scientific communication and examines the challenges and problems that could arise during the process of creating a science web service geared towards a wide audience (students, as much as, research fellows). On the basis of works conducted on the <b>vertical</b> <b>portal</b> Science and Progress (Nauka i Postęp) created by the Poznań University of Technology, Polish Television in Poznań, as well as, the Marshal Office of the Wielkopolski Region, he points out the difficulties in the integration of the old and new media emerging in the process of promotion and dissemination of science.

40|$|A portal (or Web portal) {{presents}} {{information from}} diverse sources in a unified way. A Web site {{that offers a}} broad array of resources and services, such as e-mail, forums, search engines, online shopping are referred to as portal. The first portals grow out of online services, such as AOL, and provided access to the Web, but by now most of the traditional search engines have transformed themselves into Web portals to attract and keep a larger audience. Apart from the basic search engine feature, these portals often offer services such as e-mail, news, stock prices, information, and entertainment. Portals provide a way for enterprises, research and other communities to generate a consistent look and feel with access control and procedures for multiple applications, which otherwise would have been different entities altogether. In a research environment a portal integrates online scientific services into single Web environment which can be accessed and managed from a standard Web browser. The most remarkable benefit of portals is that they simplify the interaction of users with distributed systems and with each other, because a single tool - the browser - and a standard and widely accepted network protocol - HTTP - can be used through all communications. After the proliferation of Web browsers in the mid- 1990 s many companies tried to build or acquire a portal, to have a piece of the Internet market. The Web portal gained special attention because it was, for many users, the starting point of their Web browser. Similarly, but a bit later, research communities recognized the value of Web portals in integrating various services into coherent, customizable environments. Research collaborations began developing portals in the late 1990. These environments can be broadly categorized as horizontal portals, which cover many areas, and <b>vertical</b> <b>portals,</b> which are focused on one functional area. Horizontal research portals often provide services that are independent from any scientific discipline and represent generic functionalities that are common across disciplines. <b>Vertical</b> <b>portals</b> target specific group of researchers that are involved in the same experiment or work within the same scientific field...|$|R
