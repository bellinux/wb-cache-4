40|$|PURPOSE. To {{report the}} retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> {{deviation}} according to structural RNFL loss in RNFL thickness maps. METHODS. Retinal nerve fiber layer defect {{is defined in}} RNFL thickness maps by the degree of RNFL loss. A 20 % to 70 % degree of RNFL loss was set with a 1 % interval as the reference level for determining the boundary of RNFL defects. Each individual RNFL thickness map was compared with a normative database map and the region below the reference level was identified as an RNFL defect. The RNFL <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> was calculated by summing the volumes of each pixel inside RNFL defect. The RNFL <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> deviation was calculated by summing {{the differences between the}} normative database and the subject&# 39;s RNFL measurements. To evaluate the glaucoma diagnostic ability, the areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUCs# were calculated. RESULTS. Retinal nerve fiber layer <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> and RNFL <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> deviation # 0. 984 and 0. 986, respectively# had significantly greater AUCs than all circumpapillary RNFL thickness parameters #all P ? 0. 001 #.

40|$|International audienceThe gross melt {{fracture}} defect {{is related}} to the flow instabilities developed in the contraction region. To mitigate these upstream instabilities, a convergent radial flow in the die entrance has been created. In fact, the ultimate objective of the present work is to examine the effect of the clearance width of radial flow on the appearance and development of gross melt fracture defect. So, capillary rheometer experiments were performed with linear polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) oil. As for the influence of radial flow width on the morphology of gross melt fracture defect, extrudate photographs show that this imperfection can be mitigated since its frequency is higher and amplitude smaller when the gap of radial flow decreases. Such results may be related both to shear and elongational components of radial flow. Actually, when gap width is very small compared to the external diameter of radial flow, shear deformations become more enhanced with respect to the elongational deformations and thus the helical gross melt fracture becomes more like a surface defect than <b>volume</b> <b>defect...</b>|$|E

Before this modality {{can be considered for}} assessing clinical or investigational interventions, baseline repeatability needs to be established. We assessed repeatability of lung function measurement using HP helium- 3 MRI (HP (3) He MRI) in a small cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined repeatability of HP (3) He MR images of five patients with CF in four scanning sessions over a 4 -week period. We acquired images on a Philips 3. 0 Tesla Achieva MRI scanner using a quadrature, flexible, wrap-around, (3) He radiofrequency coil with a fast gradient-echo pulse sequence. We determined ventilation <b>volume</b> and ventilation <b>defect</b> <b>volume</b> using an advanced semiautomatic segmentation algorithm and also quantified ventilation heterogeneity.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between March 2009 and May 2010, at the Plastic and Reconstructive Institute of University of Palermo, pedicled perforator flaps were used to integrate volume and/or breast skin in 12 patients after benign and malignant breast tumors. The flaps used were based on perforators of the thoraco-dorsal artery (TDAP) and of the intercostal arteries (ICAP). TDAP flaps were used to reconstruct defects in any breast quadrant, while ICAP perforator were used to reconstruct lateral and central inferior pole defects. 	RESULTS: All flaps survived completely. Breast size, shape and volume were satisfactorily restored. Contralateral breast procedure to adjust symmetry were not necessary. Donor sites scars were well hidden in the inframammary fold or under the brassiere.

The evolution of the defect profiles was studied {{as a function of}} isothermal annealing at 250 degrees C. The fraction of released He was measured by thermal programmed desorption. The defects could be identified as a coexistence of monovacancies stabilized by He-related defects and divacancies. The number of defects decreases for annealing time of a few minutes, then increases at longer annealing times. The mean depth of the defect profiles in the as-implanted samples was found to be very near the surface. After annealing, the mean depth increases to less than one half of the projected He range. This complex dynamics has been interpreted as due to passivation of vacancies by He during the implantation process and the first annealing step when no appreciable He is lost, and to subsequent depassivation during He desorption.

High temperature growth, however, is not sufficient in itself to remove open <b>volume</b> <b>defects</b> at the ITO/GaN interface.
