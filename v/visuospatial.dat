5|$|This {{section of}} the MSE covers the patient's level of alertness, orientation, attention, memory, <b>visuospatial</b> functioning, {{language}} functions and executive functions. Unlike other sections of the MSE, use is made of structured tests in addition to unstructured observation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Visuospatial</b> or {{constructional}} abnormalities {{here may}} be associated with parietal lobe pathology, and abnormalities in executive functioning tests may indicate frontal lobe pathology. This kind of brief cognitive testing is regarded as a screening process only, and any abnormalities are more carefully assessed using formal neuropsychological testing.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. <b>Visuospatial</b> difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E
5|$|Thyroxine is {{critical}} to the regulation of metabolism and growth throughout the animal kingdom. For example, Iodine and T4 trigger the change from a plant-eating water-dwelling tadpole into a meat-eating land-dwelling frog, with better neurological, <b>visuospatial,</b> smell and cognitive abilities for hunting, as seen in other predatory animals. A similar phenomenon happens in the neotenic amphibian salamanders, which, without introducing iodine, don't transform into land-dwelling adults, and live and reproduce in the larval form of aquatic axolotl. Among amphibians, administering a thyroid-blocking agent such as propylthiouracil (PTU) can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs; in contrast, administering thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis. In amphibian metamorphosis, thyroxine and iodine also exert a well-studied experimental model of apoptosis on the cells of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles. Iodine, via iodolipids, has favored the evolution of terrestrial animal species and has likely {{played a crucial role in}} the evolution of the human brain.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than <b>visuospatial,</b> ability {{lies at the}} core of expertise. In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position. According to de Groot, this perception, made possible by years of practice and study, {{is more important than the}} sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.|$|E
25|$|Optic ataxia: {{where the}} patient can't use <b>visuospatial</b> {{information}} to guide arm movements.|$|E
25|$|Although most of {{the tests}} showed no difference, there were some that did. For example, they found female {{subjects}} performed better on verbal abilities while males performed better on <b>visuospatial</b> abilities. For verbal fluency, females have been specifically found to perform slightly better in vocabulary and reading comprehension but significantly higher in speech production and essay writing. Males have been specifically found to perform better on spatial visualization, spatial perception, and mental rotation. Researchers had then recommended that general models such as fluid and crystallized intelligence be divided into verbal, perceptual and <b>visuospatial</b> domains of g, because when this model is applied then females excel at verbal and perceptual tasks while males on <b>visuospatial</b> tasks, thus evening out the sex differences on IQ tests.|$|E
25|$|Patients often {{demonstrate}} noticeable {{deficits in}} the central executive component of working memory as conceptualized by Baddeley and Hitch. However, performance on tasks associated with the phonological loop and <b>visuospatial</b> sketchpad are typically less affected. More specifically, patients with schizophrenia show impairment to the central executive component of working memory, specific to tasks in which the <b>visuospatial</b> system is required for central executive control. The phonological system {{appears to be more}} generally spared overall.|$|E
25|$|<b>Visuospatial</b> skills difficulties, {{which are}} seen {{when the person}} with PD is for example asked to perform tests of facial {{recognition}} and perception of line orientation.|$|E
25|$|Nonverbal {{learning}} disability {{is characterized by}} normal verbal abilities but impaired <b>visuospatial</b> abilities. Problem areas for children with nonverbal {{learning disability}} are arithmetic, geometry, and science. Impairments in spatial memory is implicated in nonverbal learning disorder and other learning difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Different {{treatment}} approaches {{can be used}} {{to treat}} the different symptoms of right hemisphere damage including neglect, <b>visuospatial</b> awareness, prosody, and pragmatics. Therapy for each person is individualized to their symptoms and severity of impairment. Intervention should focus on the needs of the person in both communication and functional aspects.|$|E
25|$|Neurologic {{symptoms}} and signs {{vary depending on}} the site of the brain abnormalities. Common symptoms are partial epilepsy, asymmetric spasticity, ataxia and cognitive impairment. The latter affects <b>visuospatial</b> and visuoconstructive skills first. The intracranial pressure can be elevated if cysts develop in the brain. Migraine-like headaches can occur.|$|E
25|$|Scientists are {{currently}} {{interested in the}} possibility that physical differences in brain structure could determine different abilities. One part of the operculum called Broca's area {{plays an important role}} in speech production. To compensate, the inferior parietal lobe was 15 percent wider than normal. The inferior parietal region is responsible for mathematical thought, <b>visuospatial</b> cognition, and imagery of movement.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 study {{published}} in Intelligence by researchers Miguel Burgaleta and Richard Haier dispelled previous claims that bigger brain size indicates greater male g factor than females. They found greater male brain size was instead associated with greater <b>visuospatial</b> abilities but not with g factor or general intelligence. The study also found no sex differences in g factor among the 100 participants.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscience {{has shown}} that {{memories}} are vulnerable to disruption for several hours after they form. Holmes and colleagues proposed that because of this <b>visuospatial</b> distractors like Tetris, if administered within six hours of a traumatic event could help prevent symptoms of flashbacks. Also {{there is some evidence}} that memories can become vulnerable to disruption even at longer periods of time in a process known as reconsolidation.|$|E
25|$|The term VSTM refers in a theory-neutral {{manner to}} the non-permanent storage of visual {{information}} {{over an extended}} period of time. The <b>visuospatial</b> sketchpad is a VSTM subcomponent within the theoretical model of working memory proposed by Alan Baddeley. Whereas iconic memories are fragile, decay rapidly, and are unable to be actively maintained, visual short-term memories are robust to subsequent stimuli and last over many seconds. VSTM is distinguished from long-term memory, on the other hand, primarily by its very limited capacity.|$|E
25|$|PET {{studies have}} {{revealed}} a language modality-specific working memory neural region for sign language (which {{relies on a}} network of bilateral temporal, bilateral parietal, and left premotor activation), {{as well as a}} difference in activation of the right cerebellum in bimodal bilinguals between when they are signing or speaking. Similarities of activation have been found in Broca's area and semantic retrieval causes similar patterns of activation in the anterior left inferior frontal lobe. The bilateral parietal activation pattern for sign language is similar to neural activity during nonverbal <b>visuospatial</b> tasks.|$|E
25|$|The {{explanation}} {{given for}} the success of administrating Tetris as opposed to other interventions is that Tetris draws heavily on <b>visuospatial</b> processing power. Because the brain only has a limited supply of resources to process information, playing Tetris hinders the ability of the brain to focus on other visual information, such as traumatic images. However, the details of the event can still be thought of and rehearsed verbally, as Tetris should not interfere with verbal processes of the brain. This explains why participants could remember the details of the footage they watched but why they still experienced fewer flashbacks.|$|E
25|$|Although place {{cells are}} part of a non-sensory {{cortical}} system, their firing behavior is strongly correlated to sensory input. Place cells fire when an animal is located in parts of the environment known as place fields. These circuits may have important implications for memory, as they provide the spatial context for memories and past experiences. Like many other parts of the brain, place cell circuits are dynamic. They are constantly adjusting and remapping to suit the current location and experience of the brain. Place cells do not work alone to create <b>visuospatial</b> representation; they are a part of a complex circuit that informs place awareness and place memory.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} has suggested {{a link between}} a child's abilities to gain information about {{the world around them}} and having the ability to override emotions in order to behave appropriately. One study required children to perform a task from a series of psychological tests, with their performance used as a measure of executive function. The tests included assessments of: executive functions (self-regulation, monitoring, attention, flexibility in thinking), language, sensorimotor, <b>visuospatial,</b> and learning, in addition to social perception. The findings suggested that the development of Theory of Mind in younger children is linked to executive control abilities with development impaired in individuals who exhibit signs of executive dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Iodine and T4 {{stimulate the}} {{spectacular}} apoptosis (programmed cell death) {{of the cells}} of the larval gills, tail and fins, and also stimulate the evolution of the nervous system transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog with better neurological, <b>visuospatial,</b> olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting. Contrary to amphibian metamorphosis, thyroidectomy and hypothyroidism in mammals may be considered a sort of phylogenetic, metabolic and neurologic regression to a former stage of reptilian life. Indeed, many disorders that seem to afflict hypothyroid humans have reptilian-like features, such as a general slowdown of nervous reflexes with lethargic cerebration, metabolism, digestion, heart rate, hypothermia and a dry, hairless, scaly, cold skin.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Earl Hunt {{published}} in the journal Intelligence found that sex differences on tests can result from recruitment factors, so that gender differences are only representative of those that actually participate in the studies. He also contested that not only can there be individual variations that studies consistently recruit, but that these studies wouldn't be representative of the general population especially if the participants only represent college students. A 2009 study by researcher Dominika Dykiert published Intelligence also found that sex differences in mean IQ scores can be partly created by male variability in cognitive abilities and sample restriction. Dykiert highlighted the need for representative samples for studying sex differences in intelligence to eliminate skewed results created by male variance and restriction of sample. Studies have also indicated that tests used to measure sex differences such as Raven's Progressive matrices is not a pure indicator of general intelligence or g factor and only shares 50% of its variance. Tests like WAIS have also been criticized as not directly measuring g factor in a 2002 study published in Intelligence. Lead researcher Roberto Colom has strongly asserted that g factor or general intelligence is the correlation among different test scores and not the summed scores on different tests, such as Raven's or WAIS. Roberto Colom has also pointed out that Raven's Progressive matrices test is biased against females because of the <b>visuospatial</b> nature of the test which tends to favor those with stronger <b>visuospatial</b> skills (i.e. males) instead of g factor. Therefore, he concluded that sex difference research should not be based on a single test but instead on multiple tests loaded with fluid intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Rossi (1977) {{suggests}} that the function and characteristic between left and right cerebral hemispheres may enable us to locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere. He cites research indicating that left hemispherical functioning is primarily verbal and associational, {{and that of the}} right primarily <b>visuospatial</b> and apperceptive. Thus the left hemisphere is equipped as a critical, analytical, information processor while the right hemisphere operates in a 'gestalt' mode. This means that the right hemisphere is better at getting a picture of a whole from a fragment, is better at working with confused material, is more irrational than the left, and more closely connected to bodily processes. Once expressed in the form of words, concepts and language of the ego's left hemispheric realm, however, they become only representations that 'take their colour' from the individual consciousness. Inner figures such as shadow, anima and animus would be archetypal processes having source in the right hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Spatial cues such as {{geometric}} boundaries or orienting landmarks {{are important}} examples of metric input. Place cells mainly rely on set distal cues rather than cues {{in the immediate}} proximal environment. Movement can also be an important spatial cue. The ability of place cells to incorporate new movement information is called path integration, {{and it is important}} for keeping track of self-location during movement. Path integration is largely aided by grid cells, which are a type of neuron in the entorhinal cortex that relay information to place cells in the hippocampus. Grid cells establish a grid representation of a location, so that during movement place cells can fire according to their new location while orienting according to the reference grid of their external environment. Visual sensory inputs can also supply important contextual information. A change in color of a specific object can affect whether or not a place cell fires in a particular field. Thus, <b>visuospatial</b> sensory information is critical to the formation and recollection of place field.|$|E
25|$|Sensory {{information}} {{received by}} place cells {{can be categorized}} as either metric or contextual information, where metric information corresponds to where place cells should fire and contextual input corresponds {{to whether or not}} a place field should fire in a certain environment. Metric sensory information is any kind of spatial input that might indicate a distance between two points. For example, the edges of an environment might signal the size of the overall place field or the distance between two points within a place field. Metric signals can be either linear or directional. Directional inputs provide information about the orientation of a place field, whereas linear inputs essentially form a representational grid. Contextual cues allow established place fields to adapt to minor changes in the environment, such as a change in object color or shape. Metric and contextual inputs are processed together in the entorhinal cortex before reaching the hippocampal place cells. <b>Visuospatial</b> and olfactory inputs are examples of sensory inputs that are utilized by place cells. These types of sensory cues can include both metric and contextual information.|$|E
25|$|Although place cells {{primarily}} rely on <b>visuospatial</b> input, {{some studies}} suggest that olfactory input may {{also play a role}} in generating and recalling place fields. Relatively {{little is known about the}} interaction between place cells and non-visual sensory cues, but preliminary studies have shown that non-visual sensory input may have supplementary role in place field formation. A study by Save et al. found that olfactory information can be used to compensate for a loss of visual information. In this study, place fields in subjects exposed to an environment with no light and no olfactory signals were unstable; the position of the place field shifted abruptly and some of the constituent place cells stopped firing entirely. However, place cells in subjects exposed to a dark environment with olfactory signals remained stable despite a lack of visual cues. An additional study by Zhang et al. examined how the hippocampus uses olfactory signals to create and recall place fields. Similar to the Save et al. study, this study exposed subjects to an environment with a series of odors but no visual or auditory information. Place fields remained stable and even adapted to the rotation of the pattern of olfactory signals. Furthermore, the place fields would remap entirely when the odors were moved randomly. This suggests that place cells not only utilize olfactory information to generate place fields, but also use olfactory information to orient place fields during movement.|$|E
500|$|Iodine and T4 (over {{stimulate the}} {{spectacular}} apoptosis [...] {{of the cells}} of the larval gills, tail and fins) also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog with better neurological, <b>visuospatial,</b> olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting.|$|E
500|$|While the {{definitive}} studies are lacking, the former view received {{support from a}} 2004 meta-analysis of 13 small studies. This meta-analysis found that long-term use of benzodiazepines was associated with moderate to large adverse effects on all areas of cognition, with <b>visuospatial</b> memory being the most commonly detected impairment. Some of the other impairments reported were decreased IQ, visiomotor coordination, information processing, verbal learning and concentration. The authors of the meta-analysis and a later reviewer noted that the applicability of this meta-analysis is limited because the subjects were taken mostly from withdrawal clinics; the coexisting drug, alcohol use, and psychiatric disorders were not defined; {{and several of the}} included studies conducted the cognitive [...] measurements during the withdrawal period.|$|E
500|$|Attention and {{concentration}} are {{assessed by the}} serial sevens test (or alternatively by spelling a five-letter word backwards), and by testing digit span. Memory is assessed in terms of immediate registration (repeating a set of words), short-term memory (recalling the set of words after an interval, or recalling a short paragraph), and long-term memory (recollection of well known historical or geographical facts). <b>Visuospatial</b> functioning can be assessed by the ability to copy a diagram, draw a clock face, or draw {{a map of the}} consulting room. Language is assessed through the ability to name objects, repeat phrases, and by observing the individual's spontaneous speech and response to instructions. Executive functioning can be screened for by asking the [...] "similarities" [...] questions ("what do x and y have in common?") and by means of a verbal fluency task (e.g. [...] "list as many words as you can starting with the letter F, in one minute"). The mini-mental state examination is a simple structured cognitive assessment which is in widespread use as a component of the MSE.|$|E
2500|$|Three main {{findings}} {{provide evidence for}} the distinction between visual and spatial parts of the <b>visuospatial</b> sketchpad: ...|$|E
2500|$|Baddeley and Hitch's 1974 Model {{consists}} of three components; one main component, the central executive and two sub components, the phonological loop and the <b>visuospatial</b> sketchpad. The central executive's primary role is to mediate between the two sub-systems. The <b>visuospatial</b> sketchpad holds information about what we see. The phonological loop can be further divided into: the Articulatory control system, the [...] "inner voice" [...] responsible for verbal rehearsal; and the Phonological store, the [...] "inner ear" [...] responsible for speech-based storage. Major criticisms of this model include a lack of musical processing/encoding and an ignorance towards other sensory inputs regarding the encoding and storage of olfactory, gustatory, and tactile inputs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presenting}} {{symptom of}} dementia with Lewy bodies is often cognitive dysfunction, though dementia eventually occurs in all individuals with DLB. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which memory loss {{is the first}} symptom, those with DLB first experience impaired attention, executive function, and <b>visuospatial</b> function, while memory is affected later. These impairments present as driving difficulty, such as becoming lost, misjudging distances, or as impaired job performance. [...] In terms of cognitive testing, individuals may have problems with figure copying {{as a result of}} <b>visuospatial</b> impairment, with clock-drawing due to executive function impairment, and difficulty with serial sevens as a result of impaired attention. Short-term memory and orientation to time and place remain intact in the earlier stages of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|... 1999– McMaster University {{is home to}} a {{piece of}} Albert Einstein's brain. An autopsy was {{performed}} on Einstein by Dr. Thomas Stoltz Harvey, who removed and preserved his brain. Harvey found nothing unusual with his brain, but in 1999 further analysis by a team at McMaster University revealed that his parietal operculum region was missing and, to compensate, his inferior parietal lobe was 15% wider than normal. The inferior parietal region is responsible for mathematical thought, <b>visuospatial</b> cognition, and imagery of movement. Einstein's brain also contained 73% more glial cells than the average brain.|$|E
2500|$|In the brain, B. burgdorferi {{may induce}} astrocytes to undergo astrogliosis (proliferation {{followed}} by apoptosis), which {{may contribute to}} neurodysfunction. The spirochetes may also induce host cells to secrete quinolinic acid, which stimulates the NMDA receptor on nerve cells, which {{may account for the}} fatigue and malaise observed with Lyme encephalopathy. [...] In addition, diffuse white matter pathology during Lyme encephalopathy may disrupt gray matter connections, and could account for deficits in attention, memory, <b>visuospatial</b> ability, complex cognition, and emotional status. White matter disease may have a greater potential for recovery than gray matter disease, perhaps because the neuronal loss is less common. Resolution of MRI white matter hyperintensities after antibiotic treatment has been observed.|$|E
2500|$|Faces are an {{important}} part of one's social life. [...] To be able to recognize, respond and act towards a person requires unconscious memory encoding and retrieval processes. Facial stimuli are processed in the fusiform gyrus (occipito-temporal brain area) and this processing is an implicit function representing a typical form of implicit memory. REM sleep has been seen to be more beneficial to implicit <b>visuospatial</b> memory processes, rather than slow-wave sleep which is crucial for explicit memory consolidation. REM sleep is known for its visual experiences, which may often include detailed depictions of the human countenance. [...] A recognition task was used to gauge familiarity with a previously shown sequence of faces after a subsequent period of REM sleep. It was seen that the fusiform gyrus was active during training, the REM sleep period, and the recognition task as well. It is hypothesized that brain mechanisms during REM sleep, as well as pure repetition priming, can account for the implicit recognition of the previously shown faces.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{a widely}} held opinion that {{dyslexia}} is associated with remarkably artistic creativity." [...] This leads to {{us to look at}} art schools {{to see if there are}} high numbers of people who have dyslexia. The answer is yes, there is an unusually high correlation between people with dyslexia and art students. The question should be why? [...] There are speculations that dyslexics have differing brain structures and functions. There tends to be a lack of objective studies that confirm the art and dyslexia relationship. The Wolff and Lundberg article implies that it isn't that easy to get into art school; that people with dyslexia earn their entrance into the art schools on artistic merit, as an easy way out of conventional academics. Corlu, Özcan, and Korkmazlar suggest that further research is a valid research concern. There are studies that seemingly coincide with the concept that people with dyslexia see the world differently. There seems to be evidence that dyslexics have a superior level of <b>visuospatial</b> skill. Gross and Bornstein think that dyslexia might be due to a difficulty in treating mirror images as the same stimulus, when taking into consideration words that are commonly switched, such as god and dog, no and on, and saw and was.|$|E
