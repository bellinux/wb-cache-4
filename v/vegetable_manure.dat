40|$|Bacterial {{pathogens}} {{have increasingly}} {{been identified as}} disease causing agents in vegetable-linked outbreaks. Consumers nowadays show higher demands for fresh or minimally processed fruits and vegetables, {{and at the same}} time potential sources of pathogen infestation are increasing due to the more frequent use of animal manures as fertilizers in organic than in conventional agriculture. On the other hand, a higher antagonistic potential against invading pathogens is implicated from the more diverse microbiota in organic soils. Vegetable-associated outbreaks in Europe are not well documented, and guidelines are missing for reducing risks of pathogen infestation. Thus, a survey on organically grown vegetables has been carried out by the “PathOrganic” consortium in five countries. In total, 4620 plants of lettuce, 1900 plants of spinach and 500 carrots from 14 fields were collected and by using PCR based detection methods were analyzed for the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria sp. and Campylobacter spp. Common protocols were used regarding harvest and sample preparation; and molecular analyses were shared among labs according to expertise. Preceding the <b>vegetable</b> screenings, animal <b>manures</b> of various origin used for fertilizing the fields were analyzed for the presence of the same pathogens, aimed at pin-pointing potential sources of contamination. Results of the <b>vegetable</b> and <b>manure</b> surveys are presented and the concept of microbiological risk assessment followed in the project is discussed. Besides yielding a large dataset concerning pathogen infestation of <b>vegetables</b> and <b>manures,</b> the screenings provided a collection of vegetable-derived pathogen isolates available for further analysis. Together with information obtained in experimental assays, the survey results may enlarge our understanding of vegetable-associated human pathogenic bacteria and their interrelations with common microbial colonizers of plants and soils...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{identification}} of Critical Control Points 1 (CCPs) for organic farms, which use manure {{for the production of}} organic lettuce, cabbage, carrots and spinach in Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmark. Due to the application of <b>manure,</b> <b>vegetables</b> are at risk to be contaminated with enteropathogens such as Escherichia coli pathogenic strains (i. e. O 157 :H 7), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocyto-genes, and Staphylococcus aureus. This work applies part of the principles and steps described for HACCP 2 to identify the CCPs. The steps described hereafter are reported in the course guidance document “HACCP in agri-culture – Organic milk production” (1) and were adapted to the agricultural production of field vegetables. The hazard analysis is based on the characteristics of the above mentioned enteropathogens and the agricultural practices applied by the organic farmers in the four countries when growing lettuce, cabbage, carrots, and spinach. The assessment of the actual agricultural practices uses the evaluation of interviews conducted with organic farmers growing these <b>vegetables</b> and using <b>manure</b> as fertiliser. In total were interviewed 16 farmers in Austria, 16 farmers in Switzerland, 13 farmers in Sweden, and 9 farmers in Denmark. In general terms, there is no agricultural practice common to the majority of organic farmers concerning the management of animal ma-nure, fertilisation, irrigation, harvest and postharvest management when growing lettuce, cab-bage, spinach, and carrots in Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden. Using the decision tree of the HACCP system, CCPs were identified for the primary production of organic field vegetables. Where appropriate, instead of CCPs were defined PRP-CPs 3 or OP-PRPs 4. Four CCPs were identified for the process steps ‘storage of animal manure’, ‘fertilisation practices’, ‘prevention of runoff and flooding’, and ‘irrigation practices’...|$|R

Wood chip-poiyacrylarnide (PAM) cores were used to alter the soil envi-ronment in a greenhouse study to favor indigenous soil microorganisms in <b>vegetable</b> and <b>manure</b> compost to reduce Verticillium dahliae infection of potato (Solarium tuberosum L.) plants. Potato plants growing in soils amended with vegetable compost-wood chip-PAM cores had significantly lower visible (V vi,) and isolation (V. so) dahliae infection rates than control soils and soils with dairy or vegetable compost alone. Soils amended with wood chip-PAM-dairy compost cores had significantly lower IC and isolation V. than control soils and soils with dairy compost. Soils with wood chip-PAM cores ana soils with wooirchip-PAM-vegetable compost had greater microbial biomass / Verticillium dahliae biomass (MB / VB) ratios in soil than control soils or in soils amended with compost alone.

It should be noted, that biogas – renewable energy source, which does not require any specific climatic conditions or geographical position of a country. This power source is available and can be successfully produced and used in all countries of the world. The main components of biogas – methane CH 4 and carbon monoxide CO 2. This gas is formed under anaerobic conditions, when microorganisms decompose biodegradable biomass. In biological sciences biomass means a living matter content, expressed in grams per unit area. Meanwhile, in the energy sector, the definition of biomass is limited and biomass is characterized as fuel source, produced from plant materials and organic waste (food waste, wood, sludge, <b>manure,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> etc.). Currently, to produce biogas from biomass, bioreactors are used worldwide.

However, it is unclear whether and how there is any impact of manure fertilization on populations and community structure of antibiotic-resistant endophytic bacteria (AREB) in plant tissues. To investigate the effect of manure and organic fertilizer on endophytic bacterial communities, pot experiments were performed with pakchoi grown with the following treatments: (1) non-treated; (2) chicken manure-treated and (3) organic fertilizer-treated. Manure or organic fertilizer significantly increased the abundances of total cultivable endophytic bacteria (TCEB) and AREB in pakchoi, and the effect of chicken manure was greater than that of organic fertilizer. Further, 16 S rDNA sequencing and the phylogenetic analysis indicated that chicken manure or organic fertilizer application increased the populations of multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria (MARB) in soil and multiple antibiotic-resistant endophytic bacteria (MAREB) in pakchoi. The identical multiple antibiotic-resistant bacterial populations detected in chicken manure, manure- or organic fertilizer-amended soil and the vegetable endophytic system were Brevundimonas diminuta, Brachybacterium sp. and Bordetella sp., suggesting that MARB from manure could enter and colonize the <b>vegetable</b> tissues through <b>manure</b> fertilization.

This study evaluated the effects of applications of different qualities of organic amendments on size and composition of the weed seed bank in a field under sequential cropping over 4 years. Fertilisation systems tested included farmyard <b>manure,</b> <b>vegetable</b> fruit and garden waste compost, two types of farm compost differing in carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, cattle slurry and mineral fertiliser. All organically amended plots received equal amounts of C. Crop growth was equalised on all plots by applying supplemental mineral N.

Despite equal crop growth in fertilised plots, total seed bank density was lowest in plots amended with compost with low C:N ratio and highest in slurry-amended plots. Observed differences in seed bank densities reflected differences in soil organic carbon content and microbial biomass. At plot level, hard-coated seeds in the seed bank (e. g. Chenopodium spp.) were inversely related to soil microbial activity. Observed differential responses of species to applied fertilisers might be attributed to interspecific differences in resistance against microbial seed degradation.

Due to proper combination of waste materials and agitation in drum composter, a maximum of 66. 5 and 61. 4  °C was achieved in Trial 1 and 2 by observing a temperature level of 55  °C for 4 – 6  d. The study revealed that combinations of waste materials had a major effect on the microbial degradation of waste material and quality of final compost due to its physical properties. However, Trial 1 was observed to have longer thermophilic phase leading to higher degradation of lignocellulosic fractions. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and fluorescent spectroscopy confirmed the decrease in aliphatic to aromatic ratio and increase in polyphenolic compounds of the compost.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the persistence of antibiotics in soil, especially in areas of vegetable cultivation. However, {{there are very few}} studies of the influence of planting regimes on the levels of antibiotic pollution. This work introduces geographical-detector models to investigate the relationship between planting patterns (<b>vegetable</b> planting model, <b>manure</b> type and quantity, planting age, greenhouse area, and topographic elevation) and residual fluoroquinolones (FQs) in soil in a pilot project in Shouguang County, Shandong Province (the largest vegetable-producing area in China). The results led to the following findings. 1. The vegetable planting model is the major determinant of the spatial stratification of FQ in the soil. For example, the "cucumber-cucumber" model (growing cucumbers after cucumbers) has a three-fold power of determinant compared to the "pepper-melon" model (growing melons after peppers). 2. Planting age (years with continuous vegetable cultivation) does not necessarily affect the spatial distribution of FQ owing to their relatively short degradation period. 3. Interactions between risk factors were more significant than the individual factors for FQ pollution. In particular, the interaction between the vegetable planting model and amount of manure resulted in the highest pollution level. The findings of the present study make it possible to introduce effective and practical measures to alleviate pollution of soils by FQ in the study area. Adjustment of the vegetable cultivation models and application of chicken manure (less than 6 kg/m 2 manure annually with a more dry than fresh manure) could be an effective and flexible approach to alleviate FQ pollution. The vegetable planting model is the major determinant of FQ difference in soil. Planting age could not result in spatial pollution differences. Interactions between risk factors should be given more concern. 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|Phytoparasitic {{nematodes}} cause heavy annual yield {{losses and}} thus can be considered among the most dangerous pests {{for a number of}} vegetable crops. Management of these parasites has been traditionally based on synthetic pesticides, but because of their high environmental impact we need to find more sustainable products to control nematodes. Biocidal compounds, naturally occurring as products of plant secondary metabolism, may represent a large source of biocompatible nematicides. This review briefly reports the main botanical groups and plant secondary metabolites with a nematicidal potential, as well as the most effective techniques for their exploitation. Nematotoxic volatile products, such as isothiocyanates and nitriles released from the degradation of glucosinolates present in tissues of Brassicaceae plants or cyanide deriving from the cyanogenic glucosides of some Sorghum species can be exploited for nematode control through the incorporation of fresh or dry plant material into the soil. Commercial liquid formulations based on seed oils from neem (Azadirachta indica Juss.) or sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) or water extracts from quillay (Quillaja saponaria Molina) bark or tagetes (Tagetes erecta L.) are already available for soil treatments over the crop cycle and/or seedling root dipping before t ransplant. Many plant species from Asteraceae family, such as Calendula spp., Chrysanthemum spp. and Artemisia spp., have been also demonstrated to be a potential source of nematicidal products for the control of root-knot and cyst phytonematodes economically relevant to <b>vegetable</b> crops. Green <b>manures</b> or crop rotations with indigenous (Medicago spp., Trifolium spp., Vicia spp., Lupinus albus) and tropical (Mucuna spp., Crotalaria spp) Leguminosae species, as well as soil amendments with their formulated plant biomass, have been reported to achieve a satisfactory nematode suppression, due to the high content of bioactive metabolites (phenols, alkaloids, alcohols and mainly saponins) of these plants. Essential oils {{from a wide range of}} aromatic and medicinal plants and their volatile bioactive components (terpenes, aldheydes, ketones and more) have been largely acknowledged for a high nematicidal activity, both in vitro studies and as soil treatments in water solution or by fumigation. Full exploitation of the high nematicidal potential of these products is strictly related to the development of technical formulations suitable to delay the release and degradation of active components into the soil. Phenolic compounds, such as terpenoids, flavonoids, tannins and coumarins, can also play a relevant role in the formulation of innovative nematicidal products. Commercial formulations of chestnut tannins demonstrated to be highly suppressive to root-knot nematode infestation. Nematicidal effect were reported also for soils amendments with tannin-rich plant materials. Coumarins are among the main agents of the strong nematicidal activity reported for plants from genus Ruta, such as R. graveolens and R. chalepensis. Susceptible of exploitation could be also the nematicidal properties reported for the pyrrolizidine and steroidal alkaloids from many Asteraceae, Leguminosae and Solanaceae species. Review of literature data confirmed the effectiveness of plant products for a sustainable phytonematode management, also due to the low environmental persistance and toxicity to humans, animal and plants of thei r act ive compounds. Multicomponent activity of most plant products also avoids the raising of nematode resistance, as frequently reported for repeated treatments with synthetic nematicides...|$|R

Amaranthus species are adapted to wild conditions unsuitable for exotic vegetables and could be cultivated but information on its fertility requirements, as sole or intercrop, is the key for its domestication and production as a leafy <b>vegetable,</b> particularly where <b>manure</b> is used. Two dry-land and one glasshouse experiments were conducted to {{study the effects of}} sheep kraal manure application rate, intercropping with maize and soil type on growth, fresh and dry matter yields, nutrient uptake and grain yield of a local Amaranthus accession that grows wild in the Eastern Cape. Sheep kraal manure rates ranging from 0 to 10 t ha- 1 and an NPK { 2 : 3 : 4 (30) + 0. 5 % Zn} fertilizer as a positive control, applied at rates recommended for spinach, were tested. In the Gqumahashe experiment, where Amaranthus was grown as a sole crop, low manure rates (≤ 2. 5 t ha- 1) resulted in plant heights and fresh matter yields which were comparable to those in the unfertilized control, whereas higher rates (5 and 10 t ha- 1) and recommended NPK fertilizer had higher levels both at 30 and 60 days after transplanting (DAT) at p < 0. 05. At 30 DAT, manure application rates of ≥ 2. 5 t ha- 1 and the NPK fertilizer treatment, produced greater shoot dry-matter yields (29. 35, 30. 75 and 37. 68 g plant- 1) than the unfertilized control (17. 11 g plant- 1) at p < 0. 05. Uptake of N and P in the leaves increased with increase in manure application rate with N uptake reaching a maximum (308 mg plant- 1) at a manure rate of 2. 5 t ha- 1 which corresponded with the maximum dry matter yield. There was no effect of manure rate or fertilizer on residual soil N and Ca, whereas P, K, Mg and Zn increased. In a pot experiment with soils from Ntselamanzi and Gqumahashe Villages, manure rates ≥ 2. 5 t ha- 1 resulted in plant heights and fresh matter yield that compared well with the NPK fertilizer treatment in the Gqumahashe soil whereas only the 10 t ha- 1 manure treatment was comparable to the NPK fertilizer treatment in the Ntselamanzi soil. Only treatments with ≥ 5 t ha- 1 manure had stem girth (1. 00 and 1. 07 cm) that compared well to NPK fertilizer (1. 03 cm) in the Ntselamanzi soil whereas in the Gqumahashe soil, all manure levels compared well to NPK fertilizer (1. 02 cm). However, no significant difference was observed in plant height and stem girth and fresh matter due to soil type. In both soils, the 1. 3 - 10 t ha- 1 manure treatments had dry leaf weight comparable to plants fertilized with NPK fertilizer (3. 72 g plant- 1 for the Ntselamanzi soil and 3. 65 g plant- 1 for the Gqumahashe soil) and were bigger than the unfertilized control (2. 2 g plant- 1 for the Ntselamanzi soil and 1. 38 g plant- 1 for the Gqumahashe soil) at p < 0. 05. Uptake of N, P and K increased as result of manure application but nonetheless, it was less when compared to plants fertilized with NPK fertilizer in both soils. In a field intercropping experiment carried out at Ntselamanzi, growth and yield of sole and intercropped Amaranthus plants grown with manure improved when compared to the unfertilized control and compared well to NPK fertilizer. At 30 days after transplanting (DAT), both sole and intercropped plants grown with ≥ 2. 5 t ha- 1 manure had fresh and dry matter yield comparable to plants fertilized with NPK fertilizer. At 60 DAT, intercropped plants grown with all manure levels had bigger fresh matter yield when compared to unfertilized control (836. 0 g plant- 1) whereas for sole cropped plants only those grown with ≥ 2. 5 t ha- 1 compared to NPK fertilizer (1467. 7 g plant- 1) at p < 0. 05. Uptake of N, P, K, Ca and Mg increased with increase in manure application in both sole and intercropped Amaranthus. Whereas Amaranthus did not suffer from the competition in the intercrop, maize biomass and grain yield were severely reduced with the effects being evident after 60 DAT. Based on results of this study, it is therefore suggested that, if Amaranthus is to be intercropped with maize under dry land conditions of the Central Region of the Eastern Cape, sheep manure should at least be applied at rate of ≥ 2. 5 t ha- 1 and Amaranthus be harvested at 30 DAT...|$|R
