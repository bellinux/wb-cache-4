5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, <b>vermiculite</b> and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E

Permanent expansion of swelling layers under the electron beam was achieved by intercalation of n alkylammonium ions, especially the octadecylammonium ion. Oriented flakes of clay minerals were prepared by embedding the expanded or non expanded clay minerals in epoxy resin, followed by centrifugation before hardening of the resin. The minerals were then cut perpendicular to 001 using an ultramicrotome.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{empirical}} method to estimate rapidly both mean total ayer charge {{and location of}} charge in smectites and <b>vermiculites</b> is presented, involving exchange with a long-chain alkylammonium ion {{before and after the}} Greene-Kelly test. The method utilizes an empirically determined relationship between XRD basal spacings and the mean layer charges calculated from the conventional n-alkylammonium ion-exchange technique using simple linear regression models to describe the relationships for both monolayer-bilayer and bilayer-pseudotrimolecular layer transitions. The method provides arapid estimation ofthese charge parameters and facilitates the proper identification of both smectites and <b>vermiculites</b> consistent with the AIPEA criteria for classification based on total ayer charge. It is considered superior to conventional methods of differentiation based mainly on expansion and collapse behaviour.

40|$|Although the {{intercalation}} of Fe 3 + into layered phyllosicilicates-especially into smectites-attracted {{much attention}} {{in the past two}} decades, the information about Fe 2 + loaded phyllosilicates is sparse. Here we present an investigation of the Fe 2 + exchanged <b>vermiculites</b> from Santa Olalla and Ojén (Andalusia, Spain) by means of Mössbauer spectroscopy. The room temperature Mössbauer spectra are very {{similar to those of the}} starting compounds (Na forms) except for a decrease of the contribution of structural Fe 3 + and a concomitant increase of the contribution of Fe 2 + sites, indicating an internal redox process. The extent of this redox reaction is different for the two <b>vermiculites.</b> Thus, the intercalated Fe 2 + acts as an electron mediator from the external medium to the structural Fe 3 + ions. A new component attributable to intercalated Fe 2 + is practically invisible in the room temperature Mössbauer spectra, but increases strongly and continuously during cooling to 4. 2 K, where it is the dominant feature of the Mössbauer patterns. At 4. 2 K, its quadruple splitting amounts to 3. 31 mm/s, which is in excellent agreement with the quadrupole slitting of Fe 2 + coordinated to six water molecules in a highly symmetric octahedral arrangement. The strong decrease of the Mössbauer-Lamb factor of this component with increasing temperature indicates a weak bonding of the Fe 2 + in the interlayer space. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.
