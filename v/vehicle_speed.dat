5|$|One {{study has}} shown {{theoretically}} that, while a bike leaned in a turn, road undulations can excite the weave mode {{at high speed}} or the wobble mode at low speed if either of their frequencies match the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.|$|E
5|$|Lakes may form in basins {{where there}} is {{sufficient}} precipitation or meltwater from glaciers above. They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low-lying areas. When the lakes dry up, they leave a crust or hardpan behind. This area of deposited clay, silt or sand {{is known as a}} playa. The deserts of North America have more than one hundred playas, many of them relics of Lake Bonneville which covered parts of Utah, Nevada and Idaho during the last ice age when the climate was colder and wetter. These include the Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake and many dry lake beds. The smooth flat surfaces of playas have been used for attempted <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> records at Black Rock Desert and Bonneville Speedway and the United States Air Force uses Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert as runways for aircraft and the space shuttle.|$|E

25|$|During {{a rocket}} launch, as the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> increases, and the {{atmosphere}} thins, {{there is a point}} of maximum aerodynamic drag called Max Q. This determines the minimum aerodynamic strength of the vehicle, as the rocket must avoid buckling under these forces.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{turbo lag}} is mistaken for engine speeds that are below boost {{threshold}}. If engine speed is below a turbocharger's boost threshold rpm then {{the time needed}} for the vehicle to build speed and rpm could be considerable, maybe even tens of seconds for a heavy vehicle starting at low <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> in a high gear. This wait for <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> increase is not turbo lag, it is improper gear selection for boost demand. Once the vehicle reaches sufficient speed to provide the required rpm to reach boost threshold, {{there will be a}} far shorter delay while the turbo itself builds rotational energy and transitions to positive boost, only this last part of the delay in achieving positive boost is the turbo lag.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores how <b>vehicle</b> <b>speeds</b> {{are related}} to equitable, {{environmental}} and economic sustainability of urban areas. This relationship is manifested primarily through an association between <b>vehicle</b> <b>speeds</b> and road crash casualties, severity of pedestrian crashes, generation of harmful emissions, and relative desirability of neighboring land. Reported research findings describing each of these associations is presented and discussed. Reported experience with implementing various methods of influencing <b>vehicle</b> <b>speeds</b> is then presented and discussed, including automated enforcement, “self-explaining roads”, and in-vehicle systems, among others. In order to support increasing sustainability of urban areas the following are recommended: (1) speed limits should be set to limit casualty risk, not according to driver choices,(2) roadways in developed areas should be designed with 10 ft lanes and on street parking and sidewalks, and (3) <b>vehicle</b> <b>speeds</b> in downtown and residential areas should be kept below 25 mi/h (preferably 20 mi/h), The paper also identifies gaps in knowledge about speed and sustainability...|$|R

25|$|Odometry: The <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> and {{distance}} traveled is measured on two independent channels by two pulse generators mounted on different axles.

25|$|It is {{possible}} to make a Doppler radar without any pulsing, known as a continuous-wave radar (CW radar), by sending out a very pure signal of a known frequency. CW radar is ideal for determining the radial component of a target's velocity. CW radar is typically used by traffic enforcement to measure <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> quickly and accurately where range is not important.|$|E

25|$|Worldwide, {{road traffic}} is {{becoming}} ever safer, {{in part due}} to efforts by the government to implement safety features in cars (e.g., seat belts, air bags, etc.), reduce unsafe driving practices (e.g., speeding, drinking and driving and texting and driving) and make road design more safe by adding features such as speed bumps, which reduce <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed,</b> and roundabouts, which reduce the likelihood of a head-on-collision (as compared with an intersection).|$|E
25|$|The C5 {{was also}} the first Corvette to {{incorporate}} a drive-by-wire throttle; and variable-effort steering, whereby the assist level of the power steering is varied according to <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> (more at lower speeds, less at higher speeds). Also notable, though rarely discussed, the C5 generation was the first model to adopt the parallel or 'tandem' windshield wiper configuration, abandoning the opposed configuration that was used on every previous Corvette model since the first in 1953.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a control system is a car's cruise control, which is a device {{designed}} to maintain <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> at a constant desired or reference speed provided by the driver.

The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's throttle position which determines how much power the engine delivers.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 2000s, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} in interest {{in the idea of}} moving or optimizing the headlight beam in response not only to vehicular steering and suspension dynamics, but also to ambient weather and visibility conditions, <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed,</b> and road curvature and contour. A task force under the EUREKA organization, composed primarily of European automakers, lighting companies and regulators began working to develop design and performance specifications for what is known as Adaptive Front-Lighting Systems, commonly AFS.|$|E
25|$|Some drives (such as VASIMR or electrodeless plasma thruster) {{actually}} can significantly vary their exhaust velocity. This {{can help reduce}} propellant usage or improve acceleration {{at different stages of}} the flight. However the best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the exhaust velocity is close to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed.</b> Proposed ion and plasma drives usually have exhaust velocities enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15000m/s compared to a mission delta-v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about 4000m/s).|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than the}} {{mechanical}} linkages employed in earlier directional-headlamp systems, AFS relies on electronic sensors, transducers and actuators. Other AFS techniques include special auxiliary optical systems within a vehicle's headlamp housings. These auxiliary systems may be switched {{on and off}} as the vehicle and operating conditions call for light or darkness at the angles covered by the beam the auxiliary optics produce. A typical system measures steering angle and <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> to swivel the headlamps. The most advanced AFS systems use GPS signals to anticipate changes in road curvature, rather than simply reacting to them.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} and ongoing method of measuring <b>vehicle</b> <b>speeds</b> {{was introduced in}} South Australia in 2007 {{in order to assess}} the effects of speed reduction countermeasures and to monitor the speed behaviour of South Australian motorists over time. About 130 sites around South Australia have speed measurements taken for a one week period at the same time each year. This Report summarises the data collected in 2014 and makes comparisons with previous surveys and partial surveys dating back to 2002. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>speeds</b> on South Australian 50 km/h roads were lower in 2014 than in 2013. This continues a general downward trend in speeds on those roads since 2002 (although it is more pronounced in Adelaide than in rural areas). <b>Vehicle</b> <b>speeds</b> on South Australian 60 km/h roads were essentially unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013. However, unlike rural 60 km/h roads, the Adelaide 60 km/h roads have shown previous reductions in <b>speed.</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>speeds</b> on rural hills 80 km/h roads were lower in 2014 than in 2013 continuing a reduction in speeds on those roads starting in 2013. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>speeds</b> on 100 and 110 km/h rural roads were essentially unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013 with both these road types showing very little change since surveys on them began in 2006 (although examination of the upper end speeds suggests that high end speeds are becoming less common on these roads over time).
