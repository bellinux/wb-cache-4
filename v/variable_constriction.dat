50|$|Due to {{the varying}} complications, {{different}} modifications of PAB {{have been developed}} to improve outcomes. Adjustable pulmonary artery banding has been available since 1972, allowing <b>variable</b> <b>constriction.</b> FloWatch (Leman Medical, Geneva, Switzerland: www.lemanmedical.com), an adjustable band, was created and has successfully been tested to overcome complications due to non-optimal sizing of the band. FloWatch is a wireless, battery-free, implantable device that allows the band size to be adjusted without the need for additional surgeries or other invasive procedures. The narrowing of the pulmonary artery can be controlled weeks or even months after the operation. Reports also show that the recovery period in patients that obtained the FloWatch device was faster and smoother in comparison to those that received the traditional PAB method. However FloWatch is only suitable for children with a body weight ranging from 3 kg to10kg.|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To examine, in vivo, the {{anterior}} optic nerve vasomotor effects of chronic apraclonidine hydrochloride in rabbits. METHODS: After local treatment in one randomly chosen eye with apraclonidine hydrochloride 0. 5 % over 21 days, the microvasculature of the optic nerve was examined in five rabbits using an intraluminal microvascular corrosion casting technique. The investigators were masked {{as to which}} eye was treated. The vasoconstriction near the branching point of arterioles supplying the optic nerve was calculated {{as a percentage of}} the downstream vessel calibre. An average constriction was calculated and compared between the treated and the contralateral, untreated, eyes by means of a two tailed t test for paired <b>variables.</b> <b>Constriction</b> values of a total of 72 arterioles supplying the optic nerve were obtained for the five rabbits. RESULTS: The average constriction in the treated and the control eyes was comparable (p = 0. 96). CONCLUSION: Chronic administration of apraclonidine hydrochloride 0. 5 % produces no observable optic nerve vasomotor effects in the rabbit eye...|$|R
40|$|The radial {{growth of}} roots largely affects and reorganizes the porous or crack {{networks}} of soils and substrates. We studied {{the consequences of}} a radial steric constriction on the root growth and the feedback force developed by the root on the solid phase. We developed an original method of photoelasticity to measure in situ root forces. By changing the gap width (0. 5 to 2. 3 mm) between two photoelastic disks we applied <b>variable</b> radial <b>constrictions</b> to root growth and simultaneously measured the corresponding radial forces. Changes in morphology and forces of primary roots of chick pea (Cicer arietinum L.) seedlings were recorded by time-lapse imaging every 24 min up to 5 days. The probability of root entering the gap depended on the gap size but was also affected by circumnutation. Compared to non-constrained root controls, no significant morphological change (elongation, diameter) was measured outside the gap zone. Inside the gap zone, outer cortex cells were compressed, the central cylinder was unaffected. Radial forces were increasing with time but no force levelling was observed even after 5 days. Radial constrictions applied to roots did not significantly reduce their growth. The radial force was related to the root strain in the gap...|$|R
40|$|The {{enhancement}} of Herschel–Quincke (HQ) waveguides to incorporate adaptive capa-bilities is investigated. Passive HQ waveguides {{are known to}} provide noise attenuation in pipes and ducts at selective narrow frequency bands associated with their resonances. The approach to achieve adaptation is to produce a frequency shift in these resonances to allow targeting incoming tonal noise of variable frequency. The frequency shift is obtained by placing a <b>variable</b> cross-section <b>constriction</b> along {{the interior of the}} wave-guide. Two adaptive devices are considered. The first consists of a ball with fixed diame-ter that can be axially displaced inside the waveguide. Then, the frequency tuning is obtained {{as a function of the}} ball position. The second device consists of a diaphragm at fixed axial location which can be deformed to obtain a variable cross section. In this case, the frequency shift is obtained as a function of the diaphragm deflection. The inter-nal acoustic dynamics of the two devices are investigated both analytically and experi-mentally. The created constriction inside the HQ waveguide is modeled as a series of constant cross-section tube elements with small finite area jump between adjacent pieces. The model is validated by comparing the predicted dynamics with experimental data from an extended impedance tube setup based on the two-microphone technique. Finally, attenuation predictions on a one-dimensional pipe are presented in order to illustrate the performance of the proposed adaptive HQ waveguides. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4023830...|$|R
40|$|The {{intention}} of the present work is {{to carry out a}} systematic analysis of flow behavior in a two-dimensional tube (modeled as artery) with a locally <b>variable</b> shaped <b>constrictions.</b> The simulated artery, containing a viscous incompressible fluid representing the flowing blood, is treated to be complaint as well as rigid tube. The shape of the stenosis in the arterial lumen is chosen to be symmetric as well as asymmetric about the middle cross section perpendicular to the axis of the tube in order to improve resemblance to the in-vivo situation. The constricted tube is transformed into a straight tube and the resulting governing equations are solved by a numerical method with Reynolds number and ‘n’, a number giving the shape of the constriction as parameters. The influences of these parameters on the haemodynamic factors like wall shear stress, pressure and velocity have been analyzed. The present findings demonstrate that the flow resistance decreases as the shape of a smooth stenosis changes and maximum resistance is attained in case of a symmetric stenosis. But the length of separation increases in case of asymmetric constrictions and the oscillation in the shear layer appears earlier in case of asymmetric constriction than {{that in the case of}} symmetric constriction. Maximum resistance is attained in case of rigid stenosed tube rather than the flexible one.

40|$|The high {{diversity}} of chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) in Mexico offers an excellent alternative {{to search for}} wild and semi-domesticated genotypes as sources {{of resistance to the}} complex Bemisia tabaci (Genn.) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) -Begomovirus, which has caused enormous losses in commercial production of various horticultural crops. The goal of the present work was to characterize ex situ 18 genotypes of C. annuum from southern Mexico through 47 morphological descriptors, and to evaluate its response to the B. tabaci-Begomovirus complex. Morphological characterization showed the <b>variables</b> calyx annular <b>constriction</b> (CAC), number of branch bifurcation (NBB), and calyx pigmentation (CP) had the highest variation. Principal components analysis (PCA) of 47 morphological characteristics showed that 12 components were selected as meaningful factors. These components explained 94 % of the variation. Cluster analysis showed three major clusters and seven sub-clusters. On the other hand, evaluation of the response to B. tabaci-Begomovirus showed that the genotypes have differential susceptibility to this vector-pathogen complex. Genotypes 'Chawa', 'Blanco', 'Maax' and 'X'catic' were into the low susceptibility to B. tabaci and low severity of viral symptoms. Surprisingly, the genotype 'Simojovel' showed high susceptibility to whitefly, but was grouped into genotypes with low symptom severity. This study shows the potential of native germplasm of pepper to explore sources of resistance to the B. tabaci-Begomovirus complex...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{integrity}} {{of a cell}} depends upon stable chro-mosomes where centromeres play {{an essential role in}} cell division (Pluta et al., 1990). The major cis- cting genetic locus of a chromosome is the centromere (Willard, 1990). Originally, the term “primary constriction ” was used to describe this organelle; henceforth, other constricted areas were referred to as “secondary constrictions”. For some unknown reasons, the human chromsomes 1, 9 and 16 have highly <b>variable</b> secondary <b>constriction</b> regions (qh) which frequently result in pronounced morphological variations within homologous chromosomes and are composed of het-erochromatic DNA (Erdtmann, 1982; Vogt, 1990). Various types of pericentric inversions have been observed due to the variable breakpoints within qh regions (Verma et al., 1981, 1982). Inversions, per se, generally have dire conse-quences. Inversions involving the qh region in human chro-mosomes 1, 9 and 16 have unknown functions whose inher-itance is Mendelian (Babu and Verma, 1986, 1987). Consequently, they {{have been the subject of}} detailed scrutiny in recent years (Verma, 1988, 1990). Using the CBG-banding (C-band by barium hydroxide using Giemsa) technique, both the primary (centromere) and secondary constriction regions (qh) stain uniformly dark, masking differentiation of these two areas. Thus, the structural organization of these two regions and their boundaries could not be delineated. In recent years, mole-cular ytogenetic techniques have unequivocally shown that the centromeres, together with their pericentromeric hete-rochromatin, are not homogeneous structures in spite of their uniform staining properties with conventional tech-niques (Alexandrov et al., 1988; Singer, 1982). This het-erogen ity is presumably due to accumulation of different fractions of repeated satellite DNA sequences in the peri-centromeric heterochromatin (Willard and Waye, 1987 a; Cho et al., 1991). A number of studies using cloned satel-lite probes have suggested the existence of two broad classes of human satellite DNAs (Rocchi et al., 1991; Gosd n et al., 1975, 1981). The major component of one class consists of relatively short, tandem repeat units located primarily in the qh regions, while a second class of sequences called alphoid satellite DNA, consisting of 171 bp repeats, is localized to all centromeric regions (Brutlag...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the utility of left ventricular expansion velocities in differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Background. Several {{studies have shown that}} left ventricular diastolic expansion is influenced by the elastic recoil forces of the myocardium. These forces are affected by intrinsic myocardial disease but should be preserved when diastole is impaired as a result of extrinsic causes. Methods. Using Doppler tissue imaging, we measured peak early velocity of longitudinal axis expansion (Ea) in 8 patients with constrictive pericarditis, 7 patients with restriction and 15 normal volunteers. Transmitral early (E) and late (A) Doppler flow velocities, left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes, ejection fraction and mitral annular M-mode displacement were also compared between the groups. Results. The Eavalue was significantly higher in normal subjects (14. 5 ± 4. 7 cm/s [mean ±SD]) and in patients with constriction (14. 8 ± 4. 8 cm/s) than in those with restriction (5. 1 ± 1. 4 cm/s, p < 0. 001 constriction vs. restriction). There was weak correlation between Eaand the extent of annular displacement (r = 0. 55, p = 0. 004) and the E/A ratio (r = 0. 44, p = 0. 03). There was no correlation between Eaand E (r = 0. 33, p = 0. 07) or ejection fraction (r = 0. 21, p = 0. 26). By multivariate analysis, Eawas the best <b>variable</b> for differentiating <b>constriction</b> from restriction. Conclusions. Our study indicates that longitudinal axis expansion velocities are markedly reduced in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy. The poor correlation found with transvalvular flow velocities suggests that Eamay be relatively preload independent. The measurement of longitudinal axis expansion velocities provides a clinically useful distinction between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy and may prove to be valuable in the study of diastolic function...|$|R
40|$|Ephedra, or ma huang, {{refers to}} the above ground portion of the plants that {{comprise}} the genus ephedra. Although the species of ephedra differ in their chemical composition, the content of biologically active compounds in these plants is mainly due to ephedrine (other compounds being pseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine cathine, and norephedrine phenylpropanolamine). Ephedrine is similar in chemical structure and biological function to amphetamine, although having a 25 -fold lower biological potency. Nonetheless, ephedrine is a potent central and peripheral nervous system stimulant, causing the stimulation of both Î± and Î² adrenergic receptors, {{and the release of}} dopamine within the brain and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from sympathetic nerves within and external to the CNS. These mechanisms of action cause bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, increases in heart rate and blood pressure, <b>variable</b> peripheral vasculature <b>constriction</b> and dilation, general feelings of emotional and/or psychological arousal and increased alertness, and an accelerated metabolic rate. The biological responses to ephedrine have lead to its use as a stimulant in efforts to improve exercise performance, and assist in weight loss. It has been estimated that at least 3 billion doses of over-the-counter ephedrine or extracts from ephedra were ingested in the U. S. in 2000 for the purpose of stimulating increased weight loss. In addition, compounds high in ephedrine, such as over-the-counter medications to treat sinus congestion or symptoms of the common cold, can be and are used to synthesize the illegal drug metamphetamine. Intake of ephedrine exposes the user to unacceptable negative side effects, including mood disturbances, abnormal heart function, hypertension, gastrointestinal dysfunction and headache, while providing small amounts of added weight loss and/or central nervous system stimulation. Furthermore, individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease or other illnesses may be at more serious health risk when taking ephedrine. Individuals who need to lose weight (body fat) should rely on modifications to diet and increased daily physical activity and exercise. The need for body fat loss rather than gross weight loss should also be recommended and understood. Where additional assistance is needed in body fat reduction, individuals should consult a registered dietitian or their physician...|$|R
