Willis died on his sixty-first birthday, January 20, 1867, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Four days later, {{the day of his}} funeral, all bookstores in the city were closed as a token of respect. His pallbearers included Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Samuel Gridley Howe, and James Thomas Fields.|$|E
5|$|A {{report that}} King Charles was <b>very</b> <b>sick</b> sent the Yorks back to England post-haste. They feared the King's eldest illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, and {{commander}} of England's armed forces, might usurp the crown if Charles died in their absence. The matter {{was compounded by}} the fact that Monmouth enjoyed the support of the Exclusionists, who held a majority in the House of Commons of England. Charles survived but, feeling the Yorks returned to court too soon, sent James and Mary to Edinburgh, where they stayed on-and-off for the next three years. Lodging in Holyrood Palace, the Yorks had to make do without Ladies Anne and Isabella, who stayed in London on Charles's orders. The Yorks were recalled to London in February 1680, only to return again to Edinburgh that autumn; this time they went on a more honourable footing: James was created King's Commissioner to Scotland. Separated from Lady Isabella once again, Mary sank into a state of sadness, exacerbated by the passing of the Exclusion bill in the Commons. Lady Isabella, thus far the only one of Mary's children to survive infancy, died in February 1681. Isabella's death plunged Mary into a religious mania, worrying her physician. At the same time as news reached Holyrood of Isabella's death, Mary's mother was falsely accused of offering £10,000 for the murder of the King. The accuser, a pamphleteer, was executed by order of the King.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – Non-invasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) {{has become}} the standard of care for most patients with ventilatory failure due to an acute exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). In all but a small minority, even of the <b>very</b> <b>sickest,</b> there is little to be lost by at least a short trial of NIV. In patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, NIV results in a more rapid physiological improvement and resolu-tion of dyspnoea, but the benefits in terms of survival have been called into question by two recent randomised controlled trials. There are no randomised controlled trials of NIV in patients with acute ventilatory failure due to obesity but the outcome from invasive ventilation is poor and the results of NIV encouraging. Finally, NIV may have a role during the transition from active care, aimed to extend life, to palliative care.

25|$|It is {{believed}} that between people, Ebola disease spreads only by {{direct contact with the}} blood or other body fluids of a person who has developed symptoms of the disease. Body fluids that may contain Ebola viruses include saliva, mucus, vomit, feces, sweat, tears, breast milk, urine and semen. The WHO states that only people who are <b>very</b> <b>sick</b> are able to spread Ebola disease in saliva, and whole virus has not been reported to be transmitted through sweat. Most people spread the virus through blood, feces and vomit. Entry points for the virus include the nose, mouth, eyes, open wounds, cuts and abrasions. Ebola may be spread through large droplets; however, this {{is believed}} to occur only when a person is <b>very</b> <b>sick.</b> This contamination can happen if a person is splashed with droplets. Contact with surfaces or objects contaminated by the virus, particularly needles and syringes, may also transmit the infection. The virus is able to survive on objects for a few hours in a dried state, and can survive for a few days within body fluids outside of a person.|$|E

Since he was a major shareholder of Falkner's Railroad, the plan was soon carried out. The school became quite a success and 3 generations of Lowrey's became presidents of the school himself, two of his sons and a grandson. Following several years of teaching at the Blue Mountain College, Lowrey became <b>very</b> <b>sick</b> and, in 1882, his doctors alerted him that his heart was very weak.

What likely now would have been diagnosed as a brain tumor or gastric cancer was identified by doctors of the College of Medicine at the time as “the mother,” a.k.a. wandering womb – an imprecise medical diagnosis employed…to cover ailments that were thought to attend upon feminine frailty.” Her symptoms included stomach pain, sleeplessness, fever, and vomiting. A cure could not be found, and she wasted away at the countess of Bedford’s house in Twickenham, unable to hold down food or liquids.|$|E

40|$|A {{decade of}} {{research}} on home- and community-based long-term care shows that few of the assumptions behind expectations of tis potential cost-effectiveness were warranted. Few who use home- and community-based long-term care {{would otherwise have been}} long-stayers in nursing homes. Long-stayers tend to be older, sicker, more dependent, and poorer in social resources than those who use community care. Fewer still who use community care actually have their institutional stay averted or shortened by its use, even if they are at risk. But more effective targeting on those most likely to be institutionalized may lead to high screening costs and small, inefficient programs, because few patients in the community fit the profile for high risk of institutionalization. Conversely, the <b>very</b> <b>sickest</b> and most dependent patients may be cheaper to serve in a nursing home than in the community. Patient outcome benefits have also been limited: except for the higher contentment levels found in some studies, community care appears to produce no special outcome benefits in longevity, physical or mental functioning, or social activity levels. Nonetheless, community care serves a sick, dependent, and [...] most people would agree [...] deserving population of patients and their caretakers. A refocusing of public policy to target specifically on the functionally dependent rather than the aged per se may be the best hope for public support for community care...|$|R

25|$|A {{search of}} Chikatilo's {{belongings}} revealed {{he had been}} in possession of a folding knife and two lengths of rope. A sample of Chikatilo's blood was taken, and he was placed in a cell inside the KGB headquarters in Rostov with a police informer, who was instructed to engage Chikatilo in conversation and elicit any information he could from him. The next day, 21 November, formal questioning of Chikatilo began. The interrogation was performed by Issa Kostoyev. The strategy chosen by the police to elicit a confession was to lead Chikatilo to believe that he was a <b>very</b> <b>sick</b> man in need of medical help. The intention was to give Chikatilo hope that if he confessed, he would not be prosecuted by reason of insanity. Police knew their case against Chikatilo was largely circumstantial, and under Soviet law, they had 10 days in which they could legally hold a suspect before either charging or releasing him.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{healthcare}} costs were approximately $3.2 trillion or nearly $10,000 per person on average in 2015. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%). U.S. costs in 2016 were substantially higher than other OECD countries, at 17.2% GDP versus 12.4% GDP {{for the next}} most expensive country (Switzerland). For scale, a 5% GDP difference represents about $1 trillion or $3,000 per person. Some of the many reasons cited for the cost differential with other countries include: Higher administrative costs of a private system with multiple payment processes; higher costs for the same products and services; more expensive volume/mix of services with higher usage of more expensive specialists; aggressive treatment of <b>very</b> <b>sick</b> elderly versus palliative care; less use of government intervention in pricing; and higher income levels driving greater demand for healthcare. Healthcare costs are a fundamental driver of health insurance costs, which leads to coverage affordability challenges for millions of families. There is ongoing debate whether the current law (ACA/Obamacare) and the Republican alternatives (AHCA and BCRA) do enough to address the cost challenge.|$|E
