40|$|Abstract:- Recently, {{owing to}} a high demand of and high {{dependence}} on electric power, {{the reliability of the}} distribution voltage of electric power systems has become more important. 22 kV high <b>voltage</b> cutout <b>fuses</b> have been used widely, but some melting accidents have occurred due to pollution/contamination of bushings. As the number of contaminants in bushings increases, the electric fields on the fuse element surface rise to a critical level, triggering corona discharge. A fuse element material that is more resistant to corona discharge than the Ag element is desired. A new type of current-limiting fuse made of stainless steel wires, which is low-cost and simple in design has been developed. Characteristics tests, including a blocking test with a high surge current when a voltage is applied, have been conducted. Using a model fuse, it was confirmed that this new type of fuse possesses similar performance characteristics to those with an Ag element.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method of {{analyzing}} the deformability of fused cells in a microfluidic array device. Electrical stresses—generated by applying voltages (4 – 20 V) across discrete co-planar microelectrodes {{along the side}} walls of a microfluidic channel—have been used to electro-deform fused and unfused stem cells. Under an electro-deformation force induced by applying an alternating current (AC) signal, we observed significant electro-deformation phenomena. The experimental {{results show that the}} fused stem cells were stiffer than the unfused stem cells at a relatively low voltage (< 16 V). However, at a relatively high <b>voltage,</b> the <b>fused</b> stem cells were more easily deformed than were the unfused stem cells. In addition, the electro-deformation process is modeled based on the Maxwell stress tensor and structural mechanics of cells. The theoretical results show that a positive correlation is found between the deformation of the cell and the applied voltage, which is consistent with the experimental results. Combined with a numerical analysis and experimental study, the results showed that the significant difference of the deformation ratio of the fused and unfused cells is not due to their size difference. This demonstrates that some other properties of cell membranes (such as the membrane structure) were also changed in the electrofusion process, in addition to the size modification of that process...|$|R
40|$|Keywords:hybrid current {{limiting}} fuse, arc trigger, {{fault current}} limiter, current density Abstract. With conventional high <b>voltage</b> current limiting <b>fuse,</b> the rated current is usually below 200 A. The rated current {{of the state}} of the art arc triggering hybrid current limiting fuse is only 600 A, with its interrupting capability being 25 kA, and still can’t meet the requirements of modern industrial application. With the arc triggering hybrid current limiting fuses, the major obstacle to higher rated current and interrupting capability lies in the long operation time of the arc trigger. Increasing the current density of arc trigger notches can effectively improve the operation speed of the trigger. Simulation and parameter optimization of the arc trigger are conducted by using ANSYS 11. 0 to attain the optimal fuse element structure. In this study, the notch current density of the arc trigger was as high as 3300 A/mm 2, and the trigger can be used in the hybrid current limiting fuse of rated 35 kV, 2 kA and 40 kA interrupting capability...|$|R
40|$|Current {{limiting}} fuses {{are widely}} used to protect the thyristors in DC drive systems. One very important problem is {{the choice of the}} correct <b>voltage</b> rating for <b>fuses</b> protecting regenerative DC drives, where many types of fault may occur, which makes fuse protection difficult. In the event of a commutation failure while regenerating, the fuses need to interrupt the loop supplied by the AC and DC voltages acting in series, which is the most difficult case for protection by fuses. In this paper a detailed study of the complete interruption process has been investigated by modeling of arcing process of the fuse protection against the regenerative circuit internal commutation fault. The effect of varying the motor time constant, supply impedance, number of fuses used to clear the fault and DC machine rating on the total transient response is studied. The model of a 200 A fuse is employed in this study. Fuses in series with both the semiconductor devices (F 1) and fuses in AC lines (F 2) are considered. Comparison was made between arc energy produced for fuses protecting the regenerative circuit if failure occurs, with the arc energy produced in a standard AC test in order to investigate the required voltage rating for the fuse...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{reference}} books, including Random House's American Slang, {{claim that}} the term comes from the German word glitschen ("to slip") and the Yiddish word gletshn ("to slide or skid"). Either way, it {{is a relatively new}} term. It was first widely defined for the American people by Bennett Cerf on the June 20, 1965 episode of What's My Line as [...] "a kink... when anything goes wrong down there Kennedy, they say there's been a slight glitch." [...] Astronaut John Glenn explained the term in his section of the book Into Orbit, writing thatAnother term we adopted to describe some of our problems was [...] "glitch." [...] Literally, a glitch is a spike or change in voltage in an electrical circuit which takes place when the circuit suddenly has a new load put on it. You have probably noticed a dimming of lights in your home when you turn a switch or start the dryer or the television set. Normally, these changes in voltage are protected by fuses. A glitch, however, is such a minute change in <b>voltage</b> that no <b>fuse</b> could protect against it.John Daly further defined the word on the July 4, 1965 episode of the same show, saying that it's a term used by the Air Force at Cape Kennedy, in the process of launching rockets, [...] "it means something's gone wrong and you can't figure out what it is so you call it a [...] "glitch". Later, on July 23, 1965, Time Magazine felt it necessary to define it in an article: [...] "Glitches—a spaceman's word for irritating disturbances." [...] In relation to the reference by Time Magazine, the term has been believed to enter common usage during the American Space Race of the 1950s, where it was used to describe minor faults in the rocket hardware that were difficult to pinpoint.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} {{for the assessment of}} soil bulk density (BD), which relies on an existed model to predict BD as a function of a visible and near infrared spectroscopy (vis-NIRS) measured gravimetric moisture content (v) and a frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) measured volumetric moisture content (uv). A total of 1013 soil samples collected from England and Wales, from 32 arable and grassland fields with different soil types were measured with a vis-NIR spectrophotometer (LabSpec 1 Pro Near Infrared Analyzer, Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc., USA) after in situ measurement with a ThetaProbe FDR (Delta-T Device Ltd.). Two calibration methods of the vis-NIRS were tested, namely, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural network (ANN). ThetaProbe calibration was performed with traditional methods and ANN. ANN analyses were based on a single- variable input or multiple-variable input (data fusion). During ANN - data fusion analysis, vis-NIRS spectra and ThetaProbe output <b>voltage</b> (V) were <b>fused</b> in one matrix with or without laboratory measured texture fractions and organic matter content (OM). For the vis-NIRS and ThetaProbe traditional calibration, samples were divided into calibration (75 %) and prediction (25 %) sets, whereas for the ANN analyses these were divided into calibration (65 %), test (10 %) and independent validation (25 %) sets. Results proved that high measurement accuracy can be obtained for v and uv with PLSR and the best performing traditional calibration method of the ThetaProbe with R 2 values of 0. 91 and 0. 97, and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEp) values of 0. 027 g g 1 and 0. 019 cm 3 cm 3, respectively. However, the ANN - data fusion resulted in improved accuracy (R 2 = 0. 98 and RMSEp = 0. 014 g g 1 and 0. 015 cm 3 cm 3, respectively). This data fusion approach led to the best accuracy for BD assessment when vis-NIRS spectra and ThetaProbe V only were used as input data (R 2 = 0. 81 and RMSEp = 0. 095 g cm 3). It can be concluded that BD can be measured by combining the vis-NIRS and FDR techniques based on ANN-data fusion approach...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This dissertation presents theoretical and experimental results from a research program that was aimed at finding practical ways of transferring energy to various loads, mainly from an inductive energy store fluxed by a primary store such as a capacitor bank. The main obj ecti ves of the work were to investigate and develop high power opening and closing switches, together with the transfer circuits needed to generate the fast (less than lOOns duration) high energy, pulses required in many applications. The study was to include a feasibility study {{of the use of}} the Plasma Erosion Opening Switch (PEOS) in such a system. To produce the large fast pulses required, an opening switch is required that: * Carry a current of the order of several kA during the inductor storage time. It should also be able to interrupt this current and to withstand the high voltage it will experience as the current is subsequently transferred to a load. * Conduct {{for as long as possible}} (up to one quarter period of the current waveform), to maximise the inductively stored energy which can be transferred to xhe load when the switch opens. * Open to an impedance that is large compared to the load impedance. This ensures that most of the inductively stored energy is transferred to the load. Open sufficiently rapidly to produce the required sharp pulse of voltage. In pulsed-power applications, energy is usually supplied from slow and relatively inexpensive power sources such as a capacitor bank, or an explosive flux-compression generator, which deliver large quantities of energy in the lO-lOO time range. Although no single switch is currently available which has such a long conduction time, together with a nanosecond opening time, the PEOS is a potential candidate. To overcome its short conduction time, while still obtaining an opening time of less than lOOns, the PEOS is used together with an additional slower stage or stages of switching. The key to this method is that each successive switching stage produces a considerably increased voltage. Various different types of switch were investigated and these are described in the thesis. Particular consideration is paid to the performance of the PEOS, as the final conditioning stage. Exploding foils are also investigated, together with a novel Automatic Exploding Foil Change-Over Switch, since an exploding foil opening switch is needed to condition the output of the capacitor bank before the PEOS. The initial resistance of the PEOS is very low, and the change-over switch is required to ensure that the current transfer takes place when the <b>voltage</b> across the <b>fuse</b> approaches its peak value. An important part of the investigation was to develop a mathematical model of the PEOS, as a part of the power condi tioning circuit, in order to simulate the system for different load conditions. The thesis explains the design, operation and performance characteristics of the various pulsed-power components, such as capacitor banks, closing and opening switches, pulse transformer, the vacuum system required for a PEOS, and high voltage and current measurement techniques...|$|R
