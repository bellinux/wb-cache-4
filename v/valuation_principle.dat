Our contention is that the first decade following the initial harvesting of human {{embryonic stem}} cells (1998 - 2008) in the United States was characterized by institutional and policy responses that created a non-deliberative environment that hindered the process of instrumental valuation of stem cell research. This paper concludes that the current conditions of limited corporate involvement are favorable toward a democratic discussion of the legitimacy of stem cell research, but this will require overt challenges to political elites' attempts to control the creation and flow of instrumental knowledge on stem cell research. instrumental <b>valuation</b> <b>principle,</b> stem cell research, institutionalism, democratic justice,...|$|E

The <b>valuation</b> <b>principle</b> is consistent with no-arbitrage and can be interpreted as a generalization of Schweizer's indifference principle [17]. We show that in a complete financial market or, in general, if the writer has an exponential utility function, our premium is the supremum over all "utility-indifference premiums" related to all fixed random payoffs we get by fixing the decision function of the holder. In general, our premium can be even larger than this supremum as we show by an example...|$|E

40|$|Article 31 of the Fourth Directive, which {{specifies}} {{the general}} <b>valuation</b> <b>principles</b> {{to be applied}} {{in the preparation of}} financial statements, shows a difference in emphasis between the different language versions.

The earlier drafts of the Directive are examined in an attempt to trace the development of this difference between the English and the other language versions. It seems that the particular wording of Article 31 with its relatively greater weight on prudence probably results from UK influence, more specifically from SSAP 2. A possible solution is then suggested as to why this particular emphasis on prudence was not retained in the English version of the Directive. Further, it is noted that German law did not explicitly make prudence an overriding concept before the Fourth Directive and nor does the German implementation of Article 31. ...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} of risk neutral distributions for pricing index options resulting from the hypothesis of the risk neutral <b>valuation</b> <b>principle.</b> After justifying this hypothesis, we shall focus on parametric estimation methods for the risk neutral density functions determining the risk neutral distributions. We we shall differentiate between the direct and the indirect way. Following the direct way, parameter vectors are estimated which characterize the distributions from selected statistical families to model the risk neutral distributions. The idea of the indirect approach is to calibrate characteristic parameter vectors for stochastic models of the asset price processes, and then to extract the risk neutral density function via Fourier methods. For every of the reviewed methods the calculation of option prices under hypothetically true risk neutral distributions is a building block. We shall give explicit formula for call and put prices w. r. t. reviewed parametric statistical families used for direct estimation.
