40|$|The {{effects of}} avian and mammal seed {{dispersers}} on seed germination were investigated for six common plant species (five shrubs and one herb) in the temperate rainforests of southeast Alaska. Patterns of germination behaviour were compared between defecated seeds and control (unpassed) seeds {{for a period}} of two years. Seed passage through vertebrate frugivores enhanced germination in two species, Rubus spectabilis and Sambucus racemosa, and a similar trend was observed in Ribes bracteosum. In contrast, it did not affect seed germination in Oplopanax horridus, Streptopus amplexifolius and Vaccinium ovalifolium/alaskaense. No differences in germination behaviour were found between bear- and bird-treated seeds, suggesting that seed retention time (much greater in bears than in birds) in the guts does not relevantly affect germination. Differences among frugivore effects were detected only for Sambucus, with <b>varied</b> <b>thrushes</b> enhancing germination more than American robins and black bears. The two colour morphs of Rubus spectabilis showed similar germination patterns, suggesting that seed dispersers do not exert an important selective pressure contributing to the maintenance of the polymorphism, at least through the mechanism of a differential effect on germination. The results of this study support the idea that the advantages of animal seed dispersal lie more in seed movement away from the parent plant than in seed treatment within the disperser's guts.

5000|$|Native Americans ate the berries, {{but because}} the berries have a high tannin content and are thus astringent, they more often chewed them or made them into a cider. They also used the berries to make {{necklaces}} and other decorations, and as bait for fishing. Bark and leaves were used to treat stomachaches, cramps, skin ailments, and sore throats. The bark was often made into a tea to be drunk for these medicinal purposes. Many mammal and bird species feed off the berries, including American robins, cedar waxwings, band-tailed pigeons, <b>varied</b> <b>thrushes,</b> quail, mule deer, raccoons, ring-tailed cats, and bears. Mule deer will also eat the young shoots when the trees are regenerating after fire. It is also important as a nest site for many birds, and in mixed woodland {{it seems to be}} chosen for nestbuilding disproportionately to its numbers. The wood is durable and has a warm color after finishing, so it has become more popular as a flooring material, especially in the Pacific Northwest. [...] An attractive veneer can also be made from the wood. [...] However, because large pieces of madrona lumber warp severely and unpredictably during the drying process, they are not used much.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{studying}} post-fledging survival rates from data on national ringing recoveries. The approach extends the classical two-age-class models of Brownie et al. (1985) to include a third age-class of birds ringed as nestlings. The models can incorporate age-class-specific and year-specific variation in reporting rates and survival rates. Unlike intensive resighting studies at single sites, this approach does not confound death with emigration and provides estimates of survival which are representative of a larger geographical area. We implemented the models with SURVIV software, using likelihood-ratio tests to assess the significance of possible age and year effects art survival rates or reporting rates. We demonstrate this approach using a set of data an British-ringed Song Thrushes Turdus philomelos. In this case, {{we were unable to}} detect any age-class-specific or year-specific variation in reporting rates and, although the survival rates of first-year and adult Song <b>Thrushes</b> <b>varied</b> significantly between years, post-fledgling survival did not show any detectable inter- annual variation.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources, Wildlife, 2006 I {{examined}} {{the effect of}} forest buffer width and nest site characteristics on the nest survival of forest birds on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. During 2002 and 2003, a total of 164 nests of three closed cup (Chestnut-backed Chickadee (Parus rufescens), Red-breasted Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus ruber) and Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes)) and four open cup (Pacific-slope Flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), Hermit Thrush (Cartharus guttatus), Swainson???s Thrush (Cartharus ustulatus) and <b>Varied</b> <b>Thrush</b> (Ixoreus naevius)) species were monitored within forested buffers along the coastline. I modeled daily survival rate (DSR) of closed (DSR = 0. 989) and open (DSR = 0. 982) cup nesting species independently using variables at two spatial scales. For closed cup nests the model best describing variation in DSR included height of nest and species. Nests located higher from the ground had better nest success. Variation in DSR of open cup nests was best explained by species. Pacific-slope Flycatcher nests had the highest success (87 %) whereas <b>Varied</b> <b>Thrush</b> nests had the lowest (21 %). DSR of Hermit Thrush nests, the only species for which I had adequate data to analyze separately, was related to distance to the coastline. Species with low DSR had similar nest site characteristics including diameter of nesting substrate and average percentage concealment of nest. However, these nest site characteristics alone do not determine DSR of the species evaluated in my study.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2007 Previous {{research}} suggests that Varied thrushes (Ixoreus naevius) in redwood forests (Sequoia sempervirens) are sensitive to forest edges and are unlikely to breed in small forest fragments. Food abundance is likely to vary at the forest edge, and {{has been linked to}} habitat use and edge avoidance in some other forest-interior passerines, particularly other ground foraging insectivores. To determine the degree to which Varied thrushes avoid forest edges, and how this might be influenced by food abundance, I monitored third-order habitat selection of individual birds using radio telemetry, and sampled relative abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates with pitfall traps across edge gradients in redwood forests of north coastal California. In addition, I measured vegetation structure and other habitat variables that may vary near forest edges and influence <b>Varied</b> <b>thrush</b> habitat use either directly or through effects on invertebrate distribution. I predicted that <b>Varied</b> <b>thrush</b> habitat use would be associated with invertebrate abundance, with both decreasing in proximity to forest edges, and increasing in proximity to streams. Of the 10 Varied thrushes monitored, only two used locations significantly farther from the edge than expected, and overall there was no clear pattern of edge avoidance or preference for streams in the birds studied. Invertebrate abundance was greater near forest edges, contrary to predictions, and was not affected by distance to streams or any of the habitat variables measured. Previous research indicating edge avoidance by Varied thrushes did not distinguish between second-order and third-order habitat selection. Since neither third-order edge avoidance nor edge effects on food abundance were apparent in this study, future research should focus on other potential edge effects at larger scales. The lack of evidence for edge effects also suggests that other mechanisms, such as conspecific attraction, may account for the absence of Varied thrushes from small redwood forest fragments...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Relatively {{little is}} known about {{wintering}} bird communities in lowlands of the Pacific Northwest, yet, the condition of winter habitats potentially can pose a major constraint on bird populations. I initiated a study to determine: (1) Which avian species use lowland riparian and wetland habitats in the Willamette Valley during winter, and with what intraseasonal regularity? (2) To what extent are these species associated - individually and collectively - with landscape and site-scale habitat variables? (3) To what extent are these species associated - individually and collectively - with particular landscape vs. site-scale variables? (4) How are the apparent associations affected by survey procedures and data analysis methods? Two survey procedures (area counts and point counts) in 1995 and 1996 found 104 species during 10 visits to 142 riparian and wetland sites. Area counts mainly surveyed waterbirds and raptors; point counts surveyed passerines. From area counts, mean richness ranged 0 toll species among sites and 1 to 5 species among weeks at an average site; mean number of individuals ranged 0 to 1016 among sites and from 6 to 199 among weeks at an average site. From point counts, richness ranged 1 to 6 species both among sites and among weeks at an average site. Mean number of individuals ranged 0 to 1016 per site and 6 to 199 among weeks at an average site.

40|$|This {{winter was}} {{generally}} mild with {{most parts of}} the state at least somewhat dry. The most interesting avian phenomena were a major incursion of White-winged Crossbills and a warm-up in late January which resulted in several waterfowl species putting in very early appearances. Because of the latter, it was difficult to assess the status (wintering or migrant) of birds reported in late January to early February from major reservoirs and waterfowl concentration spots without some information on ice conditions. Thanks to Larry Einemann, I had detailed information about ice conditions at Branched Oak L, but I would appreciate a few notes on other reservoirs during the winter. Jan Johnson pointed out that my reporting of records from the Wakefield School feeders that she maintains did not make it clear that these feeders are in fact in Wayne County, as are the southern 3 blocks of the town. My apologies; I believe (hope) that this may only be a problem in the Winter 2000 - 2001 report, recently published in Nebraska Bird Review. This winter offered many items of interest; a brief summary follows. Surprising late sightings included the 2 nd-latest ever American Bittern; the 4 th-latest Baltimore Oriole; and 5 species of shorebirds-most of which were spotted at Pawnee L-that were as much as 3 weeks later than previous latest dates. In contrast, several waterfowl species had influxes in late January, noticeably Greater White-fronted Goose. The Eurasian Collared-Dove continues to increase, although so far it has avoided major population centers in the east. A major invasion of White-winged Crossbills occurred, and Snowy Owls were more in evidence than usual. Noticeable for their absence were American Black Duck and Evening Grosbeak. Rarities were unspectacular; the best were 5 species usually not encountered in a winter report: Cinnamon Teal, Sage Thrasher, Pine Warbler, Smith 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur, and Lesser Goldfinch.

40|$|Of {{interest}} to many {{is evidence of}} northward movement of species which generally summer on the Great Plains. In addition to White-winged Dove and Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, both slowly establishing as breeders in Nebraska, significant numbers of Glossy Ibis continue to be found, probably associated with major increases in numbers of White-faced Ibis. Perhaps the biggest surprise this late summer and early fall was {{the large number of}} Lesser Goldfinches reported from the southern Panhandle. Less exciting by far, but worthy of attention were reports of several Mute Swans in the Omaha area, including a duo of juveniles, and a couple of sightings of Monk Parakeets, last known to breed in the state in 1998. Neither would be welcome additions to the breeding avifauna of Nebraska. Notable western species found in the east included California Gull and Rufous Hummingbird, while Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Kingbird and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Vireo crept eastward farther than usual. Most surprising in this group, however, was a Pygmy Nuthatch in Lincoln, a very rare vagrant in general. A mention also for <b>Varied</b> <b>Thrush,</b> a rare but annual visitor from way west, of which 3 were reported. Conversely, best eastern bird west was an immature Blackburnian Warbler banded in Scotts Bluff County. Relative to last year 2 ̆ 7 s good numbers, both Red-breasted Nuthatch and Purple Finch were back to normal levels. At the time of this writing, no notable incursions of winter birds had been detected. Among regular migrants, Blue-headed Vireo, Nashville Warbler, and Orange-crowned Warbler appeared in excellent numbers; the migration period for Orange-crowned Warbler occupied all of 3 months. Strangely, Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, usually abundant as a migrant in the west, was at a low ebb.

40|$|This season, {{partly due}} to the {{departure}} of my co-writer Joel Jorgensen and {{partly due to}} mental aging, I have shortened the species accounts by including only data that add to our current knowledge base. I will not routinely list early and late dates and peak counts for each species unless they are significant; readers should refer to past issues of NBR for guidelines as to what are early or late dates and high counts. Observers are, however, urged to report early and late dates and high counts of all migrant species; {{it is difficult to know}} if a sighting is significant until all the reports are pooled in my computer. In general, most observers thought this a fairly routine fall, although the Panhandle continued to be a source of significant new information, thanks to consistent coverage by Steven Dinsmore. Similar coverage of the Rainwater Basin by Joel Jorgensen also has enhanced our knowledge considerably. Every report is valuable: very few of the large list of observers fail to have at least one of their sightings included in the report. There were no new species added to the state list this fall, but this year was amazing in that respect, with 7 new species (some awaiting approval by the Records Committee) bringing the total state list to a very respectable 441 species. Rarest this fall was the pair of Black-bellied Whistling-Ducks in the Rainwater Basin, a second documented state record. Also very rare were a 7 th state record White-winged Dove and 8 th state record Lesser Goldfinch. Other interesting finds included a Brant of the western race, 3 Pomarine Jaegers, the first documented central Nebraska Blue-headed Vireo, a Mountain Chickadee, a <b>Varied</b> <b>Thrush,</b> another report of Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, the first Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s Oriole for fall east of the Panhandle, and a White-winged Crossbill. Some rather amazing counts were made: 35, 000 Western Grebes (considered conservative by the experienced observer!), a total of about 300 Great Egrets, 6000 and 4200 Blue-winged Teal, 1492 Ruddy Ducks (no estimating there!), 12, 000 Cliff Swallows, 16 Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s Sharp-tailed Sparrows, and good numbers of Purple Finches for a change. Interesting range expansions were noted for Carolina Wren, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, and Chipping Sparrow, while the continued presence of Pileated Woodpeckers at Fontenelle Forest adds to the uniqueness of that area in terms of species which breed there and nowhere else that we know about: Red-shouldered Hawk and Yellow-throated Warbler are others. In the 2 ̆ 2 huh? 2 ̆ 2 department, check out Virginia Rail and Budgerigar (maybe the next addition to the state list?...|$|E
