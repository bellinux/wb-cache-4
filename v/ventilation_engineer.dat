50|$|A more {{sophisticated}} system involving {{the use of}} mechanical equipment to circulate the air {{was developed in the}} mid 19th century. A basic system of bellows was put in place to ventilate Newgate Prison and outlying buildings, by the engineer Stephen Hales in the mid-1700s. The problem with these early devices was that they required constant human labour to operate. David Boswell Reid was called to testify before a Parliamentary committee on proposed architectural designs for the new House of Commons, after the old one burned down in a fire in 1834. In January 1840 Reid was appointed by the committee for the House of Lords dealing with the construction of the replacement for the Houses of Parliament.

The requirement for cooling the underground environment is discussed with particular emphasis on the need for this method of cooling, with the concomitant benefits. The research investigated current methods of cooling and reasons for previous failures in (M. R. P.). Both static and dynamic simulations were conducted to increase the confidence level under operating conditions. Implementation and testing, resulted in "lessons learnt" requiring modifications, which are documented. Actual results have been recorded. These results have proved that significant cooling via (M.

The spontaneous heating of crushed coal from pillars was simulated and N 2 was injected from different locations on the headgate side and through boreholes from the surface. The N 2 injection rate at each location was varied between 0. 18 m(3) /s and 0. 94 m(3) /s (380 and 2000 cfm). In the sealed longwall simulations, seal leakage rate was varied to determine its effect on N 2 injection effectiveness.

40|$|A {{booster fan}} is an {{underground}} fan installed {{in series with}} a main surface fan and used to boost the air pressure of the ventilation air passing through it. To accomplish this objective, the fan is installed in a permanent stopping and equipped with airlock doors, a monitoring system, and interlocking devices between main and booster fan controls. The stopping and doors are used to prevent flow recirculation, and the monitors to ensure safe operation of the fan. A booster fan, properly sized and sited, {{can be used to}} create safe work conditions and allow the extraction of minerals from areas that would otherwise be uneconomic to mine. In deep and large mines with heavy emissions of air contaminants, the required quantities of air can only be supplied by using high pressure fans. These fans will inevitably induce significant losses of fresh airflow through the stoppings and doors. For well defined ventilation circuits, booster fans can be used to decrease the main fan pressures and reduce the leakage flows. However, this will require a good understanding of the correct ventilation practice, from planning to operation and maintenance of booster fans. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the conditions under which booster fans can be used safely and efficiently in underground coal mines. Specifically, the study is directed at (1) collecting reliable information on airway resistances and flow requirements from two large U.

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a college to evaluate employees' concerns about health symptoms that {{were believed to be}} related to the indoor environmental quality in a campus building. The building had a history of indoor environmental quality complaints, but was mostly unoccupied at the time of our visit in May 2013. During our visit, we looked for past or current water damage, water entering the building, and mold. We interviewed current and former college faculty, managers, and staff. We reviewed (1) ventilation system drawings and maintenance records, (2) reports from indoor environmental quality consultants, and (3) the college's summary of symptoms reported by employees and students. We found the ventilation systems to be well maintained, but airborne contaminants in the dental clinic could spread to other areas of the building. First, the return air from the dental clinic mixed with return air from offices and classrooms before recirculation. Second, the dental clinic was not under a consistent neutral or negative air pressure relative to surrounding areas, meaning that air from the dental clinic could flow to adjacent areas. We saw no evidence of current or past water damage, water entering the building, or mold. Most interviewed employees reported nonspecific symptoms common to workplaces and in the general population. We could not link these symptoms to any specific workplace exposure. One employee may have had a lung condition that could be caused by mold exposure. This employee worked in the building in 2001 when mold problems were found. Additional findings included: (1) some employees using portable ionizing air cleaners (a source of ozone and possibly associated with employee symptoms), and (2) a sewer pipe vented into a cabinet in the dental laboratory. We recommended the employer work with a <b>ventilation</b> <b>engineer</b> to change how return air is mixed and to improve airflow, check for open sewer vents inside the building, and stop sampling for chemical and biological agents to identify a cause for non-specific employee symptoms.

Employees were concerned about lead exposure and reported being diagnosed with lead poisoning and being medically removed from the workplace by an occupational physician. We visited the facility in December 2013 to interview employees, assess lead exposures, and evaluate ventilation system performance. In February 2014, we provided {{a summary of the}} environmental sampling results to the employer and employee representatives and personal sampling results were sent to each employee who participated in the evaluation. Employees generally spent most of their work day at the sales counter in the showroom or in the office. They occasionally entered the ranges to assist shooters who were experiencing difficulty or to supervise league shooting. On Saturdays, employees performed a deep cleaning of the firing ranges. Each range had a separate single-pass ventilation system that supplied outside air to the range and exhausted the air directly outdoors without recirculation. The areas of the facility other than the range were served by two recirculation ventilation systems. All employees had elevated blood lead levels, defined as {{greater than or equal to}} 10 25 g/dL, when tested by the employer in November 2013. Employee BLLs ranged from 19. 9 - 40. 7 25 g/dL. No employees had undergone the medical surveillance required by Cal/OSHA. Air sampling results for lead were below the Cal/OSHA permissible exposure limit of 50 25 g/m 3. We found lead on all tested surfaces in the range and in the showroom. Employees also had lead on their hands and shoes as they left work to go home. The ventilation system had numerous deficiencies, and lead contaminated air circulated throughout the building. Multiple openings between the ranges and the wall separating them from the showroom allowed lead dust to migrate to the air handling units that serve the showroom and office/classroom area. We recommended the employer (1) switch to lead-free ammunition, (2) remove all employees with blood lead levels of 20 25 g/dL or higher from exposure to lead until their two blood lead levels taken a month apart drop below 15 25 g/dL, (3) hire a <b>ventilation</b> <b>engineer</b> to modify or redesign the ventilation systems, (4) remove lead contamination from the showroom, and (5) follow the Cal/OSHA medical surveillance requirements. We recommended employees (1) talk to their doctor about their exposure to lead at work, (2) not eat, drink, or smoke inside the facility, (3) wash their hands with a lead-removing soap before leaving the facility, and (4) change their clothes and shoes before leaving work to decrease the amount of lead transferred to their car or home...|$|E

Ventilation stoppings are more commonly {{the concern of}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>engineers,</b> and <b>ventilation</b> stopping response to ground movement has only been documented in an incidental manner. This paper presents the investigations of underground measurements that have been conducted to determine the loading response of stoppings constructed from lightweight aggregate concrete masonry units (CMU). These investigations have produced some interesting results that may prove beneficial, not only for developing and assessing alternative stopping construction techniques, but also for designing and selecting standard construction methods for use in varying mining conditions. For instance, the interface friction that results from wedging a CMU stopping during construction plays a substantial role {{in its ability to}} resist both lateral and vertical loads. Although they are not intended for ground support, the study showed that block stoppings can resist vertical loads of at least 2, 700 to 3, 000 kN. Asymmetric loading of a stopping may result in localized failure of blocks within a stopping, which, depending on the severity, can be a precursor of impending stopping failure. In addition to measurement results and implications, the paper will also present details of field measurement methods used to assess stopping response.

40|$|MFIRE, {{written in}} Fortran 77, is a {{computer}} program for ventilation state simulation in the steady state or transient state condition. It can be applied for the calculation of normal ventilation system planning or {{the analysis of the}} dynamic state variation in a ventilation system under thermal or mechanical disturbance. The state simulator MFIRE is a useful tool for mine fire fighting. In the case of a mine fire, mine <b>ventilation</b> <b>engineers</b> want to get some help to obtain more information, such as {{what is happening in the}} underground mine and how to control the mine fire, for correct decision making. By use of program MF'IRE, forecasts can be made on the variation of airflow, temperature, and contaminant distribution in a ventilation system during a mine fire. The paths which the contaminant takes at each time interval can be traced. The program MFIRE can be of assistance in the preplanning of escape routes. It can also be helpful during a mine fire emergency and mine recovery operation. Besides of offering the information of state simulation during a mine fire, MFIRE can be applied for state control by pretesting the suitability of the selected state control measures. It is to simulate the effects of the state control measures on the airflow distribution of a dynamic ventilation system. The testing result can be used for fire fighting in a similar real case of a mine fire. By employing empirical methods or a qualitative analysis like Budryk approach, <b>ventilation</b> <b>engineers</b> can choose different combinations of locations and sizes of control devices as samples of state control for an underground mine fire. Program MFIRE can simulate the different combination samples, that consist of a certain mine fue, the corresponding different control measures, and obtain the control effects. After the different control results are compared, the state control measure, which creates the best effect among the different state control measures, will be chosen for that fire case. When a mine fire, which is similar to one of the pretested cases, breaks out, the corresponding choice of the state control measure is applied to the ventilation system. It means that the simulator MFIRE has the function of indirect state control [10]. To achieve the above two functions, state simulation and state control, the mine ventilation system condition, sometimes, should be changed in a wide range to meet the requirement of the fire fighting. These wide system condition changes, such as adding operating fans, stopping or reversing fans, changing fan characteristics, adding regulators and making airflow shortcuts are represented in the time table of the input data set When the data files are changed in a wide range, however, an iteration divergence and some other computing errors in the distribution of airflow, temperature, and contaminant may occur. More serious logical programming and flexible selection on the algorithms are wanted to meet the request of the different data sets, to achieve correct state distribution simulation and improve the iteration convergence. To enhance the reliability and common suitability of program MFIRE, it is necessary to make investigation, analysis, and modification for the formal versions of MFIRE.

40|$|Purpose: Production and {{utilization}} of buildings contributes immensely to global carbon dioxide emissions. The construction sector today accounts {{for over a}} third of global energy use will increase as the world population increases. According to the EU Directive from 2010, all new buildings in EU member countries as of December 31, 2020 are to be classified as near-zero energy buildings (NZEB). The goal is to investigate the various energy-affecting measures of the involved architects, structural engineers and planners that can improve the energy performance of a kindergarten to be closer to near-zero and identify obstacles that {{make it more difficult to}} achieve NZEB. Method: The investigation strategies for the project are qualitative methods in the form of semi-structured interviews with architects, planners and <b>ventilation</b> <b>engineers</b> for six different kindergartens. The interviews were conducted by telephone in which the questions were sent in advance to those interviewed. Mail interviews were conducted early on which resulted in either short answers or not answers at all. The energy performance documents of the different kindergartens were analyzed to get information about the different energy performances. Findings: The result does not contain a solution as to what the near-zero energy definition is or how to define it, but is more like guidance concerning what factors you can influence to get closer to near-zero energy for a kindergarten. Recurring problems surfacing in the interviews is that not all the involved roles have been able to influence predetermined choices of shape and space that, among other things, contribute to a limited space for services that planners are having difficulty influencing afterwards. Implications: The result helps contribute to making sure buildings are built in a more energy-efficient way and by such reducing the construction sector's share of the global energy consumption. The building's energy efficiency may not contribute to poor indoor climate in such a way that it affects children's health in a negative manner. This results in a need for careful planning where all parties can contribute with their best energy efficiency solutions without being too limited by the architectural constraints of shape and space. Alternatively, better communication between planners and architects in the earlier stages. Good planning contributes to a better result. Limitations: The result is based on Swedish kindergartens in a Nordic climate and should not be applied in countries without a Nordic climate. The result is not only applicable to kindergartens but is largely applicable to most similar buildings. Contact with more architects, constructional engineers, planners and more kindergartens would have given a better result...|$|R

An understanding of HVAC system design and operating conditions is important to evaluating the potential influence on vapor intrusion, air quality patterns in the building space, and options for mitigation. While building conditions influencing vapor intrusion in residential structures do not typically include active <b>ventilation</b> with <b>engineered</b> systems and are therefore less systematic and more random, buildings equipped with engineered HVAC systems represent more controlled environments with rates of air exchange within specified limits.

No one can arbitrarily fix the supposed death rate at 1 per cent [sic] of those afflicted. ” Dr. Drake justified his assertion with facts and declined to be drawn into a controversy. • Dr. Robertson attended a meeting of physicians to deal with situation in Chicago. • Dr. Robertson also met with engineers and principles from North Side schools regarding a report from health officials that they were not complying with ban on “dry sweeping” and the need for proper <b>ventilation.</b> Two <b>engineers</b> protested. Dr. Robertson: “We are not here to hold a debate. Your schools have been reported, and conditions must be remedied. ”• The Superintendent of Schools Mortensen stated that his schools would comply with instructions issued by health authorities. • 397 new cases of flu and 23 deaths reported in Chicago yesterday. 82 cases of pneumonia reported with 32 deaths. • 170 new cases of flu and 96 deaths from flu reported at Camp Grant for Sunday. Total: 452 deaths and 15, 000 cases. • Washington DC orders that students entering college in IL have permission to room in houses, rather than crowded barracks. Those in barracks will be given at least 50 square feet of space. “Sneeze sheets” will be placed between beds and opposite rows of eaters in the mess hall. • A house-to-house assessment of the cases in north shore towns has been undertaken by state officials. Wilmette and Evanston communities in the North Shore have not improved, while other communities in North Shore have. • Dr. Drake reports that the Red Cross is ready to supply nurses and doctors as needed. • The Cook County Hospital is poised to close its doors. This is reported by Warden Michael Zimmer. They have a “dire” shortage of nurses. They have canceled time off for the nurses. Newspaper article...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxia-induced {{dopamine}} (DA) {{release from}} carotid body (CB) glomus cells and activation of postsynaptic D 2 receptors {{have been proposed}} {{to play an important}} role in the neurotransmission process between the glomus cells and afferent nerve endings. To better resolve the role of D 2 receptors, we examined afferent nerve activity, catecholamine content and release, and <b>ventilation</b> of genetically <b>engineered</b> mice lacking D 2 receptors (D 2 -/- mice). Single-unit afferent nerve activities of D 2 -/- mice in vitro were significantly reduced by 45 % and 25 % compared with wild-type (WT) mice during superfusion with saline equilibrated with mild hypoxia (PO 2 ∼ 50 Torr) or severe hypoxia (PO 2 ∼ 20 Torr), respectively. Catecholamine release in D 2 -/- mice was enhanced by 125 % in mild hypoxia and 75 % in severe hypoxia compared with WT mice, and the rate of rise was increased in D 2 -/- mice. We conclude that CB transduction of hypoxia is still present in D 2 -/- mice, but the response magnitude is reduced. However, the ventilatory response to acute hypoxia is maintained, perhaps because of an enhanced processing of chemoreceptor input by brain stem respiratory nuclei.

50|$|Koenigsmacker {{overlooks the}} {{crossing}} of the Moselle at Cattenom. During the Lorraine Campaign of World War II, the U.S. 90th Infantry Division crossed the flooded Moselle early on 9 November 1944. Fire from Koenigsmacker destroyed bridging equipment and harassed boat-borne troops, but elements of the 358th Infantry Regiment established a lodgement on the east bank and infiltrated {{the area of the}} fort before daybreak. The initial American assault took the German garrison, manned by the 74th regiment of the 19th Volksgrenadier Division, by surprise, but German resistance quickly became more effective. American combat engineers took over the assault, using explosives to destroy or seal openings and <b>ventilation</b> shafts. The <b>engineers</b> used such a quantity of explosives that they ran out, and had to be replenished by an airdrop. The fort's 100mm guns could not be depressed to deal with the close-in attackers, but kept up fire on nearby U.S. formations. By nightfall the Americans had occupied a portion of the fort's surface. The next morning, Company C of the 358th attacked from the south, encountering a fortified ditch. Companies A and B meanwhile occupied the fort's surface and continued with attacks using demolition charges, while the fort kept up artillery fire on American units trying to pass by the fort. On the 11th much of the fort had been suppressed, but its guns continued to fire. A relief patrol of 145 Germans attempting to relieve the fort was ambushed and captured. On the 12th an assault by G Company of the 358th coincided with a decision by the German garrison to evacuate. Surrounded, the Germans surrendered. More than 300 Germans were captured or casualties, with 111 American casualties.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Ventilation Model is to {{simulate}} the heat transfer processes in and around waste emplacement drifts during periods of forced ventilation. The model evaluates the effects of emplacement drift ventilation on the thermal conditions in the emplacement drifts and surrounding rock mass, and calculates the heat removal by ventilation {{as a measure of}} the viability of ventilation to delay the onset of peak repository temperature and reduce its magnitude. The heat removal by ventilation is temporally and spatially dependent, and is expressed as the fraction of heat carried away by the ventilation air compared to the fraction of heat produced by radionuclide decay. One minus the heat removal is called the wall heat fraction, or the remaining amount of heat that is transferred via conduction to the surrounding rock mass. Downstream models, such as the ''Multiscale Thermohydrologic Model'' (BSC 2001), use the wall heat fractions as outputted from the Ventilation Model to initialize their post-closure analyses. The Ventilation Model report was initially developed to analyze the effects of preclosure continuous <b>ventilation</b> in the <b>Engineered</b> Barrier System (EBS) emplacement drifts, and to provide heat removal data to support EBS design. Revision 00 of the Ventilation Model included documentation of the modeling results from the ANSYS-based heat transfer model. Revision 01 ICN 01 included the results of the unqualified software code MULTIFLUX to assess the influence of moisture on the ventilation efficiency. The purposes of Revision 02 of the Ventilation Model are: (1) To validate the conceptual model for preclosure ventilation of emplacement drifts and verify its numerical application in accordance with new procedural requirements as outlined in AP-SIII- 10 Q, Models (Section 7. 0). (2) To satisfy technical issues posed in KTI agreement RDTME 3. 14 (Reamer and Williams 2001 a). Specifically to demonstrate, with respect to the ANSYS ventilation model, the adequacy of the discretization (Section 6. 2. 3. 1), and the downstream applicability of the model results (i. e. wall heat fractions) to initialize post-closure thermal models (Section 6. 6). (3) To satisfy the remainder of KTI agreement TEF 2. 07 (Reamer and Williams 2001 b). Specifically to provide the results of post-test ANSYS modeling of the Atlas Facility forced convection tests (Section 7. 1. 2). This portion of the model report also serves as a validation exercise per AP-SIII. 10 Q, Models, for the ANSYS ventilation model. (4) To asses the impacts of moisture on the ventilation efficiency...|$|R
