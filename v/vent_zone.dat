40|$|Vent blocking, the {{covering}} of the filter ventilation zone on a cigarette during smoking, is a potentially {{important aspect of}} smoking behavior. Various techniques {{have been used to}} assess the incidence of vent blocking, and widely different views have been expressed on its importance. Studies relevant to filter vent blocking have been reviewed with two overall objectives: to examine critically the evidence on the occurrence of vent blocking and to assess the effects of vent blocking on the smoke yield to the smoker. The reviewed studies fall into four main categories: (1) measurements of the incidence of filter vent blocking among smokers; (2) the observed effects of vent blocking on cigarette ventilation and machine smoke yields; (3) the effect of experimentally blocking vents on human smoke yields; and (4) simultaneous determination of vent blocking and smoke yield under human smoking conditions. Direct observation indicates that only 4 % of smokers have their fingers in direct contact with the cigarette during puffing. Estimates of vent blocking incidence by lips during smoking range from 15 - 24 % (saliva-staining technique) to up to 50 % ('tar’ staining pattern technique) of smokers. For those smokers who do block the ventilation zone, a mean of 27 % of the vents are blocked, and a maximum of about 50 %. When the cigarettes are machine-smoked, the smoke yield increases in a highly non-linear manner as the blocked portion of the filter ventilation zone increases. This effect is also more pronounced at higher original filter ventilation levels. In contrast, smoking behavior monitoring techniques have shown that when the experimenter deliberately blocks the <b>vent</b> <b>zone,</b> the human smoker adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. The blocked filter affects the yields of smoke components to the smoker less than it does smoking-machine measured yields. It is concluded that the incidence of <b>vent</b> <b>zone</b> blocking by fingers is quite low and relatively insignificant. The most reliable estimate for lip blocking is that up to 25 % of smokers may cover the <b>vent</b> <b>zone</b> during at least one puff and for most smokers the coverage is partial. Ventilation zone blocking as it occurs in practice has only a relatively minor effect on human smoke yields compared to other smoker behavior factors. When a human smoker inadvertently partially or completely blocks the filter ventilation zone during smoking, he/she adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. Because of these changes in puffing behavior during human smoking, predictions of the effects of filter vent blocking on smoke yields based solely on smoking machine yields are deceptive...|$|E

We conducted high temporal resolution pH and temperature measurements in and around a shallow (2. 5 - 3 m) CO 2 vent site off Ischia, Italy in May and June 2008. Loggers were deployed at five stations to monitor water at both the surface and benthos. Our reference station, 500 m from the CO 2 vent, had no noticeable vent influence. It had a naturally high and stable benthic pH (mean 8. 16, inter-quartile range (IQ) : 8. 14 - 8. 18) fluctuating with diel periodicity, presumably driven by community photosynthesis and respiration. A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the pH of this station was well constrained by meteorological parameters. In contrast, a station positioned within the <b>vent</b> <b>zone,</b> had a low and very variable benthic mean pH of 7. 11 (IQ: 6. 91 - 7. 62) with large pH fluctuations not well constrained by a PCA. Any stations positioned within 20 m of the main <b>vent</b> <b>zone</b> had lowered pH, but suffered from abnormally large pH fluctuations making them unsuitable representatives to predict future changes to a shallow coastal environment. Between these extremes, we identified a benthic area with a lower pH of 7. 84 (IQ: 7. 83 - 7. 88) that retained many {{of the characteristics of}} the reference station such as a natural diel pH periodicity and low variability. Our results indicate that a range of pH environments maybe commonplace near CO 2 vents due to their characteristic acidification of benthic water over a wide area. Such environments could become invaluable natural laboratories for ocean acidification research, closely mimicking future CO 2 conditions in a natural setting. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|International audienceUsing a {{lava flow}} {{emplacement}} model and a satellite-based land cover classification, we produce a map to allow {{assessment of the}} type and quantity of natural, agricultural and urban land cover at risk from lava flow invasion. The {{first step is to}} produce lava effusion rate contours, i. e., lines linking distances down a volcano’s flank that a lava flow will likely extend if fed at a given effusion rate from a predetermined <b>vent</b> <b>zone.</b> This involves first identifying a vent mask and then running a downhill flow path model from the edge of every pixel around the vent mask perimeter {{to the edge of the}} DEM. To do this, we run a stochastic model whereby the flow path is projected 1, 000 times from every pixel around the vent mask perimeter with random noise being added to the DEM with each run so that a slightly different flow path is generated with each run. The FLOWGO lava flow model is then run down each path, at a series of effusion rates, to determine likely run-out distance for channel-fed flow extending down each path. These results are used to plot effusion rate contours. Finally, effusion rate contours are projected onto a land classification map (produced from an ASTER image of Etna) to assess the type and amount of each land cover class falling within each contour. The resulting maps are designed to provide a quick look-up capability to assess the type of land at risk from lava extending from any location at a range of likely effusion rates. For our first (2, 000 m) <b>vent</b> <b>zone</b> case used for Etna, we find a total of area of ~ 680 km 2 is at risk from flows fed at 40 m 3 s− 1, of which ~ 6 km 2 is urban, ~ 150 km 2 is agriculture and ~ 270 km 2 is grass/woodland. The model can also be run for specific cases, where we find that Etna’s 1669 vent location, if active today, would likely inundate almost 11 km 2 of urban land, as well as 15. 6 km 2 of agricultural land, including 9. 5 km 2 of olive groves and 5. 2 km 2 of vineyards and fruit/nut orchards...|$|E

Investigations addressed the effects of long-term exposure to elevated CO 2 levels on the inter-tidal calcifying species, Patella caerulea, found on the littoral zone within 15 - 300 m of the vent site. Surface water pH reached 6. 0 units adjacent to the <b>vent</b> <b>zone,</b> with PCO 2 concentrations of 15, 000 ftatm. The vents produced approximately 1. 0 x 10 * l ' CO 2 / day. Two pH zones matching scenarios for predicted changes to surface ocean pH with 'no abated emissions' within the next 100 years (7. 5 - 7. 9) and levels expected {{as a result of}} leaks from deep-sea CO 2 storage facilities (6. 5 - 7. 1) were determined. Signs of shell dissolution and weakening were evident in both of these zones. Detrimental effects to P. caerulea abundance and population structure were found where pH ranged from 6. 5 - 7. 1 units. The results obtained by this study strongly indicate that a reduction in sea-water to a pH from 6. 5 - 7. 1 pH units will be fatal for P. caerulea populations in the natural environment. Further, reductions in pH likely to be experienced by the end of this century may be harmful to shelled molluscs. Faculty of Scienc...|$|E

Here we present the results of a multitemporal airborne LIDAR survey 12 flown to acquire data for an active flow field separated by time intervals ranging from 13 15 min to 25 h. Overflights were carried out over 2 d during the 2006 eruption of Mt. Etna, 14 Italy, coincident with lava emission from three ephemeral <b>vent</b> <b>zones</b> to feed lava flow in 15 six channels. In total 53 LIDAR images were collected, allowing us to track the volumetric 16 evolution of the entire flow field with temporal resolutions as low as ∼ 15 min and at a 17 spatial resolution of < 1 m.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{hand-held}} thermal camera during the 2002 – 2003 Stromboli effusive eruption proved essential in tracking the development of flow field structures and in measuring related eruption parameters, such {{as the number of}} active vents and flow lengths. The steep underlying slope on which the flow field was emplaced resulted in a characteristic flow field morphology. This comprised a proximal shield, where flow stacking and inflation caused piling up of lava on the relatively flat ground of the <b>vent</b> <b>zone,</b> that fed a medial–distal lava flow field. This zone was characterized by the formation of lava tubes and tumuli forming a complex network of tumuli and flows linked by tubes. Most of the flow field was emplaced on extremely steep slopes and this had two effects. It caused flows to slide, as well as flow, and flow fronts to fail frequently, persistent flow front crumbling resulted in the production of an extensive debris field. Channel-fed flows were also characterized by development of excavated debris levees in this zone (Calvari et al. 2005). Collapse of lava flow fronts and inflation of the upper proximal lava shield made volume calculation very difficult. Comparison of the final field volume with that expecta by integrating the lava effusion rates through time suggests a loss of ~ 70 % erupted lava by flow front crumbling and accumulation as debris flows below sea level. Derived relationships between effusion rate, flow length, and number of active vents showed systematic and correlated variations with time where spreading of volume between numerous flows caused an otherwise good correlation between effusion rate, flow length to break down. Observations collected during this eruption are useful in helping to understand lava flow processes on steep slopes, as well as in interpreting old lava–debris sequences found in other steep-sided volcanoes subject to effusive activity...|$|E
40|$|Products of the 5 km 3 (DRE), 5 -yr {{duration}} Kaharoa eruption episode display {{two main}} high-silica rhyolite compositions; T 1 erupted early (as plinian pyroclastics), and T 2 erupted late (mostly as lavas). The T 1 and T 2 eruptive types {{are defined by}} crystal contents and compositional variations in whole rock, glass, plagioclase and biotite. Stratigraphically intermediate pyroclastic deposits have an intermediate composition (T 1 + 2). A small volume of rhyodacite pyroclastics, mingled with injected basalt, was also erupted. The Kaharoa rhyolites were erupted from multiple sources spread along an 8 -km linear <b>vent</b> <b>zone,</b> but the changes in eruptive compositions were largely controlled by position in the eruption sequence and magma discharge rates, rather than vent locations. Data from the Kaharoa eruptive types, vent locations, eruption sequence and discharge rates can be combined with concepts of magma chamber evacuation processes to produce a preliminary dimensional model of the pre-eruption rhyolite magma body. Our model magma body is sill-like, 8 km long, 1 km wide, 1. 4 km thick, and located at 6 – 7 km depth in the upper crust. T 1 magma overlay T 2 magma in the upper levels of the chamber, with each magma layer internally mixed to a homogeneous composition along an axial extent defined by the vent locations. An underlying third rhyolite magma (T 3) is recognised as the silicic end-member that was modified by basalt to form the rhyodacite eruptives. The rhyolite magma stratification survived multiple injections of basalt magma, which primed and finally triggered the Kaharoa eruptions. The T 1 + 2 eruptives resulted from syn-eruption mingling in the conduit of the two main rhyolite magma types. Thickness of the T 1 layer in the model can be estimated at 0. 25 km; the T 2 layer was somewhat thicker. Thicknesses of the underlying T 3 and basalt layers are uncertain.

40|$|Uncertainties in {{modelling}} volcanic hazards {{are often}} amplified in geographically large systems and in volcanoes {{which have a}} diverse eruption history that comprises variable eruption compositions and styles from different vent locations. The large ~ 700 km 2 Okataina Volcanic Centre (OVC) is a large silicic caldera complex in a geodynamic region of New Zealand which has displayed a range of eruption styles and compositions over its current phase of activity (26 ka - present), including one basaltic maar-forming eruption, one basaltic Plinian eruption, and nine rhyolitic Plinian eruptions. All three of these eruption styles have occurred within the past 3. 5 ky, and any of these styles could occur {{in the event of}} a future eruption. The location of a future eruption is also unknown. Future vents could potentially open in one of three different possible areas of the OVC: the Tarawera linear <b>vent</b> <b>zone</b> (LVZ) (5 eruptions over the past 26 ky), the Haroharo LVZ (5 eruptions over the past 26 ky), or outside of these LVZs (1 eruption over the past 26 ky). A future rhyolitic or basaltic Plinian eruption from the OVC is likely to generate widespread tephra fall in loads that will cause significant disruption and socio- economic impacts throughout the surrounding region. Past OVC tephra studies have focused on evaluating hazard from a rhyolitic Plinian eruption at select vent locations in the OVC's Tarawera LVZ. Here, we expand upon these past studies by evaluating tephra hazard for all possible OVC eruption vent areas and for both rhyolitic and basaltic Plinian eruption styles, and exploring how these parameters influence tephra hazard forecasts. Probabilistic volcanic hazard model BET_VH and advection-diffusion tephra hazard model TEPHRA 2 were used to assess the hazard of accumulating ≥ 10 kg m- 2 of tephra from both basaltic Plinian and rhyolitic Plinian eruption styles, occurring from within the Tarawera LVZ, the Haroharo LVZ, and other potential vent areas within the caldera. We present the results of these analyses as a first-order tephra hazard assessment for the entire OVC. Our results highlight the importance of considering all the potential vent locations of a volcanic system, in order to capture the full eruption catalogue in analyses (e. g., 11 eruptions over 26 ky for the OVC, versus only 5 eruptions over 26 ky for the Tarawera LVZ), as well as the full potential distribution of tephra hazard. Although the Tarawera LVZ has been prominently discussed in studies of OVC hazard because of is recent activity (1886 and ~ 1315 AD), we find that, in the event of future eruption, the likelihood of a vent opening within the Haroharo LVZ (last eruption 5. 6 ka) is equivalent (< 1 % difference) to that for the Tarawera LVZ (31. 8 % compared to 32. 5 %). We also find that an eruption from within the Haroharo LVZ presents a relatively higher hazard to several localities, such as the town of Kawerau, where the average absolute probability of accumulating ≥ 10 kg m- 2 of tephra is 1. 3 times greater than for an eruption from within the Tarawera LVZ. While the absolute probabilities of accumulating ≥ 10 kg m- 2 of tephra in the next one year from a basaltic Plinian eruption are on average 7. 2 times lower than for a rhyolitic Plinian eruption throughout the surrounding region, our results suggest that the hazard posed by a basaltic Plinian eruption does contribute to the overall OVC tephra hazard, raising absolute probabilities for the entire OVC by an order of 0. 14, which may have implications when considering sensitive decision-making thresholds...|$|E
40|$|The Saldanha {{hydrothermal}} {{field is}} positioned {{on the top}} of a seamount located in a non-transformoffset (NTO 5) on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). This hydrothermal system was first described as a low-temperature diffuse field, driven by peridotite–seawater reactions following the detection of high concentrations of CH 4 and H 2 in the water column, and the occurrence of serpentinite outcrops in the vent area. We have studied the geochemistry and isotopic composition of sediment and rock samples collected across the area and show that hydrothermal circulation at Saldanha is complex and spatially variable, comprising areas of low-temperature diffuse flow but also more focused higher-temperature <b>venting</b> <b>zones.</b> While most sediment samples have an isotopic composition that is similar to normal pelagic sediments, one core (SCD 7) show significant hydrothermal influence, sulphide mineralization, non-radiogenic Pb and radiogenicNdisotope ratios and positive Eu anomalies. This is best explained by mineral precipitation from high-temperature hydrothermal fluids that have circulated through mafic rocks. The host rock lithology and alteration is also highly variable and comprises both fresh basalts, serpentinites and hydrothermally altered rocks (metabasalts, metagabbros and steatites). Serpentinites have REE patterns and ?Nd(0) values that fall between seawater and mantle peridotite reference values, resulting from extensive interaction of seawater with the original peridotite. This process was probably favoured by the deeply penetrating and long-lived faults occurring at this NTO. Steatites have a positive Eu anomaly and nonradiogenic Pb isotopic values. These signatures, together with the sulphide mineralisation and the extensive Si input necessary for steatization of serpentinites, imply that higher-temperature hydrothermal fluids reacted with gabbroic intrusions at depth. The more hydrothermally altered sediment and rock samples appear to be associated with the Saldanha fault network that promotes a more focused fluid flow and thus enhances hydrothermal alteration within a region of low-temperature diffuse flow...|$|R

This interrelation is important for understanding the potential resource of gas hydrate deposits. The {{purpose of this study}} is to understand the influence of such activity on the marine gas hydrate system of the seaward extension of the Trujillo Basin, Peru Margin. Here, we analyze near-seafloor heat flow probe data, high-resolution multichannel seismic (MCS) profiles, swath bathymetry and ocean floor observation system (OFOS) images. Based on our results, we identify three main physiographical subregions in the study area: (1) an area with turbidites, continuous BSRs and low-to-moderate near-seafloor heat flow (7 - 33 mW/m** 2), (2) an area with sediment waves of turbidity origin, a mix of continuous and patchy BSRs, and moderate near-seafloor heat flow (26 - 39 mW/m** 2), (3) an area with extensional faulting, patchy BSRs and moderate-to-high near-seafloor heat flow (52 - 110 mW/m** 2). We conclude that sediment flow processes are the result of recent depositional controls, and faulting is the result of recent tectonic activity. Near-seafloor heat flow around chemoherms is moderate. Estimates of BSR-derived heat flow show differences to near-seafloor heat flow. This difference points to advection of fluids occurring at the seafloor. Alive Calyptogena and tube worms were observed in these <b>venting</b> <b>zones.</b> Based on our analysis, we conclude that: (1) recent depositional processes control the {{development of}} continuous BSRs and may restrict heat transfer through the GHSZ in the form of fluid venting at the seafloor, (2) recent tectonic processes control the development of patchy BSRs and allow heat transfer through the GHSZ along faults, which is manifested as fluid venting at the seafloor...|$|R
40|$|Gas seepage from {{petroleum}} basins is {{the second}} largest natural source of methane to the atmosphere, after wetlands. The uncertainty in global emission estimates should be reduced by extending the flux database which is fundamental for defining the emission factors and the actual area of seepage adopted for up-scaling. As a contribution to this goal, we report a new seepage data-set for the Transylvanian Basin, {{one of the largest}} natural gas producing regions of Europe, that is characterized by the widespread occurrence of natural leakages of gas at the surface, including at least 73 mud volcanoes and gas seeps. In this study, methane flux was measured using closed-chambers, from 12 seepage sites, in correspondence with focused gas vents (mud volcano craters, bubbling pools, and flammable gas leaks), in the soil surrounding the vents, and at 15 sites located far from macroseep zones but close to gas fields.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of rhyolitic lava from effusion to cessation of activity is poorly understood. Recent lava dome eruptions at Unzen, Colima, Chaiten and Soufrière Hills have vastly increased our knowledge on {{the changes in}} behaviour of active domes. However, in ancient domes, little knowledge of the {{evolution of}} individual extrusion events exists. Instead, internal structures and facies variations can be used to assess the mechanisms of eruption. Rhyolitic magma rising in a conduit vesiculates and undergoes shear, such that lava erupting at the surface will be a mix of glass and sheared vesicles that form a permeable network, and with or without phenocryst or microlites. This foam will undergo compression from overburden in the shallow conduit and lava dome, forcing the vesicles to close and affecting the permeable network. High temperature, uniaxial compression experiments on crystal-rich and crystal-poor lavas have quantified the evolution of porosity and permeability in such environments. The deformation mechanisms involved in uniaxial deformation are viscous deformation and cracking. Crack production is controlled by strain rate and crystallinity, as strain is localised in crystals in crystal rich lavas. In crystal poor lavas, high strain rates result in long cracks that drastically increase permeability at low strain. Numerous and small cracks in crystal rich lavas allow the permeable network to remain open (although at a lower permeability than undeformed samples) while the porosity decreases. Flow bands result from shear movement within the conduit. Upon extrusion, these bands will become modified from movement of lava, and can therefore be used to reconstruct styles of eruption. Both Ngongotaha and Ruawahia domes, from Rotorua caldera and Okataina caldera complex (OCC) respectively, show complex flow banding that can be traced to elongated or aligned vents. The northernmost lobe at Ngongotaha exhibits a fan-like distribution of flow bands that are interpreted as resulting from an initial lava flow from a N – S trending fissure. This flow then transitioned into intrusion of obsidian sheets directly above the conduit, bound by wide breccia zones which show vertical movement of the sheets. Progressive intrusions then forced the sheets laterally, forming a sequence of sheets and breccia zones. At Ruawahia, the flow bands show two types of eruption; long flow lobes with ramp structures, and smaller spiny lobes which show vertical movement and possible spine extrusion. The difference is likely due to palaeotopography, as a large pyroclastic cone would have confined the small domes, while the flow lobes were unconfined and able to flow down slope. The vents at Ruawahia are aligned in a NE – SW orientation. Both domes are suggested to have formed from the intrusion of a dyke. The orientations of the alignment or elongation of vents at Ngongotaha and Ruawahia {{can be attributed to the}} overall regional structure of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ). At Ngongotaha, the N – S trending elongated vent is suggested to be controlled by a N – S trending caldera collapse structure at Rotorua caldera. The rest of the lobes at Ngongotaha, as well as other domes at Rotorua caldera, are controlled by the NE – SW trending extensional regional structure or a NW – SE trending basement structure. The collapse of Rotorua caldera, and geometry of the deformation margin, are related to the interplay of these structures. At Ruawahia, the NE – SW trending <b>vent</b> <b>zone</b> is parallel to the regional extension across the OCC, as shown by the orientation of intrusion of the 1886 AD dyke through the Tarawera dome complex. The NE – SW trending regional structures observed at both Rotorua caldera and Okataina caldera complex are very similar to each other, but differ from extension within the Taupo rift to the south. Lava domes, such as Ngongotaha, that are controlled by this structure show that the ‘kink’ in the extension across Okataina caldera complex was active across Rotorua caldera during the collapse at 240 ka, and possibly earlier. This study shows the evolution of dyke-fed lava domes during eruption, and the control of regional structures in the location and timing of eruption. These findings improve our knowledge {{of the evolution of}} porosity and permeability in a compacting lava dome, as well as of the structures of Rotorua caldera, the longevity of volcanic activity at dormant calderas and the hazard potential of dyke-fed lava domes. ...|$|E
5000|$|Guinevere Planitia is an {{expansive}} lowland region of Venus that lies east of Beta Regio {{and west of}} Eistla Regio (quadrangle V-30). These low-lying plains, particularly in the western portion, are characterized by apparent volcanic source vents and broad regions of bright, dark, and mottled deposits. They are the only break in an equatorially connected zone of highlands and tectonic zones. The types, numbers, and patterns of mapped tectonic features and small volcanic landforms in the region provide important detail in the interpretation and evolution of venusian landscape. [...] By using Pioneer Venus, Goldstone, and Arecibo data, these regions have been interpreted as widespread superposed flows that originated from the source <b>vents.</b> Fracture <b>zones</b> and lineament belt segments that have been identified are said to represent the Beta-Eistla deformation zones of the region.

40|$|Miocene seep-carbonates {{have been}} {{reported}} from marine sedimentary successions of the northern Apennines {{in the form of}} huge isolated carbonate bodies (type 1) and numerous horizontally and vertically scattered marly-calcareous lenses (type 2) (Conti and Fontana, 2005 and references herein). They are recognized by their peculiar palaeoecological, sedimentological, compositional and isotopic features as products of the microbial oxidation of methane-rich fluids and represent an excellent example of carbonate bodies interpreted as the remains of ancient cold seeps. In the Apenninic chain, the abundance and the extent of the outcrops provide a rare opportunity to study the geometry, facies distribution and internal structures of fossil seep-carbonates. The main parameters which control the composition and development of a carbonate body are the methane pressure in interstitial sedimentary fluids, the flux discharge and rate in the <b>venting</b> <b>zone,</b> and the evolutionary path of the rising fluids (Roberts, 2001). Mineralogical, petrographic analyses, carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of type 1 and 2 carbonate samples indicate that different mechanisms of hydrocarbon fluid expulsion and variations in the upward methane flux control carbonate types and mineralogy. Mineralogical analyses of type 1 carbonate samples indicate that dolomite and ankerite represent the dominant phases, while low-Mg calcite is the type 2 dominant carbonate phase. The carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of the carbonates display very large ranges, from - 10 ‰ to - 55 ‰ V-PDB, and from - 3 ‰ to 6 ‰ V-PDB, respectively. Seep-carbonate type 1 appear significantly depleted in δ 13 C (ranging from - 30 ‰ to - 55 ‰ V-PDB) while seep-carbonate type 2 are only moderately depleted (δ 13 C varying from - 10 ‰ to - 23 ‰ V-PDB). Petrographic observations show complex facies relationships, as indicative of different stages in seep-carbonates growth. Type 1 seep-carbonates could be related to constant and discrete fluid seepage conditions while type 2 could be explained by variations in the upward methane flux (increasing, decreasing flow rates). The intraformational and rarely extraformational polygenic breccias which are often observed in the basal portions of type 1 seep-carbonates could indicate phases of violent venting of gaseous-rich fluids. The explosive escaping of carbon-rich fluids interrupted the conditions of constant fluid seepage and caused brecciation of the carbonate body. Our presentation will report the result of a detailed field observation of the two types of seep-carbonates coupled with geochemical, petrographic and mineralogical studies...|$|R

For this, near-surface sediment pressure cores and free gas venting from the seafloor were collected using autoclave technology at the Batumi seep area at 845 m water depth within the gas hydrate stability <b>zone.</b> <b>Vent</b> gas, gas from pressure core degassing, and from hydrate dissociation were strongly dominated by methane (> 99. 85 mol. ...|$|R
40|$|Between 1994 and 2010, we {{completed}} 16 thermal {{surveys of}} Vulcano’s Fossa fumarole field (Aeolian Islands, Italy). In each survey, between 400 and 1, 200 vent temperatures were collected using a thermal infrared thermometer from distances of ∼ 1 m. The results show a general decrease in average vent temperature during 1994 – 2003, {{with the average}} for the entire field falling from ∼ 220 °C in 1994 to ∼ 150 °C by 2003. However, between 2004 and 2010, we witnessed heating, with the average increasing to ∼ 190 °C by 2010. Alongside these annual-scale field-wide trends, we record a spatial re-organisation of the fumarole field, characterised by shut down of <b>vent</b> <b>zones</b> towards the crater floor, matched by rejuvenation of zones located towards the crater rim. Heating {{may be expected to}} be associated with deflation because increased amounts of vaporisation will remove volume from the hydrothermal system Gambino and Guglielmino (J Geophys Res 113 : B 07402, 2008). However, over the 2004 – 2010 heating period, no ground deformation was observed. Instead, the number of seismic events increased from a typical rate of 37 events per month during 1994 – 2000 to 195 events per month during 2004 – 2010. As part of this increase, we noticed a much greater number of high-frequency events associated with rock fracturing. We thus suggest that the heating event of 2004 – 2010 was the result of changed permeability conditions, rather than change in the heat supply from the deeper magmatic source. Within this scenario, cooling causes shut down of lower sectors and re-establishment of pathways located towards the crater rim, causing fracturing, increased seismicity and heat flow in these regions. This is consistent with the zone of rejuvenation (which lies towards and at the rim) being the most favourable location for fracturing given the stress field of the Fossa cone Schöpa et al. (J Volcanol Geotherm Res 203 : 133 – 145, 2011); it is also the most established zone, having been active at least since the early twentieth century. Our data show the value of deploying multi-disciplinary geophysical campaigns at degassing (fumarolic) hydrothermal systems. This allows more complete and constrained understanding of the true heat loss dynamics of the system. In the case study presented here, it allows us to distinguish true heating from apparent heating phases. While the former are triggered from the bottom-up, i. e. they are driven by increases in heat supply from the magmatic source, the latter are triggered from the top-down, i. e. by changing permeability conditions in the uppermost portion of the system to allow more efficient heat flow over zones predisposed to fracturing...|$|R

It is shown that fountain height is very sensitive to changes in exsolved gas content (and, thus, can be used to estimate variability in exsolved gas content) and relatively insensitive to large variations in volume flux. Volume flux was found to be the {{most important}} parameter determining the equilibrium vent diameter.

40|$|The {{focus of}} our {{investigation}} was on the application of digital topographic data in conducting first-order volcanological and structural studies of tropical volcanoes, focusing on the Java, the Philippines and the Galapagos Islands. Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, served as our test site for SRTM data validation. Volcanoes in humid tropical environments are frequently cloud covered, typically densely vegetated and erode rapidly, {{so that it was}} expected that new insights into the styles of eruption of these volcanoes could be obtained from analysis of topographic data. For instance, in certain parts of the world, such as Indonesia, even the regional structural context of volcanic centers is poorly known, and the distribution of volcanic products (e. g., lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and lahars) are not well mapped. SRTM and Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) data were expected to provide new information on these volcanoes. Due to the cancellation of the VCL mission, we did not conduct any lidar studies during the duration of this project. Digital elevation models (DEMs) such as those collected by SRTM provide quantitative information about the time-integrated typical activity on a volcano and allow an assessment of the spatial and temporal contributions of various constructional and destructional processes to each volcano's present morphology. For basaltic volcanoes, P_c?w!m-d and Garbed (2000) have shown that gradual slopes (less than 5 deg.) occur where lava and tephra pond within calderas or in the saddles between adjacent volcanoes, as well as where lava deltas coalesce to form coastal plains. <b>Vent</b> concentration <b>zones</b> (axes of rift zones) have slopes ranging from 10 deg. to 12 deg. Differential vertical growth rates between <b>vent</b> concentration <b>zones</b> and adjacent mostly-lava flanks produce steep constructional slopes up to 40 ". The steepest slopes (locally approaching 90 deg.) are produced by fluvial erosion, caldera collapse, faulting, and catastrophic avalanches, all of which are usually identifiable. Due to the delay in the release of the SRTM data following the February 2000 flight, a significant part of our effort was devoted to the analog studies of the SRTM topographic data using topographic data from airborne interferometric radars. As part of the original SRTM Science Team, we proposed four study sites (Kilauea, Hawaii; Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines; Cerro Am 1 and Femandina volcanoes, Galapagos Islands; and Tengger caldera, Java) where we could conduct detailed geologic studies to evaluate the uses of SRTM data for the analysis of lava flows, lahars, erosion of ash deposits, and an evaluation of the structural setting of the volcanoes. Only near the end of this project was one of these SRTM Science Team products (Luzon Island, the Philippines) released to the community, and we only had limited time to work on these data...|$|R
40|$|Continental rifts show close spatial {{relations}} between faulting and volcanism, however the inter{{relations between}} each process and {{their roles in}} the accommodation of regional extension are not well understood. The geometric and kinematic relations between an active silicic caldera complex and active faults in the upper 3 - 4 km of the crust (i. e. Taupo Rift) are investigated using regional gravity data, digital elevation models, outcrop mapping, seismic reflection lines, focal mechanisms and an historical account of the 1886 AD Tarawera eruption adjacent to, and within, the Okataina Volcanic Centre, New Zealand. The location and geometry of the Okataina Caldera were influenced by pre-existing faults. The caldera is elongate north-south, has a maximum subsidence of 3 +/- 0. 5 km at the rift axis and occupies a 10 km hard-linked left step in the rift. The principal rift faults (55 - 75 degrees dip) define the location and geometry of the northwest and southeast margins and locally accommodate piecemeal caldera collapse. Segments of {{the east and west}} margins of the caldera margin are near vertical (70 - 90 degrees dip), trend north-south, and are inferred to be faults formed by the reactivation of a pervasive Mesozoic basement fabric (i. e. bedding, terrane boundaries, and/or faults). Measured displacements along the Paeroa and Whirinaki Fault zones in, and adjacent to, the Okataina Volcanic Centre took place over time periods ranging from 60 to 220 ka (together with historical accounts of the 1886 AD Tarawera eruption). These indicate that neither dike intrusion nor caldera collapse have a measurable influence on fault displacement rates outside the volcanic complex. Within the volcanic complex, vertical displacement along the Whirinaki Fault zone increases by up to 50 % between the caldera topographic margin and inner collapse boundary. This increase in vertical displacement is predominantly due to the collapse of the caldera 60 ka ago. In the Okataina Volcanic Centre, extension is accommodated by a combination of tectonic faulting, dike intrusion, and gravitational caldera collapse. Gravitational caldera collapse is however, superimposed on regional extension without contributing to it. Rift-orthogonal extension dominates across the Taupo Rift with a minor (</= 20 degrees) component of right-lateral slip increasing northwards. The regional principal horizontal extension direction rotates 30 degrees clockwise south to north along the rift. The modal principal horizontal extension direction for the Okataina Volcanic Centre trends ~ 145 degrees, approximately normal to northeast striking rift faults and intra-caldera linear <b>vent</b> <b>zones,</b> and oblique to north-south faults. Zones of crustal weakness, brittle deformation, and dilation at the intersections of northeast-southwest dip slip and north-south oblique slip active fault sets are inferred to locally promote the ascent of magma. Preliminary examination of volcanism outside the Okataina Volcanic Centre suggests that intersecting northeast-southwest and north-south fault sets may also play a role in defining the geometry of calderas and locations of volcanic centres throughout the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Outside these volcanic centres (e. g. Taupo and Okataina) active extension is primarily accommodated by normal faulting which is driven by tectonic processes (e. g. far-field plate motions) and is not attributed to dike intrusion. The Taupo Rift has not yet reached the stage where it is dominated by magma-assisted extension and is primarily a young tectonic rift in an arc environment...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-four new {{heat flow}} {{measurements}} {{in the central}} troughs of the Guaymas basin {{support the hypothesis that}} they are sites of active intrusion. In the northern trough a distinct pattern of hydrothermal cooling is revealed, with venting along the western boundary fault of the trough. In the southern trough an analogous pattern is apparently superimposed upon a conductive cooling anomaly associated with a recent central intrusion. The discharge of thermal waters occurs along the boundary faults and through other faults associated with a possible horst block located in the north central floor of the southern trough. The heat flow patterns suggest that the intrusions are episodic and do not occur simultaneously along the length (15 – 40 km) of a spreading segment. A review of all available heat flow measurements for the Guaymas basin suggests that most of the recharge for a pervasive regional hydrothermal system is limited to the central depressions, with perhaps some contribution from pore water. The discharge of thermal waters occurs predominantly in the central depressions and possibly along the boundary transform faults and fracture zones. The regions of the basin more than a few kilometers in distance from the spreading axis, although presumably underlain by a hydrothermal system, are probably not the location of numerous <b>vents</b> or recharge <b>zones...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) is {{investigated}} {{to determine}} the interaction of regional structure and volcanism. A three-tiered approach is employed involving (i) analysis of rift geometry and segmentation in Modem TVZ(< 300 ka) from remote sensing and digital topographic data; (ii) fault kinematic data collected {{along the length of}} TVZ; and (iii) combining new and existing volcanological data for TVZ. Modem TVZ is a NNE-SSW trending intra-arc rift zone, subject to dextral transtension, and characterised by a segmented axial rift zone with a number of offset and variably oriented rift segments. These segments are subject to varying degrees of extension, and a general correlation exists between the amount of extension and the volume and style of volcanism in each segment. Segments with the highest degrees of extension correspond to the Okataina and Taupo Caldera Complexes in the central rhyolitic zone of Modem TVZ, while segments with a higher degree of dextral transtension correspond to the volumetrically-subordinate andesitic extremities. The influence of the structural framework on the shape and formation of calderas in Modem TVZ has been inferred from remote sensing and ground-based structural analysis. Detailed analysis of caldera structure and geometry in Modem TVZ indicates that caldera evolution is largely a function of caldera location relative to the axial rift zone. Calderas peripheral to the rift are simple, single-event structures, while those located within the axial rift zone are multiple-event caldera complexes with geometries dictated by their coincidence with rift faulting. These results show that in Modem TVZ the type, volume, and spatial distribution of magmatic activity is strongly influenced by rift structure and kinematics. The inter-relationship between rift geometry and caldera-complex development is particularly clear at the intra-rift Okataina Caldera Complex (OCC). OCC is located at a step-over in the rift where local rotation of the extension direction accompanies the development of a major transfer zone. Three main collapse events are spatially concentrated in a zone of orthogonal extension within the transfer zone. The 28 x 22 km OCC is elongate parallel to the extension direction, with a complicated topographic margin largely controlled by regional faulting. Major embayments occur on each side of OCC where it is intersected by adjacent rift segments. These are contiguous with two intra-caldera dome complexes forming two overlapping linear <b>vent</b> <b>zones,</b> which transect the caldera complex. The development of volcanism at OCC records the progressive interaction between offset rift segments and the propagation of overlapping rift segment axes. As rift propagation proceeded, a diffuse zone of volcanism progressively concentrated in the centre of the transfer zone then divided into two spatially restricted eruptive centres as through-going faults became established. Field investigations at OCC reveal a major revision to the eruptive stratigraphy that has implications {{for the development of the}} caldera and for hazard assessment in northern TVZ. Kawerau Ignimbrite is a partially welded pumice-rich ignimbrite that fills Puhipuhi Basin on the eastern side of the caldera complex and forms a thick terrace in and around the Kawerau township area. Within Puhipuhi Basin it is ~ 100 m thick, exposed on clear-felled knolls and locally forms jointed bluffs in thickest sections where it is valley ponded. Originally mapped as Kaingaroa Ignimbrite, it was subsequently considered distinct and renamed Kawerau Ignimbrite by Beresford & Cole (2000) with an accepted age of 240 ka. In Puhipuhi basin the Kawerau Ignimbrite overlies both the ~ 280 ka Matahina and ~ 65 ka Rotoiti ignimbrites and also the older tephras of the 43 - 31 ka Mangaone Subgroup. Whole-rock and glass geochemistry tie the ignimbrite specifically to the 33 ka Unit I eruptive phase of the subgroup, vastly increasing the eruptive volume of that unit and implying caldera collapse in this recent phase of OCC activity. Two pumice compositions are identified, reflecting eruption of two distinct magma bodies. Vertical variation in the ignimbrite records rapid depletion of a subordinate dacitic magma such that pumices of this composition are rare beyond proximal exposures. Lithic and pumice size distribution data indicate a source within OCC to the west of Puhipuhi basin. The residual volume of the ignimbrite is < 15 km 3, but estimates of the original volume approach 50 km 3 when intra-caldera volumes are considered. Kawerau Ignimbrite thus represents the largest eruption from OCC in the last 65 ka since the Rotoiti event, and is the youngest partially-welded ignimbrite in TVZ...|$|R
30|$|Clearly, the {{differences}} between the two catchments can be attributed to the magnitude of volcanic disturbance in proximal areas from the eruption itself and post-eruptive lahar deposition. The head of the Akagawa catchment includes the 2014 <b>vents</b> and a <b>zone</b> of hydrothermal alteration; this area was directly affected by the 2014 eruption and received relatively thick pyroclastic fall deposits. Pyroclastic density current deposits were also emplaced, and a rain-triggered lahar developed in the upstream part of the Akagawa River valley. The absence of diagnostic mineral grains from the 2014 eruption in the Shirakawa River sediments and the low suspended sediment concentration immediately after the eruption indicate that the volume of pyroclastic density current deposits in the Shirakawa catchment was small, although details of their distribution and thickness are not well known (e.g., Yamamoto 2014). This finding suggests that a thin mantle of ashfall in the catchment could have resulted in limited sediment input to the river. Similar contrasts in sediment supply were observed in several catchments after the much larger eruption at Mount St. Helens in 1980. The catchments that were disturbed by pyroclastic flows, a debris avalanche, and lahars from Mount St Helens maintained high levels of sediment transport long after the eruption, whereas river catchments that were affected only by ashfall deposition returned to background sedimentation levels within a relatively short time span (Major et al. 2000).|$|R
40|$|Volcanogenic massive {{sulphide}} deposits {{are important}} sources of base metals throughout the world. The Canadian Cu-Zn-(Au, Ag) deposits of Archaean age occur in greenstone terrains within the Canadian Shield. These deposits are {{closely associated with}} volcanic <b>vents</b> developed along <b>zones</b> of rifting within mobile belts. The vents are manifested by coarse felsic pyroclastics and/or rhyolitic domes. The Japanese Pb-Zn-Cu-Ba(Ag) deposits, generally known as Kuroko deposits, are of Miocene age, and although also associated with volcanic vents, are developed above zones of subduction. Mineralization in volcanogenic deposits {{is a result of}} submarine exhalation of metalliferous hydrothermal solutions derived from fractionation of predominantly calc-alkaline magmas. The deposits are characterized by certain geological features that result from the interaction of specific physical and chemical conditions during deposition. Primary features include massive and stringer sulphide bodies, alteration zones, mineralogical and metal zoning, and certain depositional textures and structures. These features are commonly modified by subsequent metamorphism and deformation which impart secondary ore textures and affect metal distribution and shape. The disparity in age between Canadian and Japanese deposits allows the entire spectrum of geological features to be studied; from the completely unaltered to the high deformed and recrystallized. The characteristic geological features are the prime factors which control the metal distribution and concentration, and {{the size and shape of}} the deposits, thereby influencing the viability of the respective ore bodies. A knowledge of these factors and the physico-chemical parameters which control them are thus fundamental in the "understanding" of these deposits.

40|$|In {{order to}} fully {{understand}} the cycling of elements in hydrothermal systems {{it is critical to}} understand intra-field variations in geochemical and microbiological processes in both focused, high-temperature and diffuse, low-temperature areas. To reveal important causes and effects of this variation, we performed an extensive chemical and microbiological characterization of a low-temperature venting area in the Loki’s Castle Vent Field (LCVF). This area, located at the flank of the large sulfide mound, is characterized by numerous chimney-like barite (BaSO 4) structures (≤ 1 m high) covered with white cotton-like microbial mats. Results from geochemical analyses, microscopy (FISH, SEM), 16 S rRNA gene amplicon-sequencing and metatranscriptomics were compared to results from previous analyses of biofilms growing on black smoker chimneys at LCVF. Based on our results, we constructed a conceptual model involving the geochemistry and microbiology in the LCVF. The model suggests that CH 4 and H 2 S are important electron donors for microorganisms in both high-temperature and low-temperature areas, whereas the utilization of H 2 seems restricted to high-temperature areas. This further implies that sub-seafloor processes can affect energy-landscapes, elemental cycling, and the metabolic activity of primary producers on the seafloor. In the cotton-like microbial mats on top of the active barite chimneys, a unique network of single cells of Epsilonproteobacteria interconnected by threads of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was seen, differing significantly from the long filamentous Sulfurovum filaments observed in biofilms on the black smokers. This network also induced nucleation of barite crystals and is suggested to play an essential role {{in the formation of the}} microbial mats and the chimneys. Furthermore, it illustrates variations in how different genera of Epsilonproteobacteria colonize and position cells in different <b>vent</b> fluid mixing <b>zones</b> within a <b>vent</b> field. This may be related to niche-specific physical characteristics. Altogether, the model provides a reference for future studies and illustrates the importance of systematic comparative studies of spatially closely connected niches in order {{to fully understand}} the geobiology of hydrothermal systems...|$|R

We investigated gases from a submarine high-flux seepage site in the anoxic Eastern Black Sea in order to elucidate molecular and isotopic alterations of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (LMWHC) associated with upward migration through the sediment and precipitation of shallow gas hydrates. For this, near-surface sediment pressure cores and free gas venting from the seafloor were collected using autoclave technology at the Batumi seep area at 845 m water depth within the gas hydrate stability <b>zone.</b> <b>Vent</b> gas, gas from pressure core degassing, and from hydrate dissociation were strongly dominated by methane (> 99. 85 mol. % of ∑[C 1 -C 4, CO 2]). Molecular ratios of LMWHC (C 1 /[C 2 + C 3] > 1000) and stable isotopic compositions of methane (δ 13 C = - 53. 5 ‰ V-PDB; D/H around - 175 ‰ SMOW) indicated predominant microbial methane formation. C 1 /C 2 + ratios and stable isotopic compositions of LMWHC distinguished three gas types prevailing in the seepage area. Vent gas discharged into bottom waters was depleted in methane by > 0. 03 mol. % (∑[C 1 -C 4, CO 2]) relative to the other gas types and the virtual lack of 14 C-CH 4 indicated a negligible input of methane from degradation of fresh organic matter. Of all gas types analyzed, vent gas was least affected by molecular fractionation, thus, its origin from the deep subsurface rather than from decomposing hydrates in near-surface sediments is likely. As a result of the anaerobic oxidation of methane, LMWHC in pressure cores in top sediments included smaller methane fractions [0. 03 mol. % ∑(C 1 -C 4, CO 2) ] than gas released from pressure cores of more deeply buried sediments, where the fraction of methane was maximal due to its preferential incorporation in hydrate lattices. No indications for stable carbon isotopic fractionations of methane during hydrate crystallization from vent gas were found. Enrichments of 14 C-CH 4 (1. 4 pMC) in short cores relative to lower abundances (max. 0. 6 pMC) in gas from long cores and gas hydrates substantiates recent methanogenesis utilizing modern organic matter deposited in top sediments of this high-flux hydrocarbon seep area. © 2009 Elsevier B.

Here, we test {{the application of the}} advection–diffusion equation to tephra sedimentation using data collected on the proximal (350 to ~ 1, 200 m from the vent) to medial (greater than ~ 1, 200 m from the vent) tephra blanket of a basaltic cinder cone, Cerro Negro volcano, located in Nicaragua. Our understanding of tephra depositional processes at this volcano is significantly improved by combination of sample pit data in the medial zone and high-resolution ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data collected in the near <b>vent</b> and proximal <b>zones.</b> If the advection–diffusion equation applies, then the thickness of individual tephra deposits should have Gaussian crosswind profiles and exponential decay with distance away from the vent. At Cerro Negro, steady trade winds coupled with brief eruptions of relatively low energy (VEI 2 – 3) create relatively simple deposits. GPR data were collected along three crosswind profiles at distances of 700 – 1, 600 m from the vent; sample pits were used to estimate thickness of the 1992 tephra deposit up to 13 km from the vent. Horizons identified in proximal GPR profiles exhibit Gaussian distributions {{with a high degree of}} statistical confidence, with diffusion coefficients of ~ 500 m 2 s− 1 estimated for the deposits, confirming that the advection–diffusion equation is capable of modeling sedimentation in the proximal zone. The thinning trend downwind of the vent decreases exponentially from the cone base (350 m) to ~ 1, 200 m from the vent. Beyond this distance, deposit overthickening occurs, identified in both GPR and sample pit datasets. The combined data reveal three depositional regimes: (1) a near-vent region on the cone itself, where fallout remobilizes in granular flows upon deposition; (2) a proximal zone in which particles fall from a height of less than ~ 2 km; and (3) a medial zone, in which particles fall from ~ 4 to 7 km and the deposit is thicker than expected based on thinning trends observed in the proximal zone of the deposit. This overthickening of the tephra blanket, defining the transition from proximal to medial depositional facies, is indicative of transition from sedimentation dominated by fallout from plume margins to that dominated by fallout from the buoyant eruption cloud—a feature of deposits previously identified in larger-volume eruptions. We interpret this change to represent a change in diffusion law, occurring at total particle fall times (the fall time threshold of numerical models) of ~ 400 s. Thus, the detailed GPR profiles and pit data collected at Cerro Negro help to validate current numerical models of tephra sedimentation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The Varandan Ba-Pb-Cu {{deposits}} {{are located}} 15 km {{southwest of the}} town of Qamsar and approximately 7 km south west of the Qazaan village, in the Urumieh- Dokhtar magmatic arc. The Kashan region that is situated in west-central Iran hosts several barite-base metal deposits and occurrences, the biggest ones are the Varandan Ba-Pb-Cu (case considered in this study) and the Tapeh-Sorkh (Khalajmaasomi et al., 2010) and Dorreh Ba (Nazari, 1994) deposits. Previous researchers (Izadi, 1996; Farokhpey et al., 2010) have proposed an epithermal model for formation of the Varandan deposit. However, based on some feature of the deposit, it seems that this genetic model may not be correct. Therefore, it is necessary to do more precise research studies on the deposit. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss the genesis of the Varandan deposit based on geological, ore facies, mineralogy, wall rock alterations, and geochemical studies. Materials and methods A field study and sampling was performed during the summer of 2013. To assess the geochemical characteristics of the deposit, about 17 systematic samples from different ore facies of the first, second and third sub-horizon were collected for petrography and mineralogy, and for inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy(ICP-AES), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) geochemical analysis methods. The microscopic studies were done in the optics laboratory of the Shahrood University, and the geochemical analyzes were conducted in laboratories of the Center of Research and Mineral Processing Ore Minerals of Iran, Karaj, Iran. Results The host sequence in the Varandan deposit involves three units, from bottom to top: Unit 1 : grey, green siliceous tuff, brecciated tuff, crystal tuff and andesite; Unit 2 : white grey nummulitic limestone, limy tuff and marl: and Unit 3 : tuff breccia and crystal lithic tuff. Mineralization in the Varandan deposit has occurred as four ore sub-horizons in Unit 1, as lenticular to tabular ore bodies concordant to layering of the host rocks. Based on textural, structural and mineralogical studies, the Varandan deposit consists of five ore facieses including: 1) veins-veinlets (stringer zone) that involves cross-cuting barite, quartz and sulfide veins-veinlets, 2) brecciated barite and massive pyrite (<b>vent</b> complex <b>zone)</b> involving replacement texture, 3) massive barite and sulfide (massive zone), 4) alternations of barite- and galena- rich bands (Bedded-banded zone) and; 5) iron-manganese-bearing hydrothermal-exhalative sediments. Primary ore minerals are barite, galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite, tetrahedrite, magnetite, oligiste, braunite, pyrolusite and bornite, accompanied with secondary minerals such as native copper, cuprite, digenite, covellite, chalcosite, goethite, hematite and malachite. Gangue minerals consist of chlorite, sericite, quartz and calcite. Major wall rock alterations in the deposit are chloritic and quartz- sericitic. For determining the type of ore of the Varandan deposit, the Cu/Zn ratio for the barite and sulfide ore of the first, second and third sub-horizon are 1. 08, 0. 12 and 11. 08, respectively. This lies in the yellow ore for the first and third sub-horizon, and it falls in the black ore for the second sub-. Discussion According to the basic characteristics of mineralization such as geometry of ore bodies, textures and structures, ore facies, wall rock alterations, mineralogy, fluid inclusions data, metal zonation and geochemical features, the Varandan deposit could be classified as a bimodal-felsic or Kuroko-type voclanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit, similar to those of the Hokuroko basin in Japan (Ohmoto and Skinner, 1983; Hoy, 1995, Huston et al., 2011). The Varandan deposit has been formed in an intra-arc setting due to subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic crust beneath the Iranian plate during the Middle Eocene.

40|$|In August of 1964 the U. S. Geological Survey {{established}} seismic-refraction profiles {{along the}} northeast, southwest, and west coasts {{of the roughly}} triangular-shaped Island of Hawaii. Shots were fired at 10 -km intervals along each coast from the U. S. Coast Guard Cutter CAPE SMALL and were recorded on shore by five refraction units spaced at approximately 25 km intervals along each coast. Most of these shots were also recorded on the 13 seismograph stations maintained on Hawaii by the U. S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. These data were supplemented by recordings on the 13 -station seismograph network and two mobile systems of three 500 -ton chemical explosions deronated by the U. S. Navy on Kahoolawe {{as part of the}} SAILOR HAT program and by a re-evaluation of arrivals recorded on the seismograph network from seismic-refraction profiles shot off the northeast coast of Hawaii by Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1962. Interpretation of the resulting seismograms suggests that the crust under Hawaii can be divided into two principal layers: (1) a basal layer 4 to 8 km thick with P-wave velocities of 7. 0 to 7. 2 km/sec, and (2) an upper layer 4 to 8 km thick in which P-wave velocities increase with depth from 1. 8 to 3. 3 km/sec at the surface to 5. 1 to 6. 0 km/sec at depth. The basal layer is probably the original oceanic crust under Hawaii plus the intrusive system associated with central <b>vents</b> and rift <b>zones,</b> and the upper layer is the accumulated pile of lava flows that form the bulk of the island. The crust along the northeast and southwest flanks of Kilauea is 11 to 12 km thick with P-wave velocities increasing in the upper layer from 1. 8 km/sec at the surface to 5. 1 km/sec at depth. The basal layer is 4 km thick and has a P-wave velocity of 7. 1 km/sec. A 7. 0 -km/sec layer at depths of 3 to 5 km under the northeast flanks of Mauna Kea and Kohala Mountain masks first-arrival evidence for deeper structure, but secondary arrivals interpreted as reflections from the M discontinuity suggest that the underlying crust may be anywhere between 12 and 20 km thick. This shallow 7. 0 -km/sec layer is probably associated with the nearby rift zones of Kohala Mountain and Mauna Kea. The crust increases in thickness along the west coast of Hawaii from about 14 km under the flanks of Kohala Mountain and Hualalai to about 18 km under the flank of Mauna Loa. P-wave velocities along this coast increase with depth from 2. 5 km/sec at the surface to 6. 0 km/sec at about 10 km, and the lower 4 to 6 km of the crust has a P-wave velocity of about 7. 2 km/sec. The upper mantle P-wave velocity under most of the island is 8. 2 km/sec but may decrease to 8. 1 km/sec under the southeast flank of Kilauea. Material with mantle-like P-wave velocity appears to bulge up under the summit of Kilauea to a depth as shallow as 10 or 11 km. Early P-wave arrivals associated with the summits and major rift zones of the volcanoes indicate that material with velocities as high as 7. 0 km/sec approaches within 2 or 3 km of the surface under these structures and merges at depth with the 7. 1 - to 7. 2 -km/sec layer forming the base of the crust. ...|$|R
40|$|The Middle Valley segment at the {{northern}} end of the Juan de Fuca Ridge is a deep extensional rift blanketed with 200 - 500 m of Pleistocene turbiditic sediment. Sites 857 and 858 were drilled during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 139 to determine whether these two sites were hydrologically linked end members of an active hydrothermal circulation system. Site 858 was placed in an area of active hydrothermal discharge with fluids up to 270 °C venting through anhydrite-bearing mounds on top of altered sediment. The shallow basement of fine-grained basalt that underlies the vents at Site 858 is interpreted as a seamount that was subsequently buried by turbidites. Site 857 was placed 1. 6 km south of the Site 858 <b>vents</b> in a <b>zone</b> of high heat flow and numerous seismically imaged ridge-parallel faults. Drilling at Site 857 encountered sediments that are increasingly altered with depth and that overlie a series of mafic sills at depths of 460 - 940 m below sea floor. Sill margins and adjacent baked sediment are highly altered to magnesian chlorite and crosscut with veins filled with quartz, chlorite, sulfides, epidote, and wairakite. The sill interiors vary from slightly altered, with unaltered plagioclase and clinopyroxene in a mesostasis replaced by chlorite, to local zones of intense alteration and brecciation. In these latter zones, the sill interiors are pervasively replaced by chlorite, epidote, quartz, pyrite, titanite, and rare actinolite. The most complete replacement is associated with brecciated horizons with low recovery and slickensides on fracture surfaces, which we interpret as intersections between faults and the sills. Geochemically, the alteration of the sill complex is reflected in significant whole-rock depletions in Ca, Sr, and Na with corresponding enrichments in Mg, Al, and most metals. The latter results from the formation of conspicuous sulfide poikiloblasts. In contrast, metamorphism of the Site 858 seamount includes incomplete albitization of plagioclase phenocrysts and replacement of sparse mafic phenocrysts. Much of the basement alteration at Site 858 is confined to crosscutting veins except for a highly altered and veined horizon at the contact between basaltic basement and the overlying sediment. The sill complex at Site 857 is more highly depleted in 18 O (d 18 O = 2. 4 per mil - 4. 7 per mil) and more pervasively replaced by secondary minerals relative to the extrusives at Site 858 (d 18 O = 4. 5 per mil - 5. 5 per mil). There is no evidence of significant albitization of the plagioclase at Site 857, suggesting high Ca/Na in the pore fluids. Fluid-inclusion data from hydrothermal minerals in altered mafic rocks and veins at Sites 857 and 858 show a consistency of homogenization temperatures, varying from 245 to 270 °C, which is within the range of temperatures observed for the fluids venting at Site 858. The consistency of the fluid inclusion temperatures, the lack of albitization within the Site 857 sills, and the apparently low water/rock ratio collectively suggest that the sill complex at Site 857 is in thermal equilibrium and being altered by a highly evolved Ca-rich fluid similar to the fluids now venting at Site 858. The alteration evident in these two deep crustal drillsites {{is a result of the}} ongoing hydrothermal circulation and is consistent with downhole logging results, instrumented borehole results, and hydrothermal fluid chemistry. The pervasive alteration of the laterally extensive sill-sediment complex at Site 857 determines the chemistry of the fluids that are venting at Site 858. The limited alteration of the Site 858 lavas suggests that this basement edifice acts as a penetrator or ventilator for the regional hydrothermal reservoir with much of the flow focussed at the highly altered and veined sediment-basalt contact...|$|R
