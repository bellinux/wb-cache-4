40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Valnemulin,</b> a semisynthetic pleuromutilin {{derivative}} {{related to}} tiamulin, is broadly {{used to treat}} bacterial diseases of animals. Despite its widespread use, metabolism in animals {{has not yet been}} fully investigated. To better understand <b>valnemulin</b> biotransformation, in this study, metabolites of valnemulinin in in vitro and in vivo rats, chickens, swines, goats, and cows were identified and elucidated using ultraperformance liquid chromatography−quadrupole/time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS). As a result, there were totally 7 metabolites of <b>valnemulin</b> identified in vitro and 75, 61, and 74 metabolites detected in in vivo rats, chickens, and swines, respectively, and the majority of metabolites were reported for the first time. The main metabolic pathways of <b>valnemulin</b> were found to be hydroxylation in the mutilin part (the ring system) and the side chain, oxidization on the sulfur of the side chain to form S-oxides, hydrolysis of the amido bond, and acetylization in the amido of the side chain. In addition, hydroxylation in the mutilin part was proposed to be the primary metabolic route. Furthermore, the results revealed that 2 β-hydroxyvalnemulin (V 1) and 8 α-hydroxyvalnemulin (V 2) were the major metabolites for rats and swines and S-oxides (V 6) in chickens...|$|E

40|$|Tiamulin is a pleuromutilin {{antibiotic}} {{that is used}} in veterinary medicine. The {{recently published}} crystal structure of a tiamulin- 50 S ribosomal subunit complex provides detailed information about how this drug targets the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome. To promote rational design of pleuromutilin-based drugs, the binding of the antibiotic pleuromutilin and three semisynthetic derivatives with different side chain extensions has been investigated using chemical footprinting. The nucleotides A 2058, A 2059, G 2505, and U 2506 are affected {{in all of the}} footprints, suggesting that the drugs are similarly anchored in the binding pocket by the common tricyclic mutilin core. However, varying effects are observed at U 2584 and U 2585, indicating that the side chain extensions adopt distinct conformations within the cavity and thereby affect the rRNA confor-mation differently. An Escherichia coli L 3 mutant strain is resistant to tiamulin and pleuromutilin, but not <b>valnemulin,</b> implying that <b>valnemulin</b> is better able to withstand an altered rRNA binding surface around the mutilin core. This is likely due to additional interactions made between the <b>valnemulin</b> side chain extension and the rRNA binding site.

40|$|Pleuromutilins (tiamulin and <b>valnemulin)</b> are {{antimicrobial}} agents {{that are used}} mainly in veterinary medicine, especially for swine {{and to a lesser}} extent for poultry and rabbits. In pigs, tiamulin and <b>valnemulin</b> are used to treat swine dysentery, spirochaete-associated diarrhoea, porcine proliferative enteropathy, enzootic pneumonia and other infections where Mycoplasma is involved. There are concerns about the reported increases in the MICs of tiamulin and <b>valnemulin</b> for porcine Brachyspira hyodysenteriae isolates from different European countries, as only a limited number of antimicrobials are available for the treatment of swine dysentery where resistance to these antimicrobials is already common and widespread. The loss of pleuromutilins as effective tools to treat swine dysentery because of further increases in resistance or as a consequence of restrictions would present a considerable threat to pig health, welfare and productivity.

In this work, individual 23 S rRNA mutations associated with pleuromutilin resistance at positions 2055, 2447, 2504 and 2572 (Escherichia coli numbering) are introduced into a Mycobacterium smegmatis strain with a single rRNA operon. The single mutations each confer a significant and similar degree of <b>valnemulin</b> resistance and those at 2447 and 2504 also confer cross-resistance to other antibiotics that bind to the PTC in M. smegmatis. Antibiotic footprinting experiments on mutant ribosomes show that the introduced mutations cause structural perturbations at the PTC and reduced binding of pleuromutilin antibiotics. This work underscores the fact that mutations at nucleotides distant from the pleuromutilin binding site can confer the same level of <b>valnemulin</b> resistance as those at nucleotides abutting the bound drug, and suggests that the former function indirectly by altering local structure and flexibility at the drug binding pocket...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to characterize Brachyspira hyodysenteriae isolates and to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of strains obtained from pigs in Brazil based on the minimal inhibitory concentration test (MIC). The MIC was performed for 22 B. hyodysenteriae isolates obtained from 2011 to 2013 using the following antimicrobial drugs: tylosin, tiamulin, <b>valnemulin,</b> doxycycline, lincomycin and tylvalosin. Outbreaks of swine dysentery were diagnosed based on clinical presentation, bacterial isolation, gross and microscopic lesions, duplex PCR for B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli and nox gene sequencing. All obtained MIC values were consistently higher or equal to the microbiological cut-off described in the literature. The MIC 90 values for the tested drugs were 8 μg/ml for doxycycline, > 4 μg/ml for <b>valnemulin,</b> 8 μg/ml for tiamulin, 32 μg/ml for tylvalosin, > 64 μg/ml for lincomycin and > 128 μg/ml for tylosin.

Results: High MIC 50 values were observed in the cases of tilmicosin (> 64 μ g/ml), oxytetracycline (64 μ g/ml), norfloxacin (> 10 μ g/ml) and difloxacin (10 μ g/ml). The examined strains yielded the same MIC 50 values with spectinomycin, tylosin and florfenicol (8 μ g/ml), while enrofloxacin (MIC 50 5 μ g/ml), doxycycline (MIC 50 5 μ g/ml), lincomycin (MIC 50 4 μ g/ml) and lincomycin-spectinomycin (1 : 2) combination (MIC 50 4 μ g/ml) inhibited the growth of the bacteria with lower concentrations.

40|$|Guidelines {{have been}} {{recently}} {{introduced in the}} European Union for antimicrobial products, to assess their potential for resistance development and for the demonstration of their efficacy using therapeutic regimens to minimise the risk of selecting antimicrobial resistance. A key {{part of this is}} the use of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis. Much work has been reported on the use of concentration-dependent bactericidal products such as the fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides administered by injection, in both man and animals, for systemic or respiratory infections. In contrast, little work has been reported on bacteriostatic compounds administered orally for enteric infections, which is the most common route for pigs. Two examples have been described-lincomycin for controlling Lawsonia intracellularis infections in the pig (porcine intestinal adenomatosis) and <b>valnemulin</b> for the prevention and treatment of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (swine dysentery). Predicted concentrations of lincomycin in the ileum in relation to the intracellular inhibitory concentrations (IIC) of lincomycin against L. intracellularis corresponded very closely with the clinical responses found in challenge studies. This {{may be due to the}} IIC study being a bio-model itself. With <b>valnemulin,</b> the concentrations in colonic contents had to be nine times higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration for B. hyodysenteriae to achieve preventative inhibition in a challenge study and 90 times higher to achieve bacterial elimination in a treatment study, as other factors come into play.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{anaerobic}} spirochetes Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli cause diarrheal {{diseases in}} pigs. Their fastidious nature has hampered standardization of methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. For monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility wild type cutoff values {{are needed to}} define where the wild type distribution of MICs ends and no approved cutoffs are available for Brachyspira spp. In this study antimicrobial susceptibility data for both species (in total 906 isolates) were compiled and analyzed and wild type cut off values for B. hyodysenteriae proposed. Methods The MICs of tiamulin, <b>valnemulin,</b> tylosin, tylvalosin, doxycycline and lincomycin were determined by broth dilution in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum. Results The compiled MICs from the broth dilution tests of the B. hyodysenteriae type strain, B 78 T (ATCC® 27164 T), showed that the method yields reproducible results. In an international perspective the frequencies of isolates with decreased antimicrobial susceptibility were low among both B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli. However, in B. pilosicoli a constant level of 10 - 15 % isolates with tiamulin MICs > 4 μg/ml was detected between 2002 and 2010 and in B. hyodysenteriae a gradual increase in tiamulin MICs was seen between 1990 and 2003 although this increase has ceased during the last years. The wild type cutoff values proposed for B. hyodysenteriae are: tiamulin > 0. 25 μg/ml, <b>valnemulin</b> > 0. 125 μg/ml, tylosin > 16 μg/ml, tylvalosin > 1 μg/ml, lincomycin > 1 μg/ml and doxycycline > 0. 5 μg/ml. Conclusions The broth dilution method {{used in this study}} has over the years generated tightly grouped MIC populations for the field isolates and reproducible results for the control strain B 78 T and is therefore a suitable antimicrobial susceptibility test method for monitoring of Brachyspira spp. Here we propose wild type cutoff values for six antimicrobial agents for B. hyodysenteriae tested by broth dilution based on MIC distributions and the current knowledge on mechanisms of resistance in this species. There are few studies on antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and MIC distributions in B. pilosicoli but to some extent the cutoff values proposed for B. hyodysenteriae may be applicable also for monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility in B. pilosicoli. </p...|$|E

For lincomycin and the macrolides, tylosin and tylvalosin, reproducibility {{was influenced by the}} occurrence of so-called skips. Furthermore, reduced susceptibility for lincomycin and resistance for tylosin could be detected. Sequencing of the 23 S rDNA revealed, that a point mutation is responsible for resistance and a possible explanation for the skipped wells. In a European comparison Switzerland is still in a favourable situation. However, accurate determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations is questionable, and a classification of isolates into susceptible and resistant isolates is difficult {{due to the lack of}} unambiguous classification criteria...|$|E
40|$|Invasive infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, {{including}} methicillin-resistant S. aureus are prevalent and life-threatening. Combinations {{of antibiotic}} therapy have been employed in many clinical settings for improving therapeutic efficacy, reducing {{side effects of}} drugs, and development of antibiotic resistance. Pleuromutilins have a potential to be developed as {{a new class of}} antibiotics for systemic use in humans. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between pleuromutilins, including <b>valnemulin,</b> tiamulin, and retapamulin, and 13 other antibiotics representing different mechanisms of action, against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus both in vitro and in an experimental Galleria mellonella model. In vitro synergistic effects were observed in combination of all three study pleuromutilins with tetracycline (TET) by standard checkerboard and/or time-kill assays. In addition, the combination of pleuromutilins with ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin showed antagonistic effects, while the rest combinations presented indifferent effects. Importantly, all study pleuromutilins in combination with TET significantly enhanced survival rates as compared to the single drug treatment in the G. mellonella model caused by S. aureus strains. Taken together, these results demonstrated synergy effects between pleuromutilins and TET against S. aureus both in vitro and in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The oxazolidinone {{antibiotic}} linezolid targets the {{peptidyl transferase}} center (PTC) on the bacterial ribosome. Thirteen single and four double 23 S rRNA mutations were introduced into a Mycobacterium smegmatis strain {{with a single}} rRNA operon. Converting bacterial base identity by single mutations at positions 2032, 2453, and 2499 to human cytosolic base identity did not confer significantly reduced susceptibility to linezolid. The largest decrease in linezolid susceptibility {{for any of the}} introduced single mutations was observed with the G 2576 U mutation at a position that is 7. 9 Å from linezolid. Smaller decreases were observed with the A 2503 G, U 2504 G, and G 2505 A mutations at nucleotides proximal to linezolid, showing that the degree of resistance conferred is not simply inversely proportional to the nucleotide-drug distance. The double mutations G 2032 A-C 2499 A, G 2032 A-U 2504 G, C 2055 A-U 2504 G, and C 2055 A-A 2572 U had remarkable synergistic effects on linezolid resistance relative to the effects of the corresponding single mutations. This study emphasizes that effects of rRNA mutations at the PTC are organism dependent. Moreover, the data show a nonpredictable cross-resistance pattern between linezolid, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and <b>valnemulin.</b> The data underscore the significance of mutations at distal nucleotides, either alone or in combination with other mutated nucleotides, in contributing to linezolid resistance...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in {{pigs and}} Mycoplasma bovis in cattle are major {{pathogens}} affecting livestock across Europe {{and are the}} focus of the MycoPath pan-European antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring programme. Fifty M. hyopneumoniae isolates from Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK), and 156 M. bovis isolates from France, Hungary, Spain and the UK that met specific criteria were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility in a central laboratory by using a microbroth dilution method. Specific isolate criteria included recovery from animals not recently treated with antimicrobials, isolates from different locations within each country and retaining only one isolate per farm. MIC 50 /MIC 90 values were 0. 031 / 0. 5, 0. 031 / 0. 5, 0. 062 / 0. 25, 64 / > 64, 32 / > 64, 2 / 4 and 4 / 64 mg/L, respectively against M. bovis. MIC 50 /MIC 90 values for tiamulin and <b>valnemulin</b> against M. hyopneumoniae were 0. 016 / 0. 062 and 64 / > 64 mg/L respectively. The highest MIC 90 values for M. hyopneumoniae were found in the UK at 1. 0 mg/L for enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin and florfenicol. In contrast, for M. bovis the lowest MIC 90 value was 1. 0 mg/L, but ranged to > 64 mg/L.

40|$|Background: The {{anaerobic}} spirochetes Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli cause diarrheal {{diseases in}} pigs. Their fastidious nature has hampered standardization of methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. For monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility wild type cutoff values {{are needed to}} define where the wild type distribution of MICs ends and no approved cutoffs are available for Brachyspira spp. In this study antimicrobial susceptibility data for both species (in total 906 isolates) were compiled and analyzed and wild type cut off values for B. hyodysenteriae proposed. Methods: The MICs of tiamulin, <b>valnemulin,</b> tylosin, tylvalosin, doxycycline and lincomycin were determined by broth dilution in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum. Results: The compiled MICs from the broth dilution tests of the B. hyodysenteriae type strain, B 78 T (ATCCW 27164 T), showed that the method yields reproducible results. In an international perspective the frequencies of isolates with decreased antimicrobial susceptibility were low among both B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli. However, in B. pilosicoli a constant level of 10 - 15 % isolates with tiamulin MICs> 4 μg/ml was detected between 2002 and 2010 and in B. hyodysenteriae a gradual increase in tiamulin MICs was seen between 1990 and 2003 although this increase has ceased during the last years. The wild type cutoff values proposed for B. hyodysenteriae are: tiamulin> 0. 25 μg/ml, valnemulin> 0. 125 μg/ml, tylosin> 16 μg/ml, tylvalosin> 1 μg/ml, lincomycin> 1 μg/ml an...|$|E
40|$|In Chapter 1 {{the usage}} of capture ELISA test and a {{selective}} differentiating medium in the diagnostics of the Mycoplasma bovis infection is presented. Out of 52 strains isolated from 510 various clinical specimens 43 were proven to be M. bovis by both culturing and capture ELISA. Out of 92 lung specimens 15 mycoplasma strains were isolated. All of them were identified as M. bovis by the above mentioned diagnostic methods. Samples from M. bovis challenged animals were examined by culturing, selective culturing and capture ELISA. The latter two methods have been proven to be rapid, highly specific and useful in the diagnostics of Mycoplasma bovis infection of cattle. Both capture ELISA and selective-differentiating medium give the same result as the time consuming conventional culturing of this organism. In Chapter 2 the production and testing of monoclonal antibodies against Mycoplasma bovis is discussed. To produce monoclonal antibodies, Balb/c AnN Crl BR mice were inoculated with the cell suspension of a Hungarian Mycoplasma bovis strain designated 26034. Three days after the last immunisation the spleen of the immunised mouse was removed aseptically. The fusion of spleen cells with Sp 2 / 0 -Ag 14 murine myeloma cells was performed {{in the presence of}} polyethylene glycol. The obtained hybrid cells were selected with HAT medium. Two weeks after the fusion the supernatants of the cells grown were tested by an own-developed indirect ELISA. The results showed that 63 antibody-producing hybridomas had been obtained. For accurate determination of the molecular weight of antigen determinants, the supernatants giving positive reaction in the ELISA were tested by Western blotting. According to the results, the obtained monoclonal antibodies recognise the antigen determinants of the following molecular weights: 1 B 11 : 63 kDa, 1 C 7 : 63 kDa, 2 C 5 : 22, 25 and 27 kDa, 2 C 9 : 69 kDa, 3 G 12 : 67, 69 and 72 kDa, 4 H 9 : 63 kDa, 5 B 8 : 22, 25 and 27 kDa, 5 D 3 : 22, 25 and 27 kDa, 5 C 11 : 69 kDa, 5 E 5 : 22, 25 and 27 kDa, 6 F 11 : 63 kDa, and 6 H 10 : 22, 25 and 27 kDa. The 12 cell groups {{selected on the basis of}} the Western blotting were cloned twice by end-point dilution method. The cloned cells were propagated, and with 5 cell lines antibodies were produced in the CELLine bioreactor. Cell line 3 G 12 showed the highest productivity with an average daily output of 1. 5 mg immunoglobulin. Cell line 5 E 5 produced 1. 1 mg, 6 H 10 0. 8 mg, 2 C 9 0. 47 mg and 6 F 11 0. 4 mg antibody per day. The isotype of the antibodies was determined by ELISA. The antibodies produced by the 12 cell lines tested were assigned to the IgG 1 subclass according to the heavy chain. Ten cell lines produced κ and two produced λ light-chain antibody. Possible crossreactions of the produced monoclonal anti-M. bovis antibodies with certain Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma and Acholeplasma species were tested by an indirect ELISA procedure. All of the 12 antibodies tested gave a reaction with the antigen of M. bovis strain designated 26034. Monoclonal antibodies 3 G 12 (67, 69, 72 kDa) and 5 B 8 (22, 25, 27 kDa) gave no cross-reaction with antigens other than strains of the homologous Mycoplasma species. The other antibodies reacted with the M. bovigenitalium F 7, M. sp. 8389, M. oculi and M. gallisepticum S 6 antigens. Owing to its high specificity and affinity, primarily the antibody produced by cell line 3 G 12 is considered suitable for use in immunodiagnostic tests of M. bovis infections. The produced antibodies were also tested with immunohystochemical method. These examinations demonstrated that the antibodies 6 H 10, 6 F 11 and 4 H 9 are suitable for the in situ detection of the M. bovis antigen. In Chapter 3 the prevalence of Mycoplasma bovis and the evaluation of its pathogenic role is discussed by application of a mathematical model. Thirty four large cattle herds were screened for the presence of Mycoplasma bovis infection by examination of cattle slaughtered at slaughterhouse for pneumonic lesions in the lungs, culturing of M. bovis from lung lesions and testing sera for presence of antibodies against M. bovis. A statistical model was developed, which confirmed the relationship between these 3 parameters. Among 595 examined cattle, 33. 9 % had pneumonic lesions, Mycoplasmas were isolated from 59. 9 % of pneumonic lung samples, only 10. 9 % of sera from those animals contained M. bovis antibodies. In 25. 2 % of 8 cases mycoplasmas were isolated from lungs with no macroscopic lesions. The average seropositivity rate of individuals was 11. 3 %, however in certain herds it reached more than 50 %. The proportion of seropositive herds was 64. 7 %. Comprehensive associations were found between serological responses against M. bovis and the observed lung lesions with the help of statistical calculations. In Chapter 4 the efficacy of <b>valnemulin</b> is presented in an experimental challenge trial. Mycoplasma bovis infection was experimentally induced in groups of 6 young calves. A further group was uninfected and served as a control. Ten days after infection, medication with either enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer) or <b>valnemulin</b> (Econor, Novartis) was instituted via the milk replacer for a further 10 days, after which all calves were killed. Infection resulted in depression, pyrexia, inappetance and prominent respiratory signs. Arthritis occurred in 2 animals, and 2 (unmedicated) animals died. At post mortem examination extensive lesions were present in the lungs and M. bovis was reisolated from infected unmedicated calves’ lungs. Medication with either enrofloxacin or <b>valnemulin</b> resulted in a rapid diminution of clinical signs, restoration of appetite and reversal of weight loss. Isolation of Pasteurella multocida from the calves’ lungs was suppressed by both medicaments. <b>Valnemulin</b> resulted in a more rapid reduction of clinical scores, and eliminated M. bovis from the lungs more effectively than enrofloxacin. In Chapter 5 development and application of an improved PCR system is presented. This system was developed using the forward primer described by Ghadersohi et al (1997) and a new reverse primer Mbr 2 based on the Vsp gene region of Mycoplasma bovis, since both the original system and its further developed semi-nested variant (Hayman et al., 2003) do not work. The PCR did not amplify the pathogenic and ubiquitous mycoplasmas as well as bacteria commonly occurring in bovine respiratory and mammary tract. The assay detected as low as 150 CFU/ml of Mycoplasma bovis in broth culture enabling the diagnostic use of it with high sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma (M.) bovis is {{frequently}} implicated in respiratory diseases of young cattle worldwide. Today, to combat M. bovis in Europe, only antimicrobial therapy is available, but often fails, leading to important economical losses. The antimicrobial susceptibility of M. bovis is {{not covered by}} antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks. The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify resistances that were acquired over the last 30 years in France and to determine their prevalence within comtemporary strains. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of 12 antimicrobials, considered active on M. bovis, were compared, using an agar dilution method, between 27 and 46 M. bovis isolates respectively obtained in 1978 – 1979 and in 2010 – 2012 from 73 distinct respiratory disease outbreaks in young cattle all over France. For eight antimicrobials, resistances were proven to be acquired over the period and expressed by all contemporary strains. The increase of the MIC value that inhibited 50 % of the isolates (MIC 50) was: i) substantial for tylosin, tilmicosin, tulathromycin and spectinomycin, from 2 to. 64, 2 to. 128, 16 to 128 and 4 to. 64 mg/mL, respectively, ii) moderate for enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, marbofloxacin and oxytetracycline, from 0. 25 to 0. 5, 0. 25 to 0. 5, 0. 5 to 1, 32 to. 32 mg/mL, respectively.

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} susceptibility {{of clinical}} isolates of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae in Spain was monitored, {{and the underlying}} molecular mechanisms of resistance were investigated. MICs of tylosin, tiamulin, <b>valnemulin,</b> lincomycin, and tylvalosin were determined for 87 B. hyodysenteriae isolates recovered from 2008 to 2009 by broth dilution. Domain V of the 23 S rRNA gene and the ribosomal protein L 3 gene were sequenced in 20 isolates for which the tiamulin MIC was ≥ 4 μg/ml, presenting decreased susceptibility, and in 18 tiamulin-susceptible isolates (MIC ≤ 0. 125 μg/ml), and all isolates were typed by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeats analysis. A comparison with antimicrobial susceptibility data from 2000 to 2007 showed an increase in pleuromutilin resistance over time, doubling the number of isolates with decreased susceptibility to tiamulin. No alteration in susceptibility was detected for lincomycin, and the MIC of tylosin remained high (MIC 50 > 128 μg/ml). The decreased susceptibility to tylosin and lincomycin {{can be explained by}} mutations at position A 2058 of the 23 S rRNA gene (Escherichia coli numbering). A 2058 T was the predominant mutation, but A 2058 G also was found together with a change of the neighboring base pair at positions 2057 to 2611.

40|$|Abstract Background Digital {{dermatitis}} in cattle is {{an emerging}} infectious disease. Ulcerative lesions are typically {{located on the}} plantar skin between the heel bulbs and adjacent to the coronet. Spirochetes of the genus Treponema are found in high numbers in the lesions {{and are likely to}} be involved in the pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to obtain pure cultures of spirochetes from cattle with digital dermatitis and to describe them further. Methods Tissue samples and swabs from active digital dermatitis lesions were used for culturing. Pure isolates were subjected to, molecular typing through 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and an intergenic spacer PCR developed for Treponema spp. as well as API-ZYM and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The antimicrobial agents used were tiamulin, <b>valnemulin,</b> tylosin, aivlosin, lincomycin and doxycycline. Results Seven spirochete isolates from five herds were obtained. Both 16 S rRNA gene sequences, which were identical except for three polymorphic nucleotide positions, and the intergenic spacer PCR indicated that all isolates were of one yet unnamed species, most closely related to Treponema phagedenis. The enzymatic profile and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern were also similar for all isolates. However it was possible to separate the isolates through their PFGE and RAPD banding pattern. Conclusion This is the first report on isolation of a Treponema sp. from cattle with digital dermatitis in Scandinavia. The phylotype isolated has previously been cultured from samples from cattle in the USA and the UK and is closely related to T. phagedenis. While very similar, the isolates in this study were possible to differentiate through PFGE and RAPD indicating that these methods are suitable for subtyping of this phylotype. No antimicrobial resistance could be detected among the tested isolates. </p...|$|E
40|$|Swine {{dysentery}} (SD) is {{a severe}} colitis of pigs caused by Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (Harris, 1999). The control of SD is still mainly {{based on the}} use of few antimicrobials, such as pleuromutilins, macrolides and lincosamides. However {{more than half of the}} Italian isolates of B. hyodysenteriaewere shown to be resistant to pleuromutilins, with a significant increasing trend in the last 10 years (Rugna, 2015). The aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae versus tiamulin, <b>valnemulin,</b> doxycycline, aivlosin, lincomycin and tylosin. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 206 B. hyodysenteriae isolates from Italian herds from 2005 - 2013 was evaluated by a broth microdilution test. The MIC values were interpreted using clinical breakpoints (Ronne and Szancer, 1990) and epidemiological cut-offs (Pringle, 2012). The vast majority of the isolates (above 80 %, approximately) showed MIC values above the epidemiological cut offs, indicating a previous exposure to antimicrobials. Moreover, most isolates (98 %) were clinically resistant to tylosin, about half (56 %) to lincomycin and roughly a third (34 %) to tiamulin. Furthermore, a significant increase of non-susceptible isolates (resistant or intermediate) was seen for both lincomycin and tiamulin from 2008 to 2013. A non-negligible proportion of isolates (54 %) showed no susceptibility to tylosin, lincomycin and tiamulin, with a significant increase from 2010 to 2013 compared to 2008. Finally, a correlation was found between the non-wild type status of isolates to aivlosin and tylosin (p= 0. 025) and between non-wild type status of isolates to tylosin and lincomycin (p= 0. 016). In conclusion, the decreased susceptibility of Italian isolates of B. hyodysenteriae is not restricted to pleuromutilins, but involves most of the antibiotics used for the control of SD. An increase of multiresistant isolates was recorded in the last eight years, posing a significant threat to pig industry...|$|E
