25|$|Rateable {{value is}} an {{estimate}} of the annual rent that would be paid for the property at a fixed date two years prior {{to the beginning of the}} list (known as the antecedent <b>valuation</b> <b>date),</b> incorporating certain assumptions laid down in the legislation.|$|E
25|$|Agricultural relief. This {{applies to}} a farmer – an {{individual}} who on the <b>valuation</b> <b>date</b> is domiciled in the State, and at least 80% of the gross market value of his assets consists of agricultural property (i.e., farm land and buildings, crops, trees and underwood, livestock, bloodstock, and farm machinery).|$|E
25|$|A {{business}} valuation report generally {{begins with a}} summary of the purpose and scope of business appraisal as well as its date and stated audience. What follows is a description of national, regional and local economic conditions existing as of the <b>valuation</b> <b>date,</b> as well as the conditions of the industry in which the subject business operates.|$|E
50|$|First, losses (either {{reported}} or paid) are compiled into a triangle, {{where the}} rows represent accident {{years and the}} columns represent <b>valuation</b> <b>dates.</b> For example, 43,169,009 represents loss amounts related to claims occurring in 1998, valued as of 24 months.|$|R
50|$|All tenements {{in a new}} {{valuation}} list, {{including those}} subsequently assessed by interim valuation, will be assessed by reference to a <b>valuation</b> reference <b>date</b> to ensure uniformity in assessment levels and fairness to all ratepayers. This <b>valuation</b> reference <b>date</b> is designated by the Chief Executive.|$|R
5000|$|Next, age-to-age {{factors are}} {{determined}} by calculating the ratio of losses at subsequent <b>valuation</b> <b>dates.</b> From 24 months to 36 months, accident year 1998 losses increased from 43,169,009 to 45,568,919, so the corresponding age-to-age factor is 45,568,919 / 43,169,009 = 1.056. A [...] "tail factor" [...] is selected (in this case, 1.000) to project from the latest valuation age to ultimate.|$|R
25|$|The {{antecedent}} <b>valuation</b> <b>date</b> is the {{day from}} which all other matters (effectively those to do with economic conditions) are determined. In the legislation it may be either the day of compilation, or a prior date set by the government. In practice, {{it has always been}} set at two years {{prior to the start of}} the list, so that for the 2005 rating list it is 1 April 2003.|$|E
25|$|Assessing a {{rateable}} value requires a valuation {{that follows the}} above process, but the matters to be considered are constrained by legislation. So the physical properties are considered not at the present day, but at the Material Day, and are constrained by the valuation assumptions. The economic conditions are considered at the Antecedent <b>Valuation</b> <b>Date.</b> The valuation {{is based on a}} hypothetical lease laid down in the valuation assumptions. The Secretary of State may make regulations for certain classes of property that give a statutory formulae for the {{rateable value}}, instead of the rental value. These classes include large ports and public utilities.|$|E
2500|$|The Local Government Finance Act 1988, with {{follow-up}} legislation, {{provided a}} fresh administrative framework for assessing and billing, {{but did not}} redefine the legal unit of property, the hereditament, that had been developed through rating case law. Properties are assessed in a rating list with a rateable value, a valuation of their annual rental value on a fixed <b>valuation</b> <b>date</b> using assumptions fixed by statute. [...] Rating lists are created and maintained by the Valuation Office Agency, a UK Government Executive Agency. Rating lists can be altered either to reflect changes in properties, or as valuations are appealed against. New rating lists are normally created every five years, however, the 2015 revaluation has been postponed until 2017.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, if the <b>valuation</b> {{reference}} <b>date</b> is 1 October and {{the date}} the list comes into force is 1 April of the following year, the valuer is required to assess the rateable value as at 1 October assuming the same physical state of the tenement as at the next 1 April. General changes in rental values after the designated <b>valuation</b> reference <b>date</b> will not be taken into account.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a good}} {{series of}} rate books {{comprising}} continuous runs of collectors' books from 1755 for Sheffield township and from the 1780s for four of the other townships. From 1891 borough rate-books for the census years only have been retained. <b>Valuations</b> <b>date</b> from the 1820s and 1830s. These records were kept in the vestry halls of the several wards {{of the city and}} thus escaped the destruction by enemy action which befell the records stored in the Union offices in West Bar.|$|R
50|$|The {{credibility}} of the Interbrand and BrandZ league tables have been cast into doubt by an article written in Marketing Week by Mark Ritson. The lack of clear definitions and <b>valuation</b> <b>dates</b> in the both companies methodology {{raise questions about the}} subjectivity involved in brand valuations. Being part of multinational advertising groups, Interbrand and Kantar Millward Brown also suffer from the risk of objectivity. Transparency and objectivity are two of the requirements of the ISO 10668 standard of monetary brand valuations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>valuation</b> <b>date</b> is an {{important}} component in the calculation of Wealth Tax. The Net Wealth that an assessee possesses on the <b>valuation</b> <b>date</b> determines the amount of tax, the residential status of the assessee, value of an asset, and exact amount of wealth {{at the end of the}} date. The <b>valuation</b> <b>date</b> is considered the day of 31 March immediately preceding the Assessment Year. E.g., When the Assessment Year is 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013, the <b>valuation</b> <b>date</b> will be 31 March 2012.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{coverage}} of bond valuation in introductory finance textbooks. Specifically, it extends the basic model for bond valuation to a more versatile model, which can accommodate <b>valuation</b> <b>dates</b> besides those matching the coupon dates of a bond. Such an extension allows the accrued interest to be properly recognized. Various spreadsheet-based exercises with data from bond quotations are proposed, {{in order to make}} the bond model more practically relevant and to enhance the learning experience of students.

50|$|Wealth tax is {{calculated}} {{at the rate}} of 0.25 per cent (1.0 per cent w.e.f April 2010) of the amount of net wealth that exceeds Rs. 50 lakh(Rs. 30 Lakh w.e.f April 2010) on the <b>valuation</b> <b>date.</b> The net wealth of an assessee includes the value of specified unproductive assets on the <b>valuation</b> <b>date</b> after subtracting the debt the assessee owes on the said assets. Wealth tax does not attract any Education Cess or surcharge.|$|E
