25|$|Waterlogging {{commonly}} occurs over a {{long period}} of time in polystyrene foams that are constantly exposed to high humidity or are continuously immersed in water, such as in hot tub covers, in floating docks, as supplemental flotation under boat seats, and for below-grade exterior building insulation constantly exposed to groundwater.

25|$|Although it is a {{closed-cell}} foam, both {{expanded and}} extruded polystyrene {{are not entirely}} waterproof or vaporproof. In expanded polystyrene there are interstitial gaps between the expanded closed-cell pellets that form an open network of channels between the bonded pellets, and this network of gaps can become filled with liquid water. If the water freezes into ice, it expands and can cause polystyrene pellets to break off from the foam. Extruded polystyrene is also permeable by water molecules {{and can not be}} considered a <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier.</b>|$|E

25|$|Geomembranes {{represent}} the other {{largest group of}} geosynthetics, and in dollar volume their sales are {{greater than that of}} geotextiles. Their growth in the United States and Germany was stimulated by governmental regulations originally enacted in the early 1980s for the lining of solid-waste landfills. The materials themselves are relatively thin, impervious sheets of polymeric material used primarily for linings and covers of liquids- or solid-storage facilities. This includes all types of landfills, surface impoundments, canals, and other containment facilities. Thus the primary function is always containment as a liquid or <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> or both. The range of applications, however, is great, and in addition to the environmental area, applications are rapidly growing in geotechnical, transportation, hydraulic, and private development engineering (such as aquaculture, agriculture, heap leach mining, etc.).|$|E

It was found that while all insulations deteriorated with increased cycles, two nonreinforced polyurethane foams showed no structural deterioration after 4200 thermal cycles (equivalent to 15 years of airline service). It was also found that fiberglass reinforcement and flame retardants impaired thermal performance and reduced useful life of the foams. <b>Vapor</b> <b>barriers</b> enhanced structural integrity without any deterioration in thermal properties...|$|R

50|$|The {{industry}} has recognized {{that in many}} circumstances it may be impractical to design and build building assemblies which never get wet. Good design and practice involve controlling the wetting of building assemblies from both the exterior and interior. So, the use of <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> {{should be taken into}} consideration. Their use has already been legislated within the building code of some countries (such as the U.S., Canada, Ireland, England, Scotland & Wales). How, where, and whether a <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> (vapor diffusion retarder) should be used depends on the climate. Typically, the number of heating degree days (HDD) in an area is used to help make these determinations. A heating degree day is a unit that measures how often outdoor daily dry-bulb temperatures fall below an assumed base, normally 18°C (65°F). For building in most parts of North America, where winter heating conditions predominate, <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> are placed toward the interior, heated side of insulation in the assembly. In humid regions where warm-weather cooling predominates within buildings, the <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> should be located toward the exterior side of insulation. In relatively mild or balanced climates, or where assemblies are designed to minimize condensation conditions, a <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> may not be necessary at all.|$|E

50|$|An {{interior}} vapor retarder {{is useful}} in heating-dominated climates while an exterior vapor retarder {{is useful in}} cooling-dominated climates. In most climates it is often better to have a vapor-open building assembly, meaning that walls and roofs should be designed to dry: either to the inside, the outside, or both, so the ventilation of water vapor {{should be taken into}} consideration.A <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> on the warm side of the envelope must be combined with a venting path on the cold side of the insulation. This is because no <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> is perfect, and because water may get into the structure, typically from rain. In general, the better the <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> and the drier the conditions, the less venting is required.|$|E

50|$|Damp {{proofing}} {{is defined}} by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as a material that resists the passage of water with no hydro-static pressure and waterproof as a treatment that resists the passage of water under pressure. Generally damp proofing keeps moisture out of a building where <b>vapor</b> <b>barriers</b> keep interior moisture from getting into walls. Moisture resistance is not necessarily absolute: it is usually defined by a specific test method, limits, and engineering tolerances.|$|R
50|$|Walls are not {{subjected}} to standing water, and the water-resistant membranes used as housewraps {{are designed to}} be porous enough to let moisture escape. Walls also have <b>vapor</b> <b>barriers</b> or air barriers. Damp proofing is another aspect of waterproofing. Masonry walls are built with a damp-proof course to prevent rising damp, and the concrete in foundations needs to be damp-proofed or waterproofed with a liquid coating, basement waterproofing membrane (even under the concrete slab floor where polyethylene sheeting is commonly used), or an additive to the concrete.|$|R

50|$|It is possible, and {{increasingly}} desirable, to retrofit superinsulation to an existing houses or buildings. The easiest way is often to add layers of continuous rigid exterior insulation, and sometimes by building new exterior walls that allow more space for insulation. A <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> {{can be installed}} {{on the outside of}} the original framing but may not be needed. An improved continuous air barrier is almost always worth adding, as older homes tend to be leaky, and such an air barrier can be important for energy savings and durability. Care should be exercised when adding a <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> as it can reduce drying of incidental moisture, or even cause summer (in climates with humid summers) interstitial condensation and consequent mold and mildew. This may cause health problems for the occupants and damage the existing structure. Many builders in northern Canada use a simple 1/3 to 2/3 approach, placing the <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> no further out than 1/3 of the R-value of the insulated portion of the wall. This method is generally valid for interior walls that have little or no vapor resistance (e.g. they use fibrous insulation) and controls air leakage condensation as well as vapor diffusion condensation. This approach will ensure that condensation does not occur on or to the inside of the <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> during cold weather. The 1/3:2/3 rule will ensure that the <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> temperature will not fall below the dew point temperature of the interior air, and will minimize the possibility of cold-weather condensation problems. For example, with an internal room temperature of 20°C (68°F), the <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> will then only reach 7.3 °C (45 °F) when the outside temperatures is at −18°C (-1°F). Indoor air dewpoint temperatures are more likely to be in the order of around 0 °C (32 °F) when it is that cold outdoors, much lower than the predicted <b>vapor</b> <b>barrier</b> temperature, and hence the 1/3:2/3 rules is quite conservative. For climates that do not often experience -18°C, the 1/3:2/3 rule should be amended to 40:60% or 50:50. As the interior air dewpoint temperature is an important basis for such rules, buildings with high interior humidities during cold weather (e.g., museums, swimming pools, humdified or poorly ventilated airtight homes) may require different rules, as can buildings with drier interior environments (such as highly ventilated buildings, warehouses). The 2009 International Residential Code (IRC) embodies more sophisticated rules to guide the choice of insulation on the exterior of new homes, which can be applied when retrofitting older homes.|$|E
40|$|Fourteen foam {{insulation}} specimens were tested. Some were plain foam while others contained flame retardants, chopped fiberglass reinforcement and/or <b>vapor</b> <b>barriers.</b> The thermal {{performance of the}} insulation was determined by measuring {{the rate at which}} LH 2 boiled from an aluminum tank insulated with the test material. The test specimens were approximately 50 mm (2 in.) thick. They were structurally scaled so that the test cycle would duplicate the maximum thermal stresses predicted for the thicker insulation of an aircraft liquid hydrogen fuel tank during a typical subsonic flight. The simulated flight cycle of approximately 10 minutes duration heated the other insulation surface to 316 K (110 F) and cooled it to 226 K (20 F) while the inner insulation surface remained at liquid hydrogen temperature of 20 K (- 423 F). Two urethane {{foam insulation}}s exceeded the initial life goal of 2400 simulated flight cycles and sustained 4400 cycles with only minor damage. The addition of fiberglass reinforcement of flame retardant materials to an insulation degraded thermal performance and/or the life of the foam material. Installation of <b>vapor</b> <b>barriers</b> enhanced the structural integrity of the material but did not improve thermal performance. All of the foams tested were available materials; none were developed specifically for LH 2 service...|$|R
50|$|A well {{designed}} collections storage space is multi-layered, {{beginning with the}} building itself, a room, storage furniture, and packaging. The more layers utilized the greater the protection from agents of deterioration. It is generally agreed that storage spaces should not {{be at the top}} of the building or below grade, but attics and basements are often the most practical space for storage, so many institutions weigh the risks, and opt to upgrade these spaces in terms of structure, insulation, and/or <b>vapor</b> <b>barriers</b> to create a suitable space for storage.|$|R
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of bulk insulation is commonly evaluated by its R-value, {{of which there}} are two - metric (SI) and US customary, the former being 0.176 times the latter.

However, an R-value {{does not take into account}} the quality of construction or local environmental factors for each building. Construction quality issues include inadequate <b>vapor</b> <b>barriers,</b> and problems with draft-proofing.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation conducted to improve the weather resistance of plywood assemblies used in prefabricated housing manufacture. Specifically, this work involved water sealers for edge joints (called edge sealers), the prevention of surface transfer of water vapor through plywood (called <b>vapor</b> <b>barriers),</b> and fillers for structural defects in the wood (called core void fillers). Two edge sealers for plywood were developed that were considered successful in resisting water permeation. One was a quick drying paint formulated by the addition of 30 per cent leaded zinc oxide to 70 per cent Arco primer paint No. 156. However, a better but slower drying sealer was found in the use of two coats of 40 per cent leaded zinc oxide and 60 per cent glyceryl phthalate varnish. Two <b>vapor</b> <b>barriers</b> were developed that were successful in combatting moisture condensation in the stud space of exterior wall assemblies. One of these was an aluminum-gilsonite paint. The other was an aluminum foil bonded to the plywood. Either would reduce the moisture diffusion through wood in excess of 95 per cent. A method is presented that would make the use of aluminum foil economically feasible. A filler for core voids consisting of an asbestos extended resoreinol glue mixture was developed. The filler showed optimum resistance to weather conditions, heat and water bleeding, and had an excellent pot life...|$|R
