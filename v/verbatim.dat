5|$|In a {{footnote}} to Chapter XIII, Poe {{refers to the}} Polly, a wreck which drifted for six months across the Atlantic Ocean in 1811-1812. Poe probably read this history in an 1836 book by R. Thomas, Remarkable Events and Remarkable Shipwrecks, from which he quotes <b>verbatim.</b>|$|E

5|$|David I {{established}} the first chartered burghs in Scotland, copying the burgher charters and Leges Burgorum (rules governing virtually {{every aspect of}} life and work) almost <b>verbatim</b> from the English customs of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. Early burgesses were usually Flemish, English, French and German, rather than Gaelic Scots. The burgh's vocabulary was composed totally of either Germanic and French terms. The councils that ran individual burghs were individually known as lie doussane, meaning the dozen.|$|E
5|$|Early in this film, Denham {{shoots a}} scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's {{never been on}} a ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance. The {{dialogue}} they exchange is taken <b>verbatim</b> from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film. Ironically, in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of such words toward Ann.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's trip to Istanbul in June 1955 {{to cover}} an Interpol conference for The Sunday Times {{was a source}} of much of the {{background}} information in the story. While there he met the Oxford-educated ship owner Nazim Kalkavan, who became the model for Darko Kerim; Fleming took down many of Kalkavan's conversations in a notebook, and used them <b>verbatim</b> in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Notes about {{reference}}s: For PDF files, {{the reference}} page is the page number {{appearing on the}} document, not the page number in the PDF file. Except the introduction, the article Evacuating Somalia is a <b>verbatim</b> excerpt, with some short omissions (denoted by ellipses) from pages 94–104 the document Ambassador James K. Bishop, Jr. (both were published by the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training).|$|E
5|$|Paul Wasansky, who in 1570 was {{executed}} in Ivančice, in present-day Czech Republic, {{on account of}} 124 confessed murders (he was a roaming highwayman), underwent a particularly gruelling execution procedure: First, his limbs were cut off and his nipples were ripped off with glowing pincers. He was then flayed, afterwards impaled and finally roasted alive. The pamphlet, which purports to give Wasansky's <b>verbatim</b> confession, does not record how Wasansky was apprehended, nor what means of torture was used to extract his confessions.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} caused them to commit murder; real life events are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted <b>verbatim</b> from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E
5|$|Bernoulli's work {{influenced}} {{many contemporary}} and subsequent mathematicians. Even the afterthought-like tract on calculus has been quoted frequently; most notably by the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin. Jacob's program of applying his art of conjecture to the matters of practical life, which was terminated by {{his death in}} 1705, was continued by his nephew Nicolaus Bernoulli, after having taken parts <b>verbatim</b> out of Ars Conjectandi, for his own dissertation entitled De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure which was published already in 1709. Nicolas finally edited and assisted in the publication of Ars conjectandi in 1713. Later Nicolaus also edited Jacob Bernoulli's complete works and supplemented it with results taken from Jacob's diary.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a <b>verbatim</b> record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|Hayward credits Besson with {{showing the}} {{collaboration}} between the Burgundians and the English more accurately than previous filmmakers. Many lines during scenes of Joan's trial are taken <b>verbatim</b> from Joan's real trial transcript. Joan is shown receiving both wounds she was given in real life (an arrow above the breast and later an arrow to the leg), and the film includes some of the 15th-century accounts associated with Joan, such as being able to pick out Charles VII from {{among a group of}} his courtiers at Chinon. The examining of Joan's virginity was a real test Joan had to complete to prove her merit.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{typically}} sits Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays {{from early}} January to late June and from early September to mid December, with two-week recesses in April and October. Plenary {{meetings in the}} debating chamber usually take place on Wednesday afternoons from 2pm to 6pm and on Thursdays from 9:15am to 6pm. Chamber debates and committee meetings {{are open to the}} public. Entry is free, but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space. Parliament TV is a webcast and archive of Parliamentary business back to 2012. and on the BBC's parliamentary channel BBC Parliament. Proceedings are also recorded in text form, in print and online, in the Official Report, which is the substantially <b>verbatim</b> transcript of parliamentary debates.|$|E
5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like <b>verbatim</b> copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal {{versions}} of the story also exist. In 1987, an elderly Aboriginal man from nearby Kingston related {{a version of the}} story, in which Brown shot some Aboriginal people and poisoned others because they were stealing his sheep. Brown then established his alibi by riding to Adelaide. In the same year Hastings' account was reproduced <b>verbatim</b> in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray. Three years later, the South Australian Education Department published an Aboriginal studies book for secondary students. It repeated Hastings' version, and followed it with an Aboriginal version told by a Ngarrindjeri man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay area. Trevorrow described the exploitation of Aboriginal workers by white settlers, and stated that when times were lean, Aboriginal people would steal flour from landowners. He did not name Brown, but stated that a settler poisoned some flour and rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi. Foster et al. note that while these two accounts were similar, the difference was that Hastings portrayed Brown as a victim of Aboriginal attacks, while Trevorrow emphasised white exploitation of Aboriginal people.|$|E
5|$|After Diocletian's {{reform of}} the provinces, {{governors}} were called iudex, or judge. The governor became responsible for his decisions first to his immediate superiors, {{as well as to}} the more distant office of the emperor. It was most likely at this time that judicial records became <b>verbatim</b> accounts of what was said in trial, making it easier to determine bias or improper conduct on the part of the governor. With these records and the Empire's universal right of appeal, Imperial authorities probably had a great deal of power to enforce behavior standards for their judges. In spite of Diocletian's attempts at reform, the provincial restructuring was far from clear, especially when citizens appealed the decisions of their governors. Proconsuls, for example, were often both judges of first instance and appeal, and the governors of some provinces took appellant cases from their neighbors. It soon became impossible to avoid taking some cases to the emperor for arbitration and judgment. Diocletian's reign marks the end of the classical period of Roman law. Where Diocletian's system of rescripts shows an adherence to classical tradition, Constantine's law is full of Greek and eastern influences.|$|E
5|$|Records of burghs, {{small towns}} granted legal {{privileges}} from the crown, {{can be found}} from the eleventh century. Burghs (a term derived from the Germanic word for fortress), developed rapidly {{during the reign of}} David I (1124–53). Up until this point there were no identifiable towns in Scotland. Most of the burghs that were granted charters in his reign probably already existed as settlements. Charters were copied almost <b>verbatim</b> from those used in England, and early citizens, called burgesses, that were usually English or Flemish. They were able to impose tolls and fines on traders within a region outside their settlements. Most of the early burghs were on the east coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, including Aberdeen, Berwick, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the European continent. In the south-west, Glasgow, Ayr and Kirkcudbright were aided by the less-profitable sea trade with Ireland, {{and to a lesser extent}} France and Spain.|$|E
5|$|The version by Aiken {{is perhaps}} the best known stage adaptation, {{released}} {{just a few months}} after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece. Most of Aiken's dialogue is lifted <b>verbatim</b> from Stowe's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard. Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film. By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences. By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.|$|E
5|$|From {{the reign}} of David I, there are records of burghs (a Germanic word for a fortress), towns that were granted certain legal {{privileges}} by the crown. Most of the burghs granted charters during David's reign probably already existed as settlements. Charters were copied almost <b>verbatim</b> from those used in England, and early burgesses were usually English or Flemish. They were able to impose tolls and fines on traders within a region outside their settlements. Most of the early burghs were on the east coast. Among them were the largest and wealthiest, including Aberdeen, Berwick, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the continent. In the south-west Glasgow, Ayr and Kirkcudbright benefited from the less profitable sea trade with Ireland, {{and to a lesser}} extent France and Spain. Burghs were typically surrounded by a palisade or had a castle and usually a market place, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross beside which were houses for the burgesses and other inhabitants. Around 15 burghs can be traced to {{the reign of}} David I, and there is evidence of 55 by 1296. In addition to the major royal burghs, the late Middle Ages saw the proliferation of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs; 51 were created between 1450 and 1516. Most were much smaller than their royal counterparts, and excluded from international trade they acted mainly as local markets and centres of craftsmanship.|$|E

25|$|Fuzzy-trace theory, a dual {{process model}} {{of memory and}} reasoning, was also derived from Gestalt psychology. Fuzzy-trace theory posits that we encode {{information}} into two separate traces: <b>verbatim</b> and gist.
