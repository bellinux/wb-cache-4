40|$|Purpose. To ablate retina and <b>vitreous</b> <b>membranes</b> {{using the}} 193 -nm argon {{fluoride}} excimer laser in a fluid medium. Methods. A special delivery {{system for the}} 193 -nm excimer laser was developed that enabled the delivery of the laser into high-absorption liquid environments. The system was tested on the retina in an in vitro cup preparation of cow's eyes, and also in vivo on retina and <b>vitreous</b> <b>membranes</b> of rabbit eyes. The depth of cut {{as a function of}} laser energy was determined for an ablating needle with a 0. 25 -mm exit diameter. Results. Gentle cutting of retinal tissue and of <b>vitreous</b> <b>membranes</b> was obtained in an energy range of 0. 075 to 0. 25 mj/pulse. At the energy level of 0. 075 mj/pulse, four pulses were required for full-depth cut formation in rabbit retina, whereas at energy levels greater than 0. 17 mj/pulse, one pulse was sufficient for full-depth cut formation. The maximal rate of cutting achieved for the bovine retina was 2 mm/sec at a 20 -Hz repetition rate of the laser. Ablation occurred only when the tip was held in contact with the tissue. Conclusions. The technology described herein appears to be advantageous and applicable to a variety of vitreoretinal surgical procedures. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1994; 35 : 3835 - 3840...|$|R

Methods: We identified a retrospective noncomparative case series of patients with a clinical diagnosis of endophthalmitis and a baseline echographic examination between 1996 and 2010 at a single institution. Graded echographic features studied included: dense, moderate, and mild vitreous opacities; marked, moderate, and mild vitreous membranes; retinal detachment; and choroidal detachment. These were compared between culture-negative, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and other culture-positive cases of endophthalmitis, and were correlated with final visual outcomes. Results: Of 149 patients reviewed, 60 were culture-negative, 26 grew coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 60 grew other culture-positive species. Three had multiple culture isolates. The presence of dense, moderate, and mild vitreous opacities, marked, moderate, and mild <b>vitreous</b> <b>membranes,</b> retinal detachment, and choroidal detachment was not significantly different between the three groups (P = 0. 86, P = 0. 56, P = 0. 34, P = 0. 45, respectively).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{risk factors}} for poor visual outcome in postoperative and posttraumatic endophthalmitis in a large referral center in south central India. METHODS: In this prospective observational series the authors examined 388 patients of postoperative (n= 206) and posttraumatic (n= 182) endophthalmitis at the L V Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India between 1991 and 1997. The analysis was confined to 236 patients- 128 (62. 1 &#x 0025;) postoperative and 108 (59. 3 &#x 0025;) posttraumatic patients who were followed for a minimum period of 3 months. A detailed protocol was followed. Chi-square and logistic regression analysis {{were used to determine}} {{risk factors for}} visual outcome worse than 6 / 18 and worse than 6 / 120. RESULTS: Postoperative endophthalmitis: In univariate analysis the features associated with poor visual acuity (grouped as < 6 / 18 and < 6 / 120) included intracapsular cataract surgery, poor presenting visual acuity, presence of vitreous cells, inability to visualise the optic disc on indirect ophthalmoscopy, presence of <b>vitreous</b> <b>membranes</b> on ultrasonography, and a culture-positive vitreous biopsy. In the multivariate analysis, visual acuity of < light perception (LP) at presentation was associated with a 3 -month postoperative visual acuity of < 6 / 18, with an odds ratio of 5. 85 [1. 25 - 27. 42, 95 &#x 0025; CI], and <b>vitreous</b> <b>membranes</b> seen on ultrasonography was associated with a final visual acuity of < 6 / 120, with an odds ratio of 2. 47 [1. 05 - 5. 83, 95 &#x 0025; CI]. Posttraumatic endophthalmitis: In univariate analysis the features associated with poor visual acuity (grouped as < 6 / 18 and < 6 / 120) included a retained intraocular foreign body (IOFB), trauma by needle (hypodermic or sewing), poor presenting visual acuity, inability to visualise the optic disc on indirect ophthalmoscopy, presence of <b>vitreous</b> <b>membranes</b> on ultrasonography, and a culture-positive vitreous biopsy. In multivariate analysis, IOFB was associated with a 3 -month follow-up visual acuity of < 6 / 18, with an odds ratio of 5. 90 [1. 85 - 18. 78, 95 &#x 0025; CI], and trauma by a needle (hypodermic or sewing) and retained IOFB was associated with a final visual acuity of < 6 / 120, with an odds ratio of 4. 47 [1. 22 - 16. 38, 95 &#x 0025;CI] and 3. 76 [1. 36 - 10. 37, 95 &#x 0025; CI] respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the largest, single-centre, prospective study on risk factors for poor visual outcome in postoperative and posttraumatic endophthalmitis.

The membrane does not normally detach from the vitreous base, although it can be detached with extreme trauma. However, the vitreous base may have an irregular posterior edge.

Similarly, in some people with retinal lesions such as lattice retinal degeneration or chorio-retinal scars, the <b>vitreous</b> <b>membrane</b> may be abnormally adherent to the retina. If enough traction occurs the retina may tear at these points. If there are only small point tears, these can allow glial cells to enter the vitreous humor and proliferate to create a thin epiretinal membrane that distorts vision. In more severe cases, vitreous fluid may seep under the tear, separating the retina {{from the back of the}} eye, creating a retinal detachment. Trauma can be any form from a blunt force trauma to the face such as a boxer's punch or even in some cases has been known to be from extremely vigorous coughing or blowing of the nose.|$|E

50|$|The retina of {{diabetic}} individuals often exhibits loss of pericytes, {{and this}} loss is a characteristic factor {{of the early}} stages of diabetic retinopathy. Studies have found that pericytes are essential in diabetic individuals to protect the endothelial cells of retinal capillaries. With the loss of pericytes, microaneurysms form in the capillaries. In response, the retina either increases its vascular permeability, leading to swelling of the eye through a macular edema, or forms new vessels that permeate into the <b>vitreous</b> <b>membrane</b> of the eye. The end result is reduction or loss of vision. While it is unclear why pericytes are lost in diabetic patients, one hypothesis is that toxic sorbitol and advanced glycation end-products (AGE) accumulate in the pericytes. Because of the build-up of glucose, the polyol pathway increases its flux, and intracellular sorbitol and fructose accumulate. This leads to osmotic imbalance, which results in cellular damage. The presence of high glucose levels also leads to the buildup of AGE's, which also damage cells.|$|E

30|$|It is {{difficult}} to differentiate sterile from infectious endophthalmitis, especially in cases of severe anterior inflammation induced by a toxic substance. Wasp venom may induce bacterial endophthalmitis concurrently with toxic injection. In our case, we did not analyze the anterior chamber aqueous or vitreous for diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis. If the clinical manifestation presented infectious endophthalmitis, empirical therapy, such as intravitreal antibiotics (i.e., vancomycin hydrochloride and ceftazidime) by intravitreal injection and/or systemic antibiotics are needed. Our case presented acutely without pain, whereas infectious endophthalmitis typically manifests acutely or subacutely with pain. The pathological condition resembled toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) or toxic endothelial cell destruction syndrome [8, 9]. Therefore, we initially used topical dexamethasone sodium phosphate as a corticosteroid medication for post-traumatic inflammation therapy. Typically, TASS responds well to intense steroidal treatment. However, because steroid and anterior chamber irrigation did not respond well, {{it was necessary to}} clean up the toxic substance not only from the anterior chamber, but also from the vitreous space. Wasp venom was deemed to be the cause of panuveitis. Corneal endothelial cell density decreased rapidly despite the instillation of topical corticosteroid. Therefore, we decided to remove the causative substance rapidly from the vitreous space.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} a mouse model of hyperoxia-induced vitreoretinopathy that replicated {{some of the}} clinical and pathologic features encountered in infants with severe retinopathy of prematurity and congenital ocular conditions such as persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. Methods: Experimental mice (C 57 BL/ 6 J) were exposed to 65 % oxygen between postnatal days (P) 0 to P 7 and studied at P 10, P 14, and 3, 5, 8, 20, and 40 weeks. Controls were exposed to normoxic conditions. Fundus imaging and fluorescein angiography were performed at all time points, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and electroretinography were performed at 8 - and 20 -week time points. Eyes were processed for resin histology, frozen sections, and retinal whole mounts. Immunostaining was performed to visualize vasculature isolectin B 4 (Ib 4), collagen type IV, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and α-smooth muscle actin. Results: Early exposure to hyperoxia resulted in bilateral vitreous hemorrhages at 3 weeks. From 5 weeks onward there were extensive zones of retinal degeneration, scarring or gliosis, retinal folding, and detachments caused by traction of α-smooth muscle actin-positive <b>vitreous</b> <b>membranes.</b> Tortuous retinal vessels, together with hyperplastic and persistence of hyaloid vessels are evident into adulthood. In the early stages (P 10 - 3 weeks), branches from the tunica vasculosa lentis (TVL) supplied the marginal retina until retinal vessels were established. The peripheral retina remained poorly vascularized into adulthood. Electroretinography revealed 50 % to 60 % diminution in retinal function in adult mice that strongly correlated with vitreal changes identified using SD-OCT. Conclusions: This animal model displays a mixture of vitreoretinal pathologic changes that persist into adulthood.

At the end of this stage their lower part was maximally retracted, secondary germ remained beneath the bulge, and the <b>vitreous</b> <b>membrane</b> disappeared. In the regeneration stage (from day 30 to 50), the same histologic findings as those at the end of the dystrophic stage were observed. The keratin 19 -positive cells in the secondary germ, however, were replaced with keratin 19 -negative and 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxy-uridine-labeled cells. Then, differentiation into an inner root sheath and a hair shaft began, and apoptosis was terminated. In the stable growth stage (from day 40 to at least 150), the grafted follicles were immunohistochemically and light microscopically identical with the normal anagen hair follicles except for the presence of melanin incontinence. These findings suggest that the grafted hair follicles entered into dystrophic catagen, subsequently dystrophic telogen, then returned to normal anagen follicles, and that stem cells or their close progeny in the secondary germ play an important part in the recovery process...|$|E
