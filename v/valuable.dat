40|$|Far {{from being}} {{displaced}} by modernity, {{the exchange of}} women's textile <b>valuables</b> of little practical value but enormous ritual significance is increasing in importance in Tonga and amongst Tongan migrants in the industrial West. The dwindling production of and increasing demand for these textile <b>valuables</b> have prompted entrepreneurs to open pawnshops, where customers who are monetarily poor mortgage <b>valuables</b> and customers lacking in exchange networks buy unclaimed <b>valuables.</b> Pawnshops convert <b>valuables</b> into commodities and transform the social relations among those involved. However, the one emotion that underlies traditional exchange, shame, remains central to the transactions, albeit in unevenly distributed fashion. The transformation of textiles from gift to commodity displays both rupture and continuity with pre-modern forms of exchange, continuity operating {{at the level of}} emotional subjectivities. Our analysis foregrounds objects, on the one hand, and emotions, on the other, as shaping the course of cultural and social history...|$|R

25|$|The Kula {{trade was}} {{organized}} {{differently in the}} more hierarchical parts of the Trobriand islands. There, only chiefs were allowed to engage in Kula exchange. In hierarchical areas, individuals can earn their own kitomu shells, whereas in less hierarchical areas, they are always subject to the claims of matrilineal kin. And lastly, in the hierarchical areas, Kula necklaces and bracelets are saved for external exchange only; stone axe blades are used internally. In less hierarchical areas, exchange partners may lose their <b>valuables</b> to internal claims. As a result, most seek to exchange their kula <b>valuables</b> with chiefs, who thus become the most successful players. The chiefs have saved their Kula <b>valuables</b> for external trade, and external traders seek to trade with them before they lose their <b>valuables</b> to internal claims.|$|R
