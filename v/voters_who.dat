5|$|Nixon's advisors denied he had {{abandoned}} {{a desire to}} bring the American people together. However, they were divided between those who sought national unity, and those, such as campaign manager and Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who felt Nixon should concentrate on keeping the <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> had cast their ballots for him, and should seek {{to win over the}} <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> had favored third-party candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace, as the key to reelection in 1972. According to Safire, after taking office, Nixon and his advisors decided he need not bring the country together, but need only work to secure his reelection by appealing to <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> were not hostile to Nixon and his policies—they became known as the Silent Majority. Historian Stanley Kutler suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon's policies widened divisions in America, but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency—to reject Nixon and demand his removal.|$|E
25|$|An {{independent}} voter, {{often called}} an unaffiliated voter in the United States, is a <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> does not align {{themselves with a}} political party. An independent is variously defined as a <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> votes for candidates on issues {{rather than on the}} basis of a political ideology or partisanship; a <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> does not have long-standing loyalty to, or identification with, a political party; a <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> does not usually vote for the same political party from election to election; or a <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> self-describes as an independent.|$|R

5|$|Once more {{in nearly}} a two to one margin, the gay rights {{ordinance}} was defeated in Eugene. A poll taken after the vote showed that liberal <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> were not gay simply declined {{to show up and}} vote, and those who opposed the ordinance were much more motivated.|$|E
5|$|Throughout October, {{the media}} {{emphasized}} the lead Johnson had over Goldwater, stating that Goldwater had {{little chance of}} winning the election. This negative coverage of the campaign caused many independent <b>voters,</b> <b>who</b> were not strong supporters of either candidate, not to vote, for they believed {{the result of the}} election had been already determined.|$|E
5|$|Article VII of the Constitution sets up {{the basic}} {{framework}} for the structure and function of local government in Virginia. Local government may be established at the town (population over 1000), city (population over 5000), county or regional government level. Article VII gives the General Assembly the power to create general laws for the organization and governing of these political subdivisions, except that regional governments cannot be created {{without the consent of}} the majority of the <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> vote on the issue in the region.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, an unenrolled voter is a <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> {{has failed}} to declare their voting intention. In {{other parts of the}} world, an unenrolled <b>voter</b> is one <b>who</b> is not {{registered}} to vote.|$|R

5|$|In January 2007, it was {{revealed}} that Newsom had a romantic relationship in mid-2005 with Ruby Rippey-Tourk, the wife of his then campaign manager and former deputy chief of staff, Alex Tourk. Tourk filed for divorce shortly after the revelation and left Newsom's campaign and administration. Newsom's affair with Rippey-Tourk impacted his popularity with male <b>voters,</b> <b>who</b> viewed his indiscretions as a betrayal of a close friend and ally.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities in Mississippi are {{classified}} according to population size. At time of incorporation, municipalities with populations {{of more than}} 2,000 {{are classified}} as cities, municipalities containing between 301 and 2000 persons are considered towns, and municipalities between 100 and 300 persons are called villages. Places may incorporate to become a city, town or village by through a petition signed by two–thirds of the qualified <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> reside in the proposed municipality. The major function of municipal governments are to provide services for its citizens such as maintaining roads and bridges, providing law, fire protection, and health and sanitation services.|$|E
5|$|On June 6, the {{two major}} party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock, Ontario. Speaking in the afternoon, St. Laurent drew a crowd of 200. To the shock of St. Laurent staffers, who {{remained}} for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, {{even though he was}} an hour late, with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> wanted only to see him or shake his hand.|$|E
50|$|Some {{media and}} online {{commentators}} {{used the term}} PUMA to describe any Clinton primary <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> did not support Obama's nomination or the Democratic Party leadership, regardless of PAC affiliation.|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem {{states that}} a voting rule must be manipulable, except {{possibly}} in two cases: {{if there is}} a distinguished <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> has a dictatorial power, or if the rule limits the possible outcomes to two options only.|$|R
5|$|South Africans {{living abroad}} could {{register}} to vote at any South African Embassy, High Commission or Consulate-General from 9 January 2014 to 7 February 2014. South Africans living abroad who wished to vote had to notify the IEC of their intention to vote by 12 March 2014. The weekends of 18–19 January and 25–26 January were made registration weekends to accommodate <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> were unable to register during business hours. Over 26,000 voters were registered to vote abroad {{by the time of}} the election.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from his heart attack, in early 1991 Ryzhkov stood as the Communist {{candidate in the}} first election of the President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). At the election on 12 June 1991, he gained 13,395,335 votes, equal to 16.9% of the electorate. Boris Yeltsin beat him decisively with 57%. Ryzhkov's vice presidential candidate was Boris Gromov, a Soviet war veteran who led the Soviet military during {{the final stages of}} the war in Afghanistan. Most of Ryzhkov's votes came from the countryside, while he had hoped to win over <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> were becoming increasingly disenfranchised as a result of perestroika and Gorbachev's leadership, even though the latter supported his candidacy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his personal role in Parliament, Bute sought to control the votes {{of members of the}} House of Commons, primarily to ensure the passage of legislation affecting his business interests. Initially, the Isle of Bute had only 21 <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> were dominated by his private estate, but it only returned a Member of Parliament in alternate elections, and his estates in Luton were too limited to allow him to influence the electoral process there. The best remaining option for Bute was to control the voting in Cardiff, but even here he had to choose his candidate carefully and apply careful financial pressure through his control of leases and rents to ensure their election.|$|E
40|$|Pret a Voter and Punchscan are two {{electronic}} voting schemes that both use paper based ballot forms, {{part of which}} is detached and destroyed, to provide receipt-free voter verifiability. However, both schemes share the chain voting problem and the part destruction problem. The first is where anyone who can see the ballot form before it is used can coerce a <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> uses it and the latter where a <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> can leave with the complete form can prove to a coercer {{the contents of the}} vote. In this paper we provide a comparison of the schemes from a systems perspective. We also introduce a visual encryption solution to both the above problems...|$|R
50|$|In October 2012, {{the riding}} of Don Valley East was {{dropped from the}} legal case after {{it was found that}} Leeanne Bielli, the <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> {{initially}} brought the challenge forward, did not live in the riding and therefore was ineligible to challenge the result.|$|R
50|$|This {{amendment}} asked {{voters to}} allow any registered <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> has not voted in 4 years {{to continue to}} be registered if they make the request in writing and still live at the address listed on the registration records. This measure eventually overturned by another amendment in 1994.|$|R
5|$|In {{his reelection}} as the Second District congressman, Jennings {{supported}} tariff protection and internal improvements {{and vowed to}} support the presidential candidate that his constituents preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner. Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race, beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison. In the presidential election of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates: Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Jennings favored Adams, and later, Clay; however, when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825, Jennings voted with the majority and gave his political support to Jackson, but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president. Indiana <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> supported Jackson hoped for {{a victory in the}} next election.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 {{session of}} the General Assembly, Daniels and Republicans, with some Democratic support, {{successfully}} enacted a voter registration law that required voters to show a government issued photo ID before they could be permitted to vote. The law {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States, and many civil rights organizations, like the ACLU, opposed the bill saying it would unfairly impact minorities, poor, and elderly <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> may be unable to afford an ID or may be physically unable to apply for an ID. To partially address those concerns, the state passed another law authorizing state license branches to offer free state photo ID cards to individuals who did not already possess another type of state ID.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the hand-picked candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant siding with the tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> is {{registered}} {{in an official}} political party cannot vote in a different party's primary election. A <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> is registered [...] "independent" [...] can vote in any party's primary, but is automatically {{registered in}} the party in {{which he or she}} votes. The voter can change registration at the polls after voting, and can also change registration in periodic meetings of a town's Supervisors of the Checklist or at the City Clerk's office. These rules are designed to impede the casting of a cross-over vote for a different party, which may have the goal of sabotaging its nomination. Registering in a party constrains a voter's choice of ballot, but demonstrates support for the chosen party, and is a prerequisite to being a candidate of that party.|$|R
5000|$|Eliminate {{candidates}} in neither outcome: All {{candidates who are}} not present in either outcome are excluded and the votes for them are transferred. Any <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> supports an excluded candidate has their vote transferred to their next most preferred candidate who is present {{in at least one}} of the two outcomes.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the term}} [...] "independent" [...] often {{is used as}} a synonym for [...] "moderate," [...] "centrist," [...] or [...] "swing voter," [...] to refer to a {{politician}} or <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> holds views that incorporate facets of both liberal and conservative ideologies, an independent can be of any ideological or political persuasion.|$|R
5|$|Tyler {{appointed}} Abel P. Upshur, {{a popular}} Secretary of the Navy and close adviser, as his new Secretary of State, and nominated Gilmer to fill Upshur's former office. Tyler and Upshur began quiet {{negotiations with the}} Texas government, promising military protection from Mexico {{in exchange for a}} commitment to annexation. Secrecy was necessary, as the Constitution required congressional approval for such military commitments. Upshur planted rumors of possible British designs on Texas to garner support among Northern <b>voters,</b> <b>who</b> were wary of admitting a new pro-slavery state. By January 1844 Upshur told the Texas government that he had found a large majority of senators in favor of an annexation treaty. The republic remained skeptical, and finalization of the treaty took until the end of February.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{suggested}} that McKinley's campaign {{of education of}} the voter through speakers and literature brought him victory, but with a cost to the close identification between voters and the political parties that was typical in the 19th century. Voter turnout was almost 80 percent in 1896, about average for presidential elections in the late 19th century, but then dropped substantially and remained at lower levels as <b>voters,</b> <b>who</b> once participated in rallies and torchlight processions for candidates, were distracted by radio and by professional sports. Nevertheless, later campaigns tried to recapture the magic of 1896; Warren G. Harding conducted his own front porch campaign in 1920, even borrowing the flagpole from McKinley's old front yard.|$|E
5|$|With the {{advantages}} of incumbency and a generally popular record, Garrard garnered large majorities in the state's western counties, Jefferson County, and the Bluegrass region of central Kentucky. Surprisingly, he even found support among some <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> had favored Logan four years earlier. The final voting showed Garrard the winner with 8,390 votes, followed by Greenup with 6,746, Logan with 3,996, and Todd with 2,166. Due to the term limits imposed by the new constitution, Garrard was the last Kentucky governor elected to succeed himself until a 1992 amendment to the state constitution loosened the prohibition on gubernatorial succession, and Paul E. Patton was reelected in 1999. In 1801, Garrard nominated Todd to fill the next vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after the election. Similarly, he appointed Greenup to {{a position on the}} Frankfort Circuit Court in 1802.|$|E
50|$|In another manner, an {{intentionally}} {{spoilt vote}} {{could be interpreted}} as an active abstention. An intentionally spoilt vote is caused by a <b>voter</b> <b>who</b> turns to an election and invalidates the ballot paper in some way. Because of the nature of an abstention, only intentionally spoiled ballots could be counted as an active abstention.|$|R
50|$|The {{system can}} be {{manipulated}} by either an optimistic <b>voter,</b> one <b>who</b> can cast a ballot that would elect some candidate better than all of those elected by voting honestly; or by a pessimistic <b>voter,</b> one <b>who</b> can cast a ballot that would exclude some candidate worse than all of those elected by voting strategically.|$|R
5000|$|King ran for County Commissioner, City Commissioner and the House of Representatives of the Georgia General Assembly {{simultaneously}} in 1979.
