This component offers secure, distributed vaulting, access via the Web, version and revision control, and user customized Web Portals for the engineer. The component also offers engineers <b>viewable</b> <b>file</b> generation, and automated legacy data capture.|$|E

Once the file(s) have been selected they then choose a folder to save the file(s) to and the software recovers them.|$|E
50|$|Essentially {{the same}} {{techniques}} are employed to perform variable-data publishing, as those utilized with variable data printing. The difference {{is in the}} interpretation for output. While variable-data printing may be interpreted to produce various print streams or page-description files (e.g. AFP/IPDS, PostScript, PCL), variable-data publishing produces electronically <b>viewable</b> <b>files,</b> most commonly seen in the forms of PDF, HTML, or XML.|$|R

50|$|The non-volume based {{devices are}} {{those which are}} not volumes, i.e. {{everything}} else. Digital cameras, video cameras, certain portable music players and anything which does not show up under My Computer is a non-volume device. However, the more modern the camera or music player is, {{the more likely it}} is to present Windows with a <b>viewable</b> <b>file</b> system. These types of cameras and players would thus be considered volume devices.|$|E
50|$|The Scalar LTFS Appliance is a {{file system}} that {{presents}} a Quantum tape library as an NAS share. This appliance makes <b>files</b> <b>viewable</b> {{as if they}} resided on a local disk and allows users to drag and drop files directly to and from a tape cartridge.|$|R
50|$|A hybrid disc is a disc, such as CD-ROM or Blu-ray Disc, which {{contains}} multiple {{types of data}} {{which can be used}} differently on different devices.

50|$|The System Folder is less {{protected}} {{than the}} OS X system folder, {{in that the}} contents are all <b>viewable</b> and most <b>files</b> and folders are editable. However {{it was possible to}} prevent inexperienced users from accidentally altering the contents by using the Protect System Folder Contents checkbox in the General Controls Control Panel. The Startup and Shut Down programs, Appearance themes, control panels, fonts, and extensions, as well as items in the Apple Menu, are controlled by adding or removing items from folders in the System Folder.|$|R
50|$|The mapping was {{the result}} of a two-year effort by {{doctoral}} student Curtis Melvin and other volunteers, who pored over hundreds of news reports, images, accounts, books, and maps in order to identify the geographic and political sites. The result has been called one of the most detailed maps of North Korea available to the public today. It is available as a small KMZ <b>file,</b> <b>viewable</b> with Google Earth. Between April 2007 and April 2012, the data file was downloaded more than 270,000 times.|$|R
40|$|Propella is {{a marine}} {{propeller}} performance evaluation program. The simulations can be {{run in a}} batch on the Windows of Unix operating system. It generates test results, such as thrust coefficient, torque coefficient, and pressure coefficient. The results obtained in most cases to date offer reasonable results when compared with experimental data. The program must have program specific propeller geometry files to generate the propeller shape and compute the results. There {{are a number of}} pre-defined propeller geometry files included with the program, but the user must create any others. With a basic knowledge of propeller geometry and the input file format, the ASCII*ofs input files can be easily created. There are a number of ways that the required geometry data can be generated, depending on the given format. This report describes two of the possible formats and how the *ofs geometry files are written from them. One ASCII output file is created by the program, from which the results are obtained. A quick check of the file can also give a measure of the reliability of its results. A number of <b>viewable</b> output <b>files</b> are also generated, and can be viewed with the accompanying program, PPPP. exe. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|UCNEbase ([URL] is a free, web-accessible {{information}} resource {{on the evolution}} and genomic organization of ultra-conserved non-coding elements (UCNEs). It currently covers 4351 such elements in 18 different species. The majority of UCNEs {{are supposed to be}} transcriptional regulators of key developmental genes. As most of them occur as clusters near potential target genes, the database is organized along two hierarchical levels: individual UCNEs and ultra-conserved genomic regulatory blocks (UGRBs). UCNEbase introduces a coherent nomenclature for UCNEs reflecting their respective associations with likely target genes. Orthologous and paralogous UCNEs share components of their names and are systematically cross-linked. Detailed synteny maps between the human and other genomes are provided for all UGRBs. UCNEbase is managed by a relational database system and can be accessed by a variety of web-based query pages. As it relies on the UCSC genome browser as visualization platform, a large part of its data content is also available as browser <b>viewable</b> custom track <b>files.</b> UCNEbase is potentially useful to any computational, experimental or evolutionary biologist interested in conserved non-coding DNA elements in vertebrate...|$|R
