25|$|A {{wastegate}} {{regulates the}} {{exhaust gas flow}} that enters the exhaust-side driving turbine and therefore the air intake into the manifold {{and the degree of}} boosting. It can be controlled by a boost pressure assisted, generally <b>vacuum</b> <b>hose</b> attachment point diaphragm (for vacuum and positive pressure to return commonly oil contaminated waste to the emissions system) to force the spring-loaded diaphragm to stay closed until the overboost point is sensed by the ecu or a solenoid operated by the engine’s electronic control unit or a boost controller, but most production vehicles use a single <b>vacuum</b> <b>hose</b> attachment point spring-loaded diaphragm that can alone be pushed open, thus limiting overboost ability due to exhaust gas pressure forcing open the wastegate.|$|E
25|$|The major tracheae are {{thickened}} spirally like {{a flexible}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>hose</b> {{to prevent them}} from collapsing and often swell into air sacs. Larger insects can augment the flow of air through their tracheal system, with body movement and rhythmic flattening of the tracheal air sacs. Spiracles are closed and opened by means of valves and can remain partly or completely closed for extended periods in some insects, which minimises water loss.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Aston {{introduced}} an aftermarket dealer approved upgrade path {{for power and}} handling of the 4.3-litre variants that maintained the warranty with Aston. The power upgrade was The V8 Vantage Power Upgrade, creating a more potent version of the Aston Martin 4.3-litre engine {{with an increase in}} Peak power of 20bhp to 400bhp while peak torque is increased by 10Nm to 420Nm. This consists of the fitting of the following revised components; manifold assembly (painted Crackle Black), valved air box, right and left hand side <b>vacuum</b> <b>hose</b> assemblies, engine bay fuse box link lead (ECU to fuse box), throttle body to manifold gasket, intake manifold gasket, fuel injector to manifold seal, and a manifold badge.|$|E

5000|$|Reduced {{damage and}} wear to {{furniture}} and walls — There is no heavy or awkward canister or other motorized unit to carry {{from room to}} room when vacuuming. Only a lightweight <b>vacuum</b> <b>hose</b> and the cleaning tool being used need to be carried. [...] To further reduce wear to furniture feet and projecting baseboard corners, a soft woven [...] "hose sock" [...] can be installed over the corrugated <b>vacuum</b> <b>hose.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{system uses}} {{a maze of}} {{emissions}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>hoses.</b> Because of the many vacuum-driven components and electrical connections in the system, CEC-equipped engines have developed a reputation of being hard to tune. American Motors issued a Technical Service Bulletin to diagnose low or inconsistent engine idle speeds on 1980 through 1988 AMC Eagle automobile.|$|R
50|$|Vacuuming {{helps with}} {{reducing}} bed bug infestations, {{but does not}} eliminate bed bugs hidden inside of materials. Also, unless {{the contents of the}} vacuum are emptied immediately after each use, bedbugs may crawl out through the <b>vacuum's</b> <b>hoses</b> and re-establish themselves. Vacuuming with a large bristle attachment can also aid in removing hidden bugs as well.|$|R

5000|$|To use {{a central}} vacuum, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>hose</b> {{is taken from}} storage and fitted with any needed {{cleaning}} accessories (such as a brush). The {{other end of the}} hose is inserted into a wall-mounted vacuum inlet, after opening the spring-loaded cover door. [...] In some designs, opening the door switches on the vacuum motor; in other designs, insertion of the metallic hose-end fitting bridges two electrical contacts, signaling the motor to turn on. Other alternative designs feature a remote on/off switch located at the tool end of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>hose,</b> which communicates either via a pair of wires embedded in the hose, or via wireless signaling.|$|E
5000|$|Another type {{of spring}} clamp, {{typically}} only used on <b>vacuum</b> <b>hoses,</b> {{is just a}} piece of spring steel wire bent into a loop, with the ends curled to provide handles. These are used similar to standard spring clamps, but are just pinched by hand, and provide very little clamping force. Rather than attempting to seal a hose into a barb, they just place a slight pressure on the hose, helping to keep it from sliding off the barb.|$|R
50|$|Toner {{particles}} are formulated to have electrostatic properties and can develop static electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and <b>vacuum</b> <b>hoses.</b> Static discharge from charged toner particles can ignite combustible particles {{in a vacuum}} cleaner bag or create a small dust explosion if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner {{particles are}} so fine that they are poorly filtered by conventional household vacuum cleaner filter bags and blow through the motor or back into the room.|$|R
50|$|There were 5187 {{freight wagons}} in 1999, with 1188 {{due to be}} delivered. The {{majority}} of goods trains on lines without significant gradients run without any train brakes, {{as most of the}} serviceable wagons have been cannibalised and now lack <b>vacuum</b> <b>hoses.</b> Goods trains up to 600 tonnes are braked by the locomotive only, and operate at a maximum speed of 32 km/h. If the train is particularly heavy the wagons at the front will be fitted with hoses {{for the duration of the}} trip. On the steeply-graded ghat sections all wagons will be braked.|$|R

5000|$|When {{asbestos}} {{was common}} in drum brakes, {{there was a}} danger workers repairing or replacing them would breathe asbestos fibers, which can cause mesothelioma. [...] Asbestos fibers would break off or become separated over time and with the high temperatures induced by braking. Wet brushes and aerosol sprays were commonly used to reduce dust. Safety regulators sometimes recommended using <b>vacuum</b> <b>hoses</b> to suck away the dust, or enclosures with interior lighting and space to use tools inside them, but these were rare and cumbersome. Distinctive shoes designed to protect against asbestos were also recommended. There is evidence that auto mechanics had disproportionate levels of mesothelioma.|$|R

5000|$|One of Numatic's {{most popular}} {{products}} is {{a vacuum cleaner}} called Henry. It is easily distinguishable by the large smiling face {{on the front of}} the canister (there's a 3D clip-on face which has eyes and a mouth, and the <b>vacuum's</b> <b>hose</b> forms its nose). Although designing the shape, Duncan did not conceive the [...] "Henry" [...] character. This was designed by Michael Walsh FCSD a graphic designer who was asked to create coloring for the machine. In fact he went further. Michael could see that the top of the machine could be a black bowler hat while the base could be a character face. He created the eyes and mouth and used the hose as a nose for sucking. Then he needed a name. Thinking that [...] "Hoover" [...] is now a generic term for vacuum cleaners he decided to call it [...] "Henry" [...] as in [...] "Henry the Hoover". A new parking bracket was added in September 2012. Since the introduction of Henry in 1981, over 7 million have been produced worldwide.|$|R

50|$|A {{blowoff valve}} is {{connected}} by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>hose</b> to the intake manifold after the throttle plate. When the throttle is closed, the relative manifold pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the resulting pressure differential operates the blowoff valve's piston.

40|$|The LTC coating removal system {{consists}} of several hand {{tools such as}} a Roto Peen scaler and a needlegun. They are designed to remove coatings from steel, concrete, brick, and wood. These are used with the LTC PTC- 6 vacuum system to capture dust and debris as removal of the coating takes place. The PTC- 6 is a vacuum system designed {{to be used with}} surface decontamination equipment. Dust and debris are captured by a high efficiency particulate filter (HEPA) vacuum system that deposits the waste directly into an on-board 23 -gallon waste drum. The PTC- 6 utilizes compressed air delivered from a source via an air hose connected to the air inlet to drive the hand held power tools. The control panel regulated the air pressure delivered to the tool. A separate compressed air flow powers the vacuum generator. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>hoses</b> connect the power tools to the dust chamber, returning paint chips and dust from the surface. A third compressed air flow is used to clean filters by pulsing air through a pipe with slots. The blasts of air shake dust and debris from the filter fabric...|$|R
