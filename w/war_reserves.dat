Initially the WRSA-I stock had $100 million worth of reserves; however, prior to Operation Protective Edge the WRSA-I had nearly $1 billion worth of reserves, with an authorization to increase this to $1.2 billion. In 2014 with the passing of the 2014 United States—Israel Strategic Partnership Act, the US agreed to increase the stock to $1.8 billion.|$|E

50|$|During the Second World War, Chief Constable Jenkins was {{responsible}} for building up the force’s <b>War</b> <b>Reserves</b> and Special Constabulary, as well overseeing {{the growth of the}} Auxiliary Fire Service and the ARP.

50|$|Within their <b>war</b> <b>reserves,</b> Israel keeps ammunitions, {{spare parts}} and {{replacement}} equipment needed {{for at least}} a month of intense combat. The majority of the Israeli reserves are purchased from the US, due to their $3 billion in military aid from the US that requires 75% of the money to be spent on equipment purchased from the US. In total, including the period since 1949 up to the present day the US has granted almost $84 billion in foreign aid to Israel.|$|E

It commands and supports United States Army assigned units, attached units, and augmentation forces and employs these forces in support of the commander. USARJ maintains and strengthens the credibility of deterrent power in the Pacific through maintenance of defense facilities, <b>war</b> <b>reserves</b> and operational project stocks.

In 1938 the helmet plate was changed to the Penzance Borough crest, one of many forces to do so in an attempt to adopt and reflect unique coats of arms. These were later replaced by the standard royal cipher, a step seen as detrimental to individual identity by serving officers.During the Second World War, those employed as <b>War</b> <b>Reserves</b> wore the letters WR on their collars, and routinely carried gas masks in a carryall. Members of the Special Constabulary wore striped arm bands along with the standard uniform.|$|E

50|$|He {{entered the}} US Army Harry Diamond Laboratories as a Mechanical Engineer student trainee in 1959 and retired in 2001. As a Senior level Branch Chief, {{he was an}} {{inventor}} named in 14 Patents and in 1982 was decorated by the Commanding Officer as Inventor of the Year for contributions that lowered the production cost of artillery fuzes. He also served as manager of multimillion-dollar programs, one example being the first production of the M734 Multi-Option Mortar Fuze for <b>war</b> <b>reserves.</b> In the field of manufacturing science, he managed the US Army ManTech Thrust Area for Soldering Technology, which was responsible for reducing the cost of Army electronic systems on a national scale by introducing new technologies into industrial base soldering lines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{identifying}} {{feature of}} centerfire ammunition is the primer -- a metal cup containing primary explosive inserted into a recess {{in the center}} of the base of the cartridge. The firearm firing pin crushes this explosive between the cup and an anvil to produce hot gas and a shower of incandescent particles to ignite the powder charge. [...] Berdan and Boxer primers are used in centerfire cartridges; the primers differ in construction. American cartridges primarily use Boxer primers, and European cartridges use Berdan primers. Various priming mixtures have been used in different sized primers to effect prompt ignition of the powder charge. Particles with relatively high heat capacity are required to promptly ignite smokeless powder deterrent coatings. Some priming explosives decompose into incandescent solids or liquids. Inert ingredients may be heated into incandescent sparks when the explosive decomposes into gas. Cartridges for military use require stable priming formulations so <b>war</b> <b>reserves</b> of small-arms ammunition will dependably function after years of storage.|$|E
5000|$|The M734 Fuze was {{developed}} at the Harry Diamond Laboratories (HDL) for the 60mm [...] Lightweight Company Mortar System, which now is managed by the Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) Fuze Division. [...] It {{was determined to be}} suitable for army use in July 1977 and accordingly Type Classification Standard. To demonstrate readiness for transition into Full Rate Production by the Armament Munitions & Chemical Command (AMCCOM), ARDEC/HDL managed the first production for <b>war</b> <b>reserves</b> as well as the construction of automated Initial Production Facilities (IPF) for mobilization readiness. HDL awarded three competitive contracts in 1978/79: Eastman Kodak (Rochester, NY) for the Fuze Assembly and IPF, Motorola (Scottsdale, AZ) for the Amplifier Assembly and IPF, and Alinabal (Milford, CT.) for the Alternator Assembly and IPF. After successful First Article Inspection and production Lot Acceptance tests, transition was completed in March 1983. AMCCOM performed all procurements for stockpile with technical support by ARDEC. The Army Mortar Plan issued in 1985 expanded use of the M734 fuze to 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm mortars (Figures 8,9). The initial production costs and required operating characteristics are shown in Figures 10 and 11 respectively. Improvements in the fuze reliability and performance by ARDEC engineers led to production of the M734A1 fuze [...] manufactured by L-3 FOS (Formerly KDI).|$|E

50|$|The early {{strength}} of the Penzance Borough Police was very small, with only two officers and two gaolers in 1856. Records from 1883 to 1893 suggest the force rarely numbered more than thirteen men until the First World War when numbers were boosted by Special Constables. In 1927 there were approximately 40 members of the Penzance Special Constabulary, and no women constables. A report by the Inspector of Constabulary noted, in that year, there was one Police Constable for every 775 persons of a population of 12,087 In 1883 the force consisted of two sergeants and eight constables led by Head Constable John Olds. In 1893 the force numbered two sergeants and ten constables led by Head Constable Richard Nicholas. During the Newlyn Riots of 1896 the force numbered only eight. In 1914 there were two sergeants and thirteen constables. A photograph taken in 1936 shows a {{strength of}} twenty, and by 1939 twenty-five. The force would boast its highest number of recruits during World War Two, when its regulars were supported by Special Constables {{and a large number}} of specially employed <b>War</b> <b>Reserves.</b> The addition of a criminal investigations department and a motor patrol between 1937 and 1941 by Chief Constable Robert Cyril Morton Jenkins boosted numbers further, although exact numbers are unknown. The historic reference to Inspectors and Superintendents in Penzance, relate to officers of the Cornwall County Constabulary covering the Penzance District, which in 1893 were Superintendent John Coombe, based in Camborne, and Inspector Edward Matthews, based in Chyandour.|$|E
