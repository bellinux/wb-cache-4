In what was the first episode of the Argonautic saga, she gave her children a ram with a golden fleece upon which they fled the intrigues of their stepmother Ino according to other sources. Athamas was driven mad by the gods, perhaps because he took the young Dionysus into his household, and slaughtered his and Ino's son Learchus; Ino herself jumped into the sea <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>son</b> Melicertes and became the sea-goddess Leucothea.

He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University.
