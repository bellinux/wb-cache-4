5|$|Allosaurus was {{the most}} common large {{theropod}} in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> trophic level of the Morrison food web. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E
5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, though {{there is some evidence}} of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus {{are the result of}} lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.|$|E

His mother particularly encouraged {{him to become a}} doctor. Qandil simultaneously took an interest in writing, Arabic calligraphy and foreign languages.|$|E
5|$|Trollope {{established}} himself at The Shannon Hotel, a long bow-fronted Georgian building, which was over 100 {{years old at}} that time. The hotel, which still exists, {{is located at the}} bottom of the town, a mere one hundred yards from the river. The post office where Trollope worked <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the town, which is only a matter of minutes on foot. Next to the post office was a two-roomed bungalow which was used by the Postal Surveyor and his new deputy as their working headquarters. This building is often erroneously considered to have been the residence of Trollope himself.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{there were}} 36 number-one albums in this chart, which was first {{published}} on July 10, 1993. One album peaked at {{number one in the}} first year of publication: Mi Tierra, by Cuban singer-songwriter Gloria Estefan. The album also peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It won the Best Traditional Tropical Album award at the Grammy Awards of 1994. Mi Tierra spent 25 weeks at number one in 1993 and 33 weeks at this position in 1994. Segundo Romance by Mexican singer Luis Miguel also peaked at number one; this album <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> for 29 consecutive weeks, starting in late1994. It won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 1995, defeating albums from singers Cristian Castro, Plácido Domingo, Juan Gabriel and Tejano music group La Mafia; the latter also peaked at number one on March 1995 with their live album Éxitos En Vivo.|$|E

Joliot-Curie <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Alsos's wanted list, so Pash and CIC Special Agent Gerry Beatson set out to investigate {{in the wake of}} the advancing U.S. Third Army. They searched the University of Rennes and found some documents there on 9 August. On 11 August they reached the homes of Joliot-Curie, Francis Perrin, and Pierre Auger in the L'Arcouest area. Joliot-Curie was not home, but German snipers fired on them, and they had to wait until 12 August before they could search the house.|$|E
5|$|The Morrison Formation records a {{time when}} the local {{environment}} was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the theropods Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Ornitholestes, Saurophaganax, and Torvosaurus; the sauropods Brontosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus; and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus. Apatosaurus is commonly found at the same sites as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus. Allosaurus accounted for 70–75% of theropod specimens and <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> trophic level of the Morrison food web. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are of the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks of the Lourinhã Formationmainly Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Torvosaurusor have a close counterpartBrachiosaurus and Lusotitan, Camptosaurus and Draconyx, and Apatosaurus and Dinheirosaurus. Other vertebrates that are known to have shared this paleo-environment include ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, and several species of pterosaur. Shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been evidenced in fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns with fern understory (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E

Predators in this paleoenvironment included the theropods Saurophaganax, Torvosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Marshosaurus, Stokesosaurus, Ornitholestes; and Allosaurus, {{which accounted for}} up to 75% of theropod specimens, and <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> trophic level of the Morrison food web.
