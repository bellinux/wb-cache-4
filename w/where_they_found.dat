5|$|Researchers {{discovered}} that where the P. rebeli {{lay their eggs}} {{is based on the}} size of the G. cruciata leaves and not upon the location of the closest Myrmica ant colony. Evidence for P. rebeli oviposition depending upon the range of the food plant rather than the range of the ants is supported by the timing of its oviposition. P. rebeli lays their eggs during the warm summer season, when Myrmica ants are most likely to be underground. Researchers also observed females did not base their oviposition on <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> Myrmica nests.|$|E
5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers {{to defend the}} Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston {{knew that there were}} not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and {{they did not want to}} destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E

After meeting Diana Prince, with whom he teamed to defeat Hades and Felix Faust, Clark, as Superman, chose to reveal to the President that he was not a meteor-infected individual as the public believed but was from another planet.

5|$|Following Hendrix's {{arrival in}} London, Chandler began {{recruiting}} members for a band designed {{to highlight the}} guitarist's talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Hendrix met guitarist Noel Redding at an audition for the New Animals, where Redding's knowledge of blues progressions impressed Hendrix, who stated that he also liked Redding's hairstyle. Chandler asked Redding {{if he wanted to}} play bass guitar in Hendrix's band; Redding agreed. Chandler then began looking for a drummer and soon after, he contacted Mitch Mitchell through a mutual friend. Mitchell, who had recently been fired from Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, participated in a rehearsal with Redding and Hendrix <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> common ground in their shared interest in rhythm and blues. When Chandler phoned Mitchell later that day to offer him the position, he readily accepted.

5|$|In {{response}} to the attack, Major Ormsby advanced from Fort Erie to Frenchman’s Creek with his 80 men of the 49th Regiment, where he was joined by Lieutenant McIntyre’s 70 light infantrymen, Major Hatt’s Lincoln Militia and some British-allied Native Americans under Major Givins. Finding that Boerstler’s invaders had already gone, and being unable to determine any other enemy presence in the pitch dark, Ormsby’s 300 men remained in position until daybreak, when Lieutenant Colonel Bisshopp arrived from Fort Erie. Bisshopp led the force to the Red House, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> Captain King and his men still waiting to be evacuated. Outnumbered by ten-to-one, King surrendered.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 {{made their}} way to Tagauayan, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> PT-34. There was a {{discussion}} about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit. Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, since there was no assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well.|$|E

The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> good drinking water, although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so much water that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán.|$|E

A similar fate befell many of his supporters that night, while others were captured and tortured to extract the names of all the conspirators. Alexios Mourtzouphlos was likely put in prison for his role in this affair (he is known to have been in prison in 1203), and the two Komnenos brothers, Alexios and David, seem to have fled the capital immediately after the coup's failure.|$|E
