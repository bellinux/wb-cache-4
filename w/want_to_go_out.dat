5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew {{in the care of}} their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E

She did not finish until about 1:30a.m. Sunday. She {{waited for her}} friend since kindergarten, Paul Martin, age 16, to pick her up. Martin was in town after moving away to Kilgore two years prior. He had been with her earlier that day before the dance and was {{to take her to}} a slumber party across town. Booker's classmates said that earlier that day she told them that she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with Martin but felt obligated since he was an old friend.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} slogan campaigns for Bull Durham was the “Roll Your Own” campaign. The campaign came at an ideal time, as product sales were low due to the competition against the emerging pre-rolled cigarette. These ads appeared {{around the time of the}} Great Depression and showed the low price of only a nickel per bag as well as an elegant scene with finely dressed, upper class looking people. This advertisement campaign originally had doubters, yet quickly these doubts were taken away when sales exploded. The ads made many in the middle and lower class <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to buy Bull Durham in order to emulate the upper class. The campaign was tremendously successful, using the desire for a better life to boost sales.|$|E

500|$|Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere della Sera {{mentioned that}} Madonna would play in Italy {{as part of}} a world tour to promote Bedtime Stories in spring or fall 1995. However, Madonna and her manager Freddy DeMann cancelled all plans after she was offered the role of Eva Perón on the film Evita, directed by Alan Parker. Her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg considered a [...] "shorter tour" [...] because of filming, however, Madonna commented, [...] "I've waited years for this role, and I have to put every ounce of concentration into it. I love touring, and I very much <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with this album.

500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first {{recorded}} by American pop singer Katy Perry, recording the track as a demo for her debut album One of the Boys, though it was never fully executed for the album and was passed to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals, soon after a leaked version of Katy Perry on the Internet. Perry discussed her role with Bliss magazine: [...] "My vocals are actually on Breakout. I thought, 'Yes, I'm singing on a Miley single'." [...] Cyrus said naming the album Breakout {{was influenced by the}} song as it was [...] "one of [...] favorite songs" [...] on the album; this was because the song is feminine but has appeals to different age groups: [...] "Moms, dads, sisters, brothers can, you know, relate to it.

500|$|The {{secondary}} crew of JAT Flight 367, {{flying from}} Stockholm to Belgrade with stopovers in Copenhagen and Zagreb, arrived in Denmark {{on the morning}} of 25 January 1972. According to Vulović, she was not scheduled to be on Flight 367 and JAT had confused her for another flight attendant also named Vesna. Nevertheless, Vulović says she was excited to travel to Denmark because it was her first time visiting the country. The crew had the entire afternoon and the following morning to themselves. Vulović wished to go sightseeing but her colleagues insisted that they go shopping. [...] "Everybody wanted to buy something for his or her family," [...] she recalled. [...] "So I had to go shopping with them. They seemed to know that they would die. They didn't talk about it, but I saw... I felt for them. And the captain was locked in his room for 24 hours.

500|$|Dante {{debuted in}} Devil May Cry, a game {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} part of Capcom's Resident Evil franchise. Series' creator Hideki Kamiya wrote his name after rewriting the story and took it from Dante Alighieri's poem Divine Comedy. Kamiya has said that the title character from the manga series Cobra by Buichi Terasawa served as the basis for Dante's personality. Kamiya based his idea of Dante on what he perceived as [...] "Stylish" [...] – wearing a long coat to make the character [...] "showy" [...] and a non-smoker, as Kamiya saw that as [...] "more cool". The character wears red because in Japan it is a traditional color for a heroic figure. Kamiya has also stated he perceives Dante as [...] "a character that you would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> drinking with", someone who was not a show-off but would instead [...] "pull some ridiculous, mischievous joke" [...] to endear people to him. He added that this aspect was intended to make the character feel familiar to audiences. Although Kamiya was not the main writer from the first two Devil May Cry novels he viewed Shinya Goikeda's depiction of Dante similar to the one he wrote.|$|E
500|$|During the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000), Spears {{revealed}} {{she felt}} inspired by hip hop {{artists such as}} Jay-Z and The Neptunes and {{wanted to create a}} record with a funkier sound. In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother's Gift. On the same month, Spears started to record material for her third studio album, with [...] "Overprotected" [...] being recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Additional recording was done in April 2001 at Maratone in Sweden, in which the song's vocals were completed. Background vocals were provided by Spears and Bosslady, with the track being mixed by Martin and Rami at Maratone Studios. Her third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. In an interview with the Daily Record, Spears concluded she can relate to [...] "Overprotected" [...] "on a personal basis, because I feel kind of overprotected. When I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> everything has to be organized in advance. I think that other kids of my age can relate to it to a certain extent." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{preliminary}} {{round of the}} 200-meter butterfly, Tarwater turned in the fastest time, acknowledging that nerves {{played a role in}} his fast swim. In the semi-finals, he achieved a new personal best of 1:54.72 and finished with the second-fastest time, just seven-tenths of a second slower than Phelps. [...] "It felt great, but there's still no celebrating for me," [...] he said about the swim. In the finals, Tarwater was exactly tied with Phelps and on world-record pace through the first 50 meters. He stayed near Phelps for 150 meters before fading on the last 50. In the last 25 meters, he was passed by Gil Stovall, who beat his personal best by a second and a half, to finish third. Tarwater also swam a new personal best – 1:54.46 – but it was not good enough to make the Olympic team, missing out by six-tenths of a second. After the race, he briefly considered retiring before deciding to finish the meet. [...] "I don't know what the future is going to bring, but I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> knowing I didn't get back up," [...] he said. He finished eighth in the 100-meter butterfly; earlier, he failed to make the finals in the freestyle events.|$|E
500|$|Adenhart {{made his}} Major League debut as the {{starting}} pitcher against the Oakland Athletics at home in Angel Stadium of Anaheim. At the time, he was the youngest active-roster pitcher in the major leagues. In his debut, he gave up five earned runs and walked five in two innings, earning a no-decision in a 15–8 loss. Adenhart was disappointed in his first appearance, saying, [...] "I let down the team first. You always <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and prove yourself to your teammates and your manager and your coaches. I was a disappointment to myself also." [...] His second start was against the Kansas City Royals, where he earned another no-decision, allowing three earned runs and striking out three over 4⅓ innings in a 5–3 win by the Angels. The reaction to his second start was more positive, with manager Mike Scioscia saying that [...] "it was definitely a start in the right direction." [...] Adenhart earned his only career decision, a victory, on May 12, 2008, against the Chicago White Sox in Anaheim, giving up four earned runs in 5⅔ innings {{en route to a}} 10–7 Angels victory. After the win against the White Sox, Adenhart was sent back down to the Salt Lake Bees. He {{spent the rest of the}} 2008 season at Salt Lake, amassing a 9–13 record with a 5.76 ERA in 26 games.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2014 NBA draft, Frazier {{worked out}} for several NBA teams, {{including}} the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Wizards. Philadelphia worked him out two times, and head coach Brett Brown invited him to play for them at the 2014 Las Vegas Summer League within an hour after he was not selected in the draft. The situation was {{compared to that of}} Khalif Wyatt, who played for the 76ers through the 2013 edition of the summer league, and attended Temple University in the Philadelphia area. Frazier said, [...] "When [...] reached out to me and said they wanted me for the summer league, I was ready to go for it. I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> have fun, play my hardest and show Philly and other teams what they can get from me.". According to the 76ers assistant coach, Chad Iske, he impressed the team's staff by his [...] "poise" [...] and experience at the higher level. At Las Vegas, Frazier averaged 3.4 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.2 steals in five games. On September 29, 2014, the Boston Celtics signed Frazier to a non-guaranteed training camp deal with the likely notion of auditioning with the Maine Red Claws in the future. On October 27, 2014, he was waived by the Celtics after appearing in four preseason games where he went 1-for-2 from the field and recorded two rebounds, four assists and four steals. As expected, four days later, he was acquired by the Maine Red Claws as an affiliate player. Frazier opened his season in the D-League by contributing 18 points, 9 assists, and 4 rebounds against the Oklahoma City Blue. He also shot 12-of-12 on free throws, helping the team win their first game.|$|E

2500|$|Imagine {{that during}} the winter couples do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> but want to acquire more scrip for the summer. To compensate, the {{administration}} can lower the amount of extra scrip returned when parents want to borrow in the winter, and increase rates in the summer. [...] Depending upon {{the strength of the}} seasonality of babysitting, this might work. [...] But suppose the seasonality is so strong that no one wants {{to go out in the}} winter even when the administration sets its interest rates to zero. That is, suppose no parents <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> even when they can borrow money for free. In this hypothetical situation, the co-op has fallen into a liquidity trap.|$|E
2500|$|At first, {{new members}} of the co-op felt, on average, that they should save more scrip before they began spending.
