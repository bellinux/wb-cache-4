5|$|PTV {{becomes a}} huge success, and Brian and Stewie, {{impressed}} by the hits, join in to help Peter expand his television programming, as well as performing their own show Cheeky Bastard sitcom on PTV. Lois is furious about everyone's lust for perverted TV, as she is concerned {{over the issue of}} how children will be influenced by his programming (in the episode's DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of Jackass, defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians are the ones who should take full responsibility for <b>what</b> <b>kids</b> watch on TV and also points out that there are much worse influences besides TV. Regardless of that, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, Brian, and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC's regulations are. Despite being impressed with the song, the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can't stop people from being who they are or how they live their lives, they decide to take on the challenge.|$|E

25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, <b>what</b> <b>kids</b> listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

Several other activist groups have protested the show's parodies of Christianity and portrayal of Jesus Christ. Stone claims that parents who disapprove of South Park for its portrayal of how kids behave are upset because they [...] "have an idyllic vision of <b>what</b> <b>kids</b> are like", adding [...] " [...] don't {{have any kind of}} social tact or etiquette, they're just complete little raging bastards".|$|E

500|$|In a 1999 poll {{conducted}} by NatWest Bank, eight and nine-year-old {{children in the}} United Kingdom voted Cartman as their favorite personality.

Parker and Stone have always asserted that due to Cartman's actions and dialogue, his appearances in South Park are not meant to be viewed by younger children, and they note that the show is certified with TV ratings that indicate its intention for mature audiences.|$|E

I'm very interested in seeing <b>what</b> <b>kids</b> today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
500|$|The creators {{wanted to}} make Kim as {{believable}} as possible. Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters inspired them to conceive Kim as a [...] "character with dimension ... that girls could watch and appreciate." [...] McCorkle was quick in deciding very early on that Kim {{does not belong to}} a spy organization, nor does she possess any superpowers. Although admitting that the character's accomplishments are generally [...] "implausible," [...] Schooley and McCorkle wanted Kim to remain relatable to young viewers, and avoided making her [...] "impervious" [...] like superheroes by giving her [...] "real problems and teen issues." [...] McCorkle described Kim as [...] "incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world by all the things we all have trouble with", including embarrassment, school work and family. Schooley explained that [...] "What makes Kim effective in the action world is gymnastics, cheerleading, physical activity, something that any kid, any girl, in the world could do." [...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator – named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character – with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones. Kim's use of advanced technology represents her ability to [...] "effortlessly hop around the world and get back in time for dinner. Which is pretty unrealistic, but it’s <b>what</b> <b>kids</b> can do on the internet now. They can talk to somebody anywhere".|$|E
