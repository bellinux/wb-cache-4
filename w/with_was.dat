5|$|After {{five years}} at West Point, Devers was {{selected}} to attend the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He began his studies there on 3 September 1924, and finished as a Distinguished Graduate on 28 June 1925. He was ranked 42nd {{in the class of}} 258, which was topped by Dwight Eisenhower. He was then posted once again to Fort Sill, this time as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929. Among the officers he worked <b>with</b> <b>was</b> Captain Edward H. Brooks. During his tour, Devers was credited with making a number of innovative artillery tactical and technical improvements, including advanced fire-support techniques that would later be successfully used during World War II. He remained a staunch advocate of mechanization throughout the inter-war period. The idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E
5|$|Although many Old Court supporters—typically the state's wealthy aristocracy—gravitated to the National Republican Party (later to {{be called}} Whigs) that formed in the 1820s, it is {{inaccurate}} to assume the Anti-Relief Party as a whole became National Republicans and the Relief Party became Democrats. The primary factor in determining which party Kentuckians aligned <b>with</b> <b>was</b> their faith in Whig Party founder and native son, Henry Clay. From the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828 to the expiration of John L. Helm's term in 1851, only one Democrat held the office of governor: John Breathitt, who died {{a year and a}} half into his term and was succeeded in office by his lieutenant governor, James Turner Morehead, a National Republican.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled <b>with</b> <b>was</b> {{how to deal}} with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E
40|$|Boundary {{extension}} (BE) is {{a phenomenon}} in which the boundary of a picture is reportedly extended in memory. The model known to best fit <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> is the Extension-Normalization model (intraub, 1996), which explains BE by the dual memory process. While focusing on this model, this paper reviews relevant literature dealing <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> It highlights the necessity of defining the phenomenon itself more precisely and of constructing appropriate methods, with which to measure BE. Additionally, the paper considers the possibility that, BE has multiple origins and discusses perceptual and clinical factors associated <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> that were not addressed in previous research...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{developing}} esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) for patients <b>with</b> Barrett's esophagus (<b>BE)</b> is approximately 0. 5 % per year. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> estimate and perceive their risk {{of developing}} EAC. DESIGN: Questionnaire study. SETTING: Patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> who were undergoing surveillance endoscopy based on histologic and flow cytometric results. PATIENTS: A total of 192 patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Individual patients were asked to estimate the numerical risk to develop EAC for patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> in general and for themselves. How patients perceived their own risk was measured {{on a scale from}} "very small" to "very large. " RESULTS: At least 1 question was filled out by 169 patients (88 % response). Sixty percent of respondents underestimated the numerical risk for patients <b>with</b> <b>BE,</b> in general, to develop EAC, while even more patients (69 %) underestimated their own risk. Most respondents perceived their own risk as very small or small (63 %). LIMITATIONS: Risk estimations may depend on the response scale used. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> underestimated the numerical risk and perceived their {{risk of developing}} EAC as (very) low.

40|$|BACKGROUND: GQ 1 b {{antibody}} (GQ 1 b-Ab) {{is detected}} in approximately two-thirds of sera of patients <b>with</b> Bickerstaffs encephalitis (<b>BE).</b> Whilst {{some of the}} remaining patients have antibodies to other gangliosides, many patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> are reported to be seronegative. METHODS AND RESULTS: Voltage-gated potassium channel antibody (VGKC-Ab) at high titer was detected during the diagnostic work-up of one patient <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> Sera of an additional patient <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and nine patients with Miller Fisher syndrome (MF) (all GQ 1 b-Ab positive) were investigated for VGKC-Ab and other anti-neuronal antibodies by radioimmunoprecipitation using 125 I-dendrotoxin-VGKC and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Two patients with MF exhibited moderate titer VGKC-Abs. Regardless of positivity for VGKC or GQ 1 b antibodies, serum IgG of all patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and MF reacted with the molecular layer and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in a distinctive pattern. CONCLUSION: Voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies might be involved in some cases of BE or MF. The common staining pattern despite different antibody results suggests {{that there might be}} other, as yet unidentified, antibodies associated <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and MF...|$|R
5|$|Further, {{the work}} shows {{evidence}} of its having been {{put together in}} a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative. Birley sees {{an example of the}} carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the Life of Marcus Aurelius the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and also because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'. The answer he came up <b>with</b> <b>was</b> to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus. However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Galaxy Game and Computer Space, numerous other games have been directly inspired by Spacewar. These include Orbitwar (1974, PLATO network computers), Space Wars (1977, arcade), and Space War (1978, Atari 2600). Additionally, in Asteroids (1979), designer Ed Logg used elements from Spacewar, namely the hyperspace button {{and the shape}} of the player's ship. Products as late as the 1990 computer game Star Control drew direct inspiration from Spacewar. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased <b>with</b> <b>was</b> the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games without feeling restricted to using Russell's own code or design.|$|E
5|$|Siwiec's timing {{has been}} {{described}} as unfortunate, as he chose to commit his act during a dance (mazurka), at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra playing. Some, like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof Kąkolewski, have speculated that if he had chosen to act moments earlier, during a speech by Polish communist leader Władysław Gomułka, first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party, the commotion he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely. Publicist Antoni Zambrowski noted that many other self-immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti-communist opposition movements and left messages and other documents which helped publicize their activities; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti-communist opposition with which he identified <b>with</b> <b>was</b> not aware of his action and the meaning behind it until much later.|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} the coexistence of bronchiectasis (BE) and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in series of patients diagnosed primarily <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> The {{aim of this}} study was to analyse the characteristics of patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> associated <b>with</b> COPD included in the Spanish Bronchiectasis Historical Registry and compare them to the remaining patients <b>with</b> non-cystic fibrosis <b>BE.</b> We conducted a multicentre observational study of historical cohorts, analysing the characteristics of 1, 790 patients who had been included in the registry between 2002 and 2011. Of these, 158 (8. 8 %) were registered as BE related to COPD and were compared to the remaining patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> of other aetiologies. Patients <b>with</b> COPD <b>were</b> mostly male, older, had a poorer respiratory function and more frequent exacerbations. There were no differences in the proportion of patients with chronic bronchial colonisation or in the isolated microorganisms. A significantly larger proportion of patients with COPD received treatment with bronchodilators, inhaled steroids and intravenous antibiotics, but there was no difference in the use of long term oral or inhaled antibiotherapy. During a follow-up period of 3. 36 years, the overall proportion of deaths was 13. 8 %. When compared to the remaining aetiologies, patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> associated <b>with</b> COPD presented the highest mortality rate. The multivariate analysis showed that the diagnosis of COPD in a patient <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> as a primary diagnosis increased the risk of death by 1. 77. Patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> related to COPD have the same microbiological characteristics as patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> due to other aetiologies. They receive treatment with long term oral and inhaled antibiotics aimed at controlling chronic bronchial colonisation, even though the current COPD treatment guidelines do not envisage this type of therapy. These patients' mortality is notably higher than that of remaining patients <b>with</b> non-cystic fibrosis <b>BE...</b>|$|R

40|$|Patients with Barrett 2 ̆ 7 s {{esophagus}} (BE) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are at {{a higher}} risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA).

5|$|The characters' {{body and}} facial {{movements}} were recorded using motion capture: these included capturing static figures for dialogue segments, and full-body capture for action sequences. The motion actors provided {{the basis for}} their characters' appearance: the actors were chosen based on how well they fitted with the staff's vision for the characters. The motion actors' facial expressions were captured using a special head-mounted rig the team had previously developed for the 2012 tech demo. When the character designs were being created, Nozue needed to regularly consult professional hairstylists to ensure that their chosen hairstyles for characters would be feasible in real life. For characters who appeared in the game, the team tried to keep their facial features {{as close as possible to}} their in-game counterpart. As with other Japanese CGI films aiming for a realistic tone, the team relied on photogrammetry and an extensive 3D scanning process combined with motion capture. Character clothing was created in a similar way to real-life clothing, with a number of different design variations being tested using paper cutouts. Something that both in-house and external staff contended <b>with</b> <b>was</b> making character movements realistic without being symmetrical; the biggest example was Libertus's need to walk on crutches for much of the movie, shifting his weight balance and movement speed.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{story was}} born from wanting to expand upon the {{original}} game's {{theme of the}} growing rift between mankind and the gods. The Greek Underworld was the one major mythical location that the developers of Titan Quest had not yet approached. As it offered {{a rich source of}} material for their creative staff, it was made the location for the expansion. The story concept the team began <b>with</b> <b>was</b> the possibility of a secondary hostile force besides the Titans that had only kept away from humans due to the presence of the Olympians, and now rose up as they retreated from human affairs. With the quests, the team worked to improve on the structure and impact they had in the original, introducing famous places and people from history and mythology. They also expanded the variety of side quests, and included elements such as legends and customs related to the dead. The script was written by Dean O'Donnell. While an experienced playwright, he encountered new challenges in writing for the video game medium, as he needed to always assume that the player had spoken first to a selected NPC and to contain the necessary information in the first line of dialogue with embellishment in additional lines. Aesthetically, the tone of Immortal Throne was darker than that of its predecessor, with one of the main elements of this change being the cover art: according to designer Arthur Bruno, this was in reaction to the unfavorable impression players received from the surface appearance of Titan Quest when compared to the darker take on Grecian mythology in the God of War series.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} grains were rye, barley, buckwheat, millet and oats. Rice {{remained}} a fairly expensive import {{for most of}} the Middle Ages and was grown in northern Italy only {{towards the end of the}} period. Wheat was common all over Europe and was considered to be the most nutritious of all grains, but was more prestigious and thus more expensive. The finely sifted white flour that modern Europeans are most familiar <b>with</b> <b>was</b> reserved for the bread of the upper classes. As one descended the social ladder, bread became coarser, darker, and its bran content increased. In times of grain shortages or outright famine, grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like chestnuts, dried legumes, acorns, ferns, and a wide variety of more or less nutritious vegetable matter.|$|E

5|$|The two-player {{game has}} the players {{engaged in a}} dogfight between two spaceships set against the {{backdrop}} of a randomly generated background starfield. The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased <b>with</b> <b>was</b> the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games.|$|E
