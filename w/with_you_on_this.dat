Commander Ferguson thanked the Orbit 1 team of shuttle flight {{controllers}} headed by Flight Director Kwatsi Alibaruho. He {{urged them to}} pause a moment {{on their way out}} and [...] "make a memory." [...] From the station flight control room, CAPCOM Daniel Tani, told Ferguson that it had been [...] "a pleasure and an honor" [...] to support the mission. [...] "We are proud to be the last of a countless line of mission control teams who have watched while shuttles visited the ISS. The ISS wouldn't be here without the shuttle," [...] noted Tani. [...] "It's been an incredible ride. On behalf of the four of us, we're really appreciative we had the opportunity to work <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> pivotal mission," [...] replied Ferguson.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come," [...] said he, {{putting his}} arm within {{that of his}} stout son, [...] "let us turn into the wood awhile. I would {{converse}} <b>with</b> <b>thee</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{husband will}} be too happy to talk <b>with</b> <b>you</b> further <b>on</b> <b>this</b> subject," [...] she said with quiet dignity, as she regained the General's side. [...] "Come with us to Oneida. Brook Farm {{is a thing of}} the past." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I go <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Corny, <b>on</b> <b>this</b> foolish business," [...] {{said the}} Rev. Mr. Worden, {{as soon as}} we were fairly on our way, [...] "to comply with a promise made your {{excellent}} mother, not to let you stray into any questionable company, without keeping a fatherly eye over you. Now, I regard a fortune-teller's, as a doubtful sort of society; therefore, I feel it to be a duty, to make one of this party." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] said Reuben, recollecting his firmness, [...] "and I will {{hope that}} Heaven has {{suggested}} to your kind heart and firm courage {{the only possible}} means of saving the life of this unfortunate girl. But, Jeanie, you must not take this most perilous journey alone; I {{have an interest in}} you, and I will not agree that my Jeanie throws herself away. You must even, in the present circumstances, give me a husband's right to protect you, and I will go <b>with</b> <b>you</b> myself <b>on</b> <b>this</b> journey, and assist you to do your duty by your family." ...|$|R

6000|$|The other waterman, {{alarmed at}} Nigel's gesture, lay upon his oar; but Green-jacket replied coolly--"Look you, master, I should not care a tester to venture a life <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> matter; {{but the truth}} is, I am {{employed}} to do you good, and not to do you harm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How strange!" [...] {{said the}} priest. [...] "There has always {{appeared}} {{to me to be}} something uncanny in spiders. I should be glad to talk further <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> subject.

6000|$|... "Well, well, sir," [...] {{interrupted}} Mr Kennedy, {{with a look}} of offended dignity, [...] "your feelings {{ought to}} be kept more under control. But come, sir, to my house.

6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said Steadfast. [...] "I {{went down}} {{last night to}} the mill, Jeph, to see whether perchance you might be hurt and wanting help, and after I had heard that all was well <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> I lighted <b>on</b> <b>this</b> poor little maid {{crouching}} under a bush, and brought her home with me for pity's sake till I could find her friends." ...|$|R

6000|$|Master George darted a hasty {{glance at}} Nigel, {{and when he}} saw his {{features}} betoken no consciousness, he muttered to himself,--"It must be better than I feared.--And so this cursed Spaniard, with her head full, as they all have, of disguises, trap-doors, rope-ladders, and masks, was jade and fool enough to take <b>you</b> <b>with</b> her <b>on</b> <b>this</b> wild goose errand?--And how sped you, I pray?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You seem {{to think}} it {{vexatious}} that I shall allow you but one woman [...] at a time either to praise or love.

6000|$|... "That may be, my dear," [...] rejoined Sir Thomas dryly, [...] "but {{this does}} not apply to me. Old Rad is a very old friend of mine, but if I went <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> errand to-night, I should be going not as a friend, but in an {{official}} capacity, and as such I cannot do it without the doctor's permission." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are surprised? I am glad of that, for I {{was rather}} so myself. Yes.

6000|$|Later, in May, Clemens took Twichell for an {{excursion}} to Bermuda. [...] He had begged Howells {{to go with}} them, but Howells, as usual, was [...] full {{of literary}} affairs.

[...] "Put it [...] down as an Oasis!" [...] wrote Twichell on his return, [...] "I'm afraid I shall [...] not see as green a spot again soon. And it was your invention and [...] your gift.

5000|$|Since {{the site}} of the city was {{identified}} in the 1970s, an archaeological project has been undertaken.

"That is {{awfully good}} of you, Dave," [...] Tom said, [...] "but {{as you have}} lost more than a {{fortnight}} at present, and I suppose it will be another fortnight before Dick {{is strong enough to}} travel, it isn't fair on you; and perhaps {{you might be able to}} introduce us to some men going up to the hills--that is, if you think that we could not go <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> expedition you talk of." ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{an honor}} to be <b>with</b> <b>you</b> here <b>on</b> <b>this</b> lovely campus. This is not my first trip to Indiana Wesleyan. I have many friends here and {{recently}} worked closely with Indiana Wesleyan’s faculty and staff in a major yearlong self-study and improvement planning process for the first year. I very much appreciate the invitation extended to me by Sheila Carlblom to reflect <b>with</b> <b>you</b> about your important role in Christian college settings and how what you do – helping students become knowledgeable and ethical seekers and consumers of information – is so important. In my remarks this morning, I want to reflect <b>with</b> <b>you</b> about the first year, the nature of today’s beginning students, and about the challenges we face in making information literacy a more central component of the first year. I also have questions {{about what it means to}} be a Christian librarian – honest questions that I want to explore <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in the context of the first year. Finally I want to facilitate a conversation between all of us about ways that you are currently integrating your work into the first year. But let me begin by practicing what I preach to faculty who teach first-year students by telling you a bit more about myself and how I more or less fell into a career focused on the first year...|$|R

40|$|Homology search {{methods have}} {{advanced}} substantially in recent years. Beginning with the elegant Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman dynamic programming {{techniques of the}} 1970 s, algorithms have been developed that were appropriate for the data sets and computer systems of their times. As data sets grew, faster but less sensitive heuristic algorithms, such as FASTA and BLAST, became a dominant force in the late 1980 s and 1990 s. As datasets have grown still larger in the post-genome era, new technologies have appeared to address these new problems. For example, the optimal spaced seeds of PatternHunter increase speed and sensitivity. Using these ideas, we can achieve BLAST-level speed and sensitivity approaching that of slow algorithms like the Smith-Waterman, bringing us back to a full circle. We wish to take <b>you</b> <b>with</b> us <b>on</b> <b>this</b> round trip, with some detours along the way so as to study both global and local alignment. We present methods for general purpose homology that are widely adopted, not individual programs...|$|R
