500|$|The North American {{release was}} {{scheduled}} for July 11, 2008, but was delayed until August 15, before being brought forward to August 13. As {{a result of the}} move from July, 20th Century Fox moved its family comedy Meet Dave in the open slot. The August 13 release date was also the opening weekends for the animated family film [...] and the horror film Mirrors. Studios consider the third week of August to be a weaker performing period than earlier in the summer because of students returning to school. Previous R-rated comedies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Superbad were released in mid-August and performed well at the box office. Reacting to Tropic Thunders release date, Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, stated: [...] "For a young person at the end of summer, you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> fun and forget about going back to school. What better than a crazy comedy?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Justin Brookman, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, {{expressed}} concern regarding {{the impact of}} IoT on consumer privacy, saying that [...] "There are {{some people in the}} commercial space who say, 'Oh, big data — well, let's collect everything, keep it around forever, we'll pay for somebody to think about security later.' The question is whether we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sort of policy framework in place to limit that." ...|$|E
2500|$|It's {{this world}} where the Marvel heroines are leaders in their own civilization. I really didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> kind of validating reason... So I didn't want to do {{anything}} like, [...] "all the men disappeared years ago" [...] or [...] "ever since all the menfolk were killed in that war" [...] or something like that. There are men—there are heroes there. You'll see familiar faces and favorites, but the heroines are in charge, by majority. It's just this is how their world evolved. They were competent. They were clever and they were the ones in charge because of their skills and they were the best fit for these roles and demands of their world.|$|E

6000|$|... "Crazy guy," [...] was his {{estimate}} of the mysterious automobilist. [...] "Just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> fun kiddin', I guess. He might have dug up a dollar, anyhow. Now I've got to hurry up {{and get back to}} that gang of bum bed hunters before they all get preached to sleep." ...|$|R
2500|$|Frequently in interviews, Maus {{advocates for}} [...] "truth" [...] in music. Flavorwires Tom Hawking argues that [...] "he's an {{interesting}} case because his music doesn’t necessarily discuss {{the ideas that}} seem to inform it" [...] unless one considers that the [...] "relative simplicity of his songs, both lyrically and musically, {{is a way of}} getting at fundamental truths." [...] Jordan Redmond of Tiny Mix Tapes writes that Maus [...] "bristles at the sort of obfuscated discourse often created and upheld by, as he would have it, the sophisticated and exclusionary contemporary art world," [...] and that rather than aspiring to be [...] "anti-intellectual," [...] his music [...] "only seeks to be the pinnacle of inclusion, and by embracing a form that has stroked the ears of the general populace {{for the better part of}} three decades, Maus looks to not only generate enjoyment but also discussion." [...] Slant Magazines Matthew Cole dismissed Maus' philosophical writings as [...] "a parody of post-structuralist social theory" [...] and his music as [...] "obviously some kind of art-school mindfuckery". According to Maus, he does not think about aesthetic theory when [...] "working over the keyboard, or musing over musical ideas in my head. But when discussing it, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> new thought about this new music. I wouldn't claim that my music is new, but generally speaking pop music begs for some kind of radical new way of talking about it." [...] He also denies any intention for his work to come off as [...] "a sneering take on pop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guns N' Roses headlined the Friday {{night at}} Reading Festival 2010 and closed Leeds Festival two days later. Guns N' Roses was 58 minutes late {{coming on to}} the stage, and because of a curfew issued by Reading Council the band's set ended at midnight. The band was {{therefore}} not able to complete its set, but nevertheless attempted to play [...] "Paradise City" [...] without amplification while the audience sang along. Rose orchestrated fan frustration toward the organizers, telling fans that the group would not play at the Leeds Festival. However, two days later the band played the final night of the Leeds Festival, coming onto stage 30 minutes late, and cutting part of the encore, with Rose stating to the crowd, [...] "We come here to play for you but the cops and the promoters wanna fuck us in the ass. We would like to play a few more songs for you but we'll just play one." [...] During a concert on September 1, in Dublin, the band was over an hour late arriving on stage. Rose stopped the band {{in the middle of}} the second song, [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] after multiple bottles were thrown on stage, warning the crowd [...] "One more bottle and we go home. It's up to you. We would like to stay. We want to stay. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> fun." [...] After another bottle was thrown, the band left the stage during the fourth song of the set. The band returned to the stage an hour later to finish the show.|$|E

He is too old,--too much worn out to be capable of {{managing}} things; and the people there were, of course, robbing him. I think I have put a stop to that." ...|$|R

They desire to teach their ward Nanette (Bernice Claire) to be a respectable young lady; she, in turn, has an untapped wild side. Nanette <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> fun in Atlantic City, while she is being pursued by Tom Trainor (Alexander Gray).|$|R
6000|$|... "For a {{good many}} years," [...] he said, {{lowering}} his voice a little, [...] "I have worked hard and done all I could to be successful. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sort of a position to offer. I am a Cabinet Minister now, and although I don't suppose we can last much longer this time, I shall have a place whenever we are in again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Billow is out, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> {{talk with}} you alone, Mr. Billow," [...] she said quietly, sitting down {{opposite}} to the old man.|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt, sir; but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> {{means of}} defence, when I {{get across the}} stream. Some of the enemy may be lurking there, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I warrant," [...] {{he said to}} her one evening, [...] "you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> man-body to {{take care}} of you the way I take care of Elspeth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I've {{frightened him}} to death," [...] said Bowser, talking to himself. [...] "I didn't {{mean to do}} that. I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> fun with him." [...] With that, Bowser took one more sniff and then trotted off {{to try to find}} {{something}} more exciting. You see, he hadn't had the least intention in the world of really hurting Grandfather Frog.|$|R
2500|$|... "When {{we did the}} 'Music' video, it was a weird time. She was {{pregnant}} and we didn't <b>want</b> her <b>to</b> look pregnant – so we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work around that. We <b>had</b> an idea <b>to</b> do a fun party video with her and her girls, {{make it a little}} bling and cowboy hats and all that. We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> comedy in there and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do some animation." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sober talk,' said Jonas; 'I want {{to prevent}} any mistakes, you know, and to put {{everything}} upon a pleasant understanding. That's desirable and proper, ain't it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> serious {{conversation}} with you, {{if you have}} time," [...] she said, {{coming out of a}} brown study, as if she had not heard his question.|$|E

5000|$|In 1984 {{they played}} their first {{official}} {{show in a}} club [...] "Remont" [...] in Warsaw. They also performed at the Jarocin Festival, and they were well received by the audience. In October 1984, after a huge show with TZN Xenna and Youth Brigade, Budzynski left the band (he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> influence on the band's music and lyrics, but Adamski wasn't happy about that). With that line-up they played only 6 shows. After that Budzynski formed a band called Armia (with Robert Brylewski).|$|R

50|$|Lucy and William quarreled {{over other}} matters, {{particularly}} about {{the running of}} the household. William wanted a patriarchal household, while Lucy <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> say over household matters. The two disagreed on whose power reigned over the various parts of the estate, and their arguments were often heated. Lucy refused to conform to the traditional role of the submissive wife and wished to assert her authority over enslaved people in their household. William often rebuked her in front of others when she acted upon this inclination, undermining her authority.|$|R
6000|$|... "For being {{companion}} to some {{lady in the}} decline of life, who would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> nice mannered person always with her. You {{have the advantage of}} being ladylike and gentle, and I think that you are patient by disposition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Through the door,' said Quilp {{pointing}} {{over his}} shoulder with his thumb. 'I'm not quite small enough to get through key-holes. I wish I was.

50|$|After {{having found}} all the sheets of notes, Zakk and Brodie {{go to the}} school {{building}} since they know there are amplifiers which allow them to play the hymn backwards.

Zakk tells Brodie he is not interested in Medina but simply <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> fun <b>to</b> which Brodie responds with a punch to Zakk's face. A fight ensues between the two, which Zakk manages to win. He then decides to leave town.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're {{too much}} for me," [...] Carol sighed to Kennicott. [...] "I've been {{thinking}} about getting up an annual Community Day, when the whole town would forget feuds {{and go out and}} have sports and a picnic and a dance.

That's just the stilted sort of thing I've tried to avoid. He asked Vida, and of course she agreed with him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Camilleri says; [...] "I {{remember}} playing {{birthday parties}} and weddings, just so I could get {{enough money to}} make a record. We made Sonola for $1300. I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sort of documentation that we existed. We did the artwork and screen-printed the covers. We’d put the covers on the line, one side only, {{waiting for them to}} dry, so we could do the other side.They’re the things you cherish, waiting for the record to be pressed and then having a lounge-room full of records and freaking out because you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get rid of them." ...|$|R
