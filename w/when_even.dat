5|$|Dhumavati is {{a manifestation}} of the anti-social and inauspicious {{elements}} in women and is an antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, <b>when</b> <b>even</b> solar light is obscured by the evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness rules and the soul loses its usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.|$|E
5|$|To resolve {{prolonged}} deadlocks in papal {{elections in}} the earlier years, local authorities often resorted to the forced seclusion of the cardinal electors, such as first {{in the city of}} Rome in 1241, and possibly before that in Perugia in 1216. In 1269, when the forced seclusion of the cardinals alone failed to produce a pope, the city of Viterbo refused to send in any materials except bread and water. <b>When</b> <b>even</b> this failed to produce a result, the townspeople removed the roof of the Palazzo dei Papi in their attempt to speed up the election.|$|E
5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, to lighten it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. <b>When</b> <b>even</b> that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E

5|$|The {{weight of}} an apothecaries' pound ranged {{generally}} between 300g and 320g, {{slightly less than}} that of a pound in the Roman Empire. An important exception to this rule is that the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was under rule of the Habsburg monarchy 1814–1859 and therefore had the extremely large Habsburg apothecaries' pound of 420g. (See below under Habsburg standard.) E.g. in the large city of Milan the apothecaries' system based on a pound of 326.8g was officially replaced by the metric system as early as 1803, because Milan was part of the Napoleonic Italian Republic. Since the successor of this little state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, fell to Habsburg in 1814 (at a time <b>when</b> <b>even</b> in France the système usuel had been introduced because the metric system was not accepted by the population), an apothecaries' system was officially introduced again, but now based on the Habsburg apothecaries' pound, which weighed almost 30% more.|$|E
25|$|Obstructed labour, {{also known}} as labor dystocia, is <b>when,</b> <b>even</b> though the uterus is {{contracting}} normally, the baby does not exit the pelvis during childbirth due to being physically blocked.

25|$|Cham Albanians {{claim the}} {{returning}} of the Greek citizenship, {{as a first}} phase in order to resolve the Cham issue. They are reported not to have as a primary issue the regaining of the properties, but the citizenship, because this is seen by Chams {{as an excuse for}} their suffering. They argue that the remove of their citizenship was a collective punishment, <b>when</b> <b>even</b> the Greek courts have charged only a minority of Chams for alleged crimes. They have asked the Greek government to have a dual citizenship, a policy followed by Greece {{in the case of the}} Greek minority in Albania.|$|E
25|$|From a {{political}} perspective, Kemalism is anti-clerical {{in that it}} seeks to prevent religious influence on the democratic process, which was a problem even in the largely secular politics of the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire, <b>when</b> <b>even</b> non-religiously affiliated political parties like the Committee of Union and Progress and the Freedom and Accord Party feuded over matters such as the Islamic piety of their candidates in the Ottoman elections of 1912. Thus, in the Kemalist political perspective, politicians cannot {{claim to be the}} protector of any religion or religious sect, and such claims constitute sufficient legal grounds for the permanent banning of political parties.|$|E

25|$|The {{subtropical}} species needs {{a climate}} without frost and with little wind. High winds reduce the humidity, dehydrate the flowers, and affect pollination. <b>When</b> <b>even</b> a mild frost occurs, premature fruit drop may occur, although the 'Hass' cultivar can tolerate temperatures down to −1°C. The trees also need well-aerated soils, ideally more than 1 m deep. Yield is reduced when the irrigation water is highly saline. These {{soil and climate conditions}} {{are available in}} southern and eastern Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Crete, the Levant, South Africa, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, parts of central and northern Chile, Vietnam, Indonesia, parts of southern India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, California, Arizona, Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida, Hawaii, Ecuador, and Rwanda. Each region has different cultivars.|$|E
25|$|After {{somewhat}} {{more than a}} year, on 21 February 2013 CBI arrested Gujarat IPS officer G. L. Singhal who was then Assistant Commissioner of the Police Crime Branch {{at the time of}} the incident, in connection with the alleged fake encounter. The CBI in its FIR alleged that Singhal, now Superintendent of Police at State Crime Records Bureau played an active role in the encounter which was later found to be fake by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the Gujarat High Court. Besides Singhal, CBI had previously arrested senior police officers, Tarun Barot, J. G. Parmar, N. K. Amin, Bharat Patel and Anaju Chaudhary. Though <b>when,</b> <b>even</b> after the mandatory 90 days CBI didn't file their chargesheet in the case, all the accused were released on bail, except Amin. A CBI court, issued an arrest warrant for another accused Additional DGP (Crime) P. P. Pandey, who is absconding, though he has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court to get the FIR cancelled.|$|E

Before development began, <b>when</b> <b>even</b> {{the name of the}} game was undecided, the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller said they wanted a [...] "natural flow" [...] from the first game to the sequel. As Myst proved to be a popular and commercial success, the two developers were able to expand their four-person team to a much larger crew of designers, artists, programmers, and sound designers. Development spanned more than four years, and was a much larger undertaking than for the first game; Riven had a budget of between US$5and $10million, more than ten times the cost of developing Myst.|$|E
500|$|Helheim {{was another}} major {{pioneer in the}} early scene. Helheim emerged on the scene before other bands such as Einherjer and Thyrfing, <b>when</b> <b>even</b> Enslaved was in its infancy. Not only was Helheim {{one of the first}} bands to meld black metal with Viking themed-music, but {{one of the first to}} include stylistically {{unconventional}} instruments such as horns and violins. Robert Müller of Metal Hammer Germany argues that Viking metal never solidified as a genre, and attributes this to Jormundgand, Helheim's 1995 debut album. Jormundgand included an ambitious track – [...] "Galder" [...] – but that song was considered incompatible with metal, and audiences, looking for a specific musical style, merged with the pagan metal scene, which had no particular [...] "Viking" [...] identity.|$|E

500|$|To combat falling {{revenue from}} oil sales, in 1982 Saudi Arabia pressed OPEC for audited {{national}} production quotas {{in an attempt}} to limit output and boost prices. When other OPEC nations failed to comply, Saudi Arabia first slashed its own production from 10million barrels daily in 1979–1981 to just one-third of that level in 1985. <b>When</b> <b>even</b> this proved ineffective, Saudi Arabia reversed course and flooded the market with cheap oil, causing prices to fall below US$10/bbl and higher-cost producers to become unprofitable. Faced with increasing economic hardship (which ultimately contributed to the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989), the [...] "free-riding" [...] oil exporters that had previously failed to comply with OPEC agreements finally began to limit production to shore up prices, based on painstakingly negotiated national quotas that sought to balance oil-related and economic criteria since 1986. (Within their sovereign-controlled territories, the national governments of OPEC members are able to impose production limits on both government-owned and private oil companies.) Generally when OPEC production targets are reduced, oil prices increase.|$|E

500|$|A [...] {{is a type}} {{of fruit}} that, when eaten, confers a power to the consumer.

As well as real-life animals, some Zoan fruits allow the user to transform into mythical creatures. [...] fruits give control over, and allow the user [...] "to change their living body structure into the powers of nature". [...] is a category of fruits that give the user superhuman abilities. Devil Fruits are said to be incarnations of the sea devil himself, and as a result, Devil Fruit users cannot swim in sea water, as [...] "they are hated by the sea". Sea-prism stone also has this effect. <b>When</b> <b>even</b> partially submerged in sea water, they lose all their strength and coordination, although some abilities remain. For example, Luffy is still [...] able to stretch after being totally submerged. Moving water, such as rain or waves, does not have this effect. When a Devil Fruit user dies, the powers will be reincarnated into a new Devil Fruit. Devil Fruit powers can be in a stage called [...] "Awakened", where the user can turn anything around them, besides their own bodies, into what their Devil Fruit power is.|$|E
