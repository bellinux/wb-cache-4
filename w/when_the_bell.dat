5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} {{scheduled a}} public celebration with free {{food and drink}} for the testing of the recast bell. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> was struck, it did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked by the crowd, Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away and again recast it. When {{the fruit of the}} two founders' renewed efforts was brought forth in June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The bell was hung in the steeple of the State House the same month.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is that it happened <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack in the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys had been invited to ring the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E
5|$|The tower has {{numerous}} put-log holes, and {{is supported}} on four massive columns and surmounted by a nineteenth century low octagonal broached short slated recessed slated spire with fish-scale slates and weathercock. There are nineteenth century louvred paired cusped bell-lights and a corbelled embattled parapet. The tower contains a fine peal of bells, with {{the oldest of}} the original set of six being cast in 1749 by Rudhall bell foundry. Two were added in 1886, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> chamber was renovated. Two more were added to mark the new millennium in 2000, when some of the others were recast or tuned. The work was completed by Spring 2001. The tower presents one of the more noticeable views in Aberystwyth. It also contains a south side clock dated 1859.|$|E
5|$|Under the symbiote's influence, Peter exposes rival {{photographer}} Eddie Brock, whose fake photos depicted Spider-Man as a criminal. Soon afterward, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to {{the nightclub}} where Mary Jane now works, but Gwen catches on and leaves. Peter brawls with the bouncers and, after accidentally hurting Mary Jane, {{he realizes that}} the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church bell tower, he discovers that he cannot remove the suit, but that the symbiote weakens <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> rings. Peter is able to remove the symbiote, and it falls to the lower tower, landing on Brock, who had been praying for Peter's death. The symbiote bonds to Brock, transforming him into Venom. Brock locates Marko and convinces him to join forces to defeat Peter. Brock hijacks a taxi with Mary Jane on board, and hangs it as bait from a web above a construction site, while Marko keeps the police at bay. Peter seeks Harry's help, but is rejected. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry learns the truth about his father's death from his butler, and goes to help Peter as he is being overpowered, resulting in a battle between the four. Harry subdues the Sandman before assisting Peter against Brock. In the ensuing battle, Brock attempts to impale Peter on Harry's glider, but Harry intervenes and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening Venom, and allowing Peter to separate Brock and the symbiote. Peter activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's glider to destroy the symbiote, but Brock dives in, and the bomb kills them both.|$|E

25|$|Malleting {{involves}} {{using one}} of several types of rubber, plastic, or yarn-wrapped mallet to strike the casting of the bell.

Suspended malleting can be employed to create a bell tree which allows many bells to be played by one ringer.|$|E
