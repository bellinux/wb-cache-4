500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2001–02 season, he had an {{unsuccessful}} trial with Cambridge United. He was then set to sign for Northampton Town, however, Kevin Wilson was sacked and the club's plans to sign the defender were halted. Stuart eventually joined Bury in October 2001 on a short-term contract, which was later extended to a two-and-a-half-year deal in February 2002. He made his debut for the club in the 1–0 away win at Hartlepool United in the Football League Trophy on 16 October 2001. He was sent-off in his third game for Bury in the 5–1 defeat to Brentford. Stuart scored his only goal for Bury on 22 December 2001, in the 1–1 draw at home to Blackpool. Bury went 1–0 down in the first-half, before Stuart equalised in the 53rd minute, with a shot that went in off the post. During his 18-month spell with Bury, Stuart was a first-team regular, making 61 appearances in the Third Division, scoring once. Bury finished seventh in the league during the 2002–03 season, qualifying for the play-offs. He also gained a total of four red cards and four yellows in the 18-months he was with Bury, including a red card in the 2002–03 play-off semi-final first leg against Bournemouth. Stuart was allegedly elbowed in the face by Wade Elliott, which resulted in his nose being broken and Stuart reacting by grabbing Elliott's shirt. Referee, Jeff Winter, adjudged Stuart had thrown a punch, whilst Andy Preece criticised Stuart for raising his arms to another player, defended him saying [...] "I can't see why he thinks Jamie has punched him in the face...the explanation from the ref doesn't add up with <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> the video." ...|$|E

5000|$|Byrkit added, [...] "...instead {{of having}} a script, each actor was given a page of notes each day with their back story or sort of {{motivation}} for the night.

40|$|The {{purpose for}} the Architectural Reflection design is for growth, experimentation, and precision; while {{combining}} elements of math, problem solving, and technical skill.

This design exudes modernism and innovation {{similar to that of the}} Gherkin during its time. The coat made of reflective material not only visually reads as architectural, but also includes safety elements similar to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> may <b>see</b> <b>on</b> a construction site of a building. 3 M Scotchlite reflective material reads as a metallic silver in the daylight, however, in dim or direct light, it shows as a white glowing reflection.

Portions of the life-size building and fire escape were constructed on the Universal Studios back lot.

What I'm doing is theatre, and only theatre... <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> stage isn't sinister. It's pure clown. I'm using myself as a canvas and trying to paint the truth of our time on it. The white face, the baggy pants - they're Pierrot, the eternal clown putting over the great sadness." [...] In 1977 (after retiring the Duke), Bowie stated that [...] "I have made my two or three glib, theatrical observations on English society and the only thing I can now counter with is to state that I am NOT a Fascist".|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rachel Browne of The Sun-Herald, Fisher spoke of her success and experiences on the show. [...] "I would be stupid {{to let it go}} to my head because it could all end tomorrow and I would just fade back into obscurity." [...] She added: [...] "I like working on Home And Away but it's a heavy workload so I get stressed out a lot, We work about 15 hours a day, including {{the time it takes to}} learn lines. [...] "I know a lot of people work those sort of hours but I think we really feel it because most of us are young and fairly inexperienced. I don't have a life, really. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> the screen is what I do. But I am very grateful because it is good experience.

In October 2009, Typotheque, was the first type foundry to license its entire font collection for as webfonts. “Web fonts, as a concept, have existed for about fifteen years.
