poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were

looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way

You figure, the snake hasnt bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor".

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{benefits}} Cue: While agroforestry, as a science, is quite new, in fact farmers have been enjoying the benefits of having trees on their farms for generations. Some trees, for example, produce nutrient-rich leaves which, when they fall on the soil, act as a natural fertilizer. In the lakeshore areas of Malawi, Faidherbia albida trees, known locally as msangu, are often left by farmers, who recognise the fertility benefit they give. But agroforestry {{is about more than}} just increasing soil fertility. Carefully chosen trees and shrubs, if planted on farms, can provide a huge range of benefits, from building materials to insecticides. Excello Zidana recently spoke to Dr Henry Phombeya, Project Co-ordinator for Malawi?s Land Resource Centre, about the many advantages of having trees on farms. IN:		?There are several and normally I like dividing them. ? OUT:		?. agroforestry really can help to boast crop yields. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 29 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Henry Phombeya of Malawi?s Land Resource Centre, talking to Excello Zidana. Transcript Phombeya	There are several and normally I like dividing them in two categories. We?ve got some technologies that are dealing with soil fertility improvement and for these we use shrubs like Tephrosia vogelii, Sesbania sesban, and trees like Faidherbia albida locally known as msangu or mtete. And then there are some technologies that are to do more with afforestation. And here we have trees like the Sennas, Senna spectabilis, Senna siamea. Zidana		What are the other forms of agroforestry that you have been using or that you know? Phombeya	There are other forms yes of agroforestry technologies. For example we can talk of biomass transfer. These are instances where you?ve got trees that are planted say as boundaries around your farm. You can at times prune the branches, take the biomass that you realise from there and apply it to your field. That {{has proved to be a}} very important technology and crops have improved under such systems. And then when you get the leaves like that you have the branches and of course the tree you can use for fuel wood. So you have got two benefits here. Not even two, three. You are improving soil fertility, you have the trees that are demarcating your boundaries to avoid conflict with your neighbours and then you?ve got the fuel wood which is a very important factor now that there is rampant deforestation. Zidana	When we look around in the villages in Malawi we have discovered that a number of farmers have taken up the technology of using Tephrosia vogelii. What are the specific advantages regarding this shrub? Phombeya	Tephrosia it?s a very important shrub in that first and foremost it has got a very good biomass that when we incorporate in the soil it helps to build up organic matter. And at the same time it?s a legume, it fixes nitrogen. That?s contributing to soil fertility. But up and above that Tephrosia vogelii has got some insecticidal properties. If you crush the leaves of Tephrosia vogelii and you?ve got maize stalk borer, you put it in the maize funnel the maize stalk borer goes away. So it has got that insecticidal property that is a very important component. Zidana	You also talked about the tree which is locally known as msangu in Malawi. Phombeya	Faidherbia albida, that is the scientific name. Zidana	Faidherbia albida. Now if we talk about the lake shore areas, these trees are numerous, they are all over. Do the farmers realise the importance of retaining or keeping these trees? Phombeya	Yes I did research on Faidherbia albida specifically. And in the survey that we conducted it showed that people value these trees and they deliberately leave them on their farms. And asking them about why they leave them there their answers were, if you plant maize underneath a Faidherbia albida tree it does very well and you?ve got a variety of crops that can be grown underneath it. So in a way they know it?s an important tree. Zidana	So they are convinced that if you are using these trees definitely the fertility of the soil may be improved in one way or the other? Phombeya	Yes, they are aware of that, only that they don?t know exactly what happens for that fertility to come about and that?s the work of the scientist. Zidana	You have been talking about the trees like Leucaena but now <b>we</b> <b>haven?t</b> seen you doing much on the Leucaena. Is there any problem? Phombeya	Yes Leucaena leucocephala was a very important tree in those old days when agroforestry just came into the picture. But as we were working with it a terrible pest attacked it. That pest is called psyllid; it?s a pest that attacks the leaves, the tender leaves of Leucaena and it devastates the whole tree. A very dangerous pest. Zidana	But the animals enjoyed consuming or eating the leaves from the Leucaena tree? Phombeya	It was a very good fodder, highly nutritive. But all is not lost because breeders are looking at other species of Leucaena, like Leucaena pallida, Leucaena esculenta. They are looking at Leucaena that have resistance to psyllid attack. Zidana		How do you look at farming if many people adopted this concept? Phombeya	If people adopted agroforestry, like others have already done, productivity of their farms will be very high. We compared fields where we had just maize growing on its own and a plot where we had maize and then the agroforestry species and a bit of chemical fertiliser. The differences in yields were just too high, over 200 %. So agroforestry really can help to boost crop yields. End of track.

40|$|Sweet potato Cue: Sweet {{potatoes}} {{have a lot}} of enemies. Pests {{and diseases}} can be extremely destructive, causing huge losses if not controlled. Weeds are not usually regarded as such as serious problem, although if allowed to grow unchecked, can reduce final harvests by more than half. One advantage sweet potatoes have over other root crops, such as yams and cassava, is that their stems and leaves spread quickly, shading the soil and preventing weed growth. The most important time for weeding, therefore, is early {{in the life of the}} crop, when the soil around the plants is bare. To find out more about when, and how to weed, Patrick Mphaka visited a crop research centre close to the city of Blantyre in Malawi, where new types, or cultivars of sweet potato are being developed. IN:		?Sweet potato is increasingly becoming ? OUT:		?are acceptable to the end-users. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 05 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr. Thumbiko Mkandawire of Bvumbwe Agricultural Research Station in Malawi. Transcript Mphaka	Sweet potato is increasingly becoming an important crop in Malawi and the region. This is so because of its drought resistant characteristic in the face of the current unreliable rains which continuously affect the production of other crops such as maize. To revamp the growing of the crop, Bvumbwe Agricultural Research Station Root Crop Commodity Team has been doing some research on various Sweet Potato varieties. One of the important aspects of any crop is weed control. To find out how weeds can effectively be controlled in Sweet potatoes, I had a chat with Mr Thumbiko Mkandawire, an Agricultural Research Scientist of the Root Crop Commodity Team. I caught up with him in a plot of sweet potatoes. Thumbiko	In here we have got different varieties of sweet potato. Some are the released varieties, some are still under experimentation. Some are very promising compared to the local varieties. Mphaka	Could we focus on weed control, how do you control the weeds in here? Thumbiko	In here, normally once we have started irrigating the crops or using the rain fed, weeds start to emerge. Most of the times, weeds tend to grow faster than the clones. So in the first place we use the hoe, then later on we use the hand weeding because if we tend to use the hoe, we may end up cutting the vines hence in the end, we may predispose the vines to the disease-causing organisms. Hence we end up losing the varieties. Mphaka	What you have just said, is it something which the farmers do practise or its something which they have not been practising but it?s something which you tell them to be practising because of the advantages you have just outlined? Thumbiko	Farmers are very knowledgeable. If you go to their fields you will find that two to three weeks after planting, if they have observed that the weeds are growing faster than the desired crop, you will find that farmers will take a hoe and weed, and remove the weeds. Once the plant has developed fully, and it has started putting up some of the roots into the soil, the farmers normally they do not use a hoe. They use the hands because they are running away from predisposing the crop from the disease-causing organisms as well as the soil insects. Mphaka	Now, what would you say is commonly practised: as you have done growing just sweet potatoes on a piece of land, or inter-cropping? Thumbiko	In other areas, the farmers do intercrop with other crops, but in other areas, the farmers they just grow one particular field with sweet potatoes as you know that in Malawi we have got a problem of land especially in the Southern Region. Therefore the farmers normally do portion a piece of land to a specific crop. Mphaka	If you look at the two scenarios, which area becomes more problematic when it comes to weeds? Thumbiko:	This one depends on how knowledgeable the farmer is. But in most cases in terms of labour use and minimisation of labour costs to the farmers, they tend to intercrop the sweet potato with other crops. But at times it might bring about competition for nutrients and other aspects, hence in the end, you may find that there might be a reduction in the yield in both crops. But if the crop can be grown in pure state, you find that yield returns tend to be higher than in the intercrop. Mphaka	We have noticed that some of the farmers start growing their sweet potatoes towards the end of the rainy season, while others, at the same time as they are growing the maize. Now, if you look at the two methods, which one is correct, and which one would control the weeds much better? Thumbiko	The first one is a better approach in weed control management than the delayed one, because you will be able to control the weeds before they flower; you end up reducing their mechanism for multiplication in terms for seed production. And at the same time you may end up getting a lot of yield returns than if you delay in planting because even though the sweet potatoes are drought tolerant crops, but also they do require a lot of moisture for their growth and development so they should be able to put up a lot of bigger roots. But if they delay in planting, that means they will be losing some vegetative growth hence in the end they may end up having lower returns. Mphaka	There is a lot of development nowadays and you can use chemicals to control weeds. How far have we gone in that area in Malawi? Thumbiko	As far as I know, <b>we</b> <b>haven?t</b> yet come up with that research because our research focuses on the smallholder farmers, and we know that smallholder farmers, most of them they are resource poor, and if you develop that technology, the rate of adoption will not be as high as expected. Therefore, our main focus of attention in terms of research development is towards developing technologies that will be easily adopted, and appropriate to the targeted group, in this case the smallholder farmers. That is why the main focus of our research in terms of root crop development in Malawi, is to develop cultivars that are disease resistant to major diseases and pests, and also, developing the cultivars that tend to produce or give more yields, and at the same time, varieties that are acceptable to the end-users.
