5|$|Breckinridge {{arrived in}} Princeton, New Jersey, in late December 1805. He had {{completed}} his final exams by April 5, {{but he declined}} his father's offer to come to Washington because he needed {{to catch up on}} his studies in arithmetic. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> term began in May, he joined the American Whig–Cliosophic Society, a debating society founded by James Madison, Philip Freneau, Aaron Burr, and Henry Lee in 1769.|$|E
5|$|Burton and Roosevelt had a {{complicated}} history. Burton, {{as a leader}} at the 1900 Republican National Convention, was perhaps instrumental in Roosevelt's securing his party's nomination. Roosevelt's last appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (whose jurisdiction, at the time, included appeals from Kansas) had been William Cather Hook, a choice favored by Burton's political opponents: Senator Chester I. Long (R-KS) and Governor Willis J. Bailey (R-KS). <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> vacancy opened on the Eighth Circuit, Burton and his allies favored the appointment of Charles Blood Smith. D.W. Mulvane was unsuccessful in pressing Smith's candidacy in a June 1903 meeting with Roosevelt.|$|E

The station, excluding its water tower and restaurant, cost 117,062 Norwegian krone (NOK) to build and took 26,883 man-hours. The station and axillary buildings were designed by Gudmund Hoel of NSB Arkitektkontor. The station opened with {{the first part of}} the Rauma Line on 19 November 1921. It remained the terminus until 25 November 1923, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> section, to Verma Station, opened.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian was in Antioch in {{the autumn}} of 302, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{instance}} of persecution occurred. The deacon Romanus visited a court while preliminary sacrifices were taking place and interrupted the ceremonies, denouncing the act in a loud voice. He was arrested and sentenced to be set aflame, but Diocletian overruled the decision, and decided that Romanus should have his tongue removed instead. Romanus would be executed on November 18, 303. The boldness of this Christian displeased Diocletian, and he left the city and made for Nicomedia to spend the winter, accompanied by Galerius.|$|E

The stations and the visual profile of {{the system as a}} whole are designed by the Bergen-based design groups Cubus and Fuggi Baggi Design, and Copenhagen-based Kontrapunkt. The stations of the first two stages are at street level, with facilities for buying tickets and dynamic displays that show <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> tram will arrive. The platforms have step-free access to the trams, allowing unhindered accessibility by wheelchairs and perambulators.|$|E

Davidson was regarded as the main factor in Australia's 2–1 series win. He ended the first-class season with 551 runs at 55.10 and 45 wickets at 20.62. These efforts led him to retain the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowlers ranking for 1961 (which he obtained in the previous year).|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 2009, the Government {{announced}} that it would refine the size and number of GRCs. This could be achieved without amending either the Constitution or the Parliamentary Elections Act. Instead, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> EBRC was appointed, its terms of reference would instruct the Committee to plan for fewer six-member GRCs than at present, and to reduce the average size of each GRC. The average size of GRCs at that time was 5.4 MPs because there were only five-member and six-member GRCs. The new average, however, would not exceed five MPs.|$|E

5|$|Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, {{during which}} he served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson. The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis for the days when they were in session, was unpopular with the voters of his district. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House in the next election.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the service, {{lifeboat}} launch and recovery was usually undertaken by women. There were deeply-held views about women actually crewing the boats themselves – it was considered extremely bad luck. Along all parts part of the coastline, women supported their men on the lifeboat crews by working together to get the lifeboat afloat and then later recovering it from the water in readiness for <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> call came. While lifeboat crew are still predominantly male (92%), the first female (inshore) crew member was Elizabeth Hostvedt in 1969, and Frances Glody was the first woman crew member on an all-weather lifeboat, at Dunmore East Lifeboat Station, in 1981. Lauren McGuire, at the age of 27, became the RNLI's youngest station manager in 2011, at Clovelly, Devon.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E

The business loop was extended along Walton Road in 1992 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> segment of the US31 freeway opened in Berrien County. The highway was truncated to a spur route in 1998 when M-51 was extended southward.

5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home from}} the {{legislative}} session, Breckinridge made daily visits with Henry Clay, who lay dying in Lexington, and was chosen to deliver his eulogy in Congress <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> session commenced. The eulogy enhanced his popularity and solidified his position as Clay's political heir apparent. He also campaigned for the election of Democrat Franklin Pierce as president. Although Pierce lost Kentucky by 3,200 votes, Breckinridge wielded more influence with him than he had with outgoing Whig President Millard Fillmore. A week after his inauguration, Pierce offered Breckinridge an appointment as governor of Washington Territory. He had initially sought the appointment, securing letters of recommendation from Powell and Butler, {{but by the time}} it was offered, he had decided to stay in Kentucky and seek re-election to the House.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in the Mediterranean, Lyster {{proposed}} a carrier airstrike on the Italian fleet at its base in Taranto, as the Royal Navy had been planning since the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935, and Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, approved the idea by 22 September 1940. The attack, with both available carriers, was originally planned for 21 October, {{the anniversary of the}} Battle of Trafalgar, but a hangar fire aboard Illustrious on 18 October forced its postponement until 11 November <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> favourable phase of the moon occurred.
