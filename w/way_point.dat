This is attested by the increased similarity of later occupation deposits containing pottery similar in character to Manyikeni. In addition, this is corroborated {{by the presence of}} marine shell and imports from Indian ocean trade in the context of Manyikeni deposits suggesting the coast and hinterlands were connected through trade networks. Chibuene acted as the <b>way</b> <b>point</b> for entry of materials and resources from the eastern coast and the trade network it provided.|$|E
25|$|By 1384, at {{the half}} <b>way</b> <b>point</b> of his 32-year reign, Swa had {{successfully}} consolidated his rule over Upper Burma. He faced no immediate internal or external threats. Lan Na and Arakan, were never a threat to Ava. In the south, King Binnya U of Pegu had died and his teenage son Razadarit was facing two major rebellions. Swa's main concern remained in the north, despite the uneasy truce that had held since 1373. He followed the developments in Yunnan where the Chinese Ming dynasty had been reestablishing Beijing's authority since 1380, and pressuring Shan migrations towards the Irrawaddy valley. According to Ming records, Swa asked China for a joint operation against the border Shan states but Burmese chronicles make no mention of such a request.|$|E

40|$|There are two {{frequent}} {{artifacts in}} crowd simulation caused by navigation mesh design. The first appears when all agents attempt to traverse the navigation mesh {{and share the}} same <b>way</b> <b>points</b> through portals, thus increasing the probability of collisions with other agents or queues forming around portals. The second is caused by <b>way</b> <b>points</b> being assigned at locations where clearance is not guaranteed, which causes the agents to either walk {{too close to the}} static geometry, slide along walls or get stuck. To overcome this we use the full length of the portal and propose a novel method for dynamically calculating <b>way</b> <b>points</b> based on current trajectory, destination, and clearance, therefore guaranteeing that agents in a crowd will have different <b>way</b> <b>points</b> assigned. To achieve collision free paths we propose two novel techniques: the first provides the computation of paths with clearance for cells of any shape (even with concavities) and the second presents a new method for calculating portals with clearance, so that the dynamically assigned <b>way</b> <b>points</b> will always guarantee collision free paths relative to the static geometry. In this paper, we extend our previous work by describing {{a new version of the}} algorithm that is suitable for a larger number of navigation meshes, while further improving performance. Our results show how the combination of portals with exact clearance and dynamic <b>way</b> <b>points</b> improve local movement by reducing the number of collision between agents and the static geometry. We evaluate our algorithm with a variety of scenarios and compare our results with traditional <b>way</b> <b>points</b> to show that our technique also offers better use of the space by the agents.

By mid-1900, the supplies that were located at Elands River included over 1,500 horses, mules or cattle, a quantity of ammunition, food and other equipment worth over 100,000 pounds, and over 100 wagons. As the supplies were vulnerable to Boer raids, a garrison, spread across several positions, had been established.|$|E
