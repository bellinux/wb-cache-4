When listening conditions are difficult, speakers can help listeners by deliberately speaking more clearly.

2500|$|There is some {{dispute over}} the phonemicity of soft velar consonants.

2500|$|Despite {{the large}} role that {{statistical}} learning appears {{to play in}} lexical acquisition, it is likely not the only mechanism by which infants learn to segment words.

40|$|For {{both human}} and {{automatic}} speech recognizers {{it is difficult to}} segment continuous speech into discrete units such as words. Word segmentation is so hard because there seem to be no self-evident cues for <b>word</b> <b>boundaries</b> in the speech stream.

5000|$|Sandhi (Sanskrit: [...] "joining") is a cover {{term for}} a wide variety of phonological {{processes}} that occur at morpheme or <b>word</b> <b>boundaries</b> (thus belonging to morphophonology).

2500|$|Another phonetic {{divergence}} between the Ukrainian and Russian languages is the pronunciation of Cyrillic [...] v/w. While in standard Russian it represents , in many Ukrainian dialects it denotes [...] (following a vowel and preceding a consonant (cluster), either within {{a word or}} at a <b>word</b> <b>boundary,</b> it denotes the allophone , and like the off-glide in the English words [...] "flow" [...] and [...] "cow", it forms a diphthong with the preceding vowel).

2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of Moroccan Darija is the collapse of short vowels. Initially, short [...] and [...] were merged into a phoneme [...] (however, some speakers maintain a difference between [...] and [...] when adjacent to pharyngeal [...] and [...] ). [...] This phoneme was then deleted entirely in most positions; for the most part, it is maintained only in the position /...CəC#/ or /...CəCC#/ (where C represents any consonant and # indicates a <b>word</b> <b>boundary),</b> i.e. when appearing as the last vowel of a word. [...] When [...] is not deleted, it is pronounced as a very short vowel, tending towards [...] {{in the vicinity of}} emphatic consonants, [...] in the vicinity of pharyngeal [...] and [...] (for speakers who have merged /ă/ and [...] in this environment), and [...] elsewhere. [...] Original short [...] usually merges with [...] except in the vicinity of a labial or velar consonant. [...] In positions where [...] was deleted, /ŭ/ was also deleted, and is maintained only as labialization of the adjacent labial or velar consonant; where [...] is maintained, [...] surfaces as [...] This deletion of short vowels can result in long strings of consonants (a feature shared with Amazigh and certainly derived from it). These clusters are never simplified; instead, consonants occurring between other consonants tend to syllabify, according to a sonorance hierarchy. [...] Similarly, and unlike most other Arabic dialects, doubled consonants are never simplified to a single consonant, even when {{at the end of a}} word or preceding another consonant.|$|E

5000|$|Phonetic boundaries: Some {{languages}} have particular {{rules of}} pronunciation {{that make it}} easy to spot where a <b>word</b> <b>boundary</b> should be. For example, in a language that regularly stresses the last syllable of a word, a <b>word</b> <b>boundary</b> is likely to fall after each stressed syllable. Another example can be seen in a language that has vowel harmony (like Turkish): the vowels within a given word share the same quality, so a <b>word</b> <b>boundary</b> is likely to occur whenever the vowel quality changes. Nevertheless, not all languages have such convenient phonetic rules, and even those that do present the occasional exceptions.|$|E
