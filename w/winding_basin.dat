40|$|A primary {{objective}} of the Institute for Energy Research (IER) -Santa Fe Snyder Corporation DOE Riverton Dome project is to test the validity of a new conceptual model and resultant exploration paradigm for so-called ''basin center'' gas accumulations. This paradigm and derivative exploration strategy suggest that {{the two most important}} elements crucial to the development of prospects in the deep, gas-saturated portions of Rocky Mountain Laramide Basins (RMLB) are (1) the determination and, if possible, three-dimensional evaluation of the pressure boundary between normal and anomalous pressure regimes (i. e., this boundary is typically expressed as a significant inversion in both sonic and seismic velocity-depth profiles), and (2) the detection and delineation of porosity/permeability ''sweet spots'' (i. e., areas of enhanced storage capacity and deliverability) in potential reservoir targets below this boundary. There are other critical aspects in searching for basin center gas accumulations, but completion of these two tasks is essential to the successful exploration for the unconventional gas resources present in anomalously pressured rock/fluid systems in the Rocky Mountain Laramide <b>Basins.</b> The southern <b>Wind</b> River <b>Basin,</b> in particular the Riverton Dome and Emigrant areas, is a neat location for testing this exploration paradigm. Preliminary work within the <b>Wind</b> River <b>Basin</b> has demonstrated that there is a regionally prominent pressure surface boundary that can be detected by inversions in sonic velocity depth gradients in individual well log profiles and that {{can be seen as a}} velocity inversion on seismic lines. Also, the <b>Wind</b> River <b>Basin</b> in general [...] and the Riverton Dome area specially [...] is characterized by a significant number of anomalously pressured gas accumulations.

40|$|The Laramide Rocky Mountains {{in western}} U. S. A is an {{important}} topographic feature in the continental interior, yet its formation and evolution are poorly constrained. This study uses the oxygen and strontium isotope geochemistry of freshwater bivalve fossils from six Laramide basins in order to reconstruct the spatial evolution of the paleotopography and Precambrian basement erosion in late Cretaceous-early Eocene. In addition it uses the sedimentology, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, and isotope paleoaltimetry of early Eocene sedimentary strata to constrain the tectonic setting, paleogeography and paleoclimate of the <b>Wind</b> River <b>basin.</b> Annual and seasonal variation in ancient riverwater δ¹⁸O reconstructed from shell fossils shows that the Canadian Rocky Mountains was 4. 5 ± 1. 0 km high in late Cretaceous-early Paleocene, and the Laramide ranges in eastern Wyoming reached 4. 5 ± 1. 3 km high, while the ranges in western Wyoming were 1 - 2 km high in late Paleocene. The ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios of riverwaters reconstructed from the same fossils show that Proterozoic metamorphic carbonates in the Belt-Purcell Supergroup were not exposed in the Canadian Rocky Mountains during Late Cretaceous-early Paleocene, but that Precambrian silicate basement rock was exposed and eroded in the Laramide ranges during late Paleocene-early Eocene. The sedimentary environment of the early Eocene <b>Wind</b> River <b>basin</b> changed from gravelly fluvial and/or stream-dominated alluvial fan to low-sinuosity fluvial systems.
