500|$|On 18 October, The Sun {{reported}} that McGuire {{had left the}} band. At a reception when Ayers Rock returned to Australia, he said: [...] "The pressure of the tour was just too much. We {{were on the road}} all the time and I guess I wasn't as strong {{as the rest of the}} band. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio I had the shakes. I mean I was playing the right notes, but not in the right places." [...] To finish the album McGuire's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts, and American Jeff Castleman played bass on [...] "Catchanemu". Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney. McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975, to warm applause.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{band members}} have also spoken about the {{contributions}} of Dickinson and MacDougall. [...] "Sometimes when new people come in it brings so many positive changes", said Rich. [...] "Adam came in and tried out and everyone was impressed, but when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio everyone's jaws dropped." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The sun turned {{black in}} the middle of the battle; we could still see it over us, or should have thought we had been {{fighting}} till evening. Then <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camp, and there was a great deal of smoke and firing. Afterwards the sun came out bright again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nice {{you call}} that?" [...] said her mother. [...] "All I {{remember}} is <b>the</b> disgrace <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> and <b>the</b> fright I was in! I {{wonder what the}} old home will bring us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A very rowy row. I don't {{mean about}} dollars, for you'll have to manage that just at first. When <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> running, I think I shall have {{something}} to say on that subject too." ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> corral {{the first}} thing that {{happened}} to me was a smack from mother for having stayed away so long; but father praised Jed and me when we gave our report.|$|R
2500|$|... 'Back in {{the early}} '90s, I was really into the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Brothers Johnson, and I loved to slap. But {{it became clear that}} if I slapped with Rage, we'd sound like another Chili Peppers clone band. I wanted to be in a band that sounded unique, so when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> second record, I made the {{decision}} to put the thumb up on the shelf and never use it again. I used to be good, but now I suck at slapping.' ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1966–67 {{season was}} again successful, as Manchester United claimed the league title by four points. Best stated that [...] "if the {{championship}} was decided on home games we would win it every season. This time our away games made the difference. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> right frame of mind." [...] An ever-present all season long, he scored ten goals in 45 games. He then helped the [...] "Red Devils" [...] {{to share the}} Charity Shield with a 3–3 draw with FA Cup winners Tottenham Hotspur; {{it was the first}} game to be broadcast in colour on British television.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the period}} of filming, Murray {{was in the midst}} of marital {{problems}} and several crew reported his attitude as erratic. Murray had wanted to make the film less of a comedy as to make it more contemplative, against Ramis' own direction to keep it as a comedy. Rather than to handle Murray's constant phone calls, Ramis had Murray work with Rubin in New York City directly to adjust the script to satisfy Murray's requests. Actor Stephen Tobolowsky described the script changes: [...] "When I got the part, it was still kind of a mediocre Bill Murray movie," [...] he said. [...] "You know, Bill Murray, with no consequences, in comic situations ... It wasn’t until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shooting that everything turned on its head. And it became not only a good movie, not only a great movie, but a classic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{perhaps you}} had better, Hugh. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> way of {{sleeping}} heavily at Dort, without any night guard or disturbance. I doubt not that these Dutchmen mean us no harm. Still {{it is well}} {{to be on the}} safe side." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{caught sight}} of her once or twice before we left, and each time I noticed my friend look after her. He made no remark, however, until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open air, and were walking arm-in-arm along Princes Street.|$|R
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> fairly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Clyde {{and near}} Glasgow {{the scene was}} wonderful. It was nearly night, and the great fires of the {{factories}} lit up the sky, and we saw on the stocks a great ship being built.|$|R
2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, but {{it seemed like a good}} idea. Carl was standing next to me in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sanders {{voted against}} the resolutions authorizing {{the use of force}} against Iraq in 1991 and 2002, and opposed the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq. He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists that has been cited as the legal justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 attacks. Sanders voted for a non-binding resolution expressing support for troops at the outset of the invasion of Iraq, but gave a floor speech criticizing the partisan nature of the vote and the George W. Bush administration's actions in the run-up to the war. Regarding the investigation of what turned out to be a leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity by a State Department official, Sanders stated: [...] "The revelation that the President authorized the release of classified information in order to discredit an Iraq war critic should tell every member of Congress that the time is now for a serious investigation of how <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> war in Iraq and why Congress can no longer act as a rubber stamp for the President." ...|$|E
60|$|No {{sooner had}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> street than Hunsden {{collared}} me.|$|E
5000|$|Rambus {{said these}} deals {{were part of}} a change in {{strategy}} to a less litigious, more collaborative approach, distancing themselves from accusations of patent trolling. Ronald Black, Rambus’s CEO, said, “Somehow <b>we</b> <b>got</b> thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> patent troll bunch…This is just not the case.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{much care}} and anxiety. The visitation has done its worst in our house. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lull after the storm, {{and you need}} not be anxious about me. There is peace in what I have to do now. It is {{gathering}} the salvage after the wreck." ...|$|R
6000|$|At last <b>we</b> <b>got</b> up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} region of Glen Lynden, {{the place to}} which the Scotch settlers were sent by Government in 1820, {{under the care of}} Thomas Pringle, the [...] "African poet," [...] who, among other pieces, wrote the beautiful poem which begins: ...|$|R
60|$|This storm past, we had fair weather until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Irish Sea.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> barn unperceived, and I {{watched him}} climb {{the ladder to}} the loft. Then I went indoors to tell them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Late! Why it's not yet twelve. I don't {{suppose it}} was eleven when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Square. Anywhere else {{it would have been}} early.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{little man}} {{shook hands with}} me. We began to talk, but, my {{attention}} distracted by my surroundings, I took small notice of him, and after we had each ordered a cocktail we separated. When <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> motor again and were driving away, Winter said to me: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{agreed to}} go, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> a street-car. <b>The</b> Colberts {{lived in one}} of the up-town streets, and Uncle Chipperton had been at their house, on business.|$|R
6000|$|Then father stood up, {{and so did}} I. So did the two men--the {{clerk and}} the {{shorthand}} writer. Father did not say a word till <b>we</b> <b>got</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> street. <b>We</b> walked along, and presently we passed an open gate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fields. He turned back, saying to me: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{car without}} another word. Lord John backed her round {{and turned her}} to the south. To us the chapter seemed closed. Little did we foresee the strange new chapter which was to open.|$|E
6000|$|Harris had a sad {{expression}} on him, so we noticed, when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boat. He {{gave you the}} idea {{of a man who had}} been through trouble. We asked him if anything had happened, and he said— ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And who {{was that}} hidjus manster"--that was the way her Ladyship pronounced,--"that ojous vulgar wretch, with the iron heels to his boots, and the big mouth, and the {{imitation}} goold neck-chain, who steered at us so as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> carriage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good indeed," [...] {{said the}} Senator. [...] "In <b>the</b> States <b>we</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> way yet of using dinner clarets." [...] It {{was as good}} as a play to see the rector wince under the ignominious word. [...] "Your great statesman added much to your {{national}} comfort when he took the duty off the lighter kinds of French wines." ...|$|R
6000|$|Another {{reason why}} we dare not talk of this earth as this hymn does is, that <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> habit of saying, 'Cattle and {{creeping}} things--they are not rational beings. How can they praise God? Clouds and wells--they are not even living things. How can they praise God? Why speak {{of them in a}} hymn; much less speak to them?' ...|$|R
5000|$|How <b>We</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Into</b> Trouble with <b>the</b> Army [...] (Come inguaiammo l&#39;esercito) is a 1965 Italian comedy film {{directed}} by Lucio Fulci. This film was {{also known as}} I Due Marmittoni, or The Two Rookies.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, uncle; but it {{is lucky}} you put the chief in the bows. I should have made a mess of it; for from the time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> waves it seemed nothing but confusion, and though I heard your voice I {{did not seem to}} {{understand}} what you said." ...|$|E
60|$|We rambled for a {{while through}} the covered way, over the glacis and along the counterscarp, {{and listened to the}} guide as he {{detailed}} to us, in already accustomed words, how the siege had gone. Then <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> private apartments of the general, and, having dexterously shaken off our attendant, wandered at large among the deserted rooms.|$|E
6000|$|Here {{spoke the}} born explorer. His eyes sparkled, his face flushed. The farther <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{houseless}} cattle range, the better he liked it. [...] "The best times I've {{ever had in}} my life," [...] he remarked as we were looking away across the plain at the faint shapes of the Spanish Peaks, [...] "was when I was cruising the prairie in a covered wagon." ...|$|E
500|$|The gamble at the icefall succeeded, {{and the men}} {{reached their}} depot two days later. However, they had great {{difficulty}} navigating down the glacier. Lashly wrote: [...] "I cannot describe <b>the</b> maze <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> and <b>the</b> hairbreadth escapes {{we have had to}} pass through." [...] In his attempts to find the way down, Evans removed his goggles and subsequently suffered agonies of snow blindness that made him into a passenger.|$|R
6000|$|... "That shtrame was miles woide! Orth'ris, on the rear-rank log, whispers <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Thames below Sheerness by mistake. 'Kape on shwimmin', ye little blayguard,' sez I, 'an' don't go pokin' your dirty jokes at the Irriwaddy,'--'Silince, men!' sings out the Lift'nint. So we shwum on <b>into</b> <b>the</b> black dhark, wid our chests on the logs, trustin' in the Saints an' {{the luck}} av the British Army.|$|R
60|$|And {{then you}} know, as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic {{this side of}} Cape Verde, the ship began to go to pieces. I don't pretend for one moment to {{understand}} what happened. But I think Greiffenhagen's recent work {{on the effects of}} radium upon ligneous tissue does rather carry out my idea that emanations from quap have rapid rotting effect upon woody fibre.|$|R
