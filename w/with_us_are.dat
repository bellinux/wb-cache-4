"Yes," [...] another said, [...] "there {{would be}} plenty to do, but I would not mind wagering {{that we should}} not wait for him; and after all, I am not sure if it would not be the best thing to do, for these Germans <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> little better than a rabble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Chief," [...] he said, [...] "my friends desire me {{to speak}} with you. We are worn out with our adventures.

60|$|We who are aft, besieged in {{the high}} place, are {{stronger}} in numbers than I dreamed until now, when I have just finished taking the ship's census. Of course Margaret, Mr. Pike, and myself are apart.

6000|$|... "I {{propose that}} we first conduct your sister safely {{to the corner}} of her own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry's <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> <b>Are</b> we ready?

60|$|Ever {{since the}} {{beginning}} of the book we have been neglecting Elspeth so pointedly that were she not the most forgiving creature we should be afraid to face her now.

6000|$|... "Sancho," [...] {{the general}} said; [...] "I know, from what Marina says, {{that you have}} great intelligence, though you have so long been cut off from your own people.
