500|$|In 1999 Hippe became Editor-in-Chief of Økonomisk Rapport (ØR). Hippe openly {{supported}} the Labour Party Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg from mid 2000 in Stoltenberg's first term (17 March 2000 to 19 October 2001). Hippe believed the government needed {{to spend more}} money from the Norwegian oil fund, saying: [...] "The greatest paradox today is that the government refuses to investigate what it will mean to buy goods and services abroad in fear that someone <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the idea of spending more money than we do today. The government plays with the lives of the sick and aggravates children's education because of the dogma that oil money cannot be used". Hippe left his position as Editor-in-Chief in 2002 because the new owners did not share the same future plans for the magazine as he did. He was succeeded by Joachim Bamrud. Six months after Hippe left a number of journalists and most of the old leadership staff had also left the magazine.|$|E

500|$|The {{effect of}} Shelby's advent on Puck evoked the most praise. Benigno called the segment where Puck meets Beth [...] "the best scene {{of this very}} young season", The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg {{said it was a}} [...] "top moment", and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly dubbed it [...] "the sweetest scene of the night". VanDerWerff also called it [...] "very sweet" [...] and {{expressed}} hope that [...] "the show <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> something for him to do after mostly relegating him to weird comic relief last season." [...] The effect of her return on Quinn was greeted with less enthusiasm. Reiter was [...] "not thrilled" [...] by the possibility of a custody battle between Quinn and Shelby and called Quinn's plan [...] "half-baked", and Canning dismissed it as [...] "clichéd drama". Kubicek expressed interest in seeing [...] "where this goes", and VanDerWerff noted that Quinn has been [...] "grieving giving up her child all this time and she didn't even know it", and characterized it as a [...] "fairly powerful storyline".|$|E

[...] The script of the show was created by Jamie King, and was inspired by the concept of the femme fatale and femme fatales throughout the ages. Rudolph stated that the idea for the show was to have Spears as an [...] "international woman of mystery". The setlist was composed mostly of songs from Femme Fatale, but also included hits from her previous albums, as Spears explained, [...] "The fans really like a lot of the old songs, because that's what they are used to. So it's just about finding the balance, and how many songs I wanna incorporate from the past and from the present." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bilingual lexical {{access is}} an area in {{psycholinguistics}} research that studies the activation or retrieval process of the mental lexicon for people who can speak two languages. Bilingual lexical access {{can be understood as}} all aspects of word processing, including all the mental activity from the perception of the word from one language until all its lexical knowledge from the target language is available. Research in this field seeks to fully understand these mental processes. Bilingual individuals have two mental lexical representations for an item or concept and are able to successfully select words from one language without significant interference from the other language. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} whether these dual representations interact or affect one another. Bilingual lexical access researchers focus on the control mechanisms bilinguals use to suppress the language not in use when in a monolingual mode and the degree to which the related representations within the language not in use are activated. [...] For example, when a Dutch-English bilingual is asked to name a picture of a dog in English, he or she <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the English word dog. Bilingual lexical access is the mental process that underlies this seemingly simple task: the process that makes the connection between the [...] "idea" [...] dog and the word dog in the target language. While activating the English word dog, the Dutch word hond (its equivalent in Dutch), is most likely also in a state of activation.|$|E
