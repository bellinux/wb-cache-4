The {{objective of the}} present study was to investigate the development of muscle IL- 15 expression in suckling piglets and in early <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> (day 14) at each level, that is, mRNA, protein, and secretion. Eight litters (eight piglets per litter) of newborn healthy piglets (Large × White × Landrace) with a similar initial weight (1618. 0  ±  140. 1 g) were chosen and divided into two groups. Group one used suckling piglets that were killed, respectively, at days 1, 7, 14, 21, and group two used early (day 14) <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> that were killed respectively, at days 15, 17, 19, 21. In group one, IL- 15 gene expression levels increased significantly (P    0. 05) among piglets at other ages. These findings indicated that increased IL- 15 mRNA expression did not result in a corresponding increase of its protein expression. In group two, which used early <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> from days 15 – 19, IL- 15 mRNA and protein expression levels increased constantly (P    0. 05) compared with suckling piglets at day 14 of age.

40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to examine shifts in the {{composition}} of the bacterial population in the intestinal tracts (ITs) of <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> by antibiotic treatment using high-throughput sequencing. Methods Sixty 28 -d-old <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> were randomly divided into two treatment groups. The Control group was treated with a basal diet without antibiotics. The Antibiotic group’s basal diet contained colistin sulfate at a concentration of 20 g per ton and bacitracin zinc at a concentration of 40 g per ton. All of the pigs were fed for 28 days. Then, three pigs were killed, and the luminal contents of the jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon were collected for DNA extraction and high-throughput sequencing. Results The results showed that the average daily weight gain of the antibiotic group was significantly greater (p 0. 05), than the control group. A total of 812, 607 valid reads were generated. Thirty-eight operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were found in all of the samples were defined as core OTUs. Twenty-one phyla were identified, and approximately 90 % of the classifiable sequences belonged to the phylum Firmicutes. Forty-two classes were identified. Of the 232 genera identified, nine genera were identified as the core gut microbiome because they existed in all of the tracts. The proportion of the nine core bacteria varied at the different tract sites. A heat map was used to understand how the numbers of the abundant genera shifted between the two treatment groups.

40|$|Intestinal {{health is}} {{essential}} for the health of the body since the gastro-intestinal mucosa is the main site of interaction with the external environment, as well as the major area colonized by the microbiota. Intestinal health relies on proper barrier function, epithelial integrity and related mechanisms of protection (mucous layer, tight junctions, immune and inflammatory system). In pigs, during the weaning transition, intestinal inflammation and barrier integrity {{play a crucial role in}} regulating intestinal health and, consequently, pig’s health, growth and productivity. The aim of the project was to assess the impact of different nutritional strategies on the intestinal health of <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> with reference to the inflammatory status and epithelial integrity. Therefore, in vivo trials were conducted to test the in-feed supplementation with zinc, tributyrin, or organic acids and nature-identical compounds (NIC) to <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets.</b> All the dietary interventions positively impacted the intestinal inflammatory status and, as a consequence, improved epithelial integrity by modulating tight junctions proteins (zinc or tributyrin) or by enhancing barrier properties measured with Ussing chambers (organic acids and NIC). These findings highlight that intestinal inflammation and barrier function are strictly linked, and that the control of inflammation {{is essential for}} adequate barrier function. In addition, in zinc trial and organic acids and NIC trial, better intestinal health could successfully result in better growth performance, as aimed for pig production improvement.

Based on an analysis of published data, the growth-promoting effect of formates, fumarates and citrates did not differ in <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> In fattening pigs, formates were the most effective followed by fumarates, whereas propionates did not improve growth performance. These acids improve the feed:gain ratio of both <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets</b> and fattening pigs. In <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets,</b> the growth-promoting effects of dietary organic acids appear to depend greatly on their influence on feed intake. In sows, organic acids may have anti-agalactia properties. Successful application of organic acids in the diets for pigs requires an understanding of their modes of action. It is generally considered that dietary organic acids or their salts lower gastric pH, resulting in increased activity of proteolytic enzymes and gastric retention time, and thus improve protein digestion. Reduced gastric pH and increased time have been difficult to demonstrate, whereas improved apparent ileal digestibilities of protein and amino acids have been observed with growing pigs, but not in <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> Organic acids may influence mucosal morphology, as well as stimulate pancreatic secretions, and they also serve as substrates in intermediary metabolism. These may further contribute to improved digestion, absorption and retention of many dietary nutrients. Organic acid supplementation reduces buffering capacity, which is expected to slow down the proliferation and/or colonization of undersirable microbes, e. g. Eschericia coli, in the gastro-ileal region. However, reduced scouring has been observed in only a few studies. As performance responses to dietary organic acids in pigs often varies, more specific studies are necessary to elucidate an expla- nation. vo...|$|E

40|$|The {{immediate}} post-weaning {{period is}} one of the most stressful phases in a pig's life, and during this period, piglets are usually exposed to environmental, social and psychological stressors which have direct or indirect effects on gut health and overall growth performance. In this review, the impact of husbandry practices on gut health outcomes and performance of piglets is discussed. Husbandry practices in the swine barn generally include nutrition and management practices, maintenance of hygienic standards and disease prevention protocols, and animal welfare considerations. Poor husbandry practices could result in reduced feed intake, stress and disease conditions, and consequently affect gut health and performance in <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> Reduced feed intake is a major risk factor for impaired gut structure and function and therefore a key goal is to maximize feed intake in newly <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> In <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets,</b> crowding stress could reduce pig performance, favor the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria resulting in diarrhea, stimulate immune responses and interfere with beneficial microbial activities in the gut. Sanitation conditions in the swine barn plays an important role for optimal piglet performance, because unclean conditions reduced growth performance, shifted nutrient requirements to support the immune system and negatively affected the gut morphology in <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> Appropriate biosecurity measures need to be designed to prevent disease entry and spread within a swine operation, which in turn helps to keep all pigs and piglets healthy. Collectively, husbandry practices relating to feeding and nutrition, animal welfare, biosecurity and disease prevention are important determinants of gut health and piglet performance. Thus, it is suggested that adopting high husbandry practices is a critical piece in strategies aimed at raising pigs without the use of in-feed antibiotics...|$|E

In swine, 44 % of the variation in preweaning piglet growth is attributed to the variability in milk quantities (34 %) and total milk solids content (15 %) produced by the sow (Lewis et al., 1978). The other 56 % of variability in preweaning growth is attributed to genetic and environmental factors. Furthermore, sow milk yields and milk composition have been identified previously as key limiting factors to preweaning piglet growth and consequently to all stages of postweaning piglet growth (Boyd and Kensinger, 1998). On average, sow reared piglets grow at a rate of 215 g/d in the first weeks of life (Tritton et al, 1993), whereas piglets reared on a milk replacer diet provide...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{fermentable}} carbohydrates (sugar beet pulp and fructooligosaccharides) on the faecal bacterial communities of <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> was analysed using 16 S rDNA-based approaches. Amplicons of the V 6 -V 8 variable regions of bacterial 16 S rDNA were analysed by {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE), cloning and sequencing. Differences in piglet faecal bacterial community structure were determined {{based on the}} Dice coefficients for pairwise comparison of the DGGE fingerprints and revealed significant changes in the faecal microbiota immediately after <b>weaning.</b> <b>Piglets</b> fed with fermentable carbohydrates showed a higher bacterial diversity and a more rapid stabilisation of the bacterial community compared with that of the animals fed with the control diet. Thirteen dominant DGGE bands were matched with sequences that showed 91 - 97 % similarity to those derived from the Clostridium coccoides group and the Clostridium leptum subgroup. Amplicons related to Ruminococcus-like species were found in all DGGE fingerprints derived from pigs on the diet containing sugar beet pulp and fructooligosaccharides, but not in pigs on the control diet. These results indicate that these bacteria {{may play a role in}} the utilisation of dietary fibres. (C) 2002 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play {{important}} roles in intestinal diseases; however, the role of miRNAs during weaning stress is unknown. In our study, six jejunal small RNA libraries constructed from <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> at 1, 4 and 7 d after weaning (libraries W 1, W 4 and W 7, respectively) and from suckling piglets on the same days as the <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> (libraries S 1, S 4 and S 7, respectively) were sequenced using Solexa high-throughput sequencing technology. Overall, 260 known swine miRNAs and 317 novel candidate miRNA precursors were detected in the six libraries. The results revealed that 16 differentially expressed miRNAs were found between W 1 and S 1; 98 differentially expressed miRNAs were found between W 4 and S 4 (ssc-mir- 146 b had the largest difference); and 22 differentially expressed miRNAs were found between W 7 and S 7. Sequencing miRNA results were validated using RT-qPCR. Approximately 11, 572 miRNA-mRNA interactions corresponding to 3, 979 target genes were predicted. The biological analysis further describe that the differentially expressed miRNAs regulated small intestinal metabolisms, stressful responses and immune functions in piglets. Therefore, the small intestine miRNA transcriptome was significantly different between weaning and suckling piglets; the difference varied {{with the number of}} days after weaning...|$|R

40|$|Fertility of sows {{has shown}} marked increases, {{especially}} during the last decade. In order to raise as many piglets as possible without resorting to nursing sows, it is extremely important to provide the piglets with a diet covering all their nutritional needs. This study examined the influence of automatically providing suckling pigs with a supplementary diet of milk and prestarter {{on the number of}} <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets,</b> their weight development and on the condition of the sow. The results were used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis. This analysis shows that automatically providing supplementary milk and prestarter led to higher weaning weights. However, the system would only be cost effective if at least 0. 65 additional <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets</b> were raised per litter through supplementary feeding...|$|E

At present, the really assumed potential of fecundity is 15. 0 piglets born alive, 2. 4 litters/year, 10 % losses and 32. 5 piglets per sow/year. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of phytogenic additive in sows feed rations on reproductive efficiency. In control group were 12 sows Large white (between 2 nd and 5 th farrows) and in experimental group were the same sows as in control group, but they were on the next farrowing (between 3 rd and 6 th farrows). Sows in experimental group were fed with the same feed ratio, but with phytogenic additive supplementation. We studied in both groups number of all born, live born and <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets</b> in litter. We found out that reproductive efficiency of sows in control group was: 10. 17 all born piglets, 8. 67 live born piglets, 8. 17 <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> Reproductive efficiency of sows fed with phytogenic additive was: 13. 00 all born piglets, 10. 67 live born piglets, 10. 17 <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> However we did not find statistically significant effect of the addition of phytogenic additive to the feed onreproductive efficiency of sows between control and experimental group...|$|E

40|$|Pseudorabies (PR) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} and fatal viral disease in swine. The clinical symptoms and mortality depend on the age of affected swine. However, PR infection is more often to become imperceptible in growing to finishing pigs but will induce high mortality in suckling and <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> when antibody titer is impairment. For controlling this disease, vaccination of the pregnant sows can mount good protective maternal antibody to prevent suckling and <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> from PR infection. In addition, Progressive atrophic rhinitis (PAR) is an important respiratory disease and causes the snout deformation, turbinate atrophy, septum deviation, and growth retardation in swine. PAR can affect all ages of swine but piglets are most susceptible. Both diseases and the following complication of porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) will induce tremendously economic loss on production in a pig farm. Multivalent vaccine is a good strategy for immunization and {{can be applied to}} reduce the stress and the cost of management during vaccination. The purpose of this project is to develop the bivalent of gE(-) PR/PAR of recombinant subunit PMT vaccine, and test its efficacy and safety in mice, rabbits, swine and field trials in order to control PR and PAR for decreasing the diseases outbreak in pig farms. 豬假性狂犬病(Pseudorabies; PR) 為高傳染性及高致死性的疾病,特別若爆發於哺乳仔豬及離乳幼豬之時期,感染後的死亡率甚至可高達 100 %. 此外,豬進行性萎縮性鼻炎(progressive atrophic rhinitis; PAR) 為豬隻重要呼吸道疾病,感染豬隻之鼻黏膜會急速壞死且造成鼻甲骨萎縮,導致呼吸系統第一道防禦機制嚴重受損,因而其他病原十分容易長驅直入,為豬隻罹患呼吸道綜合感染症(procine respiratory disease complex; PRDC) 之主因. 本計畫為預防此二種疾病發生,除可減少因PR或AR本身所造成之直接經濟損失外,亦可降低所繼發各種PRDC的發生,並大幅降低豬隻因呼吸道疾病死亡的損失及因治療或預防添加藥物所需的成本. 豬假性狂犬病與萎縮性鼻炎具有相同的免疫適期,均需藉由免疫懷孕母豬產生的移行抗體以保護仔豬免於早期之感染. 本計畫的主要目的即先以小白鼠進行免疫攻毒之安全性試驗及田間母豬隻免疫試驗,進行PR與PAR雙價疫苗免疫效力的評估. 而最終則是開發新一代的gE基因缺損PR與PAR重組次單位PMT毒素雙價疫苗,並藉由本實驗能成功移轉高安全、高效率及成本低廉並具競爭之PR與PAR雙價疫苗,以減少養豬業之經濟損失...|$|R
40|$|Tetracyclines {{are among}} the most common {{antibiotics}} administered via medicated feed to <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets,</b> in concentrations of several hundreds of mg kg- 1 feed, to prevent the outbreaks of enteric diseases. A signifi cant part is excreted still in active form, remaining in the slurry, where it can persist particularly when bound to the organic matter. A study has been carried out to assess the risk of the transfer of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and their metabolites to grain maize fertilised with pig slurry, at two experimental sites, one in Northern Italy (Reggio Emilia) and the other in Central Italy (Rome). Slurries were either injected between rows or distributed by sprinkling, splashing onto the plants. The tetracycline concentrations in the slurries, in the soil and in the different parts of the maize plant (stalks, cobs, grains and roots) were measured by means of liquid chromatography with UV/DAD detection (LoD = 20 ng g- 1). The average concentration in the <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> slurry was measured at 24 mg kg- 1 of oxytetracycline and 6 mg kg- 1 of chlortetracycline.
