25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus {{and treatment of}} metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E

25|$|Hoover {{was best}} known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to {{demonstrate}} the capabilities of Aero Commander's Shrike Commander, a twin piston-engined business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the plane as he put the aircraft through rolls, loops, and other maneuvers, <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> would not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he shut down both engines and executed a loop and an eight-point hesitation slow roll as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he would touch down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would start his engines to taxi back to the parking area. On airfields with large enough parking ramps (such as the Reno Stead Airport, where the Reno Air Races take place), Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast {{all the way back to}} his parking spot in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring a cup of tea while performing a 1G barrel roll.|$|E
25|$|Congenital amusia, {{commonly}} known as tone deafness, refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation, and it affects about 4% of the population. Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions with <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> are born. They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes {{even if they have}} normal audiometry and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody. If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to internalize musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{identity}} is one's personal experience of one's own gender. Gender identity can correlate with assigned sex at birth, or can differ from it completely. All societies {{have a set}} of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's social identity in relation to other members of society. In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females, a gender binary to <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> adhere and which includes expectations of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, and gender expression. In all societies, some individuals do not identify with some (or all) of the aspects of gender that are assigned to their biological sex; In some cases, a person's gender {{identity is}} inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics (genitals and secondary sex characteristics), resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms. These gender expressions may be described as gender variant, transgender, or genderqueer (there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity), and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria (traditionally called Gender Identity Disorder or GID). Transgender individuals are greatly affected by language and gender pronouns before, during, and after their transition.|$|E

500|$|Cold Feets {{cast and}} crew were {{frequently}} praised for their depiction of real-life social issues on the series. When Cold Feet began, Christine Langan stated, [...] "The real challenge was to overcome the traditional view {{that many of the}} issues we cover—jealousy, guilt, money, sexual problems, parental death—are ordinary issues, hardy perennials and, as such, not interesting enough for drama." [...] The fourth episode of the first series was controversial due to its depiction of the characters freely discussing their sex lives; in the left-wing New Statesman, Andrew Billen praised it as a homage to La Ronde and, despite the sex-talk, being [...] "intricately constructed as a farce". The right-wing tabloid Daily Mails critic wrote that the episode [...] "veered a little too close last night towards the category of 'adult entertainment', with all its connotations of sleaze and smut" [...] and [...] "we found ourselves immersed in their sex lives on a level of embarrassing intimacy <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> would share only with their doctor". A complaint was made by a viewer to the Independent Television Commission—the commercial television regulator—about the depiction of sex, but it was not upheld.|$|E

[...] She reviews scientific literature in the biochemical libraries at U.C.L.A., for instance.

2500|$|The actual {{cause of}} death in cold or very cold water is usually lethal bodily {{reactions}} to increased heat loss and to freezing water, rather than any loss of core body temperature. Of those who die after plunging into freezing seas, around 20% die within 2 minutes from cold shock (uncontrolled rapid breathing and gasping causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure and cardiac strain leading to cardiac arrest, and panic), another 50% die within 15 – 30 minutes from cold incapacitation (loss of use and control of limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body 'protectively' shuts down the peripheral muscles of the limbs to protect its core), and exhaustion and unconsciousness cause drowning, claiming the rest within a similar time. A notable example of this occurred during the sinking of the Titanic, in <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> who entered the [...] water died within 15–30 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{successful}} early-twentieth century staging was the 1935/1936 Theatre Guild production, which began on Broadway and subsequently toured all over North America. Starring {{husband and wife}} Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, the show ran for a record 129 performances, and was remounted in 1940 as a fundraiser for the Finnish Relief Fund. Ostensibly directed by Harry Wagstaff Gribble, the production notes indicated that Lunt and Fontanne {{were responsible for the}} [...] "scheme of the production," [...] <b>which</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> took to mean they were the real directors. Presented as a rollicking farce involving circus animals, dwarfs, acrobats and clowns, the performers would often involve the audience in the play; latecomers would be heckled by the actors on some nights, whilst on others, the actors would stop the play to politely explain to the latecomers what they had missed. Any particularly loud coughing in the audience would often lead to the entire cast breaking into a fit of coughing. At the end of the play, Katherina and Petruchio ascended into the heavens in a golden chariot, accompanied by choral music. To enhance Katherina's fiery reputation, the production kept her offstage during Act 1, Scene 1. However, none of her lines were cut. Instead, they were all shouted from offstage, and were often accompanied by her flinging objects at the on-stage performers. The fight with Petruchio was also commented upon by many reviewers as being extremely physical. Lunt and Fontanne were the most famous celebrity couple of the time, and their backstage fights were rumoured to be just as ferocious as their on-stage performances. So legendary did the tempestuous reputation of the couple become that Cole Porter's 1948 musical Kiss Me, Kate, about a fiery couple attempting to stage an adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew, was based on their real-life antics.|$|E
