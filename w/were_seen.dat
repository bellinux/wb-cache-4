5|$|In November 1980, the Voyager 1 probe {{visited the}} Saturn system. It sent back the first {{high-resolution}} {{images of the}} planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> for the first time. Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of {{the atmosphere of the}} moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details <b>were</b> <b>seen.</b> The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from the plane of the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Some comets {{have been}} {{observed}} to break up during their perihelion passage, including great comets West and Ikeya–Seki. Biela's Comet was one significant example, when it broke into two pieces during its passage through the perihelion in 1846. These two comets <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> separately in 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular meteor showers <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A minor meteor shower, the Andromedids, occurs annually in November, and it is caused when the Earth crosses the orbit of Biela's Comet.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{almost all}} pterosaurs <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> as surface-feeding piscivores, {{a view that}} still dominates popular culture. In reality, however, the {{majority}} of pterosaurs are now {{thought to have been}} terrestrial carnivores or insectivores.|$|E

5|$|Although {{previous}} Congress governments {{developed the}} capability {{for a nuclear}} weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II, a series of five nuclear tests in 1998. The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range ballistic missile. They <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> {{as an attempt to}} display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in late 1933 and {{escalating}} {{throughout the}} first half of 1934, American Roman Catholics launched a campaign against what they deemed the immorality of American cinema. This, plus a potential government takeover of film censorship and social research seeming to indicate that movies which <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> to be immoral could promote bad behavior, was enough pressure to force the studios to capitulate to greater oversight.|$|E
5|$|Both King George V of England and Cosmo Gordon Lang the Bishop of Canterbury took a {{personal}} interest in the Assyrian affair. British representatives at home demanded from Faysal that Sidqi and other culprits be tried and punished.

5|$|Egyptian temples {{were built}} for the {{official}} worship of the gods and in commemoration of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt and regions under Egyptian control. Temples <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> as houses for the gods or kings to whom they were dedicated. Within them, the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals, the central functions of Egyptian religion: giving offerings to the gods, reenacting their mythological interactions through festivals, and warding off the forces of chaos. These rituals <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> as necessary for the gods to continue to uphold maat, the divine order of the universe. Housing and caring for the gods were the obligations of pharaohs, who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance. Out of necessity, pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties {{to a host of}} priests, but most of the populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple's most sacred areas. Nevertheless, a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians, who went there to pray, give offerings, and seek oracular guidance from the god dwelling within.|$|E
5|$|Having {{made only}} 5 and 18 in the {{previous}} Test, Jack Crapp was originally dropped from the team but was reprieved by Washbrook's injury. The England selectors were widely condemned for their decisions, which <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> as an investment in youth rather than necessarily picking the best players available at the time. Their frequent changes meant the home team had used a total of 21 players for the five Tests.|$|E
