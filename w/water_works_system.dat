Introduction: In making a {{study of the}} {{municipal}} ownership of the water supply of a small city, drawbacks are encountered in that suitable statistics are hard to procure. Accounts are kept with little attempt at proper classification. Many items are placed under general heads such as "maintenance" and "miscellaneous". Under these heads are listed one fourth of all expenditures incurred by the city <b>water</b> <b>works</b> of Manhattan. This ambiguous method of keeping books may be sufficient for ascertaining the loss and gain of the whole, but is certainly most unsatisfactory {{from the standpoint of the}} investigator into all the details of administration. Neither is it business-like nor safe. In spite of this disadvantage sufficient data have been secured upon which to base a discussion that will justify the conclusion herein reached. My efforts in this line have been greatly facilitated by the hearty cooperation of the city clerk and the free access to all his books, memoranda, and accounts. Valuable assistance was also rendered by several worthy citizens of the town. Criticisms offered are not intended to be personal, but merely to turn on the light where it is needed and to be suggestive of needed improvements. In making {{a study of the}} plant in which the citizens of Manhattan are interested, we find that in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas providing for the construction and maintenance of municipal <b>water</b> <b>works</b> <b>systems,</b> the citizens of Manhattan in 1886, then a city of about 2700 inhabitants began to agitate the question of installing a <b>system</b> of <b>water</b> <b>works,</b> and a special election on March 24 th of the following year, for the purpose of issuing bonds for the same...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} if douching with <b>Water</b> <b>Works</b> device for 1 month can (1) lower or eliminate perceived vaginal odor by subject; (2) have any effects on vaginal ecosystem. Methods. Ten women with perceived vaginal odor {{with or without}} discharge, douched every day for 4 weeks in an open-label, nonrandomized pilot study. Primary outcome measures included perceived vaginal odor by subject, lactobacilli score from Nugent slide, and acceptance of the <b>Water</b> <b>Works</b> douching <b>system.</b> Secondary outcome included the safety of using this douching device. Results. At week 4, there was improvement in vaginal odor (P =. 0006) {{and there was no}} significant change in lactobacilli score. Conclusion. Douching with <b>Water</b> <b>Works</b> device is associated with reduction or elimination of vaginal odor without adversely affecting the vaginal ecosystem. Copyright © 2006 Ashwin J.

50|$|In {{subsequent}} {{decades the}} Brooklyn <b>Water</b> <b>Works</b> <b>system</b> was repeatedly expanded by adding wells and collection reservoirs, extending the conduit farther east, and adding pumps. The Ridgewood Reservoir's third basin {{was completed in}} 1891. Farmers in southern Queens County complained that Brooklyn's thirst was lowering the water table. Late in the century, the conduit was extended to a large pumping station in Massapequa, some 30 miles (50 km) away. Efforts to extend it farther were thwarted by legislation protecting the water of Suffolk County. Force Tube Avenue, Conduit Boulevard, and Sunrise Highway were built, in part, atop the water conduit or within its right of way, early in the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{new water}} balance {{calculation}} has {{been worked out}} that considers the effect of urbanization. This calculation method was applied to evaluate the water balance of the historic center of Budapest, the Buda Castle Hill, where an intensive network of cellars is found. The method, a combination of hydrogeologic tests and field measurements, was also tested in other Hungarian cities where underground structures are common, such as Eger, Pécs and Veszprém. The calculation considers both natural and anthropogenic water sources. Beside the commonly-used natural factors such as precipitation, evaporation, runoff, infiltration, etc. it also employs input parameters such as broken pipelines and sewer systems. The water losses of these waterworks significantly influence the natural water balance and provide additional and very often significant water input into the water system. The new method is of great importance in designing and planning remedial actions for historic cities, where the built environment, cellars and natural caves are endangered by infiltrating water. Another feedback of the method is {{the application of the}} results in the long-term planning strategy of public works supplying or using <b>water</b> (<b>water</b> <b>works,</b> sewer <b>system</b> and energy sector) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1902, {{the town}} was incorporated, a town marshal appointed, {{sidewalks}} constructed and a jail built {{at the cost of}} $140. The first addition to {{the town was}} presented to the town council in 1903. The old school house was moved onto town property and made into a town hall. In 1905, five street lamps were purchased, sidewalks and streets were extended. From 1907 to 1910 the telephone came to town, a <b>water</b> <b>works</b> <b>system</b> was installed and cement sidewalks constructed. By 1917 a fire department was organized. In 1926 a new consolidated school was built at the cost of approximately $75,000. There were 62 students in high school and 116 in the grades with seven teachers in charge.|$|E
50|$|This {{city was}} reincorporated on November 17, 1945. The {{first meeting of}} the town council {{took place at the}} old school house on January 16, 1946. Later that year, the {{original}} city council established the Graysville <b>Water</b> <b>Works</b> <b>system.</b> In 1949, the city council established the Graysville Gas Board which eventually became the Graysville Municipal Gas System. During the 1950s and 1960s, the local coal mines and steel mills attracted families from all over Alabama. As a result of this growth, Graysville established the City’s first series of home developments and subdivisions. During the 1980s and 1990s, Graysville expanded its city limits by annexing multiple acres in what was then unincorporated in Jefferson County.|$|E

50|$|In low-rainfall areas, closing gates can cut {{livestock}} {{off from}} water supplies. For example, {{most of the}} land used for grazing in Australia has no natural water supplies, so drinking water for the stock must be supplied by the farmer or landowner, often by using a windmill to pump groundwater. Even visitors who know how a stock <b>water</b> <b>system</b> <b>works</b> may be unaware of breakdowns. During hot weather, cattle require large quantities of water to drink and can die in less than a day if they don't get it. Sheep need less water and can survive longer without it, but will die if cut off from water for several hot days.|$|R

Indian Hill <b>Water</b> <b>Works</b> (IHWW) supplies <b>water</b> to several suburban communities {{to the east of}} Cincinnati. Finished water hardness is approximately 150 mg/L as CaCO 3, total alkalinity approximately 250 mg/L as CaCO 3, DIC approximately 60 - 65 mg C/L, and pH ranges from about 7. 1 to 7. 5, mostly near 7. 3. Final treatment consists of chlorination, fluoridation, and at different times, addition of caustic and/or corrosion inhibitor. Historically, water heater failures and high copper levels resulting in blue water were reported in the 1950 ’s, and caustic addition was used to elevate the pH to as high as 8 at different times throughout the next 3 decades. In the late 1980 ’s and early 1990 ’s, zinc orthophosphate treatment was employed, which was mostly successful for lead and inconsistently successful for copper. In 1997 with the 90 th percentile still at 1. 54 mg/L for copper, the zinc orthophosphate treatment was withdrawn. In 1998, new pilot tests were carried out in collaboration with the Water Supply and Water Resources Division of USEPA in Cincinnati to do some new pilot testing and a more systematic analysis of copper corrosion control chemistry.
