Although {{it was close to}} the city center, this also meant that the airport's runway took up central parts of Byfjorden. With increased use of aircraft, they became a safety hazard on the fjord. The operations were distributed, as the air traffic control was located at Herdla Airport on Askøy. Herdla was considered, but its runway was too rudimentary and the airport was far from the city. Although closer, Bergen Naval Air Station on Flatøy also needed to be reached with a ferry.|$|E

Work progressed with limited supplies and those needed for the Polar Line were cannibalized to give way for the airport's completion. From 5 July the workforce was supplemented and later dominatedby Eastern European prisoners of war (POW), mostly from Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. As of 1 January 1943 there were 441 POWs in Tromsø, most of which were working at Skattøra. By 1 April 1945 the number had increased to 1,325, of which 661 were working at Skattøra. Eighteen POWs died in Tromsø during the war.|$|E

The airline proposed in 1954 that four short take-off and landing airports be built along the coast, including one in Molde. They hoped to serve these using Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneers. Årø was the preferred site, although Langmyren was also considered. However, the aircraft were not approved by the authorities, mostly because of an insufficient de-icing system. This resulted in that the plans for Ålesund Airport, Vigra to be prioritized, and soon the site was upgraded to primary airport, allowing it to open on 7 June 1958.

25|$|Two-thirds of the {{building}} complex at the station was demolished {{in the remainder of}} 1945. This was done to secure building material for the reconstruction of Finnmark. For instance Gunnarnes Chapel is a former barracks built at Skattøra. Skattøra was the only naval air station of the Navy Air Service to resume use after the war. All other seaplane bases were jointly located with land airport. The Air Force decided in 1947 to make Skattøra one of its five main air stations—and the only one of these to be a <b>water</b> <b>airport.</b> The Air Force and the civilian aviation authorities determined that Norway would receive two area control centers for its air traffic control. One of these was located at Tromsø and located in the subterranean structure at Marielund. This also acted as a rescue coordination center.
