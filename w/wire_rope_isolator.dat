40|$|Different {{isolation}} {{systems are}} currently employed to protect sensitive equipment and their hosting structures from undesirable vibrations originating from earthquake ground motions. <b>Wire</b> <b>rope</b> <b>isolator</b> (WRI), {{a type of}} passive isolator {{is known to be}} effective in isolating the vibrations and shock, can be used for vibration isolation of structures and equipment. The aim of the present work is to study the performance of WRIs in mitigating the vibrational response of equipment mounted on the upper floor of a multi-story structure using numerical simulations. In multistoried buildings, the upper floors experience significantly amplified accelerations than the lower floors and hence the sensitive equipment requires an effective vibration isolation system. The present study shows that the WRI can provide an effective isolation by reducing the equipment acceleration through its lateral flexibility while satisfying the displacement demand. The Performance of the WRI was assessed considering six different earthquake excitations in a series of numerical simulations. The influence of flexibility of the structure on the performance of the WRI is also reported...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the results}} of {{experimental}} tests performed on a Helical <b>Wire</b> <b>Rope</b> <b>Isolator</b> (HWRI) are presented in order to describe the dynamic and static behavior of the selected metal device in three different displacements ranges, namely small, relatively large, and large displacements ranges, without and under {{the effect of a}} vertical load. A testing machine, allowing to apply horizontal displacement or load histories to the tested bearing with a constant vertical load, has been adopted to perform the dynamic and static tests. According to the experimental results, the dynamic behavior of the tested device depends on the applied displacement amplitude. Indeed, the HWRI displays a softening and a hardening stiffness at small and relatively large displacements, respectively, and a stronger nonlinear stiffening behavior at large displacements. Furthermore, the experimental tests reveal that the application of a vertical load allows to have a more flexible device with higher damping properties and that the applied vertical load affects much less the dynamic response of the metal device at large displacements. Finally, a decrease in the static to dynamic effective stiffness ratio with increasing displacement amplitude has been observed...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{advanced}} Nonlinear Exponential Model (NEM), able {{to simulate the}} uniaxial dynamic behavior of seismic isolators having a continuously decreasing tangent stiffness with increasing displacement in the relatively large displacements range and a hardening or softening behavior at large displacements, is presented. The mathematical model is validated by comparing the experimental force-displacement hysteresis loops obtained during cyclic tests, conducted on a helical <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> <b>isolator</b> and a recycled rubber-fiber reinforced bearing, with those predicted analytically. Good agreement between the experimental and simulated results shows that the proposed model {{can be an effective}} numerical tool to predict the force-displacement relationship of seismic isolation devices within the large displacements range. Compared to the widely used Bouc-Wen model, unable to simulate the response of seismic isolators at large displacements, the proposed one allows to avoid the numerical solution of a first order nonlinear ordinary differential equation for each time step of a nonlinear time history analysis, thus reducing the computation effort. Furthermore, the proposed model can simulate the smooth transition of the hysteresis loops from small to large displacements by adopting only one set of five parameters determined from the experimental hysteresis loops having the largest amplitude...|$|E

Based on the predicted environments in the Service Module avionics ring, an isolation system was deemed necessary to protect the avionics packages carried by the spacecraft. Impact, sinusoidal, and random vibration testing were conducted on a prototype Orion Service Module avionics pallet in March 2010 at the NASA Glenn Research Center Structural Dynamics Laboratory (SDL).

40|$|The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III - International Space Station (ISS) {{instrument}} {{will be used}} to study ozone, providing global, long-term measurements of key components of the Earth's atmosphere for the continued health of Earth and its inhabitants. SAGE III is launched into orbit in an inverted configuration on SpaceX;s Falcon 9 launch vehicle. As one of its four supporting elements, a Contamination Monitoring Package (CMP) mounted to the top panel of the Interface Adapter Module (IAM) box experiences high-frequency response due to structural coupling between the two structures during the SpaceX launch. These vibrations, which were initially observed in the IAM Engineering Development Unit (EDU) test and later verified through finite element analysis (FEA) for the SpaceX launch loads, may damage the internal electronic cards and the Thermoelectric Quartz Crystal Microbalance (TQCM) sensors mounted on the CMP. Three-dimensional (3 D) vibration isolators were required to be inserted between the CMP and IAM interface in order to attenuate the high frequency vibrations without resulting in any major changes to the existing system. <b>Wire</b> <b>rope</b> <b>isolators</b> were proposed as the isolation system between the CMP and IAM due to the low impact to design. Most 3 D isolation systems are designed for compression and roll, therefore little dynamic data was available for using <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> <b>isolators</b> in an inverted or tension configuration. From the isolator FEA and test results, it is shown that by using the 3 D <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> <b>isolators,</b> the CMP high-frequency responses have been suppressed by several orders of magnitude over a wide excitation frequency range. Consequently, the TQCM sensor responses are well below their qualification environments. It is indicated that these high-frequency responses due to the typical instrument structural coupling can be significantly suppressed by a vibration passive control using the 3 D vibration isolator. Thermal and contamination issues were also examined during the isolator selection period for meeting the SAGE III-ISS instrument requirements...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>rope</b> is a versatile, flexible, {{high-strength}} member {{that is used}} in many mechanical systems. However, due to {{the complexity}} of <b>wire</b> <b>rope,</b> analytical investigations have been relatively limited. Previous attempts to create simplified models of <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> were not validated with physical testing and used a cumbersome beam-and-shell or beam-and-solid method for simulating the <b>wire</b> <b>rope.</b> An improved LS-DYNA model of 19 -mm diameter 3 x 7 <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> commonly used in roadside cable guardrail installations has been developed. A Belytschko-Schwer beam element was selected along with material *MAT_ 166. Since <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> displays internal damping due to friction of strands and wires, low-frequency bending modes of <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> were damped in the model using the LS-DYNA frequency range command, and high-frequency noise was reducing using the part stiffness damping. The optimum element length based on timestep, accuracy, and computational cost was determined to be between 0. 4 and 0. 8 in. (10 - 20 mm). Dynamic component tests were conducted on <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> to determine material properties, and consisted of high-speed jerk tests of <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> constrained at one end, and perpendicular impact of <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> constrained at both ends. These tests were simulated and the results compared to the physical tests. The new proposed <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> model more accurately simulated the <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> tension and bogie vehicle motion than previously-developed <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> models. The <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> was also modeled in full-scale crash test models using a Chevrolet C 2500 pickup model, consistent with NCHRP Report No. 350 TL- 3 impact conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{modeling}} method and dynamical characteristics of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> {{has been researched}} for several decades. In the past, steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> were usually modeled as a two dimensional system, which was only suitable for the planar motion. Also, no kink-wave propagation was considered when steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> were used in relatively low speed engineering application areas. By contrast, a three dimensional approach to model steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> used in high energy absorber apparatus is presented in this paper. Three dimensional contacts between steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and other objects and kink-wave propagation in steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> are taken into consideration when applying the new approach to model steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> Compared to the two dimensional model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes,</b> the proposed model regards steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> as a multi-body system consisting of identical cylindrical elements with {{6 degrees of freedom}} connected by space constraints. Impact forces generated by three dimensional contacts between steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and other objects are calculated and theories of elastic wave propagation are applied to analyze the kink-wave propagation when steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> are loaded with a sudden perpendicular impact by a high speed moving object. In addition, mathematical model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is established and numerical simulation of the three dimensional model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is implemented. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data available, the model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> proposed in this paper is demonstrated to be valid and correct. Therefore, the proposed {{modeling method}} can be treated as a new approach in the research field of modeling steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> The dynamical characteristics of the steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> based on this new modeling approach are addressed simultaneously and plots of the dynamics of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> cannot only be regarded as a basis for the further comparative studies, but also can provide some significant and interesting results...|$|R
