40|$|Algumas empresas têm instituído, ao lado dos Call Center, intitulados atualmente de <b>Web</b> <b>Call</b> Center, o chat como uma nova modalidade de atendimento agente-cliente, visando, sobretudo, ao aumento da produtividade e engajamento com a nova tecnologia. Considerando essa nova atividade de trabalho, esta pesquisa, pautada em metodologia qualitativa, de base epistemológica interpretativista de observação, teve como objetivo {{investigar}} e analisar interações ocorridas em situação de atendimento ao cliente, via chat, para compreender as características das práticas discursivas nesse contexto. Nesse sentido, procurou responder a duas questões: Qual(is) a(s) característica(s) da situação de trabalho das atendentes do <b>Web</b> <b>Call</b> Center? Qual o estatuto discursivo do chat em situação de trabalho? Do ponto de vista teórico, recorreu aos estudos da linguagem - mais especificamente às contribuições de Marcuschi (2010), que considera o chat como gênero, e de Dominique Maingueneau (2001), que o vê como hipergênero - e aos estudos do trabalho, mais especificamente à Ergologia, entendida como um modelo teórico-metodológico inovador para abordar a atividade de trabalho (Schwartz, 1997, 2006). O corpus considerado para análise constituiu-se de registros de atendimento ao cliente por meio do chat, entre técnicos de seguros na função de agentes de atendimento de uma Seguradora Nacional e, seus clientes - corretores de seguros. Por meio da análise e discussão desses registros, concluiu-se que o chat em situação de trabalho sofre várias coerções que permitem caracterizá-lo como gênero. Ficaram claras também as várias renormalizações feitas pelas atendentes, as quais indicam a dialética entre os saberes instituídos, isto é, as normas que antecedem a atividade, e os saberes investidos, a experiência advinda da práticaSome {{companies have}} been offering online chats named as <b>Web</b> <b>Call</b> Centers besides traditional Call Centers. This is a new tool for communication between companies and clients which aims for more productivity and commitment. Considering this new work activity and through qualitative methodology and epistemological interpretative orientation, this research examines online chat interactions to understand {{the characteristics of the}} discursive practices in this given context. This work has looked for answering two major questions: what are the characteristics of the situation of work of <b>Web</b> <b>Call</b> Center attendants?; and what is the discursive status of the online chat in this work situation? Theoretically, we have recurred to language studies that consider online chats as a genre, specifically Marchurschi s contibutions (2010). We have also recurred to language studies that consider online chats as a hypergenre like Dominique Maingueneau s work (2001) and, we have recurred to studies of work, specifically Ergology, which is considered an innovative theory to approach work activities (Schwartz, 1997, 2006). The corpus considered in the analysis consists of registers of online chats in customer service with interactions between insurance technicians as attendants and their clients who were insurance agents. By doing the analysis of these registers and by discussing them, we {{have come to the conclusion}} that in work situation the online chat goes under coercion that allows us to classify it as a genre. Some other aspects were revealed in the study as well, such as the normalization, done by the attendants, that points to the dialectics among the instituted pieces of knowledge, i. e., the rules that precede the activity, and the invested knowledge, the experience that comes with practic...|$|E

The objective is to identify and portray the visual features occurring in an image in terms of differentiated classes or themes. Applications can be found in a wide range of domains such as medical image understanding, surveillance applications, remote sensing and interactive TV. Traditional image classification methods analyses independent blocks of an image, which results in a context-free formalism. However there is a fairly wide-spread agreement that observations should be presented as collections of features which appear in a given mutual position or shape (e. g. sun in the sky, sky above landscape or boat in the water etc.) [20], [21].

This paper focuses on the technical challenges involved in the topdown evaluation of the reasoning rules. First, we discuss the application of well-known algorithms in the QSQ family, and analyze their advantages and drawbacks. Then, we present a new algorithm, called RDF-SQ, which re-uses different features of the QSQ algorithms and introduces some novelties that target the execution of the OWL-RL rules. We implemented our algorithm inside the QueryPIE prototype and tested its performance against QSQ-R, which is the most popular QSQ algorithm, and a parallel variant of it, which is the current state-of-theart in terms of scalability. We used a large LUBM dataset with ten billion triples, and our tests show that RDF-SQ is significantly faster and more efficient than the competitors in almost all cases...|$|E
