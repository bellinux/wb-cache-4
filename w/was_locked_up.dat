5|$|Serb forces {{singled out}} a number of {{prominent}} individuals. Among them was Dr. Vesna Bosanac, the director of the town's hospital, who was regarded as a heroine in Croatia but demonised by the Serbian media. She and her husband were taken to Sremska Mitrovica prison, where she <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> in a single room with 66 other women for several weeks. Her husband was subjected to repeated beatings. After appeals from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the couple were eventually released in a prisoner exchange. Croatian Radio journalist Siniša Glavašević, whose broadcasts had become iconic in Croatia, was taken to Ovčara, severely beaten and shot along with the other victims of the massacre.|$|E

25|$|Queen Olga and {{her husband}} were devoted foster parents, but in the beginning, they had little success in {{improving}} the girl's condition. Vera was homesick and continued to be extremely difficult, {{to the point of being}} physically violent towards them. Periodically, Vera had to be brought under control by an army officer, and on more than one occasion she <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up.</b> Karl went for long walks with Vera and read passages from the Bible to her in the evening. By 1866, there was still little improvement in Vera's condition, but Queen Olga persevered and with time, Grand Duchess Vera eventually outgrew her disruptive behavior.|$|E
25|$|William McClure Thomson {{arrived in}} Beirut in 1833 for missionary work {{and was in}} the area {{at the time of the}} earthquake. He wrote, in fine detail, of the damage and {{personal}} tragedies he witnessed during his travels in the book The Land and the Book, Or, Biblical Illustrations Drawn from the Manners and Customs, the Scenes and Scenery of the Holy Land. The book was published in 1861 and remained a best seller through much of the nineteenth century. In the region, the Egyptians (led by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt), had recently succeeded in overpowering the Ottomans and gained control of Syria during the Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833). During his time in the area Thomson <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> with charges of spying. The Egyptians were ultimately flushed from the region by Turkey.|$|E
25|$|While Duntov was {{developing}} an innovative new chassis for the 1963 Corvette, designers were adapting and refining the basic {{look of the}} racing Sting Ray for the production model. A fully functional space buck (a wooden mock-up created to work out interior dimensions) was completed by early 1960, production coupe styling <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> {{for the most part}} by April, and the interior, instrument panel included was in place by November. Only in the fall of 1960 did the designers turn their creative attention to {{a new version of the}} traditional Corvette convertible and, still later, its detachable hardtop. For the first time in the Corvette's history, wind tunnel testing helped refine the final shape, as did practical matters like interior space, windshield curvatures, and tooling limitations. Both body styles were extensively evaluated as production-ready 3/8-scale models at the Caltech wind tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Most of Cape Cod's {{geological}} history {{involves the}} advance and retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet {{in the late}} Pleistocene geological era and the subsequent changes in sea level. Using radiocarbon dating techniques, researchers have determined that around 23,000 years ago, the ice sheet reached its maximum southward advance over North America, and then started to retreat. Many kettle ponds – clear, cold lakes – were formed and remain on Cape Cod {{as a result of}} the receding glacier. By about 18,000 years ago, the ice sheet had retreated past Cape Cod. By roughly 15,000 years ago, it had retreated past southern New England. When so much of Earth's water <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> in massive ice sheets, the sea level was lower. Truro's bayside beaches used to be a petrified forest, before it became a beach.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{supersonic}} {{escape capsule}} {{was designed for}} the XF-103. The pilot's seat was located in a shell with a large movable shield in front that was normally slid down into the area {{in front of the}} pilot's legs. In the case of depressurization, the shield would slide {{up in front of the}} pilot, sealing the seat into a pressurized pod. Basic flight instruments inside the capsule allowed the aircraft to be flown back to base, and a window in the front of the shield allowed the periscope system to be used. In an emergency, the entire capsule would be ejected downward, along with a small portion of the aircraft fuselage that provided a stable aerodynamic shape. To enter and exit the aircraft, the ejection module was lowered on rails out of the bottom of the aircraft, allowing the pilot to simply walk into the seat, sit down, and raise the module into the aircraft. The capsule was fully pressurized, allowing the pilot to continue operating the aircraft without a pressure suit when the capsule <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Ice Age a vast, {{cold and}} dry Mammoth steppe {{stretched}} from the arctic islands southwards to China, and from Spain eastwards across Eurasia {{and over the}} Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon where it was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. The land bridge existed because sea-levels were lower because more of the planet's water than today <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> in glaciers. Therefore, {{the flora and fauna}} of Beringia were more related to those of Eurasia rather than North America. Beringia received more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover from the north Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of the}} Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided a ecological refugium for plants and animals. In East Beringia 35,000 YBP, the northern arctic areas experienced temperatures 1.5 C degrees warmer than today but the southern sub-Arctic regions were 2 C degrees cooler. During the LGM 22,000 YBP the average summer temperature was 3–5 C degrees cooler than today, with variations of 2.9 C degrees cooler on the Seward Peninsula to 7.5 C cooler in the Yukon. In the driest and coldest periods of the Late Pleistocene, and possibly during the entire Pleistocene, moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the air-flow from the North Pacific.|$|E

500|$|Imprisoned with 25 comrades, Castro renamed {{his group}} the [...] "26th of July Movement" [...] (MR-26-7) {{in memory of}} the Moncada attack's date, and formed a school for prisoners. He read widely, enjoying the works of Marx, Lenin, and Martí but also reading books by Freud, Kant, Shakespeare, Munthe, Maugham and Dostoyevsky, {{analyzing}} them within a Marxist framework. Corresponding with supporters, he maintained control over the Movement and organized the publication of History Will Absolve Me. Initially permitted a relative amount of freedom within the prison, he <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> in solitary confinement after inmates sang anti-Batista songs on a visit by the President in February 1954. Meanwhile, Castro's wife Mirta gained employment in the Ministry of the Interior, something he discovered through a radio announcement.

Both Fidel and Mirta initiated divorce proceedings, with Mirta taking custody of their son Fidelito; this angered Castro, who did not want his son growing up in a bourgeois environment.|$|E
500|$|Todd was {{a pioneer}} doctor {{in the field of}} psychiatry. [...] At the time, {{treatment}} of the mentally ill was typically inhumane: “A mentally ill patient <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> in an insane asylum with little or no care and treated as if they were a criminal”. Prior to 1800, it was common for people deemed mad to be locked away and forgotten about. Some individuals, such as Todd and Dorothea Dix wanted more humane care for the mentally ill as they were appalled at the treatment of such people. The Connecticut Retreat for the Insane was built in 1823, and was opened to admissions in 1824. Eli Todd was its first director. It was {{often referred to as the}} Hartford Retreat for the Insane, and is now known as The Institute of Living. The Hartford Retreat for the Insane cost $12,000 to build and could serve up to 40 patients at a time. “It cost $3.00 a week for a state resident and $4.00 a week for an out of state resident”.|$|E
500|$|Imprisoned with 25 fellow conspirators, Castro renamed [...] "The Movement" [...] the [...] "26th of July Movement" [...] (MR-26-7) {{in memory}} of the Moncada attack's date.

He read widely, enjoying the works of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Martí but also reading books by Freud, Kant, Shakespeare, Munthe, Maugham and Dostoyevsky, analyzing them within a Marxist framework. He began reading about Roosevelt's New Deal, believing that something similar should be enacted in Cuba. Corresponding with supporters outside of prison, he maintained control over the Movement and organized the publication of History Will Absolve Me, with an initial print run of 27,500 copies. Initially permitted a relatively high amount of freedom within the prison compared to other inmates, he <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> <b>up</b> in solitary confinement after his comrades sang anti-Batista songs on a visit by the President in February 1954. Meanwhile, Castro's wife Mirta gained employment in the Ministry of the Interior, having been encouraged to do so by her brother, a friend and ally of Batista's. This was kept a secret from Castro, who found out through a radio announcement. Appalled, he raged that he would rather die [...] "a thousand times" [...] than [...] "suffer impotently from such an insult".
