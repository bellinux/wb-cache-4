5|$|The ice trade {{enabled the}} {{consumption}} {{of a wide range}} of new products during the 19th century. One simple use for natural ice was to chill drinks, either being directly added to the glass or barrel, or indirectly chilling it in a <b>wine</b> <b>cooler</b> or similar container. Iced drinks were a novelty and were initially viewed with concern by customers, worried about the health risks, although this rapidly vanished in the US. By mid-19th century, water was always chilled in America if possible. Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk chilled, also used ice. Drinks such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created that could only be made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks, with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were surprised to see the Anglo-Indian elite prepared to drink iced water. Some Hindus in India regarded ice as unclean for religious reasons, and as such an inappropriate food.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, museums often {{displayed}} electrotypes {{of ancient}} coins {{instead of the}} originals (see photograph D below), and individuals purchased electrotypes for their private collections. By 1920, the Victoria and Albert Museum in England had acquired nearly 1000 electrotyped copies of important objects from the collections of other European museums. The most celebrated may be their copy of the Jerningham <b>wine</b> <b>cooler,</b> which is a spectacular silverwork made in England in 1735 {{that has long been}} {{in the collection of the}} Hermitage Museum in Russia. Many of these objects were made by Elkington & Co., which had an extensive business in electrotyped silver.|$|E
500|$|Willis left New York City {{and headed}} to California to {{audition}} for several television shows. In 1984, he appeared in an episode of the TV series Miami Vice, titled [...] "No Exit". In 1985, he was the guest actor in the first episode of the 1980s revival of The Twilight Zone, [...] "Shatterday". He auditioned {{for the role of}} David Addison Jr. of the television series Moonlighting (1985–1989), competing against 3,000 other actors for the position. The starring role, opposite Cybill Shepherd, helped to establish him as a comedic actor, with the show lasting five seasons winning him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy. During the height of the show's success, beverage maker Seagram hired Willis as the pitchman for their Golden <b>Wine</b> <b>Cooler</b> products. The advertising campaign paid the rising star between $5–7 million over two years. In spite of that, Willis chose not to renew his contract with the company when he decided to stop drinking alcohol in 1988.|$|E

[...] Apart from the Waterloo chair in the Royal collection, he had some other items made from the lumber: a minerals cabinet, a small table cabinet, a writing table, a work-table (owned by Anne Atkins), a chair, and a stand with the bark still on it, for a bust of Wellington.

2500|$|The font {{is made of}} {{limestone}} from Derbyshire, and the stone contains small fossils. The church accounts of 1686 refer to [...] "putting a loop ring" [...] on the font for two pennies; the loop fitted {{on the rim of}} this rare oval font is still in situ, dating it to before that date. The church leaflet mentions legends of its origin in Fountains Abbey or in a mansion where the font was once a <b>wine</b> <b>cooler.</b> Contrary to the above listing description, it is the wooden cover and not the font which was made in 1772 and restored in 1975. The brass eagle lectern was presented to the church in 1875. The pulpit, presented to the church in 1955, is the work of Norval Paxton; this is possibly architect Norval Paxton of Tadcaster who designed the church hall (dedicated in 1947 and now demolished) at Foundry Mill Street in Seacroft. The east window in the chancel was presented by Eliza Bentley in 1883.|$|E
