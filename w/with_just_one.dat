5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1925–26, Kilner was {{selected}} for the MCC tour of the West Indies, during which no Test matches were played. It was not personally successful for him and he recorded few effective performances.

5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E
5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over a {{province}} including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks {{argues that the}} choice of Rochester was probably not {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway, and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus was probably not a monk (he was not called that by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E

5|$|Incorporated {{municipalities}} in Florida may {{be called}} cities, towns, or villages, {{but there is no}} legal distinction between the different terms. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, more than 10million Floridians, 55% of the state's total population of 18,801,310, resided in incorporated municipalities. The remainder resided in unincorporated areas. However, 94% of the population lives in metropolitan areas. Of the remaining 6%, many live in smaller cities and towns, thus the actual number of residents living in truly rural areas is small. There are ten counties in the state <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> incorporated municipality and ten counties with only two.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United and Arsenal took {{immediate}} action by fining {{a number of}} their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as {{they were involved in}} a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> defeat.|$|E

5|$|The 2014–15 season {{opened with}} the Devils' roster {{suffering}} with injuries, and consequently the team accumulated losses. On December 26, Peter DeBoer {{was fired from}} the head coach position. To replace him, Lamoriello invested in two head coaches, former Devils player Scott Stevens (who had been DeBoer's assistant for two years) and Adam Oates, with Lamoriello himself supervising the team during the first months. The Devils finished the season as the sixth-worst team in the League, 20 points away from a playoff spot and <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> victory in the last 11 games.|$|E
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas proved more potent than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was {{wiped out by}} French artillery, and pulled back <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> battleworthy tank. The Company retreated {{under the cover of}} part of the ridge, and moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company was rushed to the spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's late arrival tilted the scales. They managed to eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season began}} {{as the previous}} one had ended <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> win and six defeats, their worst start since the 1902–03 season when they were relegated. On 17 March 2012, manager Owen Coyle travelled to the London Chest Hospital with Fabrice Muamba who had suffered from a cardiac arrest whilst playing against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane in a FA Cup match. Muamba stayed in a critical condition for several weeks and Coyle was widely praised for {{the manner in which}} he represented the club during the period. That 13 May, Bolton were relegated to the Championship by one point {{on the last day of}} the season after drawing 2–2 with Stoke City.|$|E

An actual 38 seconds were played after the ball was kicked off. Liverpool tried one last attack but Thomas managed to intercept and pass the ball back to Lukic. The final whistle confirmed Arsenal as champions, with the two sides inseparable on points and goal difference meaning the visitors won the title by virtue of having scored eight more goals than Liverpool throughout the season. Arsenal received the Championship trophy after the match.|$|E
5|$|When County cricket resumed in England in 1946, Yorkshire won the County Championship. Yardley scored 788 runs at {{an average}} of 23.17, <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> century, for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire. With the ball, he was used less {{frequently}} than before the war and took only nine wickets. He was not selected for any Test matches, but appeared for England in a Test trial and scored 39 and 11. He also played twice for the MCC and represented the Gentlemen against the Players, making 29 and a duck in a heavy defeat for the amateurs. Critics regarded his season as unsuccessful, but he was chosen as vice-captain to Hammond on the tour to Australia that winter, continuing his pre-war role.|$|E

5|$|Both {{ships were}} damaged in the engagement, {{although}} Saumarez's damage was almost entirely confined to his rigging: very few shots had actually struck his hull during the battle, {{and the only}} one that provoked notice passed across the deck without causing injury and struck a cannon on the opposite site, setting it off {{in the direction of a}} number of small gunboats that were approaching from the shore. Casualties on Crescent were equally light, <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> man injured; he had been standing too close to his own cannon during the opening broadside and had been struck by the recoiling gun, suffering a broken leg. Damage and losses on the French ship were very severe, with the rigging in tatters, the hull and lower masts repeatedly struck and casualties that Saumarez initially estimated at more than 120 men killed or wounded, although French accounts give the lower figure of 33 killed and 48 wounded.|$|E
5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|E
5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
