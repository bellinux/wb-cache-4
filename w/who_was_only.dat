5|$|The Indian Princess {{certainly}} began a long American {{tradition of}} romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> {{a child in}} Smith’s original accounts.

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Raelle Tucker, and marked the directorial debut of series creator Eric Kripke. It {{featured}} the return of deceased characters Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) and Jessica Moore (Adrianne Palicki). Kripke enjoyed expanding upon the character of Mary, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> briefly depicted in earlier episodes. The production schedule had to be altered to accommodate Palicki, who was simultaneously working on the TV series Friday Night Lights.|$|E

5|$|When casting for {{the role}} of Dorothy, Warner Bros. {{declined}} to audition any actresses younger than the age of 30; Jennifer O'Neill's agent, who had developed a fondness for the script, convinced the studio to audition his client, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> 22 at the time. O'Neill auditioned {{for the role}}, albeit hesitantly, not wanting to perform any nude scenes. O'Neill got the role and Mulligan agreed {{to find a way to}} make the film work without blatant nudity.|$|E
5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (<b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E
5|$|Charles X died in February 1660 and was {{succeeded by}} a regency council—led by {{the queen mother}} Hedvig Eleonora—that ruled {{in the name of}} Charles XI <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> four {{at the time of his}} father's death. Sweden had come close to almost {{complete}} control over trade in the Baltic, but the war revealed the need to work against the formation of anti-Swedish alliances that included Denmark, especially with France, the most powerful state in Europe at the time. There were some successes in foreign policy with the anti-French 1668 Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic.|$|E

5|$|ESPN {{noted the}} {{worldwide}} success of women horse trainers in 2013, particularly owing to wins {{in three of}} the world's major races within a one-month period. In October, Criquette Head-Maarek won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe with Treve, the only woman trainer to win the Arc. Then, a few days after Ritvo's horse won the Breeders' Cup Classic, the Melbourne Cup was won by Fiorente, a horse trained by Australian trainer Gai Waterhouse, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> the second woman to train a winner in that race.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Wetherby resumed his private law practice. In 1956, Senator Alben Barkley {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a}} heart attack. The timing of his death meant that the state would elect two senators in 1956—Clements' term was expiring and now Barkley's seat was vacant. President Eisenhower convinced former senator and ambassador John Sherman Cooper to be the Republican candidate for the seat, hoping Cooper's immense popularity in the state would help his own re-election bid. Barkley's death occurred so late in the year that there was not time for a Democratic primary to choose the party's candidate for the open seat. The Democratic state committee chose Wetherby, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> six months removed from his term as governor.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, the Duke of York's {{conversion}} to Catholicism became public, and {{he married a}} Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> {{six and a half}} years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke of York was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father. There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well together, and the Duke of York was a conscientious and loving father.|$|E

They competed in one sport, Bobsledding, in both the two-man and four-man events and {{finished}} outside the medal places in both competitions. Athletes were recruited from the Jamaica Defence Force, which saw Dudley Stokes, Devon Harris and Michael White become the first members of the team. Caswell Allen was the fourth man, but was injured prior to the start of the Olympics and was replaced by Chris Stokes, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> in Canada to support his brother and new teammate Dudley.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon's early {{education}} was {{obtained in the}} public schools of Madisonville. While there, one of his teachers was his sister, Susan Isabella Laffoon, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> 16 years old. At age 15, while plowing a field, Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule, requiring a six-week stay in a Nashville hospital. In the winter of the same year, he slipped on some ice and re-injured the hip. As a result of these injuries, his right leg was one-and-a-half inches shorter than his left leg, requiring him to wear special shoes and walk with a cane and a limp {{for the rest of his}} life. After his injury, Laffoon's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to the private school of W. C. O'Bryan. By age 17, he was teaching in the common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County.|$|E
5|$|Rajam died of typhoid in 1939. Her death {{affected}} Narayan {{deeply and}} he remained depressed {{for a long}} time; he was also concerned for their daughter Hema, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> three years old. The bereavement brought about {{a significant change in}} his life and was the inspiration behind his next novel, The English Teacher. This book, like his first two books, is autobiographical, but more so, and completes an unintentional thematic trilogy following Swami and Friends and The Bachelor of Arts. In subsequent interviews, Narayan acknowledges that The English Teacher was almost entirely an autobiography, albeit with different names for the characters and the change of setting in Malgudi; he also explains that the emotions detailed in the book reflected his own at the time of Rajam's death.|$|E

5|$|Since Mayor Senkichi Awaya {{had been}} killed while eating breakfast with his son and granddaughter at the mayoral residence, Field Marshal Hata, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> {{slightly}} wounded, took over {{the administration of the}} city, and coordinated relief efforts. Many of his staff {{had been killed}} or fatally wounded, including a Korean prince of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi Wu, who was serving as a lieutenant colonel in the Japanese Army. Hata's senior surviving staff officer was the wounded Colonel Kumao Imoto, who acted as his chief of staff. Soldiers from the undamaged Hiroshima Ujina Harbor used suicide boats, intended to repel the American invasion, to collect the wounded and take them down the rivers to the military hospital at Ujina. Trucks and trains brought in relief supplies and evacuated survivors from the city.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of York {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in 1668 or 1669, but Mary and Anne {{were brought up}} as Anglicans, pursuant to the command of Charles II. They were moved to their own establishment at Richmond Palace, where they were raised by their governess Lady Frances Villiers, with only occasional visits to see their parents at St James's or their grandfather Lord Clarendon at Twickenham. Mary's education, from private tutors, was largely restricted to music, dance, drawing, French, and religious instruction. Her mother died in 1671, and her father remarried in 1673, taking as his second wife Mary of Modena, a Catholic <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> four years older than Mary.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lairds {{transformed}} the estate into a valuable asset. Lord Pitfour, the second laird, purchased additional lands including Deer Abbey and Inverugie Castle. Pitfour's son, James Ferguson, {{who became the}} third laird, continued to improve and expand the estate by adding the lake and bridges, and establishing planned villages. The third laird died a bachelor with no children, so the estate passed to the elderly George Ferguson, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> in possession of the property for a few months. George was already a wealthy man, owning lands in Trinidad and Tobago, but despite not directly improving the Pitfour estate he added considerable value to the inheritance passed to his illegitimate son. The extravagant lifestyles of the fifth and sixth lairds led to the sequestration of the estate, which was sold off piecemeal to pay their debts.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1534, the 22 {{year old}} Mercator arrived back in Leuven and threw himself into the study of geography, {{mathematics}} and astronomy {{under the guidance of}} Gemma Frisius. Mercator was completely out of his depth but, with the help and friendship of Gemma, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> four years older, he succeeded in mastering the elements of mathematics within two years and the university granted him permission to tutor private students. Gemma had designed some of the mathematical instruments used in these studies and Mercator soon become adept in the skills of their manufacture: practical skills of working in brass, mathematical skills for calculation of scales and engraving skills to produce the finished work.|$|E

The investigation then turns to Granny, who reveals that, unbeknownst to her family, she is an extreme sports enthusiast. During a ski race earlier that day, she was attacked by the opposing team, but got away safely after learning that they were hired by the Goody Bandit.|$|E
5|$|With funding {{provided}} by the Fitch and the Jamaica Tourist Board, training was conducted in Canada and Austria {{in preparation for the}} 1988 Winter Olympics. Sepp Haidacher was recruited as a coach, and the team began to be featured in North American media with a comical angle. An agreement was reached with the Fédération International de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing in order to allow for entrance in both the four-man and the two-man events at the Games. Once in Calgary, the team conducted test runs on a frozen lake in order {{to get used to the}} conditions, but Allen fell and was injured.
