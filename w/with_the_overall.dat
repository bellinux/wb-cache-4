5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} {{than it is in}} the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions.

Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E
