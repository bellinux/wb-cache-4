50|$|For {{those who}} prefer to place {{the bulk of their}} phone calls from home or work computers, C2Call GmbH’s <b>WebPhone</b> version assists them with all the browser-powered VoIP protocol. FriendCaller’s <b>WebPhone</b> can be {{permanently}} saved on almost any desktop computer free of charge. Users can have 7-Way Cross-platform Mobile Video Chat in real time with up to 27 people.|$|E
50|$|The first {{beta version}} of the Jajah <b>Webphone,</b> a {{proprietary}} peer-to-peer internet telephony (VoIP) softphone, was released in July 2005.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first report of a very recent study of the users and uses of the Internet in Japan. Survey data from 1320 adult {{respondents}} was collected in late 2002 in the somewhat rural prefecture of Yamanashi, not far from Tokyo. Participants were asked about their use of both mobile phones and personal computers (PCs) : how often they used them, what they used them for, whom they contacted, {{and what was the}} nature of their social networks and social support. As the first paper reporting these findings, we compare the users of Internet-connected PCs and web-enabled mobile phones (which we call "webphones"). We report {{on the extent to which}} they communicate and the nature of their social networks. Our key research questions are: a. Who uses <b>webphones</b> and PCs? b. How do people use them? Research for this study has been supported by grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, The Matsushita International Foundation, the Social Science and Research Council of Canada and the U. S. National Science Foundation. The Centre for Urban and Community Studies, University of Toronto, happily hosted Kakuko Miyata on her research leave, 2002 - 2003. We thank Mitsuhiro Ura, Hiroshi Hirano, Tetsuro Kobayshi, Kaichiro Furutani, Irena Shklovski, Mimi Ito and Rachel Yould for their advice, and Vicky Boase, Monica Prijatelj, and Uyen Quach for their assistance in the final preparation of this paper. In part, our work addresses the ongoing debate about the effects of Internet use on community and alienation. We differ from other studies by: a. Focusing on the Japanese context, which is so different than the more widelyreported American context. b. Comparing communication via mobile phones and PCs. While we believe that our results are interesting in themselves, we further b [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Besides {{registering}} for an account; iOS, Android and <b>WebPhone</b> {{users can}} also log into FriendCaller using their Facebook ID via Facebook Connect.|$|E
50|$|Users {{can also}} {{download}} and install WebPhoneFX on their desktop PC, Mac OS, or Linux. It's an installable version of FriendCaller's <b>WebPhone</b> to call anyone directly.|$|E
50|$|<b>WebPhone</b> {{supports}} instant video calls {{straight from}} the browsers. Connecting with anyone {{does not require the}} other party to have FriendCaller installed on their operating systems. One can contact FriendCaller user via CallMe-Link.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other VoIP-based {{telephony}} services, {{there is}} no software to download, install and configure. The browser-based Internet phone, FriendCaller <b>WebPhone,</b> [...] lets the user experience next generation VoIP technology with Group Video Calling, without having the need for any pre-requisite software installation. C2Call is a venture-backed company that has generated more than $2 million in revenue since April 2010.|$|E
50|$|In April 2008, Optimus {{launched}} the TAG tariff. For a €10 monthly, converted in credit for communications, all communications between TAG users (voice and video calls, SMS and MMS, usage of Mobile Instant Messenger - Optimus Messenger and MSN) are absolutely free and limitless. There {{is also a}} PC-based application working as a <b>WebPhone,</b> where all sorts of communications {{can be made in}} the same manner that in a mobile phone (including incoming communications).|$|E
50|$|However, several tentatives {{failed at}} the {{beginning}} and internauts took some time to approve the initiative because of hardware and bandwidth limitations {{by the time it was}} developed. Other developers released similar products but the distinctive features of Call You Free was that it used Click2Call Technology, that lets the caller place his webcall using a <b>webphone</b> within a browser. Remember that all the earliest transmissions of voice over internet protocol required separate software to establish the communication. We are talking about using only the internet browser. That was really a new concept.|$|E
40|$|Since, the 3 G {{network is}} well-developed, the {{increasing}} business requirements motivate {{the need for}} content-orientated services delivery, which plays {{a critical role in}} supporting value-added services to user. The dynamic content-orientated services delivery has the ability to provide value-added services through push content-orientated services that some research effort has been made to promote it in both academia and industry. The technology requires mechanisms to ensure the available services can be correctly pushed, which should include services select, content recommend, data transmission and services display. In this study, an efficient and flexible solution based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been proposed to sending services to <b>WebPhone</b> by using Session Initial Protocol (SIP). A framework for service push is introduced by using Widget to implement web services composition and interaction. After that, it showed architecture and a prototype for content-orientated services delivery. At last, some functional design of <b>WebPhone</b> is discussed. In conclusion, our approach is an improvement method to enhance the performance of content-orientated services delivery in 3 G Network...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} demand for converged solutions in telecommunication sector. Up until recently only monolithic solutions were available which were consequently expensive. There are several tools at our disposal today, which permit us to develop converged solutions in-house. Many among them are available for free. In thesis is addressed a problemof convergence of IP telephony and worldwide-web. Our goal is to present a converged solution in form of a web application - <b>WebPhone.</b> Application provides telephone and web services to its users and has been developed using exclusively open source tools and libraries. Furthermore, the solution permits further extensions in form of additional services. A substantial part of the thesis is concentrated on SIP. SIP is a protocol used for handling VoIP sessions. Theoretical background of SIP is described {{at the beginning of}} the thesis using simple examples and its practical use inside the application in the following chapters. <b>WebPhone</b> application was written in Java using tools Mobicents, Seam and JBoss AS. During evaluation we took note of usability, modularity and portability. Usability was verified by integrating the application into telephone network and modularity by incorporating a new functionality into the application. Portability was shown to be varying depending on its type. In general we succeeded to demonstrate the possibility of developing a converged application using the right protocols, tools and libraries. ...|$|E
40|$|Once upon a time, {{not so long}} ago, {{people were}} rooted to their homes and {{workplaces}} by computers that were wired in place by electric and Internet cables. In those days, the magic book was called Wired magazine. Its vibrant pages told all that was avant-garde about the Internet {{and other forms of}} computer-mediated communication. Its name evoked how computer-mediated communication electronically connected people to the world. Then mobility came. First, portable computers – originally 11 kg backbreakers – shrank into portable notebooks weighing 2 – 4 kg. Software became standardized and the Internet globally available, so wherever people went they could connect with the network. Personal digital assistants, such as the Palm, became capable of accessing the Internet. However, the most widespread change was the birth of mobile phones, which became as common in people’s pockets and handbags as their keys. By the turn of the 21 st century, mobile phones had become <b>webphone...</b>|$|E
