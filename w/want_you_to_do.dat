500|$|At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge's Division was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps and was stationed {{on the east side}} of the Stones River. When the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Major General William Rosecrans, attacked on December 31, 1862, beginning the Battle of Stones River, Bragg's main force initially repelled the attack. Bragg ordered Breckinridge to reinforce him on the west side of the river, but Brigadier General John Pegram, who commanded a Cavalry brigade, erroneously reported that a large Union force was advancing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was slow to comply with Bragg's order. When he finally crossed the river, his attacks were ineffective, and Bragg ordered him back across the river. By January 2, Union forces had taken a ridge that ran along the river; against Breckinridge's advice, Bragg ordered the 2nd Division to launch a near-suicidal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, [...] "if [...] should result in disaster and I be among the killed, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to my memory and tell the people that I believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it." ...|$|E
500|$|Disney then {{assigned}} Larry Clemmons as his new {{writer and}} one of the four story men for the film, giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling's book, and telling him: [...] "The first thing I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is not to read it." [...] Clemmons still looked at the novel, and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity, needing adaptations to fit a film script. Clemmons wanted to start in medias res, with some flashbacks afterwards, but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight - [...] "Let's do the meat of the picture. Let's establish the characters. Let's have fun with it.". Although much of Bill Peet's work was discarded, the personalities of the characters remained in the final film. This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple, and the characters should drive the story. Disney took {{an active role in the}} story meetings, acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters, help create gags and develop emotional sequences. Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most sequences. The story artists then discussed how to fill the scenes, including the comedic gags to employ. The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other. The Jungle Book also marks the last animated film from the company to have Disney's personal touches, before his death on December 15, 1966.|$|E

2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside.

[...] Buck though, would add that although he knew Tim McCarver well, they never developed a good relationship with each other on the air despite high hopes to the contrary.

2500|$|After {{two years}} of calling {{baseball}} telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week, All-Star Game, National League Championship Series, and World Series), Buck was dismissed by CBS. The official reasoning behind Buck's ouster was that he simply had poor chemistry with lead analyst Tim McCarver. Buck was soon replaced by Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Buck later noted that [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let McCarver run the show ... In television, all they <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is shut up. I'm {{not very good at}} shutting up."

2500|$|In 1950, Harry Truman called Smathers into {{a meeting}} at the White House and {{reportedly}} said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> me a favor. I want you to beat that son-of-a-bitch Claude Pepper." [...] Pepper had been part of an unsuccessful 1948 campaign to [...] "dump Truman" [...] as the Democratic presidential nominee, and Smathers had been his manager and pupil. Smathers challenged the incumbent senator in the Democratic primary and won by a margin of over 60,000 votes. The race was marked by echoes of the Red Scare. Smathers repeatedly attacked Pepper for having Communist sympathies, pointing out his pro-civil rights platform and campaign for universal health care as well as his travels to the Soviet Union in 1945.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the 1950 Florida Senate election, President Harry Truman called George Smathers into {{a meeting}} at the White House and {{reportedly}} said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> me a favor. I want you to beat that son-of-a-bitch Claude Pepper." [...] Pepper had been part of an unsuccessful 1948 campaign to [...] "dump Truman" [...] as the Democratic presidential nominee. Smathers ran against him in the Democratic primary (which at the time in Florida was tantamount to election, the Republican Party still being in infancy there). The contest was extremely heated, and revolved around policy issues, especially charges that Pepper represented the far left and was too supportive of Stalin. Pepper's opponents circulated widely a 49-page booklet titled The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper. Pepper was defeated in the primary by Smathers.|$|E

2500|$|According to Badu, the album's closing track, [...] "Out My Mind, Just in Time", is a three-{{movement}} song: [...] "The first {{movement is}} called 'Recovering Undercover Over-lover.'

It's typical of how you feel in relationships. The second movement is called ... 'Easier Said Than Done,' and it's about {{how hard it is to}} change after you've been in a relationship for so long. And then the third movement is called 'But Not This Time,' because even though I've done things a certain way for so long, I won't do that this time". Andy Kellman of AllMusic described the song as being innocently as a piano ballad, before changing into a [...] "psychedelic, slow-motion soul-jazz" [...] song that sees Badu becoming [...] "increasingly fragmentary and tripped-out" [...] before being [...] "renewed." ...|$|E
2500|$|All major {{religions}} accept {{organ donation}} {{in at least}} some form on either utilitarian grounds (i.e., because of its life-saving capabilities) or deontological grounds (e.g., the right of an individual believer to make his or her own decision). Most religions, among them the Roman Catholic Church, support organ donation {{on the grounds that it}} constitutes an act of charity and provides a means of saving a life, consequently Pope Francis is an organ donor. One religious group, The Jesus Christians, became known as [...] "The Kidney Cult" [...] because more than half its members had donated their kidneys altruistically. Jesus Christians claim altruistic kidney donation is a great way to [...] "Do unto others what they would <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> unto them." [...] Some religions impose certain restrictions on the types of organs that may be donated and/or on the means by which organs may be harvested and/or transplanted. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses require that organs be drained of any blood due to their interpretation of the Hebrew Bible/Christian Old Testament as prohibiting blood transfusion, and Muslims require that the donor have provided written consent in advance. A few groups disfavor organ transplantation or donation; notably, these include Shinto and those who follow the customs of the Gypsies.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Warrior began {{competing}} for the WCWA Texas Heavyweight Championship, losing to Bob Bradley in a tournament final on January 12. He won the title from Bradley on February 2 of that year. The title was held up in April 1987 after Warrior left the WCCW. He was reinstated as champion upon returning, but vacated it once more upon resigning from WCCW to join the World Wrestling Federation, where he adopted the ring name The Ultimate Warrior. Warrior began appearing on house shows in June and was initially billed as The Dingo Warrior in house card promos by Gene Okerlund, but soon had his name modified. There is dispute over who created the Ultimate Warrior name. Bruce Prichard stated that Vince McMahon {{did not know what}} a [...] "Dingo" [...] Warrior was, but because there was the [...] "Modern Day Warrior" [...] Kerry von Erich and The Road Warriors there should not be one more simple warrior, but the ultimate warrior. Warrior claims after one of his first matches, McMahon had him do a pretaped promo. It was there Vince said we <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Warrior, but we don't want Dingo. The Warrior then proceeded to cut the promo and stated that he was not this warrior or that warrior, he was The Ultimate Warrior.|$|E

James Skinner from BBC praised Rihanna's vocals on the song [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] and wrote that her voice is powerful and that [...] "it is Rihanna's vocal– at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable– that anchors the song, and Loud itself". Andy Gill from The Independent feels that [...] "California King Bed" [...] features her best vocal performance. In a review of Unapologetic, Billboard magazine wrote, [...] "Diamonds finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date, on this inspirational pop ballad." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times stated, [...] "over the years, as her game face froze in place, her voice cured into a weapon of emotional chill and strategic indifference.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners {{and a lot of}} other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E
