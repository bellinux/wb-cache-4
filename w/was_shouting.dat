25|$|The būdinys (the {{descriptive}} or intensifying participle) {{reinforces the}} meaning of the verb being described: Šaukte šaukiausi pagalbos, niekas neatsiliepė – I <b>was</b> <b>shouting</b> loudly for help, nobody answered. Type I būdinys is used relatively often in some written and colloquial speech. Type II būdinys is very rare and can only be found in literary language. Their primary function is the same. In some grammars they are not considered verbs, but adverbs derived from verbs.|$|E
25|$|In frustration, Ryan forced Mitchinson to back off, {{then got}} out of the passenger's side door and noticed Walker running towards him, being chased by Hodson who was holding the pipe in his hand. Walker <b>was</b> <b>shouting</b> frantically to Ryan that prison guard William Bennett, {{standing}} on the Number 2 prison tower, had his rifle aimed at them. At this time, Hodson was chasing Walker, Ryan took a couple of steps forward and raised his rifle and aimed it at Hodson.|$|E
25|$|Dean, who {{had been}} {{suffering}} with a severe bout of the flu for several days, attended a post-caucus rally for his volunteers at the Val-Air Ballroom in West Des Moines, Iowa and delivered his concession speech, aimed at cheering up those in attendance. Dean <b>was</b> <b>shouting</b> over the cheers of his enthusiastic audience, but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} with Ringelmann's first findings, Bibb Latané et al. replicated previous social loafing findings while demonstrating that the decreased performance of groups was attributable to reduced individual effort, {{as distinct from}} a deterioration due to coordination. They showed this by blindfolding male college students while making them wear headphones that masked all noise. They then asked them to shout both in actual groups and pseudogroups in which they shouted alone but believed they were shouting with others. When subjects believed one other person <b>was</b> <b>shouting,</b> they shouted 82% as intensely as they did alone, but with five others, their effort decreased to 74%.|$|E
500|$|Akira Ishida voiced {{the protagonist}} in this Japanese adaptation. He noted {{that since he}} was {{presented}} with the roles of both Pharos and the protagonist, recording {{the scene of the}} protagonist's initial meeting with Pharos was something he enjoyed. In the English version of Persona 3 the role of both the protagonist and Ryoji is taken by Yuri Lowenthal. As with his previous role as protagonist of the [...] games, Lowenthal did not have extensive dialogue lines. His main task <b>was</b> <b>shouting</b> out the names of Personas: localization editor Yu Namba was initially worried about his performance, but Lowenthal managed to pronounce the names correctly. He attributed this to his love for Dungeons & Dragons.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the credited actors, the crew had a crowd of extras for one day of filming. Around 12 extras were used; budget constraints allowed this number for a day, or five extras for two days. This constraint led {{to a change in}} the script, seeing the crowd removed from the trial. Although uncredited, Goody Two-Shoes was played by an actress who had appeared in Psychoville, one of Pemberton and Shearsmith's previous productions, as Joanne Dunderdale, an understudy. The writers were complimentary of Cooper's performance; they said that he was almost [...] "conducting" [...] the crowd of extras, in that they were noisy when he <b>was</b> <b>shouting,</b> and quiet when he stopped.|$|E

And that's the way I went, except that it came out {{on the other side of}} the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. But then his brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn't ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be déclassé. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have a big victory. He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about it. Never did. Why should I? ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 May the theatre was packed. Gustav Linor reported, [...] "Never... has the hall been so full, or so resplendent; the {{stairways}} and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear". The evening began with Les Sylphides, in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles. The Rite followed. Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, and grew in a crescendo when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in [...] "Augurs of Spring". But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts, [...] "it was not Stravinsky's music that did the shocking. It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky." [...] Marie Rambert, who was working {{as an assistant to}} Nijinsky, recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear the music on the stage. In his autobiography, Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him, and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings. The demonstrations, he says, grew into [...] "a terrific uproar" [...] which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who <b>was</b> <b>shouting</b> the step numbers to the dancers. The journalist and photographer Carl Van Vechten recorded that the person behind him got carried away with excitement, and [...] "began to beat rhythmically on top of my head", though Van Vechten failed to notice this at first, his own emotion being so great.|$|E

Osbourne {{revealed}} she was surrounded by violence during her childhood and that it was a normal occurrence to see her father threatening someone, or brandishing a firearm. In an interview in 2001, she commented that her father has never seen her children and that [...] "he never will". Osbourne had told her children that their grandfather was dead, but they unknowingly saw {{him for the first time}} when Osbourne <b>was</b> <b>shouting</b> abuse at him on a street in Los Angeles. When asked who she <b>was</b> <b>shouting</b> at, she replied Tony Curtis. They were reunited in 2001 and he then had a role in their reality show The Osbournes.

Chelsea invited me to be a ball-boy for a match against Liverpool and it was fantastic to meet my heroes Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler. I was a Liverpool fan simply because my dad followed them.

2500|$|After the U.S. Department of State placed Al-Manar on the Terrorist Exclusion List on 17 December 2004, {{transmissions}} to North America via Intelsat's satellites were blocked. Javed Iqbal, {{a resident}} of New York City is {{the first person to}} charged under this law. Iqbal, 45, a Pakistani who had been living in the U.S. for more than 25 years, was charged by federal prosecutors with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization by broadcasting Al Manar to U.S. customers, in exchange for thousands of dollars payment. In a 2008 plea bargain, he agreed to serve a prison term of up to [...] years. Saleh Elahwal, who also operates HDTV, was also charged and went on trial 5 January 2009. Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, says it's constitutional for the government to outlaw businesses with direct operational ties to terrorist organizations, and media outlets that directly incite and direct violent action, but in this case, the government is trying {{to stop the spread of}} ideas. Mark Dubowitz, who founded the Coalition Against Terrorist Media to in part stop Al-Manar, said Al-Manar <b>was</b> <b>shouting</b> fire in a crowded theater, although Lieberman disagreed with that metaphor.|$|E
2500|$|In {{pursuit of}} the ADF, Kishi visited India, Pakistan, Burma, Thailand, Ceylon, and Taiwan in May 1957, asking the leaders of those nations to join the ADF, but with the {{exception}} of Taiwan, which agreed to join, all {{of the leaders of the}} those nations gave equivocal answers. Through he always denied it in public, but Kishi saw the ADF as an economic version of the [...] "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" [...] that Japan had sought to establish in World War II, which contributed to the failure of the proposed ADF as memories of the Japanese occupation were too fresh in Southeast Asia. To many people in Southeast Asia, the slogan [...] "Economic Development for Asia by Asia" [...] sounded too much like the wartime Japanese slogan [...] "Asia for Asians!". During World War II, the Japanese state had always presented the war as a race war between Asians vs. the [...] "white devils", portraying the war as a Pan-Asian crusade to unite all of the peoples of Asia against the [...] "white devils". The Japanese had been generally welcomed as liberators from European imperialism when they arrived in Southeast Asia, but soon the peoples of Southeast Asia had learned the Japanese did not regard other Asians as equals, as the Japanese had a habit of slapping the faces of the peoples they ruled to remind them who were the [...] "Great Yamato race" [...] and who were not. [...] The Burmese Prime Minister U Nu had, like everyone else in the Burmese elite, been a Japanese collaborator in World War II. Precisely because of his past U Nu told Kishi during his visit to Rangoon that he was reluctant to join the ADF as it would remind the Burmese people of the days when he <b>was</b> <b>shouting</b> Pan-Asian rhetoric, praising Japan as the natural leader of Asia and declaring how happy he was to serve the Japanese. Even in countries that were not occupied by Japan like India, Ceylon and Pakistan, Kishi encountered obstacles. During his visit to Karachi, the Pakistani Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy told Kishi that he thought of himself as a [...] "human being rather than an Asian first", preferred bilateral over multilateral aid as it allowed Pakistan to play off rival nations for better terms, and that Pakistan would not join the ADF if India also joined. Suhrawadry made it clear that until the Kashmir dispute was settled to Pakistan's satisfaction that Pakistan would not be joining any organization that India was a member of. [...] The Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru told Kishi during his visit to New Delhi that he wanted his nation to be neutral in the Cold War, and that as Japan was allied to the United States, joining the ADF would be in effect aligning India with the Americans. In Colombo, the Ceylonese Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, through not objecting to the ADF in principle, told Kishi that he preferred bilateral aid deals as it allowed Ceylon to play off the Soviet Union against the United States, and objected to the provision that joining the ADF would mean be [...] "locked in" [...] to only accepting aid from the ADF. Only during his visit to Taiping did Kishi receive outright acceptance of the ADF, through the Taiwanese press statement proclaiming the ADF would be most useful for stopping the rise of Communism in Asia proved embarrassing for Kishi as he had maintained in public that the ADF was supposed to be an organization for allowing Asians to help other Asians and had nothing to do with the Cold War. Because Japan was a much richer nation than all of the other nations of the proposed ADF combined, the ADF was generally as a vehicle for Japan to re-establish itself as a great power in Asia, as few had any doubt that Japan would be the dominant member of the ADF. Moreover, the fact that the United States was supporting the ADF led the proposed organization to be seen as siding with the United States in the Cold War, a struggle that many Asian nations wanted to be neutral in.|$|E
