40|$|Abstract. Polynomial time unsafe approximations for {{intractable}} {{sets were}} introduced by Meyer and Paterson [9] and Yesha [19], respectively. The question of which sets have optimal unsafe approximations {{has been investigated}} extensively; see, e. g., [1], [5], [15], and [17]. Recently, Wang [15], [17] showed that polynomial time random sets are neither optimally unsafe approximable nor �-levelable. In this paper we show that: (1) There exists a polynomial time stochastic set in the exponential time complexity class which has an optimal unsafe approximation. (2) There exists a polynomial time stochastic set in the exponential time complexity class which is �-levelable. The above two results answer a question asked by Ambos-Spies and Lutz [2]: What kind of natural complexity property can be characterized by p-randomness but not by p-stochasticity? Our above results also extend Ville’s [13] historical result. The proof of our first result shows that, for Ville’s stochastic sequence, we can find an optimal prediction function f such that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> never <b>lose</b> our own money betting according to f (except the money we have earned), that is to say, if at the beginning we have only $ 1 and we always bet $ 1 that the next selected bit is 1, then we always {{have enough money to}} bet on the next bit. Our second result shows that there is a stochastic sequence for which there is a betting strategy f such that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> never <b>lose</b> our own money betting according to f (except the money we have earned), but there is no such optimal betting strategy. That is to say, for any such betting strategy, we can find another betting strategy which could be used to make money more quickly...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular and {{diabetic}} {{disease are}} the leading and preventable causes of death worldwide. The currently prognosticated dramatic increase in disease burden {{over the next two}} decades, however, bespeaks a low confidence in our prevention ability. This conflicts with the almost enthusiastic reporting of study results, which demonstrate substantial risk reductions secondary to simple lifestyle changes. Discussion: There is a case to be made for a disregard of the difference between statistical significance and clinical relevance of the reported data. Nevertheless, lifestyle change remains the main weapon in our battle against the epidemic of cardiometabolic disease. But along the way from risk screening to intervention to maintenance the compound inefficiencies of current primary preventive strategies marginalize their impact. Summary: Unless we dramatically change the ways in which we deploy preventive interventions <b>we</b> <b>will</b> inevitably <b>lose</b> the battle.

30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{language}}, English is the language with more resources and for which more research has been done.

In {{the case of the}} NIST STD 2006 evaluation, very important performance decreases are observed when moving from English to other languages. In the case of our evaluation, we should not expect important decreases due to the use of Spanish since we are conducting a query-by-example evaluation in which language resources are less important and the technology is relatively more language independent. However, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> probably <b>lose</b> some performance due to using a query-by-example setting.
