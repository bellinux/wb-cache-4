25|$|The Allies {{had begun}} a new {{offensive}} at Amiens on 8 August, and the First Surreys joined {{this at the}} Battle of Albert. 47th Division attacked on 22 August from the old Amiens defences towards an objective called the Green Line, on the high ground east of 'Happy Valley'. 140th Brigade was in support, intended to exploit any success in conjunction with Whippet tanks and the cavalry of the Northumberland Hussars. However, the division's leading brigades encountered stiffer than expected opposition, the tanks and cavalry were unable to get through, and the Green Line was not reached. 140th Brigade therefore made a fresh attack on the night at 01.00 on 24 August. This surprise night attack was a complete success, the regimental historian reporting that 'In brilliant moonlight, and with a splendid barrage, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>over,</b> and were almost immediately in the trenches which formed our objective'. However, the battalion's left-hand company was severely shot up by a German strongpoint that the neighbouring division had failed to capture. The following afternoon the strongpoint was finally suppressed by tanks. The following night the battalion renewed the advance behind a creeping barrage, gaining two miles with almost no opposition.|$|E
500|$|Above the waterline, {{there was}} little {{evidence}} of the collision. The stewards in the first class dining room noticed a shudder, which they thought might {{have been caused by}} the ship shedding a propeller blade. Many of the passengers felt a bump or shudder – [...] "just as though <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> about a thousand marbles", as one survivor put it – but did not know what had happened. Those on the lowest decks, nearest the site of the collision, felt it much more directly. Engine Oiler Walter Hurst recalled being [...] "awakened by a grinding crash along the starboard side. No one was very much alarmed but knew we had struck something". Fireman George Kemish heard a [...] "heavy thud and grinding tearing sound" [...] from the starboard hull.|$|E
500|$|Atkinson {{has said}} that in the buildup to the final episode, he began to psychologically {{experience}} something of his character's apprehension. Speaking to Michael Parkinson in 2003, he recalled [...] "I remember...in {{the weeks leading up to}} the one day recording of that final episode when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the top, for the first time in my acting career...knowing that even though the rest of the episode was its usual standard funny sitcom self, there was this deep twist in my stomach throughout that week thinking along with your character that you were doomed. It was most peculiar. I'm sure serious character actors feel this all the time... Obviously if you're trying to feel the character and his dilemma then you're going to experience some of the fictional feelings for real. You felt swept along by it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vaughan owed {{his guitar}} {{technique}} {{in large part}} to Lonnie Mack. Vaughan said, [...] "I got a lot of my fast stuff from Lonnie" [...] and observed in live performance that Mack was [...] "ahead of his time". In 1987, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. Mack recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978: [...] "We was in Texas looking for pickers, and we went out to see the Thunderbirds. Jimmie was saying, 'Man, you gotta hear my little brother. He plays all your [...]' He was playing a little place called the Rome Inn, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> there and checked him out. As it would be, when I walked in the door, he was playing 'Wham!' And I said, 'Dadgum.' He was playing it right. I'd been playing it wrong {{for a long time and}} needed to go back and listen to my original record. That was in '78, I believe." [...] Vaughan owed part of his enduring style—especially his use of tremolo picking and vibrato—to Mack. He acknowledged that Mack taught him to [...] "play guitar from the heart". Vaughan's relationship with another Texas blues legend, Johnny Winter, was a little more complex. Although they met several times, and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material, as in the case of Boot Hill, Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography, [...] "Raisin' Cain", Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. [...] "We even played together over at Tommy Shannon's house one time." [...] Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a Blues Festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill, explaining that he has been misquoted and that [...] "Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him". [...] Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that [...] "mine's a little bit rawer, I think." ...|$|E
