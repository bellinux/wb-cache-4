500|$|Lessing {{dedicated}} Shikasta to her father. While she {{was still}} a child in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) he often used to gaze up at the night sky and say, [...] "Makes you think – there are so many worlds up there, wouldn't really matter if we did blow ourselves up – plenty more where we came from." [...] Shikasta gave rise to a religious cult in America. Lessing {{said in an interview that}} its followers had written to her and asked, [...] "When are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> visited by the gods?", and she told them that the book is [...] "not a cosmology. It's an invention", and they replied, [...] "Ah, you're just testing us".|$|E
500|$|As {{the debate}} {{stage of the}} {{election}} began, Biden participated in the first presidential debate of the election on April 26, 2007 in South Carolina. He was the second {{to respond to a}} question originally posed to Senator Hillary Clinton on whether Senator Harry Reid's assessment that the war in Iraq was [...] "lost" [...] is factual. Biden responded by stating the war is not a [...] "game show" [...] or a [...] "football game", which can be lost. He went on to argue that the real question that should be asked is, [...] "Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to leave Iraq... and leave behind something other than chaos?" [...] He elaborated on this statement revealing his belief in the need for a change in the strategy for Iraq, declaring that the United States has to [...] "change the fundamental premise of this engagement, and that is... to decentralize Iraq... give the regions control over their own destiny..." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of , {{at least}} four demonstrations have been held {{around the country in}} {{response}} to DuBose's death. A Black Lives Matter vigil and rally in support of DuBose was held in Cincinnati on , the third such event since the shooting. The victim's mother said, [...] "As long as we stand up for the righteous, <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> OK. I would come out here every night, I will go city to city because now I'm involved, my child was involved." [...] Participants chanted [...] "I am Sam DuBose." [...] Around 300 participants subsequently walked through Over-the-Rhine to Fountain Square. Six people were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest during the march. One hundred protesters joined a [...] "United March for Justice" [...] on , linking DuBose's killing with the deaths of Tamir Rice, John Crawford, and Samantha Ramsey.|$|E
60|$|Jack and Algernon [Speaking together.] Our Christian names! Is that all? But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> christened this afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|But why? Darling! My darling, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> parted, and now we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> together. Can {{anything}} matter beside that? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{the end of}} that game," [...] muttered Snap, much crestfallen. [...] "Boys, {{it looks}} as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> skunked to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How frank are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> How full are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> Anyhow--we {{can break}} off at any time.... We'll try it. We'll try it.... And so for this {{journey into the}} west of England.... And--if we can get there--I'm not sure {{that we can get}} there--into the secret places of my heart." ...|$|E
60|$|Synge {{has promised}} me {{an article for}} Dana too. Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants {{something}} in Irish. I hope you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't {{particularly}} good of me at all, Anne. I {{was pleased to}} be able to do you some small service. Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> friends after this? Have you really forgiven me my old fault?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but Dick, isn't it splendid that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{so close}} <b>to</b> each other? Why, we'll <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> meet lots of times!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Run up and sit awhile with Sister Peace, my dear. She {{likes to}} have you read while she rests, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> busy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{see people}} are leaving, and I am not sorry. As <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> up before daybreak, the sooner one {{turns in the}} better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There'll {{be nothing}} more," [...] {{explained}} Joan. [...] "So {{long as my}} friendship is of any assistance to Robert Phillips in his work, he's going to have it. What use are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in politics--what's all the fuss about, if men and women mustn't work together for their common aims and help one another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't fool us, Savine. We're poor {{men with}} a living to earn, but we're mighty tough, and nobody walks over us with nails in their boots. If you can't hold up that river, where are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> I'd sooner shove in the giant powder to blow them up, than stand by and see my crops and cattle washed out when your big dykes bust." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't to me!" [...] {{cried the}} old man. [...] "We {{are in the}} keeping of the divine Love here, too, and are we happy? Are those who live rightly happy? It's because we're not {{conditioned}} for happiness here; and how are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conditioned differently there? We are going to suffer to all eternity through our passions, our potentialities of experience, there just as we do here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your {{behaviour}} at {{that meeting}} in the family vault, when I told you <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married. Deception, dishonesty, everywhere; all the world's of a piece!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> snowed up here {{we ought}} to try for some game," [...] said Chet. [...] "Maybe I can stir up some rabbits, or something." ...|$|R
30|$|The third result <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> use <b>is</b> as follows.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Are {{we going}} to stand it, boys?--Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done like this, Sergeant Thomas, by a scoundrel and a bully as has led a life beyond mention, in those American mining-camps, and then wants {{to come back and}} make havoc of a poor woman's life and savings, after having left her with a baby in arms to {{struggle}} as best she might? It's a crying shame if nobody will stand up for me--a crying shame--!' ...|$|E
60|$|ASHER. It {{looks like}} more bad news,--the Germans have started {{another one of}} those offensives. I was afraid they were getting ready for it. West of Verdun this time. And George may be in that sector, for all I know. How is this thing going to end, Jonathan? That damned {{military}} machine of theirs seems invincible--it keeps grinding on. Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to stem the tide, or to help stem it with a lot of raw youths. They've only had a year's training.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hullo! How are you? Where {{did they}} catch you? What's {{the latest news}} of Buller's advance? Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exchanged?' {{and a dozen other}} {{questions}} were asked. It was the sort of reception accorded to a new boy at a private school, or, as it seemed to me, to a new arrival in hell. But after we had satisfied our friends in as much as we could, suggestions of baths, clothes, and luncheon were made which were very welcome. So we settled down to what promised to be a long and weary waiting.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beaten, madam," [...] he said dolefully. [...] "Nesborough made a hundred and ninety-eight, and we have six wickets down for fifty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>are</b> <b>we</b> never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> men! <b>We</b> do grow {{along so}} slowly, and France never needed {{soldiers}} as she needs them now, {{to wipe out}} this black insult." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it isn't a blizzard, it <b>is</b> {{next door}} <b>to</b> it," [...] {{returned}} Dave. And {{then he added}} quickly: [...] "It looks {{to me as if}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> snowbound!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps September. We'll see. Oh, Hawk dear, can you {{conceive}} of us actually sitting here and solemnly discussing being married? Us, the babes in the wood? And I've only known you three days or so, seems to me.... Well, as I was saying, perhaps I'll marry you in September (um! frightens {{me to think}} of it; frightens me and awes me and amuses me to death, all at once). That is, I shall marry you unless you take to wearing pearl-gray derbies or white evening ties with black edging, or kill Mason in a duel, or do something equally disgraceful. But engaged I will not be. And we'll put the money for a diamond ring into a big davenport.... Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dreadfully poor?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> merely spectators or listeners-in as at {{any other}} {{interesting}} function, {{with a sort of}} passive curiosity? Or are we in some sense going to consecrate ourselves to the service of God and the welfare of mankind?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Gerard and Commissioner Rodney Woods {{were the}} two dissenting votes when the Largo City Commission voted to {{terminate}} City Manager Stanton following her announcement of her decision to undergo sex reassignment surgery. In a CNN interview, Gerard explained her position of support for Stanton saying, [...] "We're making a decision here about whether we're {{going to be an}} inclusive and compassionate community or are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> small-minded and bigoted." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What, {{you thought}} you had a new place, Purday, and {{circumvented}} us!" [...] cried Hal; [...] "but we smelt you out, you old rogue; <b>we</b> weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> baulked of our bonfire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> full up, but I'll put down your name and {{you can come back}} in the morning," [...] he remarked. [...] "What do you call yourself?" ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{can claim}} {{with at least}} as much {{accuracy}} as a well-known writer claims of his little books, that no newspaper would dare print what we have to say. Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very cruel and abusive, then? By no means: on the contrary, {{we are going to be}} impartial. We have no friends - that is a great thing - and no enemies." [...] Charles Baudelaire, introducing his Review of the Paris Salon of 1845 ...|$|E
5000|$|Pahlka founded Code for America, a San Francisco-based {{non-profit}} organization {{that aims to}} make government more transparent and connected. According to the Washington Post it [...] "is the technology world’s equivalent of the Peace Corps or Teach for America… offering {{an alternative to the}} old, broken path of government IT." [...] In her 2012 TED Talk, Palhlka noted that {{we will not be able}} to reinvent government unless we also reinvent citizenship, and asked [...] "Are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a crowd of hands?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Again, {{with the}} caves, they werent these crazy mazes or {{labyrinths}} of caves that they described. Most {{of them were}} natural caves. Some were supported with some pieces of wood maybe {{about the size of}} a 10-foot by 24-foot room, at the largest. They werent real big. I know they made a spectacle out of that, and how are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to get into them? We worried about that too, because we see all these reports. Then it turns out, when you actually go up there, theres really just small bunkers, and a lot of different ammo storage is up there. - Jeff, Staff Sgt. ODA 572 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! the traitor! the traitor!" [...] she mumbled, almost inaudibly. [...] "Now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> burnt; and I bent my knee to him. No! he {{must run}} at {{the heels of his}} English." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stumped,--just as those other searching parties were stumped," [...] remarked Roger, dismally. [...] "Maybe the lost mine will remain lost forever!" [...] and he sighed deeply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some rare sort of animal," [...] I said, [...] "might comfort {{himself in}} that way while they <b>were</b> {{bringing}} him <b>to</b> the Zoo.... It doesn't follow that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shown all these things." ...|$|R
