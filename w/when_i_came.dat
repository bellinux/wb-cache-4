5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2003, Usher {{submitted}} his fourth studio album, Confessions (2004), to his record label Arista Records. However, when the singer and the company's then-president L.A. Reid listened to the songs, Reid felt the album lacked a song that {{had the potential to}} be released as the album's lead single. In light of this, Usher was told to record a few more tracks, and so he enlisted American rapper-producer Lil Jon to aid in musical production. Lil Jon recalled [...] "He [...] needed a single. They had 'Burn', 'Burn' was hot, but they needed that first powerful monster. That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> in." ...|$|E

Bush said, [...] "Originally when I wrote the song 'The Sensual World', I had used text {{from the end}} of Ulysses. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes." ...|$|E

Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. [...] "It just wasn't right, so I left", Iommi said. [...] "At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having {{a leader in the}} band, which was Ian Anderson's way. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether.

Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium. He said of it, [...] "Frank House was the catcher. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're going to throw you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That's the last time I ever tell you what pitch is coming'." ...|$|E

After he and the company's then-president Antonio [...] "LA" [...] Reid listened to the songs, they felt the album needed a first single and that they needed to create one or two more songs, which caused the album's release to be postponed. Usher went back to the studio and collaborated with Lil Jon, who said, [...] "He needed a single. They had 'Burn,' 'Burn' was hot, but they needed that first powerful monster. That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> in." [...] They worked on few more tracks, including [...] "Red Light", which {{was not included in the}} first release of the album, and [...] "Yeah!", which features Ludacris and Lil Jon.|$|E
500|$|Colbert, a {{historian}} and former head writer {{on the television}} quiz show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, {{became interested in the}} books and bought the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, to see what the story was about. As he was reading, he began to notice mythological references in the book. He commented: [...] "I almost laughed out loud <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> across the three-headed dog [...] I instantly knew it was a reference to Cerberus, the threeheaded beast which Ancient Greeks believed guarded the gates to the Underworld." [...] Inspired by this, Colbert continued to search the book for more references and noticed that most characters' names are based on their personality and every magic creature is a reference to mythology and folklore.|$|E

One incident took place during a game as Doby was sliding into second base when the shortstop from the opposing team spat tobacco juice on him.

After he had retired as a player, Doby recalled memories of {{his days as a}} barrier-breaker. [...] "You know why I hit so well in Washington and St. Louis?

500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to college. By that time, I knew I wanted to write games." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his junior}} year, Presley began {{to stand out}} more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline. In his free time, he would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis's {{thriving}} blues scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes {{in the windows of}} Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing them. Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual [...] "Minstrel" [...] show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with [...] "Till I Waltz Again with You", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: [...] "I wasn't popular in school... I failed music—only thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show... <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that." ...|$|E

My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it.

500|$|In September 2012, {{following}} {{the hiring of}} former General Hospital executive producer Jill Farren Phelps onto the series, Francis was let go from the soap opera due to budgetary cuts from Sony Pictures Television and CBS.

When asked specifically about reports indicating Francis' dismissal, she said: [...] "Genie and I had a wonderful talk <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to Y and I think we're really quite fond of each other. She's a magnificent actress." [...] Despite confirmations that the actress' dismissal was due to budgetary reasons, Jillian Bowe of Zap2it reported a rumor that [...] "the veteran's tenure on the show wasn't well-received by the brass at CBS and Sony". Sara Bibel of Xfinity reported another rumor about her dismissal, saying it was [...] "no secret" [...] that Francis and Phelps [...] "did not get along" [...] while both worked on General Hospital, and that [...] "few are surprised that the two were not eager to work together again".|$|E
500|$|He {{earned his}} first cap for Northern Ireland in a 4–1 home defeat against Germany in a {{friendly}} on 4 June 2005, the Irish Football Association (IFA)'s 125th anniversary match. He came on {{as a substitute for}} Maik Taylor on 76 minutes, conceding one goal scored by Lukas Podolski. On reflection of this match, Ingham said [...] "The reaction of the crowd <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> on was amazing. To be honest I was holding back the tears as I never thought I would get such a reception. I was the proudest man in the ground." [...] For this match, he was offered insurance by the IFA, due to him not yet being under contract at Wrexham. This appearance would result in a £30,000 payment for former club Cliftonville, which came {{as a part of the}} deal for Sunderland to sign him, but by August 2005 this had still to be received by the club. The Premier League was called into the situation by Cliftonville, as they had only received the first part of the payment after he made his first-team debut for Sunderland. Ingham himself was also due a £20,000 bonus for this appearance.|$|E

500|$|Although Peggy did return {{briefly in}} 2004 to attend her {{daughter}} Sam's wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), {{it was not}} until 2005 that she resumed her role as a series regular. Her full return was announced in January 2005, with John Yorke, the BBC controller of continuing drama series, stating he was [...] "delighted" [...] as [...] " [...] is a hugely loved character and one we think will be stirring things up from the moment she steps back into Walford." [...] Windsor said that she was [...] "over the moon" [...] to return, adding: [...] "I had a great time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> back to film {{for a couple of weeks}} recently. It really reminded me that the square is where I feel at home." [...] BBC executives hoped that Peggy's return would help to revive EastEnders ratings. Her absence coincided with a two-year ratings slump for EastEnders, with David Liddiment in The Guardian drawing direct correlation between her return and the show's [...] "ratings rejuvenation". The episode in which she returned was watched by 10 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 47% audience share in the timeslot.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{up with a way to}} tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism.

Leading up to the album sessions, lead vocalist Bono had been reading the works of American writers such as Norman Mailer, Flannery O'Connor, and Raymond Carver so as to understand, in the words of Hot Press editor Niall Stokes, [...] "those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream". Following a September–October 1985 humanitarian visit to Egypt and Ethiopia with his wife Ali, Bono said, [...] "Spending time in Africa and seeing people in the pits of poverty, I still saw a very strong spirit in the people, a richness of spirit I didn't see <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> home...
