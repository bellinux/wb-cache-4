Along {{with the rest of the}} 4th Brigade the 18th Battalion worked on defences to the north of Damascus before the <b>whole</b> <b>division</b> was recalled to Libya on 17 June following the attack on the Eighth Army's Gazala Line by Panzer Army Africa. It was initially based at Mersa Matruh, but after the fall of Tobruk to Rommel's forces, the division was ordered on 25 June to establish defensive positions at Minqar Qaim. The 18th Battalion was temporarily detached from the rest of the 4th Brigade to act as the main infantry component of the divisional reserve.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942 the {{battalion}} {{was sent to}} North Africa and re-designated 156th Parachute Battalion, where it became the central unit of the new 4th Parachute Brigade, formed in December. Waddy was briefly made adjutant of {{the battalion}}, but quickly moved up to the post of the 4th Brigade's Intelligence Officer. The brigade moved from Egypt to Palestine in February 1943, and to Tunisia in June where it joined the 1st Airborne Division, then commanded by Major General George Hopkinson. Waddy recalled that {{the introduction of the}} now famous maroon beret was particularly unpopular with the 156th Battalion, who had previously worn bush hats. The 4th Brigade did not take part in the Allied invasion of Sicily but on 5 September the <b>whole</b> <b>Division</b> sailed to Taranto in Italy (Operation Slapstick), successfully capturing the port with 156th Battalion and brigade HQ in the vanguard.|$|E

The garrison of the out-posts were all killed by the subadar and his men, by kukri or bayonet and the next machine-gun posts were dealt with similarly.

In the Battle of Sorauren on 28 July, Taupin's <b>whole</b> <b>division</b> launched {{an assault on the}} hill of Oricain with Lecamus' brigade on the right and Béchaud's brigade on the left. Normally light companies were used to skirmish. Since Taupin employed his grenadier companies also, the French skirmish line was twice as strong as usual. Lecamus' brigade was repulsed before it reached the crest, but Béchaud's troops briefly established themselves on the crest before being driven off.|$|E
25|$|Seeing the 'spontaneous advances' of Ord {{and then}} Roosevelt, General Wheeler (having {{returned}} to the front) gave the order for Kent to advance with his <b>whole</b> <b>division</b> while he {{returned to the}} Cavalry Division.

The Spanish fled, as Ord began directing supporting fire into the remaining Spanish when he was shot in the throat and mortally wounded. General Hawkins was wounded shortly after.|$|E
50|$|The Nazi {{invasion}} {{caught the}} Soviet military unprepared. In the larger sense, Stalin expected invasion {{but not so}} soon. The Army had been decimated by the Purges; time was needed for a recovery of competence. As such, mobilization did not occur and the Soviet Army was tactically unprepared as of the invasion. The initial weeks of the war were a disaster, {{with tens of thousands}} of men being killed, wounded, or captured. <b>Whole</b> <b>divisions</b> disintegrated against the German onslaught.|$|R
25|$|The All-Star Game, {{which would}} have been in Phoenix, did not take place (the city will host the event in a future year as a replacement); the league instead took a break in February so that many of its players could {{participate}} in the XX Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy.

50|$|Following {{the period}} of {{operational}} training, or during the final portion of it, troop carrier units engaged in combined exercises with elements of the Airborne Command (Army Ground Forces). These realistic maneuvers, which lasted for about two months, were divided into three phases. The first consisted of small-scale operations in which a company of ground soldiers was transported. The scale of movement was increased in the second period, and during the final phase <b>whole</b> <b>divisions</b> were moved as units over distances up to 300 miles.|$|R
25|$|The {{units of}} the 2nd Wessex Division began to form {{as soon as the}} 1st Wessex had {{embarked}} for India. Any officers and men left behind by the 1st Line units were used to train the 2nd Line. On 25 November the War Office decided to send the 2nd Wessex to India as well, despite its lack of training. On 12 December 1914 the <b>whole</b> <b>division</b> embarked at Southampton and disembarked at Bombay 4–8 January 1915. The RFA batteries arrived with the same strength of five officers and 140 other ranks, equipped with four 15-pounders. Only in March 1915 was it discovered that half the 15-pounders had obturator pads made of wood, and could not be used for practice until these items had been replaced from England.|$|E
25|$|Duhesme {{retreated to}} Barcelona, leaving Chabran and a brigade to hold Mataró. Soon after, Duhesme {{attacked}} {{a force of}} miquelets along the Llobregat River and drove them away. Chabran tried to entice the Catalan militia into battle but was unsuccessful. Finally becoming aware of Duhesme's troubles, Napoleon earmarked a newly formed division under General of Division Honoré Charles Reille to reinforce him. Reille moved out with an advanced guard and soon relieved the garrison of Sant Ferran Castle at Figueras. After assembling his <b>whole</b> <b>division,</b> Reille moved against the port of Roses, but was rebuffed by its defenders and the British battleship HMS Montagu (74), which landed its marines to help. Hearing about the division of reinforcements, Duhesme prepared for a new attempt on Girona. The next action was the First Siege of Gerona.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth's {{defense and}} the retaking of the greater portion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, however successful, had not {{resulted}} in the recovery of all the lands lost in the 1650s. Smolensk was left in Russian hands and Ukraine became divided, with the right (western) bank of the Dnieper River (under Yurii Khmelnytsky) tied to the Commonwealth, and the left bank to Russia {{under the terms of}} the Pereyaslav treaties. With the Zaporizhian center also conducting its own politics, the <b>whole</b> <b>division</b> of Ukraine resulted in a highly volatile situation and internal warfare, known in Ukrainian history as the Ruin. In January 1663 in Chyhyryn the pro-Polish Pavlo Teteria was elected Cossack hetman, but his authority was not recognized in left-bank Ukraine, where in June Ivan Briukhovetsky was chosen with Russian support.|$|E

25|$|After {{the initial}} shock {{of losing a}} major city and the {{defection}} of a <b>whole</b> <b>division,</b> the DRA reacted ruthlessly. The 4th and 15th armoured brigades were sent from Pul-e-Charki, but due to the distance they had to travel, Hafizullah Amin ordered Major-General Sayyed Mukharam, commander of the Kandahar garrison to send an armoured force that could reach Herat faster. Mukharam's column of 30 tanks and 300 men arrived at Herat on March 20, waving green flags and Qurans, which induced the insurgents to believe that rebellion had spread to the whole country. The Khalq troops were thus allowed to pass, and recapture the city. The government forces then subjected Herat to an aerial bombardment with Ilyushin Il-28 bombers flying from Shindand Air Base, during which the city was heavily damaged, and thousands of Heratis were killed, though the exact death toll is uncertain: the lowest estimate runs at 3,000 to 4,000 dead, while the higher-case estimate reaches 25,000 dead. In 1992, a mass grave was uncovered, containing 2,000 bodies of those killed by the DRA repression.|$|E
25|$|The German Spring Offensive {{opened on}} 21 March. The First Surreys {{had just taken}} over the 'Welsh Ridge' section of the front at Villers-Plouich, with two {{companies}} holding a chain of outposts rather than a continuous trench. After a heavy bombardment and a day of skirmishing with German probes, the battalion was ordered to fall back to 'Highland Ridge' after dark. The following day the battalion's Lewis gun teams fought a delaying action from Welsh Ridge to Highland Ridge. The main German breakthrough {{had been to the}} south, and {{over the next few days}} the <b>whole</b> <b>division</b> had to fall back because of pressure from this flank. The First Surreys now got separated, part retiring with the rest of the brigade, the remainder with battalion HQ and details of other battalions digging in at Four Winds aerodrome at Lechelle. Later, Brig-Gen Kennedy, organising a mixed force from 47th and 2nd Division had two FSR companies under his command, while battalion HQ and the other companies were part of another mixed force holding the brigade's front line. These outposts were slowly pushed in as the enemy infiltrated between them, and it was not until the evening of 24 March that the battalion was once more concentrated, at Bazentin Wood on the old Somme battlefield. On 25 March the battalion occupied an old trench and caused heavy casualties to German troops pushing past in the direction of Pozieres. Towards evening the enemy infiltration forced the brigade back once more. On 26 March the battalion retired across the River Ancre past fresh troops and ceased to be in the front line. For the next few days the First Surreys were engaged in digging defences, coming under heavy bombardment on 4 April when the rest of 47th Division was attacked once more. The battalion was finally relieved on 8 April.|$|E
50|$|During World War I cycle-mounted infantry, scouts, {{messengers}} and ambulance carriers were extensively used by all combatants. Italy used bicycles {{with the}} Bersaglieri (light infantry units) {{until the end}} of the war. German Army Jäger (light infantry) battalions each had a bicycle company (Radfahr-Kompanie) at the outbreak of the war, and additional units were raised during the war, bringing the total to 80 companies. A number of these were formed into eight Radfahr-Bataillonen (bicycle battalions). The British Army had cyclist companies in its divisions, and later two <b>whole</b> <b>divisions</b> became cyclists: 1st and 2nd Cyclist Divisions.|$|R
40|$|How {{a company}} is sliced, or broken up into {{divisions}} of various sorts, has a huge effect on the accountability and hence the behavior of its managers. Senior management faces a tradeoff between delegating authority to subordinates who have the best information for specific decisions, and maintaining authority to avoid parochial behavior that might hurt the organization as a <b>whole.</b> <b>Divisions</b> exist within companies to {{provide a framework for}} such delegation. A divisional structure allows decision-making authority to be pushed down along with accountability for results. Thus, how divisions are established is critical to decision-making, motivation, and accountability. 2000 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R
40|$|When {{children}} learn about fractions, their {{prior knowledge of}} whole numbers often interferes, resulting in a whole number bias. However, many fraction concepts are generalizations of analogous whole number concepts; for example, fraction <b>division</b> and <b>whole</b> number <b>division</b> share a similar conceptual structure. Drawing on past studies of analogical transfer, we hypothesize that children’s <b>whole</b> number <b>division</b> knowledge will support their understanding of fraction division when their relevant prior knowledge is activated immediately before engaging with fraction division. Children in 5 th and 6 th grade modeled fraction division with physical objects after modeling a series of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and <b>division</b> problems with <b>whole</b> number operands and fraction operands. In one condition, problems were blocked by operation, such that children modeled fraction problems immediately after analogous whole number problems (e. g., fraction <b>division</b> problems followed <b>whole</b> number <b>division</b> problems). In another condition, problems were blocked by number type, such that children modeled all four arithmetic operations with whole numbers in the first block, and then operations with fractions in the second block. Children who solved <b>whole</b> number <b>division</b> problems immediately before fraction division problems were significantly better at modeling the conceptual structure of fraction division than those who solved all of the fraction problems together. Thus, implicit analogies across shared concepts can affect children’s mathematical thinking. Moreover, specific analogies between whole number and fraction concepts can yield a positive, rather than a negative, whole number bias...|$|R
500|$|The {{population}} of some areas secured by the division {{had a high}} proportion of Serbs, a situation that had arisen when the area was part of the Military Frontier between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Once the division had secured its area of responsibility, it became clear {{to the members of the}} division that a fratricidal war had been raging between Croats and Serbs. Both Roman Catholic and Serbian Orthodox churches had been destroyed, and elements of the division would observe smoke in the valleys occupied by Serbs, and upon investigation, would find burned houses and dead and wounded Serb civilians. Mickl was indignant about these attacks, and summoned all the Croatian civil and military leadership in the divisional area to his headquarters. In the meantime, he ordered two battalions of the division away from their positions on the eastern side of Otočac. When the Croatian officials arrived at his headquarters, they protested that he had exposed Otočac to attack. Incensed, Mickl shouted at them, [...] "Are you officers and soldiers, or robbers and murderers?", and threatened to withdraw the <b>whole</b> <b>division</b> to the coast, leaving the whole area undefended. The Croatian functionaries swore that the perpetrators of the attacks had been punished and that they would ensure that they would not occur in future. Nevertheless, Mickl kept garrisons in the Serb-populated valleys for many weeks in order to protect the Serbs from their Croat neighbours.|$|E
