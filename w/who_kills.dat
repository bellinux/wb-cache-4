40|$|This article {{presents}} findings {{of research on}} women <b>who</b> <b>kill.</b> All cases inwhich a woman was investigated by police as a perpetrator in a homicide in Victoria,Australia, between 1985 and 1995 were examined. The aim {{was to investigate the}} range of circumstances in which women kill. Seventy-seven cases were identified. The primary source of data was the Victorian Coroner’s office. Initially it was expected that most women would have killed a partner {{as a result of the}} experience of long-term violence. However, the findings of the study show that the situation with respect to women and those they kill is more complex. Three primary relationship categories were identified: women <b>who</b> <b>kill</b> their partners, women <b>who</b> <b>kill</b> their children and women <b>who</b> <b>kill</b> non-intimates. The third category primar-ily involved women <b>who</b> <b>killed</b> friends and acquaintances. This paper will argue that the homicide literature fails to provide a conceptual framework for understanding women <b>who</b> <b>kill</b> and hence contributes to the cultural stigmatising of violent women as “mad ” or “bad”. Homicide is considered to be an extreme form of violence where one person i...|$|R
5|$|St. Elmo is a 1914 American silent drama film {{produced}} by the Balboa Amusement Producing Company and distributed by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company. It was the first feature-length film adaptation of Augusta Jane Evans's 1866 novel of the same name. The story follows {{the life of the}} title character (played by William Jossey), <b>who</b> <b>kills</b> his cousin (Francis McDonald) over the love of Agnes (Madeline Pardee), falls from grace, and eventually finds redemption and love with Edna (Gypsy Abbott). It is disputed who directed the film; many sources credit Bertram Bracken, while others list St. Elmo as J. Gordon Edwards's directorial debut.|$|E
5|$|The film is {{a debate}} with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, which Wilton is seen reading early on, {{identifying}} him with the anti-hero Raskolnikov. That character is a brooding loner <b>who</b> <b>kills</b> two women {{to prove that he}} is a superior being, but is racked by guilt and eventually admits all to a dogged sleuth, and he is finally redeemed by punishment, the love of a poor girl, and the discovery of God. Wilton is a brooding loner <b>who</b> <b>kills</b> a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little guilt, and avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both killers attempt to cover their crime by faking a robbery, both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance in the stairwell, and both sleuths play cat and mouse with the suspect. Allen argues, unlike Dostoyevsky, that there is neither God, nor punishment, nor love to provide redemption. The theme of parody and reversal of Dostoyevsky's motifs and subject matter has been visited by Allen before, in his film Love and Death. In Love and Death, the dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Gambler, The Idiot, and War and Peace. In Match Point, Allen moves the theme from parody to the more direct engagement of Dostoyevsky's motifs and narratives.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{will explore}} the socio-legal response(s) to women <b>who</b> <b>kill.</b> Interrogating the constructions of “woman” and “femininity” within {{criminal}} legal discourse it {{will argue that}} the agency (that is, the ability of an individual to choose to act in a particular way) of women <b>who</b> <b>kill</b> is denied, both passively and actively within criminal legal discourse. It will be argued that denying the agency of women <b>who</b> <b>kill</b> is problematic for numerous reasons, including but not limited to, the construction and reinforcement of gender discourse surrounding femininity and issues of justice both being done and being seen to be done for women <b>who</b> <b>kill</b> and for their victims. In order to address these issues, this thesis will therefore propose an agency-based model for women <b>who</b> <b>kill,</b> which will interrupt both the passive and active agency denials which currently exist for these women...|$|R

5|$|Davies' {{next project}} was The Grand, a period soap drama {{set in a}} Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was {{designed}} to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9pm on a Friday night. After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), <b>who</b> <b>kills</b> her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder.

5|$|In North Indian manuscripts of the Ramayana, some interpolations {{elaborate}} Tara's lament. Tara {{mentions the}} hardships of widowhood and prefers death to it. She blames Rama for unjustly killing Vali and tells him {{that if they had}} forged an alliance, Vali could have helped him recover Sita. Tara invokes the power of her chastity and curses Rama so that he will soon lose Sita after he regains her. She declares that Sita will return to the earth. The curse also appears in the North-western Indian manuscripts. In several vernacular adaptations of the Ramayana like the Oriya Vilanka Ramayana by Sarala Dasa, Tara's curse is reiterated. Apart from the usual curse to Rama of his separation from Sita, in the Bengali Krittivasi Ramayana, Tara additionally curses Rama that in his next birth, he will be killed by Vali.
