500|$|Edwin Catmull, {{president}} of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios, felt that Jobs would [...] "be appalled" [...] at his depiction in the film, arguing {{that he was}} a kinder person later in life than is portrayed in the picture. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Catmull commented, [...] "When [...] left Apple, he then entered into <b>what</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the classic hero's journey: He's wandering in the wilderness, he's working with NeXT, it's not working. He's working with Pixar, we're failing. In that process, Steve learned some major lessons, and he changed. He became an empathetic person, [...] that aspect of the change of Steve was missed." ...|$|E
500|$|Also {{published}} in 1961 was Vonnegut's short story, [...] "Harrison Bergeron", {{set in a}} dystopic future where all are equal, {{even if that means}} disfiguring beautiful people and forcing the strong or intelligent to wear devices that negate their advantages. [...] Fourteen-year-old Harrison is a genius and athlete forced to wear record-level [...] "handicaps" [...] and imprisoned for attempting to overthrow the government. [...] He escapes to a television studio, tears away his handicaps, and frees a ballerina from her lead weights. As they dance, they are killed by the Handicapper General, Diana Moon Glampers. Vonnegut, in a later letter, suggested that [...] "Harrison Bergeron" [...] might have sprung from his envy and self-pity as a high school misfit. [...] In his 1976 biography of Vonnegut, Stanley Schatt suggested that the short story shows [...] "in any leveling process, <b>what</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> lost, according to Vonnegut, is beauty, grace, and wisdom". Darryl Hattenhauer, in his 1998 journal article on [...] "Harrison Bergeron", theorized that the story was a satire on American Cold War misunderstandings of communism and socialism.|$|E

500|$|On several occasions, {{people within}} the {{television}} and entertainment industry have suggested that Holby City {{is a waste of}} the television licence fee, with some suggesting that it ought to be cancelled. In August 2002, Paul Bolt, director of the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised BBC programming as being [...] "humdrum" [...] and [...] "formulaic", saying of Holby City and the police procedural Mersey Beat: [...] "One begins to wonder <b>what</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the point of the BBC bringing this to us. Let's have something a bit different." [...] Then head of BBC drama Jane Tranter responded that Bolt's examples were [...] "highly selective" [...] as well as [...] "hugely patronising to the millions of viewers who enjoy popular dramas like Holby City – week in, week out". Young, who at the time held the position of head of drama serials, told The Guardian: [...] "Popular drama has always been singled out for criticism, but people are increasingly voting with their on-buttons." [...] Also in 2002, David Cox of the New Statesman criticised BBC One's 2001 Christmas schedule, for airing Holby City against a contemporary version of Othello. On this basis, Cox advocated the abolition of the licence fee, explaining: [...] "The BBC was invented in a period when the elite decided what the population should know. If that has gone, then the licence fee should go too." [...] At the 2003 Edinburgh International Television Festival, BSykB chief executive Tony Ball called for stricter restrictions on how the BBC spent licence payers' money, suggesting that Holby City be sold to the channel's commercial rivals, with the proceeds used to develop more original programming. The BBC refused Ball's suggestion, responding in a statement: [...] "This speech clearly reflects BSkyB's view that programmes are merely a commodity to be bought and sold." [...] In June 2004, Charles Allen, chief executive of ITV plc questioned the amount of funding spent on lengthened episodes of Holby City, and in January 2010, Janet Street-Porter of The Independent, opined Holby City had [...] "come to the end of [...] natural life" [...] and should be cancelled.|$|E

In an English class, Shakur wrote a paper, [...] "Conquering All Obstacles," [...] in which he said: [...] "our raps, not the sorry story raps everyone is so tired of.

6000|$|A [...] "slight incident" [...] and a {{beautiful}} thought. But all I have so far said about the little book is preliminary to what I wish to say about another sonnet which must also be quoted. It is perhaps, as a sonnet, as ill done as the others, but the subject of it specially attracted me, as {{it happened to be}} one which was much in my mind during my week's stay at Norton. That remote little village without a squire or any person of means or education in or near it capable of feeling the slightest interest in the people, except the parson, an old infirm man who was never seen but once a week--how wanting in some essential thing it appeared! It seemed to me that the one thing which might be done in these small centres of rural life to brighten and beautify existence is precisely the thing which is never done, also that <b>what</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> being done is of doubtful value and sometimes actually harmful.|$|E
60|$|Does it not seem, however, {{that there}} are some precedents, such, for example, as the Institute of France, in which the body electing to the {{vacancies}} that occur within it keeps up a very high character, and enjoys a great reputation?--There are many such precedents; and, as every such body for its own honor must sometimes call upon the most intellectual men of the country to join it, I should think that every such body must retain a high character where the country itself has a proper sense of the worth of its best men; but the system of election may be wrong, though the sense of the country may be right; and I think, in appealing to a precedent to justify a system, we should estimate properly what has been brought about by the feeling of the country. We are all, I fancy, too much in the habit of looking to forms as the cause of <b>what</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> caused by the temper of the nation at the particular time, working, through the forms, for good or evil.|$|E

60|$|So far as art is thus used to show these {{goods to}} <b>be</b> <b>what</b> they <b>really</b> <b>are</b> not, and deceive the buyer, {{so far it}} is a trading fraud, which is an unjustifiable {{practice}} in business, and which, like coining of counterfeit money, is making goods to pass for <b>what</b> they <b>really</b> <b>are</b> not; and is done for {{the advantage of the}} person who puts them off, and to the loss of the buyer, who is cheated and deceived by the fraud.|$|R
60|$|In order, therefore, {{to arrive}} at <b>what</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> {{sensation}} in an occurrence which, at first sight, seems to contain nothing else, we have to pare away all that is due to habit or expectation or interpretation. This {{is a matter for}} the psychologist, and by no means an easy matter. For our purposes, it is not important to determine what exactly is the sensational core in any case; it is only important to notice that there certainly is a sensational core, since habit, expectation and interpretation are diversely aroused on diverse occasions, and the diversity is clearly due to differences in what is presented to the senses. When you open your newspaper in the morning, the actual sensations of seeing the print form a very minute part of what goes on in you, but they are the starting-point of all the rest, and it is through them that the newspaper is a means of information or mis-information. Thus, although {{it may be difficult to}} determine what exactly is sensation in any given experience, it is clear that there is sensation, unless, like Leibniz, we deny all action of the outer world upon us.|$|E

60|$|In {{the very}} laudable and {{fascinating}} extensions of {{our interest in}} Asiatic arts or faiths, there are two incidental injustices which we tend nowadays to do to our own records and our own religion. The first {{is a tendency to}} talk as if certain things were not only present in the higher Orientals, but were peculiar to them. Thus our magazines will fall into a habit of wondering praise of Bushido, the Japanese chivalry, as if no Western knights had ever vowed noble vows, or as if no Eastern knights had ever broken them. Or again, our drawing-rooms will be full of the praises of Indian renunciation and Indian unworldliness, as if no Christians had been saints, or as if all Buddhists had been. But if the first injustice is to think of human virtues as peculiarly Eastern, the other injustice is a failure to appreciate <b>what</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> peculiarly Eastern. It is too much taken for granted that the Eastern sort of idealism is certainly superior and convincing; whereas in truth it is only separate and peculiar. All that is richest, deepest, and subtlest in the East is rooted in Pantheism; but all that is richest, deepest, and subtlest in us is concerned with denying passionately that Pantheism is either the highest or the purest religion.|$|E
50|$|Watson {{said that}} any {{existence}} of a mental life is false. Thus, he argued that mental activity could be observed.

They are all manual devices used by humans that result in thinking. By using anecdotes that illustrate the behaviors and activities of mammals, Watson outlines his behaviorist views on these topics.|$|R
