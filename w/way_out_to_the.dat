25|$|The French Royalists in Menen {{were aware}} {{that they would be}} {{executed}} if captured. Therefore, on the night of 30 April the garrison of Menen broke out. Led by the Loyal Emigrant Battalion, Hammerstein's men cut their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. It was alleged that the escape was partly due to the carelessness of Moreau's brigade commander Dominique Vandamme. The garrison got away with most of their own artillery. The Hanoverians lost 38 killed, 123 wounded and 387 captured while the Royalists lost 92 killed and 87 wounded. Hessian and Austrian losses were not reported. The total loss was therefore 727 casualties and 10 artillery pieces. The garrison captured seven French guns but had to abandon five because they did not have enough horses to haul them. French losses were 500 men and two guns.|$|E
25|$|Installing {{a barrage}} {{may change the}} {{shoreline}} within the bay or estuary, affecting a large ecosystem that depends on tidal flats. Inhibiting {{the flow of water}} {{in and out of the}} bay, there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary, causing additional turbidity (suspended solids) and less saltwater, which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals. Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams, and may attempt to pass through the turbines. The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages. Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue, though locks can be added to allow slow passage. However, the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge. Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary. In August 2004, a humpback whale swam through the open sluice gate of the Annapolis Royal Generating Station at slack tide, ending up trapped for several days before eventually finding its <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Annapolis Basin.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June, the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade moved {{west from}} Buq Buq and formed three columns under the 7th Armoured Division, with the 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers {{armoured}} car regiment attached. After {{the fall of}} Tobruk the brigade formed part of the rearguard operating between Sidi Rezegh and Bir el Gubi. The brigade retired {{with the rest of}} the 7th Armoured Division to Sofafi over the border in Egypt and then to Mersa Matruh. Two columns arrived safely but the PAVO column ran into a minefield and then the 90th Light Division. The column broke away only to bog in soft sand; the troops managed to dig the vehicles out overnight and then ran into yet another Axis force at close range, then drove off north-east, only to find its way blocked by minefields with gaps covered by Axis forces and was caught in crossfire. Part of the PAVO column found a way through the minefield but the rest were captured. The 13th Lancers column found themselves caught between Axis forces to the north and a minefield to the south, shot their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, then turned south-west through Axis formations, during which the armoured cars ran into an Axis column, charged, knocked out four guns and took many prisoners.|$|E

500|$|Napoleon {{embarked}} {{aboard the}} brig Épervier {{early in the}} morning of 15 July, and made his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bellerophon. As he approached, the 74-gun Superb, flying Vice-Admiral Hotham's flag, was sighted approaching. Concerned that the brig might not reach Bellerophon before the Superb arrived, and that consequently Hotham would take over and receive Napoleon himself, Maitland sent Bellerophons barge to collect the former Emperor and transfer him to the ship. At some point between 6 and 7 am, the barge pulled alongside Bellerophon and General Henri Gatien Bertrand climbed aboard, followed by Napoleon. The marines came to attention, and Napoleon walked to the quarterdeck, took his hat off to Maitland and in French announced [...] "I am come to throw myself on the protection of your Prince and your laws." [...] Maitland bowed in response. With the former emperor in custody aboard a British warship, the Napoleonic Wars were finally over. To maritime historian David Cordingly, this moment was Bellerophons [...] "crowning glory [...] six weeks after the battle of Waterloo,... Napoleon, trapped in Rochefort, surrendered to the captain of the ship that had dogged his steps for more than twenty years." ...|$|E

In fierce {{fighting with the}} bayonet, Ricard's soldiers captured the village, lost it to a counterattack, then clawed their way back into a few houses. After failing to cut his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, about 3:00 pm Poltoratsky began a fighting withdrawal to the north with his men in square formation. Heading for the village of La Caure, his soldiers kept the French back with regular volleys. About [...] north of Champaubert they began {{to run out of}} ammunition and their ranks began to show unsteadiness. The French demanded that Poltoratsky capitulate and when he refused, they brought up a horse artillery battery and began blasting his troops with canister shot. Instead of being a possible refuge, the nearby woods turned out to be filled with French skirmishers. With his men being mown down by canister and riddled by musketry, Poltoratsky finally agreed to surrender his two regiments and cannons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main attack}} was towards {{that part of}} the line held by the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments which was forced back until they were facing due west, with their backs to the tangled maze of, for cavalry and guns, impassable rocky hills. The 4th Light Horse Regiment {{supported}} by ‘A’ Battery HAC on the right or northern flank, had held their position until the attackers closed to within [...] when they began their slow withdrawal into the hills. The Nottinghamshire Battery RHA was positioned near the centre of the brigade but each time an attack broke and melted away before the light horse fire from rifles and the guns, the German and Ottoman dead lay a little closer to the guns of these two batteries. Each time a short retirement was made, the heavy pressure of the attackers pushed the guns further into the hills and each time there were fewer men and horses to move the guns. They were forced into a position from which there was no escape fighting till all their ammunition was exhausted and the German and Ottoman attackers were within [...] on three sides. Then the teams of horses were killed by machine gun fire and the nine 13–pounder guns were abandoned while the remaining men and horses scrambled up the hills to the east and succeeded in reaching the Wadi el Retem just {{to the north of the}} Umm esh Shert track.
