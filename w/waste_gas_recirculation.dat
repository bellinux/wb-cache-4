Meanwhile, the influence of exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> rate, exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> temperature and excess air coefficient on combustion temperature are discussed. The result shows that, under the condition with excess air coefficient αa≥ 1. 5, the combustion temperature is lower than 1500 °C. Under the condition ofαa< 1. 5, the exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> technology can make the combustion temperature reduce to 1500 °C.

Interdepence between cell fuel utilization, system fuel utilization and <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> is investigated numerically. Tendency towards carbon deposits is evaluated via thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. It is quantified which <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> rates {{are necessary to}} achieve high values of system fuel utilization even if the cell fuel utilization is kept at a moderate level. Furthermore, tendency towards carbon deposition strongly depends on temperature, pressure and feed gas composition and can be reduced by adequate recirculation rates.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in a {{spark-ignition}} engine fueled with iso-propanol/gasoline blends. Emission characteristics of this engine were investigated experimentally, including gaseous emissions (HC, CO, NOx) and particulate matter emission in term of number and size distributions. The effects of different iso-propanol percentages, loads and exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> rates on emissions were analyzed. Results show that the introduction of exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> reduces the NOx emission and NOx emission gives the highest value at full load condition. HC and CO emissions present inconspicuous variations at all the loads except the load of 10 %. Additionally, HC emission shows a sharp increase for pure propanol when the exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> rate is up to 5 %, while little variation is observed at lager exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> rates. Moreover, the particulate matter number concentration increases monotonically {{with the increase of}} load and the decrease of exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> rate.

40|$|Within the literature, {{there are}} a number of studies {{investigating}} the benefits of exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> and as a result it has become established as a promising technology for combustion control to allow engine downsizing technology to be advanced. Aside from the dilution effect of exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> some of the components, such as NO, CO, and hydrocarbons, can have significant chemical effects. The literature shows that the component within exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> which has the largest chemical effect on combustion is NO, which can promote or inhibit the onset of autoignition causing reactions within the end gas at high load. The reduction in NOx gases in catalysed exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> can increase the knock limit at high load, with some authors reporting up to a 5 ∘ crank angle improvement in combustion phasing. There is conflicting evidence on whether this translates to an improvement in fuel consumption, with one study finding a decrease of up to 2 % comparing to another finding an increase of 1. 5 %- 3. 5 %. Crude calculations on the emissions of a 2. 0 -L direct injection spark ignition engine operating at high load show that in an extreme case the reduction in the calorific value of the inlet charge due to catalysis of the recirculated gases can be up to 4. 5 %. Despite the potential benefits, the literature on catalysed exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> is fairly limited and the evidence seems so far inconclusive as to whether this technology may have the potential to further enhance the benefits of exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation.</b> This article uses current literature to ascertain the potential benefits of catalysed exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> compare to pre-catalyst exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> and investigates its individual components in more detail to explain how chemical interactions can either promote or inhibit ignition depending on their concentration and temperature...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{the focus}} on {{renewable}} energy and alternative fuels has increased due to increase oil prices, environment pollution, and also concern on preserving the nature. Biodiesel has been known as an attractive alternative fuel although biodiesel produced from edible oil is very expensive than conventional diesel. Therefore, the uses of biodiesel produced from non-edible oils are much better option. Currently Jatropha biodiesel is receiving attention as an alternative fuel for diesel engine. Previous studies reported that Jatropha biodiesel was found to emit higher nitrogen oxides and lower smoke emissions compared to ordinary diesel. Exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> is an effective technique to reduce nitrogen oxides emission from diesel engines; because it enables to lower both flame temperature and oxygen concentration in the combustion chamber. Some studies succeeded to reduce nitrogen oxides emission from biodiesel fuelled engines using exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation.</b> However, they observed increase in soot emission.

Simulations of two incineration processes, with and without flue <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> have been carried out by using a commercial flowsheeting simulator. The results of the simulations demonstrate that, from an economic point of view, the proposed technique permits a greater level of energy recovery (up to + 3 %) and, at the same time, lower investment costs as far as the equipment and machinery constituting the air pollution control section of the plant are concerned. At equal treatment system efficiencies, the environmental benefits stem from the decrease in the emission of atmospheric pollutants.
