5|$|A win in {{the third}} Test <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> to keep the Lions hope of a series win alive. John scored ten points of the 13–3 win, the other three coming from Wales' team-mate Gerald Davies. The final Test ended in a 14–14 draw, giving the series to the tourists. John scored eight of the Lions points, having scored in every match, Test and regional, he had played in.|$|E
5|$|Alonso's {{second season}} at Real Madrid {{started with the}} arrival of a new manager, José Mourinho. He was given the number 14 jersey after the {{departure}} of vice-captain Guti. He did not score any goals that whole season but <b>was</b> <b>vital.</b> While he believed that Real Madrid would win the league, the club only managed to win the Copa del Rey.|$|E

50|$|Plasticity <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> for coking as it {{represents}} {{its ability to}} gradually form specific plasticity phases during the coking process, measured by coal dilatation tests. Low phosphorus content <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> for these coals, as phosphorus is a highly damaging element in steel making.|$|R

5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, {{he did not}} believe that performance <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> to the plays, nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|During its 19 {{months of}} operation, it reduced {{the time for}} {{messages}} to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to about 10 days. From April 3, 1860 to October 1861, it became the West's most direct means of east–west communication before the telegraph was established and <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> for tying the new state of California {{with the rest of}} the United States.|$|E
5|$|In this period, Germany {{was still}} in a dire {{economic}} situation as millions were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was daunting. Hitler knew that reviving the economy <b>was</b> <b>vital.</b> In 1934, using deficit spending, public works projects were undertaken. A total of 1.7 million Germans were put {{to work on the}} projects in 1934 alone. Average wages both per hour and per week began to rise.|$|E

5|$|Washington had {{considered}} abandoning Fort Washington, {{but he was}} swayed by Nathanael Greene, who believed the fort could be held and that it <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> to do so. Greene argued that holding the fort would keep open communications across the river and might dissuade the British from attacking New Jersey. Magaw and Putnam concurred with Greene. Washington deferred to Greene and did not abandon the fort.|$|E
5|$|While {{the port}} of Antwerp <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> for the Allies after D-Day, Admirals Cunningham and Ramsay warned SHAEF and Montgomery that the port was of no use while the Germans held the approaches. But Montgomery {{postponed}} the Battle of the Scheldt, and the delay in opening the port was a grave blow to the Allied build-up before winter approached.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E

50|$|In general, HIFs <b>are</b> <b>vital</b> to development. In mammals, {{deletion}} of the HIF-1 genes {{results in}} perinatal death. HIF-1 {{has been shown}} to <b>be</b> <b>vital</b> to chondrocyte survival, allowing the cells to adapt to low-oxygen conditions within the growth plates of bones. HIF plays {{a central role in the}} regulation of human metabolism.|$|R
5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Blackwell's son and {{approximately}} 50 other children boycotted the school, {{because of its}} decision to not let the children wear the SNCC freedom pins. As a result, Blackwell and some other activists in the community decided that it <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> to school those children. She helped open freedom schools in Issaquena County, to resolve the issue. The schools became popular and continued to teach classes every summer until 1970, when the local schools finally desegregated.|$|E
5|$|Different factions {{may have}} {{existed in the}} royal court. The k'uhul ahaw and his {{household}} would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, public performance <b>was</b> <b>vital.</b> Such performances included ritual dances, presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.|$|E
50|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{information}} <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> for all decisions. Hence, it <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> for any organization {{to be cautious}} when communicating with the public. The communicated information should be absolute and all <b>vital</b> information must <b>be</b> conveyed appropriately. Purposely withholding crucial information might result in the public conceiving a bad image.|$|R

5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls hit some distance from him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{forces had}} landed on Bougainville in early 1942, {{capturing}} {{it from the}} small force of Australians garrisoning the island. They had subsequently developed several airbases on the island, using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States, Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area. These bases also helped protect Rabaul, the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea; throughout 1943, Allied planners determined that Bougainville <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul.|$|E

5|$|More than 2.7million players {{participated in}} the beta, which lasted from May 3 to 20. The game was rolled out from an {{internal}} group of Bungie and Microsoft employees, with {{the total number of}} players in the thousands. When the beta went public, more than a million played the first day, causing back-end servers to struggle to handle the traffic. While the engineering team had overestimated server load, bugs in server clusters caused game uploads to become backed up, slowing matchmaking until the underlying issues could be fixed. Jarrard noted that the 16million total hours of play time and large-scale rollout of the beta <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> to seeing how Reach would perform.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January 1940, Northcott became acting Chief of the General Staff (CGS) {{following}} the death of Lieutenant General Ernest Ker Squires. In August, his successor, General Sir Brudenell White, died in an air crash and Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee succeeded him. The post of commander of the 8th Division thereby became available but Northcott was excluded from consideration because his knowledge <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> to the new CGS. When the commander of the 9th Division, Major General Henry Wynter, fell ill in January 1941, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey asked for Northcott to replace him, but Northcott was involved in organising the 1st Armoured Division and the appointment instead went to Brigadier Leslie Morshead.|$|E
5|$|Strict Sabbatarianism <b>was</b> <b>vital</b> to Presbyterian culture. For {{members of}} separatist churches, the Sunday {{walk to the}} meeting house, {{sometimes}} as much as thirty miles, marked the intensity of dissent and strict keeping of the Sabbath was a mark of true membership. Fast days were also important, particularly in Seeder culture. They often did not involve actual fasting, but focused on stricter observance of the Sabbath. The established kirk had three a year, but the seeders as many as six.|$|E
