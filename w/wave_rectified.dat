We measured sensitivity to ITD of users of a cochlear implant (CI) and a contralateral hearing aid (HA) to speech-like, ecologically relevant stimuli. Recently, it was shown that users of a cochlear implant (CI) and a contralateral hearing aid (HA) are sensitive to ITDs in simple stimuli that consist of a low-rate pulse train (100 pps), presented on a single electrode, together with an acoustically presented filtered click train with F 0 = 100 Hz [1]. We investigated ITD sensitivity of bimodal listeners to different stimulus types that are more ecologically relevant. One stimulus consisted in one ear of an acoustic sinusoid of various frequencies that was modulated with a half <b>wave</b> <b>rectified</b> low-frequency sinusoid, {{and in the other}} ear of a high-rate electric pulse train (900 pps) that was modulated with the same half <b>wave</b> <b>rectified</b> low-frequency sinusoid. JNDs in ITD were comparable to those measured with the 100 pps pulse train. Another stimulus consisted in one ear of an acoustically presented filtered click train and in the other ear of the same filtered click train processed by a CIS-like algorithm into a multichannel electric signal. Care was taken to maintain the correct temporal relationships between the signals presented to different electrodes. The original filtered click train and the electric signal were presented simultaneously. JNDs in ITD were again comparable to those measured with the 100 pps pulse train.

40|$|Widespread {{seismicity}} {{was triggered}} by the June 28, 1992, Landers California, earthquake at a rate which was maximum immediately after passage of the exciting seismic <b>waves.</b> <b>Rectified</b> diffusion of vapor from hydrothermal liquids and magma into bubbles oscillating in an earthquake can increase the local pore pressure to seismically significant levels within {{the duration of the}} earthquake. In a hydrothermal system modeled as a two-component H_ 2 O-CO_ 2 fluid in porous rock the pressure initially increases linearly with time. The rate of pressure buildup depends sensitively on the mean bubble radius and is large for small bubbles. The diffusion-induced pressure is relaxed by percolation and resorption of vapor into the liquid solution. The induced seismicity itself also relieves stress. Values of parameters used in the present calculations give results consistent with observations of triggered seismicity at Long Valley caldera after the Landers earthquake. For one representative condition, at 250 °C and 5. 6 km depth, oscillating strain acting on 10 -μm-diameter bubbles increases pore pressure at the rate of 151 Pa/s resulting in a pressure increase of 12 kPa in the 80 -s duration of the Landers earthquake. The elevated pressure induced by a single 26 -m-diameter cloud of bubbles in saturated rock relaxes by percolation through soil of 0. 2 -mdarcy permeability in 53. 6 hours. Observations of earthquake swarms at other locations suggest that self-induced buildup of pore pressure by rectified diffusion can provide a positive feedback mechanism for amplifying seismicity...|$|R

40|$|Epoch {{is defined}} as the instant of {{significant}} excitation within a pitch period of voiced speech. Epoch extraction continues to attract the interest of researchers because of its significance in speech analysis. Existing high performance epoch extraction algorithms require either dynamic programming techniques or a priori information of the average pitch period.

Half <b>wave</b> <b>rectified</b> and negated ILPR (or Hilbert transform of ILPR) is used as the pre-processed signal. A new non-linear temporal measure named the plosion index (PI) has been proposed for detecting `transients' in speech signal. An extension of PI, called the dynamic plosion index (DPI) is applied on pre-processed signal to estimate the epochs. The proposed DPI algorithm is validated using six large databases which provide simultaneous EGG recordings. Creaky and singing voice samples are also analyzed.

We consider (i) sine, (ii) square, (iii) symmetric saw-tooth, (iv) asymmetric saw-tooth, (v) modulus of sine and (vi) rectified sinusoidal forces. The external periodic forces and Gaussian noise term are added {{to one of the}} two state variables of the system. The effect of each force is studied separately. In the absence of noise term, when the amplitude f of the applied periodic force is varied cross-well motion is realized above a critical value (f_c) of f. This is found for all the forces except the modulus of sine and rectified sinusoidal forces. Stochastic resonance is observed in the presence of noise and periodic forces. The effect of different forces is compared. The logarithmic plot of mean residence time τ_MR against 1 /(D - D_c) where D is the intensity of the noise and D_c is the value of D at which cross-well motion is initiated shows a sharp knee-like structure for all the forces.

At high intensities it evokes in active masseter muscles of healthy subjects two overlapping reflexes: p 11 /n 15 and p 16 /n 21 waves, whose origin {{has not yet been}} demonstrated. Our purpose was to test which receptor in the inner ear is responsible for these reflexes. We compared masseter EMG responses induced in normal subjects (n = 9) by loud clicks (70 – 100 dB normal hearing level (NHL), 0. 1 ms, 3 Hz) to those evoked in subjects with a selective lesion of the cochlea (n = 5), of the vestibule (n = 1) or with mixed cochlear-vestibular failure (n = 5). In controls, 100 dB clicks induced bilaterally, in the unrectified mean EMG (unrEMG), a clear p 11 wave followed by a less clear n 15 wave and a subsequent n 21 wave. Lowering the intensity to 70 dB clicks abolished the p 11 /n 15 wave, while a p 16 <b>wave</b> appeared. <b>Rectified</b> mean EMG (rectEMG) showed, at all intensities, an inhibitory deflection corresponding to the p 16 /n 21 wave in the unrEMG. Compared to controls, all deaf subjects had a normal p 11 wave, together with more prominent n 15 wave; however, the p 16 /n 21 waves, and their corresponding inhibition in the rectEMG, were absent. The vestibular patient had bilaterally clear p 11 waves only when 100 dB clicks were delivered bilaterally or to the unaffected ear. Stimulation of the affected ear induced only p 16 /n 21 waves.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the shape of six {{different}} periodic forces and second periodic forces on the onset of horseshoe chaos are studied both analytically and numerically in a Duffing oscillator. The external periodic forces considered are sine wave, square wave, symmetric saw-tooth wave, asymmetric saw-tooth <b>wave,</b> <b>rectified</b> sine wave, and modulus of sine wave. An analytical threshold condition for the onset of horseshoe chaos is obtained in the Duffing oscillator driven by various periodic forces using the Melnikov method. Melnikov threshold curve is drawn in a parameter space. For all the forces except modulus of sine wave, the onset of cross-well asymptotic chaos is observed just above the Melnikov threshold curve for onset of horseshoe chaos. For the modulus of sine wave long time transient motion followed by a periodic attractor is realized. The possibility of controlling of horseshoe and asymptotic chaos in the Duffing oscillator by an addition of second periodic force is then analyzed. Parametric regimes where suppression of horseshoe chaos occurs are predicted. Analytical prediction is demonstrated through direct numerical simulations. Starting from asymptotic chaos we show the recovery of periodic motion {{for a range of}} values of amplitude and phase of the second periodic force.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of leg predomination on reliability testing of the VMO-VL muscle onset measurement during single leg squatting in healthy subjects. Methods: the onset of VMO and VL muscles of ten healthy subjects with a right dominant leg was assessed during single leg squatting. Data was collected from the muscle bellies of the VMO and VL.

However, most of the EMG and heart rate measuring tools are expensive and large in size. The process of data collection also often confined to hospital or biomechanics lab. Therefore, the development of this monitoring system capable provides immediate feedback about physiological data which is desired by athletes and trainers.

Applying local anaesthesia to this tooth decreased the total surface of the waves, on average by 89 %. The excitatory and the inhibitory waves were similarly affected, indicating that mainly pressure receptors in the periodontium mediate the entire PSEC. In 4 subjects, who were exposed to acoustic noise to exclude a contribution of acoustic receptors, the recovery of the PSEC waves from local anaesthesia was tracked. In 3 subjects, one wave (the first inhibitory or the first excitatory one, respectively) recovered differently from the other waves, indicating that they are not necessarily mediated by one type of afferent axons. The evidence, nevertheless, suggests that the different PSEC waves in man reflect the projection of the periodontal afferents upon several brain structures, involved in the control of the activity of the masseteric motorneurones, as: inhibitory and excitatory control requires different groups of interneurones; and a mediation of the first inhibitory wave by slower conducting axons than the second inhibitory wave, or a mediation of both waves by axons of similar type, is not compatible with common interneurones. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The TELSTAR 4 {{communication}} satellites being manufactured by Martin Marietta Astro Space (Astro Space) for AT&T are three axis stabilized spacecraft {{scheduled to be}} launched on expendable vehicles such as the Atlas or Ariane rockets. Typically, these spacecraft consist of a box that holds the electronics and supports the antenna reflectors and the solar array wings. The wings and reflectors are folded against {{the sides of the}} box during launch and the spacecraft is spun for attitude control in that phase; they are then deployed after achieving the final orbit. The launch phase and transfer orbits required to achieve the final geosynchronous orbit typically take 4 to 5 days during which time the power required for command, telemetry, attitude control, heaters, etc., is provided by two 50 AH nickel hydrogen batteries augmented by the exposed outboard solar panels. In the past, this situation has presented no problem since there was a considerable excess of power available from the array. In the case of large high powered spacecraft such as TELSTAR 4, however, the design power levels in transfer orbit approach the time-averaged power available from the exposed surface area of the solar arrays, resulting in a very tight power margin. To compound the difficulty, the array output of the spinning spacecraft in transfer orbit is shaped like a full <b>wave</b> <b>rectified</b> sine function and provides very low charging rates to the batteries during portions of the rotation. In view of the typically low charging efficiency of alkaline nickel batteries at low rates, it was decided to measure the efficiency during a simulation of the TELSTAR 4 conditions at the expected power levels and temperatures on three nickel hydrogen cells of similar design. The unique feature of nickel hydrogen cells that makes the continuous measurement of efficiency possible is that hydrogen is one of the active materials and thus, cell pressure is a direct measure of the state of charge or available capacity. The pressure is measured with a calibrated strain gage mounted {{on the outside of the}} pressurized cell...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{identification}} of neuromuscular patterns {{is an important}} cue {{for the management of}} muscular development, skill improve- ment and injury prevention. The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to characterize muscular coordination patterns in the dominant upper limb in the different phases of golf swing in experienced golfers. Methods: Three low-handicap golfers (handicap lower than five) performed six full swing movements with a pitch iron. Surface electro- myography (EMG) was recorded from 12 muscles: anterior (AD), middle (MD) and posterior (PD) deltoids, pectoralis major (PM), latissimus dorsi (LD), infraspinatus (IS), vastus lateralis (VL) and long portion (LP) of triceps brachii, biceps brachii (BB), brachioradialis (BR), wrist flexors (WF), and wrist extensors (WE). The EMG signals were sampled at 1000 Hz, full <b>wave</b> <b>rectified,</b> low pass filtered (second order Butterworth filter at 12 Hz) and normalized using the EMG of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) as a reference. In synchrony with the EMG signals, a three axis accelerometer fixed at the back of the golf club head informed about ball contact time (BC). Mean EMG value was calculated separately during each phase: backswing (BS), downswing (DS) and the first 500 ms of the follow-through (FT). For the move- ment analysis and phase delimitation the swing was filmed with four high speed video cameras (300 Hz). The recording of EMG and cinematic data was performed with a SIMI system (SIMI Motion, Munich, Germany). Results: The average of normalized values of all muscles of the dominant arm in the three subjects, showed that the DS exhibited the highest muscular activity (28, 8 % of the EMG of the MVC) compared with the FT (19, 9 %) and the BS (15, 7 %). The elbow flexors (BB 26 %, BR 45 %) and the wrist extensors (WE 26 %) presented the strongest activation during the BS to promote elbow flexion and hand extension, and silenced before the DS initiation. During the DS the shoulder adductors (LD 53 %, PM 38 %) and the elbow extensors (LP 50 %, VL 47 %) presented the highest EMG activation. These muscles were activated at the beginning of the DS but the shoulder adductors peaked earlier. The AD peaked 70 ms before the BC and its activation may contribute to the arm internal rotation during the acceleration phase. The WF peaked during or just after the BC to accelerate hand flexion. The shoulder abductors (AD 34 %, MD 14 %) and the wrist flexors (36 %) showed the highest activity during the FT. The posterior and middle deltoids showed low activity in all the phases (less then 20 %). Conclusions: The results demonstrated that the most active muscles during the golf swing were the shoulder adductors and the elbow extensors, and that the downswing was the phase where muscles from the dominant upper limb presented stronger activation. The EMG patterns we found can help to design training programs to improve strength and flexibility and to reduce injury risk in the golfers upper limb...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} motor performance (target tracking), timing and amplitude of biceps and triceps muscle activity (EMG), {{in a sample}} of people with upper limb hemiplegia following stroke, before and after training in a planar robot. METHODS: In a planar robot, in which the arm was supported by a hinged arm-holder and constrained to move in 2 dimensions, five chronic stroke participants practiced a subset (chosen to be appropriate to ability) of nine tracking tasks in which trajectory (orientation and length), speed and resistance to movement were varied during 18 (n= 3) and 25 (n= 2) one-hour training sessions. During tracking, electrical stimulation (ES) (40 Hz biphasic, fixed amplitude, variable pulse-width; 0 - 300 µs) was delivered via a commercially available CE marked stimulator using surface self-adhesive electrodes to the triceps muscle. Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithms were applied to reduce tracking error on consecutive trials by adjusting the pulse width and timing of ES. Immediately before training and after session 18, EMG and tracking performance (without ES) data were recorded during nine tasks. EMG signals were recorded from seven muscles including triceps and biceps using Noraxon Dual Ag-AgCl snap electrodes positioned according to SENIAM guidelines. EMG signals for each muscle were also recorded during maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). EMG signals were sampled at 1500 Hz, amplified x 2 at the electrodes to reduce the signal to noise ratio. Further EMG signal processing was performed using Matlab (7. 2. 0. 232). Data were zero-phase filtered, using a fourth order Butterworth filter with passband 10 - 500 Hz, then full <b>wave</b> <b>rectified</b> and smoothed using a moving average filter with 0. 1 s window. EMG data was normalised using the MVIC. RESULTS: Analysis of the pre intervention EMG data showed that, for all stroke participants, timing and amplitude of peak EMG activity in biceps and triceps during all tasks differed from the mean of neurologically intact participants (n= 8) (p< 0. 05), using data recorded under the same conditions. Analysis of pre intervention and post session 18 EMG data, showed statistically significant (p< 0. 05) changes (mean of all tracking tasks) in timing and amplitude of biceps and timing of triceps EMG towards those of neurologically intact participants. Changes in tracking performance showed a statistically significant (p< 0. 03) reduction in error of the 9 tasks. An association between improved tracking performance and changes in timing and amplitude of EMG was identified. A statistically significant interaction (ANOVA) between tracking and timing of biceps (p= 0. 03) and tracking and amplitude of triceps (p= 0. 04) was detected but not between amplitude of biceps or timing of triceps (i. e. the variables that showed the greatest change towards normal). CONCLUSION: Five people with upper limb post-stroke hemiplegic underwent 18 training sessions in a planar arm robot in which ES of triceps, mediated by ILC, was used to correct tracking error. An improvement in motor performance and changes in EMG activity in biceps and triceps were observed. An interaction was found between improvement in tracking and some but not all EMG variables...|$|E
