25|$|The {{earliest}} ceramics in {{the lowest}} levels of occupation contained a distinct pottery style, most associated with early agriculturalists in southern Africa.

Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "...a great and thundering series of political and psychological intrigue bristling with vivid characters, cross-hatched with tantalizing plotlines and seasoned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> of fantasy". New York Posts Linda Stasi gave Thrones 3.5/4 stars stating, [...] "The art direction, acting and incredible sets are as breathtaking as the massive scope of the series".

500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave it}} {{four out of five}} stars, wrote [...] "what gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off" [...] and describing the tracks as the ones that illustrate Clarkson as a rare thing in the 2000s: [...] "a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream." [...] Sputnikmusic's Dave Donnelly gave it a [...] "4" [...] rating, remarking that [...] "Breakaway is not a Thriller to her Off The Wall by no means, but she has at least created a rare type of album: a one that offers a full selection of potential singles, reminiscent of Michael Jackson's Bad or Thriller, which he described as having a mass appeal with artistic integrity and perceived longevity. Breakaway may be remembered in years to come as a pop classic, alongside Madonna's early material perhaps." [...] Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] rating, noting it's rock direction and describing it as [...] "Avril-meets-Evanescence, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> of Pat Benatar." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave Breakaway a three-and-a-half star rating and commented that [...] "though her rocky leanings were hinted at on the less coherent Thankful, Clarkson had always cited Mariah Carey as a primary influence and that she still owes a lot to that former powerhouse artist." [...] Furthering describing it as [...] "what Mariah might sound like if she ever decided to rock out." [...] Charles Merwin wrote for Stylus Magazine that the album's probable non-singles still maintain a quality [...] "high enough to quell worries about the [...] "I love the singles, but that's all I really need to hear" [...] arguments." [...] He described Clarkson as ranking some where {{at the top of her}} class as far as rock albums go among the teen pop set, saying that she [...] "has a long way to go before we'll ever feel comfortable calling her anything besides an American Idol, but for now she has a sound that seems believable enough to support her considerable chops." [...] In a quick review, Billboard described Breakaway as a [...] "rare exhibition of substance over style".|$|E
