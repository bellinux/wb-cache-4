5|$|Historians like Milcíades Peña {{consider}} this historical {{period of the}} Americas as pre-capitalist, as most production of the coastal cities was destined to overseas markets.

Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it <b>was</b> <b>neither</b> capitalist nor feudalist, but an hybrid system result of {{the interaction of the}} Spanish civilization, on the transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the natives, still living in the prehistory.|$|E
