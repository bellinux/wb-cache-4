From Wooldridge's hanging, Wilde later wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol.|$|E
50|$|Gerbils only {{became popular}} pets after 1954, when 20 {{breeding}} pairs <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the United States from eastern Mongolia for scientific testing.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, the codex <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Florence by an émigré scholar. It belonged to Niccolo Ridolpho († 1550) Cardinal of Florence.

5|$|As a boy, Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) {{read the}} Comte de Buffon's Histoire Naturelle from the {{previous}} century, as well as Linnaeus and Fabricius. He <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Paris by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1795, {{not long after the}} French Revolution. He soon became a professor of animal anatomy at the Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, surviving changes of government from revolutionary to Napoleonic to monarchy. Essentially on his own he created the discipline of vertebrate palaeontology and the accompanying comparative method. He demonstrated that animals had become extinct.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-6th century, as Buddhism <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Japan from Baekje, new {{styles of}} shrine {{architecture}} were introduced; today's Shinto shrine blueprint is of Buddhist origin. The concept of temples {{as a place}} of assembly was applied to shrines. Spaces for worship were added in the form of extended roofs or worship halls (haiden) in addition to the main hall (honden). The following stylistic elements of Buddhist temple architecture were assimilated and applied to Japanese shrines: column-base stones, brackets, curved roofs, painted surfaces, metal ornaments, corridors and pagodas.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings {{of birds and}} other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E

5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun {{to show what}} quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something he loved {{to do on the}} farm), he made the mistake of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> tears.|$|E
5|$|Chambers' American {{football}} career <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> {{a standstill}} when a stress fracture injury {{on his right}} foot ruled him out for the season.

5|$|Cocker Spaniels were {{originally}} bred as hunting {{dogs in the}} United Kingdom, with the term cocker deriving from their use to hunt the Eurasian woodcock. When the breed <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the United States, it was bred to a different standard, which enabled it to specialize in hunting the American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during {{the early part of}} the 20th century.|$|E

Emma Dorotea Reinfeld later married the Swede Anders Karlsson, but her illegitimate son John kept his mother's surname. The spelling was later changed to Reinfeldt. He also has Italian ancestry, via his paternal grandmother.|$|E
5|$|During the Renaissance, {{money and}} art went hand in hand. Artists {{depended}} entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent.
