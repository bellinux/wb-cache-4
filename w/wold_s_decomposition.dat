The effect of microwave supply power on H 2 <b>S</b> <b>decomposition</b> rate was investigated over MoS 2 catalyst {{and found that}} 100 W was an optimal microwave supply power for this reaction. That is to say, the pathway of H 2 <b>S</b> <b>decomposition</b> under microwave conditions is different with that under conversional conditions. The activities of Co catalyst with different supports were also compared.

40|$|AbstractReplicative helicases play central {{roles in}} {{chromosome}} duplication and their assembly onto DNA is regulated via initiators and helicase loader proteins. The Escherichia coli replicative helicase DnaB and the helicase loader DnaC form a DnaB 6 –DnaC 6 complex {{that is required}} for loading DnaB onto single-stranded DNA. Overexpression of dnaC inhibits replication by promoting continual rebinding of DnaC to DnaB and consequent prevention of helicase translocation. Here we show that overexpression of dnaB also inhibits growth and chromosome duplication. This inhibition is countered by co-overexpression of wild-type DnaC but not of a DnaC mutant that cannot interact with DnaB, indicating that a reduction in DnaB 6 –DnaC 6 concentration {{is responsible for the}} phenotypes associated with elevated DnaB concentration. Partial defects in the oriC-specific initiator DnaA and in PriA-specific initiation away from oriC during replication repair sensitise cells to dnaB overexpression. Absence of the accessory replicative helicase Rep, resulting in increased replication blockage and thus increased reinitiation away from oriC, also exacerbates DnaB-induced defects. These findings indicate that elevated levels of helicase perturb replication initiation not only at origins of replication but also during fork repair at other sites on the chromosome. Thus, imbalances in levels of the replicative helicase and helicase loader can inhibit replication both via inhibition of DnaB 6 –DnaC 6 complex formation with excess DnaB, as shown here, and promotion of formation of DnaB 6 –DnaC 6 complexes with excess DnaC [Allen GC, Jr., Kornberg A.
