The term also includes a large number of non-urgent ambulances which are for transport of patients without an urgent acute condition (see below: Functional types) and a wide range of urgent and non-urgent vehicles including trucks, vans, bicycles, motorbikes, station wagons, buses, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, boats, and even hospital ships (see below: Vehicle types).|$|E
5|$|On 24 July 1959, Vulcan B.1 XA891 crashed {{due to an}} {{electrical}} failure during an engine test. Shortly after take-off, the crew observed generator <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> and loss of busbar voltage. The aircraft commander, Avro Chief Test Pilot Jimmy Harrison, climbed XA891 to , steering away from the airfield and populated areas while the AEO attempted to solve the problem. When {{it became clear that}} control would not be regained, Harrison instructed the rear compartment crew to exit the aircraft and the co-pilot to eject, before ejecting himself. All the crew survived, making them the first complete Vulcan crew to successfully escape. The aircraft crashed near Kingston upon Hull.|$|E

40|$|This {{report has}} {{documented}} the research performed {{to assess the}} effectiveness of a flashing <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> system as a work zone traffic control device. Researchers investigated motorist understanding of and perceived usefulness of various designs of the <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> system in a simulated work zone at night at TTI’s proving ground facility at the Texas A&M University Riverside Campus. Field studies of the <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> system were also performed at night to determine if the system would yield significant operational or safety benefits in actual work zone applications. Furthermore, researchers discussed the physical design of the <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> system in respect to the problems encountered while using the system in the proving ground and field studies. Proving ground and field studies show that the <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> system is perceived positively and is not confusing to the motoring public, and may encourage motorists to vacate a closed travel lane sooner (which is believed to offer a potential safety benefit). However, researchers believe that the current design (cable interconnected directional LED lights) of the system will be difficult to implement and maintain in a field setting. Therefore, researchers recommend that TxDOT consider the following: 1) TxDO...|$|R

25|$|Many U.S. states allow {{volunteer}} fire, EMS and Search and Rescue {{personnel to}} place emergency <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> {{in their personal}} vehicles for use when responding to emergencies. The degree of lighting is mandated by law and also by local custom in most areas, and can vary from a single rotating light on the dashboard or roof, to a setup much like modern police cruisers. Some states also allow volunteer use of sirens and air horns to request the right of way.|$|E
25|$|<b>Warning</b> <b>lights</b> and bells are {{activated}} {{when the}} train is about 1km before the crossing, depending on line speed. 5seconds later the barriers start closing, which takes about 10seconds. When the barriers have closed, the bells are often set less loud. Lights and bells are stopped when the barriers have raised again. As passive warning signs there are red and white striped fences, red and white saltires for single tracks (doubled in case {{of two or more}} tracks) and sometimes advanced warning signs at 80, 160 and 240metres.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Power supply == The ideal <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> {{must be able}} {{to power}} itself while clamped to a single wire of the line. Lights may be powered either from the {{electric}} field surrounding the energized wire, or the magnetic field produced by current through the wire. The first approach takes advantage of the high electric potential gradient between conductors, but a strong enough capacitive coupling is requested to allow capacitive extraction of the power required from the <b>warning</b> <b>light.</b> This means that long conductors must be suspended parallel to the line using glass/ceramic isolators: in fact several meters of suspended conductor are generally required, total length being inversely proportional to the line voltage. The second approach is based on Faraday's law of induction involving magnetic flux flowing through a circuit which powers the <b>warning</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R
