Adler did not doubt that the rabbi <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Yiddish actors leaving London. In New York, they promptly discovered that neither Mogulesko and Finkel at the Romanian Opera House nor Maurice Heine at the Oriental Theater had any use for them. They headed on to Chicago, where, after a brief initial success, the troupe fell apart due to a combination of labor disputes and cutthroat competition. The Oberlanders managed to start a restaurant; he and Keni Liptzin headed to New York that autumn, where she managed to sign on at the Romanian Opera House; failing to find a similar situation for himself, he returned to London, drawn back to the charms of both Dinah and Jennya.|$|E

[...] In mid August 2006, Machine Head announced that the title of their sixth studio effort would be The Blackening. Flynn and drummer Dave McClain spent August 18 and 19 jamming together, fine tuning songs chosen for the album and performing pre-production.

500|$|In February 2010, a 180-page {{volume of}} Mengele's diary was sold by Alexander Autographs at auction for an {{undisclosed}} sum to the grandson of a Holocaust survivor. The unidentified previous owner, who acquired the journals in Brazil, {{was reported to be}} close to the Mengele family. A Holocaust survivors' organization described the sale as [...] "a cynical act of exploitation aimed at profiting from the writings {{of one of the most}} heinous Nazi criminals." [...] Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the diary fall into Jewish hands. [...] "At a time when Ahmadinejad's Iran regularly denies the Holocaust and anti-Semitism and hatred of Jews is back in vogue, this acquisition is especially significant," [...] he said.

500|$|In contrast, Amy Kaufman from Los Angeles Times {{opined that}} Cavallari was more {{intriguing}} than Conrad, whose storylines she felt had been overshadowed as the series progressed. Tracie Egan Morrissey of Jezebel commented that she [...] "kind of [...] Kristin", and <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her replacing Conrad. Julie Miller from Movieline {{was critical of}} the episode's [...] "staged showdowns", but nonetheless noted that the series [...] "continues to compel" [...] like professional wrestling and enjoyed {{a scene in which}} Jenner became irritated with Nicole, labeling it the sole genuine reaction of the episode. Writing for Homorazzi, Patrick [...] "loved this episode", and expressed an interest in the love triangle that seemingly develops between Cavallari, Jenner, and Nicole. Furthermore, a writer from The Hollywood Gossip opined that The Hills [...] "can annoy the crap out of you sometimes" [...] but [...] "still entertains" [...] despite appearing to be heavily scripted.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Slanderous" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Mourning" [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] was {{the third}} song that was written for Machine Heads album The Blackening. Flynn {{originally}} presented it to the band as [...] "The Thrashterpiece" [...] which became the songs working title, because according to Flynn [...] "it owes a huge debt to the band Exodus, (there's) a lot of Bay Area thrash worship {{going on in this}} song." [...] In February 2005, Machine Head had penned a rough version of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate". A 13-track November 2005 demo featured the song, although it contained what Flynn described as a [...] "totally fucking lame 'Angel of Death' rip off. I hated it every time we played it so I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that part go!" [...] The band entered Sharkbite Studios, in Oakland, California on August 21, 2006 to begin recording. Production duties were handled by Flynn with assistance from Mark Keaton, and mixing by Colin Richardson.|$|E
500|$|On 23 July {{they set}} off again longing to reach home, but FitzRoy wanted to ensure the {{accuracy}} of his longitude measurements and so took the ship across the Atlantic back to Bahia in Brazil to take check readings. Darwin <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the beauties of the jungle for a last time, but now compared [...] "the stately Mango trees with the Horse Chesnuts of England." [...] The return trip was delayed for a further 11 days when weather forced the Beagle to shelter further up the coast at Pernambuco, where Darwin examined rocks for signs of elevation, noted [...] "Mangroves like rank grass" [...] and investigated marine invertebrates at various depths on the sandbar. The Beagle departed for home on 17 August. After a stormy passage including a stop for supplies at the Azores, the Beagle finally reached Falmouth, Cornwall, England on 2 October 1836.

500|$|Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Ben and Leslie come {{together}} {{the way they}} did, particularly because he feared the no-dating rule would become an [...] "artificial barrier" [...] that dragged out the romance subplot. Porter also praised Rob Lowe's performance, and said it made the character likeable even as he kept Leslie and Ben apart. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called it a [...] "stellar" [...] episode that was [...] "loose, silly, rich with details and heart". While he said the episode included good [...] "outrageous comedy", he said the script strives on the more subtle scenes about Leslie and Ben coming together, along with Chris' constant interruptions. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic was underwhelmed by the Know Ya Boo story, but strongly praised Leslie and Ben's scenes, which he said were both touching and very funny. He particularly praised the way [...] scene when Ben describes his feelings for Leslie through his description to the baseball tournament panel about why he loves Pawnee.|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the usage}} of A Link to the Pasts version of Hyrule in A Link Between Worlds, Veloria thought that while revisiting {{familiar}} places was a nostalgic experience, the mystery of exploring new areas was absent and having to retread the same game world again was [...] "somewhat unsatisfying". Gaston called the loose structure and openness of the game a [...] "revelatory change", and <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that some restrictions in previous Zelda titles were not present in A Link Between Worlds. The introduction of the item rental system was well received, with many reviewers {{pointing out that the}} system granted players with more freedom. Ryckert loved having items available from the beginning, saying that it allowed him to experiment in combat. Both MacDonald and Gies agreed that losing rented items upon defeat added another layer of challenge and consequence to the game. Nintendo Life reviewer, Martin Watts found that streamlining the item system allowed the game to place a greater emphasis aspects such as exploration, solving puzzles and boss fights. However, Veloria expressed that not being able to find key items in dungeons was a drawback of the system.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the episode was not entirely favorable. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted a general decline in the show's quality in the fourth season, and after a return to form in its previous episode, [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001", he found [...] "Secret Santa" [...] disappointing, {{and gave it a}} grade B. [...] "It was cute and nicely plotted", he wrote [...] "but it felt a little rote and familiar." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning was more positively inclined. He appreciated Julianne Moore's appearance, but he found that some of the story lines, [...] "though sprinkled with funny moments, were more successful as sweet tales made for the holiday." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Cheyenne Jackson's Danny back on 30 Rock, and noted that the plots concerning Jack and Nancy and Kenneth and the TGS writers, respectively, were [...] "home runs". He liked that Tina Fey's character Liz [...] "was more of a supporting player" [...] in [...] "Secret Santa". Sassone also enjoyed Moore's appearance on the show, commenting that she was [...] "wicked good" [...] as Jack's new love interest. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons wrote that this episode [...] "had some awesome Liz/Jack moments, a nice little storyline for Pete and Danny, and the invention of a whole new pizza-loving religion." ...|$|E

500|$|David Kronke of the Los Angeles Daily News {{wrote that}} the show [...] "returns to its wicked wit, dialing back but {{certainly}} not eradicating the melodrama." [...] He complimented the four main actresses for their comedic relief and concluded: [...] "Rarely does a show unjump the shark this well; it's back in fine form, calibrating its humor and its menace just right." [...] New York Daily News writer David Bianculli compared the premiere to the show's second season, noting that the episode showed [...] "an assurance and a knowing playfulness that was missing most of last year." [...] He complimented Cherry and Greenstein's script and approved the storylines for each character. Bianculli opined that the episode returned {{the quality of the}} show's first season and concluded: [...] "Pass the word: If you've given up on 'Desperate Housewives,' it's time to return to the neighborhood." [...] Entertainment Weekly Lindsay Soll identified Eva Longoria as the episode's strongest performer, declaring that she [...] "definitely looks like the one to watch this season." [...] Soll <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the Susan character was [...] "a little more toned down and less accident-prone than usual," [...] and called the scenes with Susan and Mike touching. Additionally, she opined that Laurie Metcalf [...] "did a brilliant job of playing the classic TV nosy neighbor," [...] but expressed her confusion over the Orson storyline.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{praised the}} episode, comparing it positively to previous episodes [...] "Casino Night" [...] and [...] "Booze Cruise": [...] "not as heavy or emotional, certainly, {{but still a}} chance to see our Dunderheads in a charming and demonstrative not-quite-work environment." [...] Lyons also complimented a number of changes in the series the episode seemed to indicate, including shifting allegiances, goodwill where there used to be bad and a possible budding romance between Andy and Kelly. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode, [...] "started off seeming like a dumb and pointless idea before gradually revealing itself to be a fun, and even welcome, diversion." [...] Sepinwall said the episode was not as funny as other recent ones, but that he enjoyed seeing the characters interact this way together, and particularly liked seeing Dwight and Phyllis bond, [...] "even as he treated her like a racehorse". Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune in Scranton, Pennsylvania, described the episode as [...] "a wacky and wonderful little gem, one of those rare ones where it was just wall-to-wall happy, giddy fun, with not a drop of pathos, except for maybe Michael whining about having to eat lunch by himself." [...] McAuliffe also said he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Erin's [...] "cheerful, appealingly goofy personality" [...] continue to emerge.|$|E
500|$|Thunderball was {{generally}} well {{received by the}} critics; Francis Iles, writing in The Guardian wrote that it [...] "is a good, tough, straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines." [...] Referring to the negative publicity that surrounded Dr. No—in particular the article by Paul Johnson in the New Statesman entitled, [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism"—Iles was left [...] "wondering {{what all the fuss}} is about", noting that [...] "there is no more sadism nor sex than is expected of the author of this kind of thriller". Peter Duval Smith, writing in Financial Times, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming's work against negative criticism, also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review: [...] "one should not make a cult of Fleming's novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing." [...] Duval Smith thought that Thunderball was [...] "an exciting story is skilfully told", with [...] "a romantic sub-plot... and the denouement involves great events" [...] He also considered it [...] "the best written since Diamonds Are Forever, four books back. It has pace and humour and style. The violence is not so unrelenting as usual: an improvement, I think." [...] He also expressed concern for the central character, saying [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him [...] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up. He was having bad hangovers on half-a-bottle of whisky a day, which I don't call a lot, unless he wasn't eating properly." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. The {{episode was}} described as [...] "tense", with Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic, saying that [...] ""Missing" [...] upped the emotional intensity when the autopsies weren't about finding a killer, but about finding a kidnapped little boy". Orlando said that the scenes with Bud were a highlight, {{as well as the}} scenes with Megan and Derek. Orlando said, [...] "I enjoyed the banter between Megan and Derek. He's the optimist to her pessimist. When they get the photo of the boy, Derek pointed out that at least he's alive and not alone. Megan said yes, but he's sick and possibly coughing up blood. The amateur nature of the photo gave Derek hope that the kidnapper wasn't a professional. Great, said Megan, that meant he was incompetent and desperate. Was anyone else seeing a case where opposites attract?". She said it was a [...] "pity" [...] that Megan turned Derek down; [...] "Megan could use a bit of a love life and I'm hoping we see more of Agent Ames in the future". She said she was [...] "thankful" [...] that there was not a storyline with Lacey (Mary Mouser), saying that the storyline with Megan and Kate arguing over Lacey had gotten [...] "old", [...] "I'm happy they seem to be moving on". Finishing, she praised the scenes with Megan and Joan and added, [...] "Having been a bit bored with last week's episode, I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Body of Proof step up its game. The only thing lacking was a bit of the humour I've grown to love".|$|E
500|$|The {{fire and}} Peggy's exit episodes {{garnered}} a mixed reception by critics. Liam Tucker, founder of website Watch With Mothers, compared the fire episode {{to the film}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and admired the special effects and performances of the episode, but said that it seemed unlikely that everyone would have escaped safely, especially Stacey and her baby. Roz Laws from the Sunday Mercury wondered if the fire episode was inaccurate {{due to the lack}} of fire alarms, sprinklers and emergency lighting in the pub, but noted that the episode's use of the song [...] "Murder on the Dancefloor", featuring the line [...] "Gonna burn this god damn house right down", was [...] "clever". A writer for Heat said [...] "We knew the Vic fire was coming, but actually seeing it was quite another thing, and knowing that it also marked the end of an era with the departure of [...] Windsor made it that much more emotional." [...] A reporter for the Nottingham Evening Post wrote [...] "Never in the history of soap fires, of which there have of course been legion, have so many hilariously overindulgent explosions been captured on camera." [...] The Mail on Sunday picked the fire episode as the [...] "Soap of the Day", while The People deemed the lack of deaths [...] "a wasted opportunity." [...] Ally Ross wrote in his column in The Sun that the fire episode was [...] "twenty minutes of shouting", questioned why one character was seen flouting the smoking ban and Phil was boarded up behind an inward-opening door, and opined that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Peggy leave as she had become [...] "increasingly psychotic" [...] and [...] "vile".|$|E
500|$|Nathin Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode {{made him feel}} [...] "borderline euphoric", and said of it, [...] "With a light touch the show made an {{insightful}} point—that we need our dance-offs and workday discos and spontaneous expressions of delight." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode had [...] "an infectious sense of fun" [...] and {{felt as if the}} show producers [...] "just turned the camera on the cast's wrap party and let it roll a while". However, Fickett also said very little actually happened in the episode, which he said felt [...] "mostly like filler" [...] between the recently finished Michael Scott Paper Company arc and the following week's season finale, [...] "Company Picnic". New York magazine writer Will Leitch also said the episode felt lighter than recent episodes, but he said, [...] "that’s okay: They’ve earned a week off, and they sure seem to be having a lot of fun." [...] He particularly praised the competition between Andy and Kelly, and Michael's dancing: [...] "There are few funnier dancers than Steve Carell, particularly Steve Carell amped on coffee." [...] Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said the episode allowed the entire cast to shine and included great chemistry between Phyllis Smith and Rainn Wilson. He also said he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Ellie Kemper get more screen time, [...] "and not just because she's Office eye candy. She adds some freshness to the cast, as she's the only person at Dunder Mifflin right now who doesn't really know anything about all the drama and backstory, so she just takes Michael and everyone else for face value." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend described [...] "Cafe Disco" [...] as [...] "one of the most random episodes of The Office." ...|$|E
