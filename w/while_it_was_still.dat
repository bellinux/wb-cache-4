Los Alamos received its first plutonium from Hanford on February 2. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> by no means clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the war's end, Hanford was by early 1945 in operation.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E

Just as Rosa Burger in the novel visits family in prison, so Gordimer visited her friend. Later in 1986, Gordimer gave evidence at the Delmas Treason Trial in support of 22 ANC members accused of treason. She was a member of the ANC <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> an illegal organization in South Africa, and hid several ANC leaders in her own home to help them evade arrest by the security forces.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Sakurai {{confirmed}} {{that he was}} working on a new game through Project Sora. Uprising was officially announced at the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the announcement of the 3DS. In an interview closer to release, Sakurai said that he had misgivings about Uprising being shown off at gaming expos since 2010 <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in an unfinished state. As announced in 2011, the game suffered a delay that pushed its release into 2012. In January 2012, Sakurai announced via his Twitter feed that the game had gone gold. The game released on Japan on 22 March 2012; in Europe and North America on 23 March; and in Australia on 29 March. The game's box art was almost identical between its Japanese and English releases.|$|E

The regularly assigned aircraft commander, Robert A.

Despite a localization being confirmed as in development in an official guidebook interview, the original version of Type-0 was not released in the west. In the wake of the game's release in Japan, 1UP.com and Joystiq speculated that the game could be successfully brought west as a port to the PlayStation Vita. Tabata later commented that the main reasons for the game not being localized were the flagging Western PSP market and uncertainties surrounding the Vita's commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Castlevania was rebooted {{due to the}} team's {{concern over}} the poor sales in their latest Castlevania games. The team wished to expand the franchise's fanbase with this game. A number of prototypes in {{parallel}} development competed {{to become the next}} Castlevania title. Konami told MercurySteam the game would be an original intellectual property (IP) when it was first greenlit as a Castlevania title. Konami eventually asked them to cease work on Lords of Shadow <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in its early stages, until David Cox showed the Japanese senior management the game and was offered help by video game designer Hideo Kojima. Konami then chose the pitch for it as the next Castlevania entry. The original concept for the game was to remake the first Castlevania starring Simon Belmont, but it was later decided to make a reboot of the franchise. Lords of Shadow still drew inspiration from earlier titles in the series, most notably Castlevania for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Castlevania IV.|$|E
5|$|Gellibrand was {{disappointed}} at not being appointed AA & QMG, but Bridges was unimpressed with Gellibrand's staff work. He felt that Gellibrand had mishandled the move of the 2nd Infantry Brigade to Cape Helles, where it {{participated in the}} First Battle of Krithia. He also expected Gellibrand to organise a proper officers' mess at Gallipoli and was annoyed at the poor quality of what Gellibrand had scrounged from ships' canteen supplies. Gellibrand might have even been dismissed by Bridges but fate intervened. On 1 May Gellibrand {{was wounded in the}} ankle by shrapnel. Then, on 11 May, while laughing at two men whose water bottles had been holed, he received a severe wound in his right shoulder and was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS Gascon. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> anchored off Anzac Cove, Bridges was wounded on 15 May and brought on board the same ship (and to the same bed, Gellibrand was moved out of the way), where Bridges died on 18 May 1915.|$|E

5|$|In 1955 the US Army began {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) as an anti-ballistic missile to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the missile could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> far enough away to give the missile time to launch. All of this appeared to be within {{the state of the}} art, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. These barriers were swept aside in late 1957 after the launch of the R-7 Semyorka, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority.|$|E
5|$|News soon {{spread of}} {{thousands}} of Chinese joining forces with Javanese soldiers in Grobogan, outside of Semarang. On 1 May, Visscher was accosted by Captain Rudolph Carel von Glan, a unit leader, asking why Visscher had done nothing {{to deal with the}} uprising. Visscher heatedly replied that it was not Glan's business. The following day, after being questioned by prosecutor Jeronimus Tonnemans Jr., Yonko, and Anko, Visscher became increasingly angry, breaking a table in half and yelling at his Chinese advisers. When Yanko disappeared after the meeting, Anko told Visscher that he had joined the rebelling Chinese. This caused Visscher, who had heavily invested in Yonko and had left a large amount of money with him, to take out his carriage and scream to the residents of Semarang to escape <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> possible. This continued until he crashed into the city walls. The residents ran away from Semarang in a panic, leaving eight loaded cannons outside the city walls.|$|E
5|$|Purvis {{was born}} on July 4, 1857, into a family of Scottish descent. His parents were Robert Raaf Purvis and Annie Silburn Marshall. His {{paternal}} grandfather, William Purvis, {{who worked as a}} trader and ship captain, had settled in the Dutch East Indies in the 1810s <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> part of the British Empire. The family lived in many places including Dutch East Indies, Brussels, and London. Educated at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Edward William Purvis served as a sub-lieutenant of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot in Bengal, where he learned Hindi, and later as a sub-lieutenant for the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot in Chatham, Kent. Around 1879 he resigned his British Army post and traveled to the Hawaiian Islands, where his father and older brother Robert William Theodore Purvis had already settled, having arrived on December13, 1877; his brother Theodore had started a sugar plantation business on the island of Kauai. A distant cousin of theirs was William Herbert Purvis, known for introducing macadamia nuts to Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a subtropical cyclone, Olga maintained well-defined outflow, and located to the southeast of a strong ridge over the western Atlantic Ocean, the cyclone tracked west-southwestward. The storm strengthened slightly while paralleling the north coast of Puerto Rico, and after an increase in convection near the center, Olga made landfall near Punta Cana, Dominican Republic at 1800UTC on December 11. A Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm reported a tighter wind gradient and peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), and at 0000UTC on December 12 the National Hurricane Center reclassified Olga as a tropical cyclone <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> inland. Convection rapidly weakened as the storm crossed central Hispaniola, and upon reaching the Caribbean Sea the system lacked the convection required for the classification of a tropical cyclone; rainbands well to its northeast maintained stronger winds, though the center became ill-defined with dry air and strong wind shear. Late on December 12, convection increased slightly over the center, though {{by that time the}} cyclone weakened to tropical depression status. As significant convection failed to persist, the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Olga earlier on December 13 while located about 80miles (130km) northwest of Kingston.|$|E

Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb purchased the division from their employers in December 1989, as Cineplex looked to offload assets. Originally the assistant general manager of The Pantages Theatre, he became its general manager. In 1993, he moved to North York Performing Arts Centre to prepare it for the stage revival of the musical Show Boat. Livent used Toronto as the test site for the original Broadway production of Ragtime; it made it world premiere at North York Centre in 1996, and Bednar was involved in production. As of 1997, Bednar was general manager of The Pantages Theatre. {{and general manager of}} theatre for its parent company, Livent. From 1997 to 1998, {{near the end of his}} time with the company, he spent a year in New York City preparing the Ford Center for the Performing Arts for its opening and that of Ragtime; he had worked on the production previously in Toronto. He was scheduled to oversee the remake of Chicago's Oriental Theatre into the Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In 1097, the Crusader armies {{assembled}} at Constantinople having {{traveled in}} groups eastward through Europe. Alexios I, who had requested only some western knights {{to serve as}} mercenaries to help fight the Seljuk Turks, blockaded these armies {{in the city and}} would not permit them to leave until their leaders swore oaths promising to restore to the Empire any land formerly belonging to it that they might conquer on the way to Jerusalem. The Crusaders eventually swore these oaths, individually rather than as a group. In return, Alexios gave them guides and a military escort. The Crusaders were however exasperated by Byzantine tactics, such as negotiating the surrender of Nicaea from the Seljuks <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> under siege by the Crusaders, who hoped to plunder it to help finance their journey. The Crusaders, feeling betrayed by Alexios, who was able to recover a number of important cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor, continued on their way without Byzantine aid. In 1098, when Antioch had been captured after a long siege and the Crusaders were in turn themselves besieged in the city, Alexios marched out to meet them, but, hearing from Stephen of Blois that the situation was hopeless, he returned to Constantinople. The Crusaders, who had unexpectedly withstood the siege, believed Alexios had abandoned them and considered the Byzantines completely untrustworthy. Therefore, they regarded their oaths as invalidated.|$|E

5|$|The {{assault was}} under the direct command of Major-General Essad Pasha. The plan was to gather the assault force {{secretly}} behind the Turkish lines on 18 May. Then at 03:30 19 May, <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> dark, the Turkish forces would simultaneously attack all along the ANZAC perimeter. The aim was to force the defenders out of their trenches {{and back into the}} sea. To maintain surprise the attack would not be preceded by an artillery bombardment; but the previous day all the available Turkish artillery bombarded the ANZAC lines between 17:00 and midnight. This was something they had done twice before that month. The signal to start the attack {{was supposed to have been}} the detonation of a large mine at Quinn's Post, in the centre of the ANZAC lines, but by 19 May the tunnel for the mine had not been completed. The attacking force, from north to south, comprised the 19th Division (now made up of the 27th, 57th and 72nd Infantry Regiments), 5th Division (13th and 14th Infantry Regiments), 2nd Division (1st, 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments), 16th Division (33rd, 47th, 48th and 125th Infantry Regiments) and the now independent 77th Infantry Regiment. In total this was around 42,000 men. The 2nd and 16th Divisions were fresh, having just arrived on the peninsula, while the other two had taken part in some of the previous counter-attacks at Anzac Cove.|$|E
