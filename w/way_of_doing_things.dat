There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E

This contrast defines his character: he enjoys living the high life, {{but at the same time}} is uncomfortably conscious of his low beginnings and obsession with business. He is often portrayed on stage as an unpleasant character because of his greedy tendencies and ultimate betrayal of the Gayev family, but there is nothing in the play to suggest this: he works strenuously to help the Gayevs, but to no avail. Lopakhin represents the new middle class in Russia, one of many threats to the old aristocratic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

He also put a ban on the team's long-standing tradition of having wine at the mechanics lunch table during testing, something that proved unpopular with the team's mostly Italian mechanics.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between November 2 and December 23, 1981. The plants used in the gardening scenes were brought inside at night {{to keep them from}} freezing. Due to the tight schedule, the cast and crew worked seven days a week with very long hours each day. Although the Australian filmmakers and the crew, who were mostly from Dallas, got along very well {{both on and off the}} set, Beresford and Duvall were at odds during the production. Beresford, in his usual approach, meticulously planned each scene, and Duvall, who preferred a free-form give-and-take on set, felt restricted by the director's methods. Although Duvall regularly acknowledged his talent as a director, he said of Beresford, [...] "He has this dictatorial <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> with me that just doesn't cut it. Man, I have to have my freedom." [...] Although he had no problem with Duvall's acting methodology, the actor's temperament infuriated Beresford. While filming one scene with Harper and Barkin, he became so frustrated during a phone conversation with Duvall that he said, [...] "Well if you want to direct the film, go right ahead," [...] and walked off the set. Beresford flew to New York and reportedly was ready to quit, until Duvall flew out to speak with him. After further arguments, the two made amends and returned to work on the film.|$|E
