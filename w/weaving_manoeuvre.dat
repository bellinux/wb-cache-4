40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{modeling}} the acceleration-deceleration behavior of drivers during freeway weaving manoeuvres, under heavy traffic conditions. Data capturing {{a wide range}} of microscopic information were collected using video-recording and image processing techniques. The data was collected at two weaving sections on urban freeways in Tokyo and Melbourne. A theoretical framework for modeling weaving driver acceleration-deceleration behavior is presented. The collected data are used to calibrate the proposed model. A particular feature of the proposed model is that it captures the acceleration-deceleration behavior of drivers during the entire process of <b>weaving</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> The results indicate that on average a 0. 72 sec time gap exists before weaving drivers respond to stimuli. It is found that the surrounding freeway vehicles significantly affect the weaving vehicle acceleration behavior. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTraffic Rotary at road intersections {{is special}} form of grade change of lanes to {{channelize}} movement of vehicles {{in one direction}} around a central traffic island. With rapid growth of traffic it is experienced that widening of roads and providing flyovers have become imperative to overcome major conflicts at intersections such as collision between through and right- turn movements. In this way, major conflicts are converted into milder conflicts like merging and diverging. The vehicles entering the rotary are gently forced to move in a clockwise direction. They then weave out of the rotary to the desired direction. The crossing of vehicles is avoided by allowing all vehicles to merge into a stream around the rotary and then to diverge out to the desired radiating road. Thus the crossing conflicts eliminate and convert into <b>weaving</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> or a merging operation from right and a diverging operation to the left. In this paper, designing rotaries at road intersections is discussed and a software package is developed {{to be used in}} road works...|$|E

The 120 kg warhead (originally based on that of the Bullpup ASM built under license by Kongsberg) detonates inside the target ship by using a delay fuze. The MK3 when launched from high altitudes can initially act as a glidebomb, only firing its rocket engine to extend range, or ideally to achieve maximum speed before hitting the target; for better penetration.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{most of the}} {{existing}} highway capacity manuals, level of service (LOS) of freeway weaving segments and ramp junctions is traditionally defined by the speed, volume or density in critical areas of merge, diverge and <b>weaving</b> <b>manoeuvres.</b> In that traditional concept several capacity values of different critical areas (merge, diverge, weaving) as well as upstream and downstream basic freeway segments within the influence areas are evaluated separately. In this paper, a new model which considers the total segment of freeway merge, diverge, and weaving as an entire object is introduced. A combined volume-tocapacity ratio is used for defining the LOS of the total segment. According to the probability and queuing theory, the volume-tocapacity ratio of the whole segment {{can be considered as}} a combination of volume-to-capacity ratios in the different critical areas under consideration. The parameters of the new model can be calibrated with field data. Those parameters are functions of the number of lanes on the freeways, the number of lanes in the on-ramps or off-ramps, the length of the acceleration, deceleration, or weaving sections. Varying the model parameters the function can be fitted to {{the existing}} capacity models for different types of weaving segments or ramp junctions. With this model, the traffic quality (LOS) can be obtained directly {{as a function of the}} volumes on the freeway and on the on-ramp or off-ramp respectively. The new model has the following advantages: a) a uniform function for all types of freeway weaving segments and ramp junctions, b) traffic quality assessment for all critical areas under investigation in one step, and c) easy calibration. The new model will be incorporated into the new edition of the German Highway Capacity Manual (HBS 201 X) ...|$|R
