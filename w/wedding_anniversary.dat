2500|$|<b>Weddings,</b> <b>anniversaries,</b> and {{funerals}} are observed, {{though they}} avoid incorporating certain traditions they see to have pagan origins. The Watchtower {{has stated that}} the use of wedding rings by Witnesses is acceptable, even though wedding rings may have first been used by pagans, based on its conclusion that there is no definite evidence wedding rings were used [...] "as part of false religious practices" [...] (emphasis from original). Witnesses typically observe <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries,</b> with the Watch Tower Society noting that <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries</b> apparently do not stem from pagan origins.|$|R
40|$|Married {{couples in}} the United States {{celebrate}} their <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries</b> through occupation. The celebrations are highly interactive, creating a meaningful and focused co-occupation {{for the two}} individuals. Co-occupation, as defined in occupational science, reflects engagement in occupation {{of two or more}} individuals, whereby the occupation cannot occur without both partners present and actively engaged (Pierce, 2009). Within occupational science, studies have been conducted illustrating celebratory occupations associated with food and holidays (Shordike 2 ̆ 6 Pierce, 2005). However, there currently is no research regarding celebratory occupations related to the ways individuals celebrate their <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries.</b> Studies that have been conducted regarding <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries</b> do not specifically address celebratory means, but focus on quality of marriage, social networking, and shared memories (Kearns 2 ̆ 6 Kenneth, 2004; Leeds-Hurwitz, 2005). The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe how married couples who were born, raised, and currently reside in the United States observe their <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries.</b> Using a grounded theory approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 heterosexual couples who have been married for at least one year. Range of years married spanned from 1 - 57 years to maximize comparative contrast in the data. Both partners were present during interviewing. Interviews were transcribed and coded using Hyper Research. The study revealed four common factors in the celebration of <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries.</b> Family involvement was an important role in determining celebratory activities. Couples were less likely to extravagantly celebrate non-milestone anniversaries as years passed, which indicated the effect on anniversary celebration due to the number of years married. Annual means of celebrating <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries</b> became their rituals, such as giving gifts or dining at certain restaurants. Lastly, planning of activities depended on the number of years married and couples’ rituals. This study will add to occupational science literature and offer empirical evidenced based data regarding social and cultural celebratory occupations in observance of married couples’ <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries</b> useful across social sciences. Discussion Questions: The celebration of <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries</b> and many other co-occupations have been studied in occupational science. Why are these particular occupations of so much interest to occupational scientists? Wedding anniversaries are annual celebratory rituals that seem to carry great symbolic significance. What other occupations carry the significance and have been studied, or should be studies, in occupational science...|$|R

5|$|Purcell {{did not set}} any of Shakespeare's text to music; {{instead he}} {{composed}} music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare wrote it. The masques {{are related to the}} play metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that they bear no relationship to the play. Recent scholarship has shown that the opera, which ends with a masque featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversary</b> of William III and Mary II.|$|E
50|$|The {{historic}} {{origins of}} <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversaries</b> {{date back to}} the Holy Roman Empire, where husbands crowned their wives with a silver wreath on their twenty-fifth anniversary, and a gold wreath on the fiftieth.

5|$|Helena saw {{relatively}} little of her surviving siblings, and continued {{her role as}} a support to the monarchy and a campaigner for the many charities she represented.

On one such occasion, the elderly couple represented the King at the silver <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversary,</b> in 1906, of Kaiser Wilhelm II (Helena's nephew) and his wife Augusta Victoria (Christian's niece). During the Edwardian period, Helena visited the grave of her son, Prince Christian Victor, who died in 1900 following a bout with malaria while serving in the Second Boer War. She was met by South African Prime Minister Louis Botha, but Jan Smuts refused to meet her, partly because he was bitter that South Africa had lost the war and partly because his son had died in a British concentration camp.|$|E

As president of the latter, she was a strong supporter of nurse registration against the advice of Florence Nightingale. She became the first member of her family to celebrate her 50th <b>wedding</b> <b>anniversary</b> in 1916, but her husband died a year later. Helena outlived him by six years, and died aged 77 at Schomberg House on 9 June 1923.|$|E
