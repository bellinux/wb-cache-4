German institutions such as the State of Hesse, the German Federal government and the State of Baden-Württemberg support VGU financially. The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the <b>World</b> <b>University</b> <b>Services</b> (WUS, Germany) contribute to VGU's further development by their long-term experience in higher education. Furthermore, German and multi-national companies support VGU. The VGU-Consortium, a non-profit organization plays a significant role for VGU's progress. It consists of more than 30 universities which include the TU9, an association Germany's leading Universities of Technology. The VGU-Consortium coordinates the cooperation with German partner universities and is in charge of academic as well as administrative issues. The VGU-Consortium also seeks to contribute to the internationalization of the German higher education sector. An important milestone in VGU's development is the loan of US$180 million, provided by the World Bank. Approved in June 2010, the loan is mainly used for the construction of the new campus in Binh Duong Province, a blooming town adjacent to Ho Chi Minh City.|$|R

The main objective of this paper is to examine the relationship of food quality and food price on international students‘ satisfaction in UUM cafeterias. A mixed-method approach was applied in this study which includes both qualitative and quantitative methods. In order to identify the current research problem, an initial pre-data collection was being done by distributing comment cards to the international students to gain feedback regarding their satisfaction towards food quality and food price while patronizing in UUM cafeterias. Based on the findings, majority of international students were dissatisfied with the taste, freshness, temperature, portion, and price. The second phase of this study, which is quantitative method, was conducted. Multiple regression analysis was done to examine the significant relationship between food quality and food price on international students‘ satisfaction in UUM cafeterias. Results revealed that taste, freshness, portion and price have significant relationship with international students‘ satisfaction. Meanwhile, temperature was not found to be significantly associated with international students‘ satisfaction.
