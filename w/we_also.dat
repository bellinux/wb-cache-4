25|$|<b>We</b> <b>also</b> {{have the}} usual algebra between spatial diffeomorphisms. This {{represents}} a dramatic simplification of the Poisson bracket structure, and raises new hope {{in understanding the}} dynamics and establishing the semiclassical limit.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>also</b> have a {{human right}} to sanitation: In September, 2010, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a {{resolution}} {{recognizing that the}} human right to water and sanitation {{are a part of}} the right to an adequate standard of living.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>also</b> possess in {{fragments}} a History of Physics (Περὶ φυσικῶν ἱστοριῶν). To {{this class}} of work belong the still extant sections on Fire, on the Winds, and on the signs of Waters, Winds, and Storms.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} the Euler-Poincaré's characteristic with an elementary way and historically. <b>We</b> explain <b>also</b> why one should call Descartes-Poincaré characteristic {{instead of the}} Euler-Poincaré's characteristic. All the considered spaces are compact and without boundary. We work essentially on smooth and oriented surfaces. However, <b>we</b> work <b>also</b> on singular and non-oriented surfaces. <b>We</b> provide <b>also</b> the results which may be extended for the case of superior dimension.

25|$|The {{least squares}} estimators are point {{estimates}} of the linear regression model parameters β. However, generally <b>we</b> <b>also</b> {{want to know how}} close those estimates might be to the true values of parameters. In other words, we want to construct the interval estimates.|$|E
25|$|If {{the medium}} {{is not the}} whole space, in order to solve the heat {{equation}} uniquely <b>we</b> <b>also</b> need to specify boundary conditions for u.
