5000|$|The <b>white-winged</b> <b>shrike-tanager</b> {{is about}} 16 cm long. The male has a black {{head with a}} patch of {{yellowish}} olive {{at the front of}} the crown. The back and rump are yellowish ochre, and the underparts are yellow apart from an olive bib at the throat. The wings and tail are blackish, and there is a large patch of white on the outer wing-coverts. The female is much more uniform in colour, being brownish ochre above, the wings and tail being darker than the other upper parts, and yellowish ochre below, with an especially yellow belly. The male is quite distinctive, but the female could be confused with the flame-crested tanager (Tachyphonus cristatus), but the latter has browner upper parts and is buffish ochre rather than yellowish ochre below. The beak is large and sharply hooked in both sexes, the upper mandible having a [...] "tooth" [...] at the tip.|$|E
