500|$|Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV: A {{first-class}} passenger whom Rose (correctly) {{calls the}} richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife Madeleine (Charlotte Chatton) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack {{is connected to the}} [...] "Boston Dawsons", a question Jack neatly deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> in.|$|E
500|$|Bulleid {{designed}} a new [...] tender which could carry 5 tons (5.1 t) of coal on a six-wheel chassis. [...] It featured BFB wheels and streamlined panels, or [...] "raves", {{that gave the}} top of the tender a similar cross-sectional outline to the carriages hauled by the locomotive. [...] The water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight, and the tender was fitted with vacuum braking equipment of a clasp-type similar to that used on the locomotive. [...] Three train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space. [...] Unusually for a British locomotive, two extra water filler caps were incorporated into the tender front, for access from the footplate. [...] The original tender design proved to be inadequately braced and subject to serious leakage if even slightly damaged, or when <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> caused the welded joints to split. [...] The problem was not solved until 1944 when additional baffling was fitted.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] long Chalakudy River, {{originates}} in the Anamudi mountains of the Western Ghats and {{flows through the}} Vazhachal Forest toward the Arabian Sea. The river initially runs smoothly but becomes more turbulent as it nears Athirapilly. At Athirappilly Falls, the <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> around big rocks and cascades down in three separate plumes. Below the falls, the river remains turbulent for about [...] until it reaches Kannamkuzhi. Then it calms and flows smoothly until reaching the dam at Thumburmuzhi.|$|E

50|$|A tsunami was {{observed}} in Shanghai, China, and a <b>water</b> <b>surge</b> of about 2 to 3 Chi was recorded in Huangpu River.|$|R
25|$|Instability: <b>Water</b> <b>surging</b> inside large side tanks {{can cause}} the {{locomotive}} to become unstable and prone to derailment, {{as was the case}} with the LB L class 4-6-4T before they were modified.|$|R
2500|$|... "Like the {{previous}} game's hotel sequence, the cruise ship segment is impressive {{because of how}} it exploits our perception of both the game's rules and our character's surroundings. As the boat lurches downward, we have to maneuver Drake upwards through hallways and staterooms that tilt sideways, climbing up through doors and over bed frames. Our horizontal axis turns vertical as a wall of <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> towards us and suicidal pirates continue to attack, forcing us to quickly adapt to this new perspective. Eventually we fall into a grand chamber whose skylight is fully submerged. The art deco decor, underwater lighting, and skewed angles recall both Bioshock and The Poseidon Adventure. Sadly there are no cameos from Red Buttons or Shelley Winters. Moments like that are what make Uncharted 3 great." ...|$|E

5000|$|Contaminant remediation: {{to reclaim}} areas {{affected}} by chemical spills, storm <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> (with urban runoff), and other soil contaminations, including silt from sewage sludge and from decayed matter, like wilted plants. Disposal becomes a proportionally large factor in these operations.|$|E
50|$|A Vauclusian {{spring is}} a spring that {{originates}} from a shaft or a cave system, with the <b>water</b> <b>surging</b> upwards under relatively high pressure. It {{is named after}} the Fontaine de Vaucluse in southern France.|$|R
50|$|Lower-lying {{agricultural}} land in northeast Colorado was affected as flood <b>waters</b> <b>surged</b> down rivers and creeks, inundating fields and pastures. Significant crop damage is expected from standing water {{that has no}} way to drain from fields.|$|R
50|$|Cannon Rock is an 1895 oil {{painting}} depicting an offshore wave breaking over a submerged shelf, with <b>water</b> <b>surging</b> into an inlet created by {{rocks in the}} foreground. The work {{is part of the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection.|$|R
50|$|The Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project (Southeast Louisiana Project, or SELA) is a {{flood control}} project by the US Army Corps of Engineers {{to protect the}} New Orleans {{district}} from flooding due to potential storms, hurricanes, or <b>water</b> <b>surges.</b> It was established in 1996.|$|E
50|$|The two reservoirs, Lookout Point and Dexter, {{were created}} in the early 1950s, when the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{finished}} building the dams that contain them. Dexter exists partly as a re-regulating basin that controls <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> from Lookout Point Lake. The pair of dams work together to prevent downstream flooding.|$|E
50|$|The Eko Atlantic {{project has}} been criticised by local {{residents}} living nearby, saying that ongoing construction works have caused coastal erosion and ocean surges; as ocean <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> through living areas, flooding access roads and taking down electricity poles and forcing residents to relocate. The Lagos State Government is also being criticised for failing to involve {{the people in the}} project.|$|E
500|$|The {{rainfall}} {{effect is}} experienced predominantly in estuaries. Hurricanes may dump {{as much as}} [...] of rainfall in 24hours over large areas and higher rainfall densities in localized areas. As a result, watersheds can quickly <b>surge</b> <b>water</b> into the rivers that drain them. This can increase the water level near the head of tidal estuaries as storm-driven <b>waters</b> <b>surging</b> in from the ocean meet rainfall flowing from the estuary.|$|R
50|$|Deputy Prime Minister Campbell, {{in charge}} while the prime {{minister}} is away, declares a state of emergency. He begins to evacuate over one million civilians from Central London before the <b>water</b> <b>surge</b> hits. He is assisted by Police Commissioner Patricia Nash, Major General Ashcroft and others.|$|R
50|$|In March 2006, a {{large portion}} of the glacier {{detached}} and fell into the lake. This resulted in a large wave of <b>water</b> <b>surging</b> into the valley below. The risk of such events are monitored because of the risk of flash flooding towns and even cities below.|$|R
50|$|The tower, {{built in}} 1869 by {{architect}} William W. Boyington from yellowing Lemont limestone, is 182 feet (55 m) tall.Inside was a 138-foot (42 m) high standpipe to hold water. In {{addition to being}} used for firefighting, the pressure in the pipe could be regulated to control <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> in the area. Together with the adjacent Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, it drew clean water from water cribs in Lake Michigan.|$|E
50|$|The two reservoirs, Dexter and Lookout Point, {{were created}} in 1954 when the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{finished}} building the dams that contain them. Dexter exists partly to control <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> from the upstream lake during Lookout Point's production of hydroelectricity. Dexter Lake's water levels vary greatly, while the flow below Dexter Dam remains relatively steady. The Dexter and Lookout Point projects are among 13 that the Corps built in the Willamette Valley.|$|E
5000|$|Coastlines: <b>Water</b> <b>surges</b> over {{not only}} the dune, but also {{man-made}} walls and roads. Large and destructive waves pound weak structures and severely damage well-built homes and businesses. Overwash occurs on high-level seawalls. If major flooding occurs at high tide, impacts may be felt well inland. If cities are at or below sea level, catastrophic flooding can inundate the entire city and cause millions or {{billions of dollars in}} damage (such as occurred in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina).|$|E
5000|$|When a roof of coal caved in, [...] {{of water}} per minute flooded into the mine. The miners were trapped under a {{mountain}} of debris and drowned when the <b>water</b> <b>surged</b> into the mine. The Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO), which owned the mine, said it conformed to international standards.|$|R
50|$|One {{instance}} of flooding {{occurred at a}} sharp bend in the river at Bushicun village. There in August 2016, on the outside bend, as it had before, <b>water</b> <b>surged</b> and flooded onto the land. The ground there, several metres above normal river level, is strewn with rusted boat hulls from previous floods.|$|R

Several rocks protrude from the water further out from the shore. More coastlines {{can be seen in}} the background on the left while a ship floats on the right...|$|R
50|$|The 145 km long Chalakudy River, {{originates}} in the Anamudi mountains of the Western Ghats and {{flows through the}} Vazhachal Forest toward the Arabian Sea. The river initially runs smoothly but becomes more turbulent as it nears Ayyampuzha. At Athirappilly Falls, the <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> around big rocks and cascades down in three separate plumes. Below the falls, the river remains turbulent for about 1 km until it reaches Kannamkuzhi. Then it calms and flows smoothly until reaching the dam at Thumburmuzhi.|$|E
5000|$|The Kali Gad merges {{into the}} main Song river east of the Kalinga hill. After this confluence, the Song is a broad river valley, larger than its western {{counterpart}} - The Assan River [...] The river now flows through the valley in a south-eastern direction passing through the regions of Harrawala and Doiwala. It is a perennial river, however the <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> during the monsoon {{as can be seen}} from the bridge at Doiwala. The river proceeds southward till it merges with the Sooswa river.|$|E

50|$|Great Hindu epic Mahabharata links Bhimkund with Pandavas. Tired {{and weary}} under the hot {{scorching}} sun, Draupadi fainted of thirst. Bhim, the strongest {{of the five}} brothers, hit the ground with his gada (a kind of club with a round head, made of metal) and lo and behold, <b>water</b> <b>surged</b> out and the pool came into being.|$|R
50|$|Among {{several factors}} causing the high {{death toll from}} the tsunami, one was the {{unexpectedly}} large size of the <b>water</b> <b>surge.</b> The tsunami walls at several of the affected cities were based on much smaller tsunami heights. Also, many people caught in the tsunami {{thought that they were}} located on high enough ground to be safe.|$|R
50|$|History {{repeated}} {{itself on}} St George's day in 2005 when a bank breached, near Lock 64, sending thousands {{of gallons of}} <b>water</b> <b>surging</b> down into the River Irk. The breach caused severe damage including a 60-80-foot-wide crater around the canal bed. The burst happened {{on the side of}} the canal facing away from town, so Middleton was saved from widespread flooding.|$|R
50|$|With {{climate change}} hurricanes in {{southern}} Florida {{are projected to}} become more severe causing mangrove populations to be shorter, of smaller diameter, and contain {{a higher proportion of}} red mangrove species. Mangroves could be further threatened by storms if the return time of major storms exceeds reestablishment. In addition, mangroves have been shown to reduce the flow pressure of <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> associated with tsunamis, hurricanes, etc. and by doing so protect coastlines. The loss of mangroves could therefore be detrimental to coastal communities exposed to increased storm surges.|$|E
5000|$|The tsunami was recreated with {{a mixture}} of digital effects and real <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> filmed in slow motion created in a water tank in Spain using miniatures that were {{destroyed}} by a huge wave. Bayona committed to working with real water rather than a computer-generated wave because he wanted the story to be authentic. This meant Watts and Holland spent five weeks filming physically and psychologically demanding scenes in a massive water tank. 16-year-old Holland later described it as a [...] "scary environment ...You can imagine how tiring and brutal that was." ...|$|E
5000|$|The course {{plans were}} {{drawn by the}} McLaughlin Whitewater Design Group, architects of the Ocoee Whitewater Center, which served as the canoe slalom venue for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The Ocoee {{facility}} is the only Olympic whitewater venue built in a riverbed, using natural boulders to direct the water flow, and McLaughlin used a similar design here—with a channel shaped like a natural streambed and lined with natural boulders blasted from the mountaintop. The purpose was both aesthetic and practical. Irregular surfaces dampen the <b>water</b> <b>surges</b> that can occur in geometrically regular artificial channels.|$|E
50|$|The Dutch West Frisian and the German East Frisian Islands are barrier islands. They arose {{along the}} breakers' edge where the <b>water</b> <b>surge</b> piled up {{sediment}}, and behind which sediment was {{carried away by}} the breaking waves. Over time, shoals arose, which ultimately were only covered by infrequent storm floods. Once plants began to colonize the sandbanks, the land began to stabilize.|$|R
5000|$|At 9:35 PM, {{the force}} of the {{accumulated}} water spilling over the median barriers caused 12 of them to collapse, and the backed-up <b>water</b> <b>surged</b> over the roadway, carrying seven vehicles downstream into Jacobs Creek. Total rainfall was estimated to be from 6 in to 8 in and the peak flow of Jacobs Creek at the Kansas Turnpike was estimated to be [...]|$|R
50|$|Surge Radio officially {{opened on}} April 22, 2005 after renovating the studio. They possessed {{control of the}} {{streaming}} servers used by Zed Radio, while the newly formed Radio Galaktika was left dead in the <b>water.</b> <b>Surge</b> Radio originally opened with a Dance/Hip Hop format but later flipped to Underground Punk, Metal and Electronica after the exit of Music Director DJ CM3.|$|R
