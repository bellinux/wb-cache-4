5|$|Structurally, Amir's {{early works}} are quite {{different}} from his later ones. The works compiled in Buah Rindu generally followed the traditional pantun and syair style of quatrains with tail rhymes, including many with rhyming couplets; some works, however, combined the two, or had additional lines or more words than traditionally acceptable, resulting in a different rhythm. Though these early works were not as detailed as Amir's later works, Teeuw writes that they did reflect the poet's mastery of the language and his drive to write poems. Works in this anthology repeated terms of sadness such as menangis (cry), duka (grief), rindu (longing), and air mata (tears), as well as <b>words</b> <b>such</b> as cinta (love), asmara (passion), and merantau (wander).|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used <b>words.</b> <b>Such</b> instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E
5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two <b>words</b> <b>such</b> as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E
5000|$|Paired {{associate}} learning - {{when one}} learns to associate one specific word with another. For example, when given a <b>word</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "safe" [...] one {{must learn to}} say another specific <b>word,</b> <b>such</b> as [...] "green". This is stimulus and response.|$|R

2500|$|The second table {{includes}} only 'false' diphthongs, being they {{composed by}} a semivowel + a vowel, not two vowels. The situation is more nuanced {{in the first}} table: a <b>word</b> <b>such</b> as 'baita' is actually pronounced [...] and most speakers would syllabify it that way. A <b>word</b> <b>such</b> as 'voi' would instead be pronounced and syllabified as , yet again without a diphthong.|$|R
25|$|Given {{their long}} history, {{ligatures}} are sometimes used to invoke archaism or in literal quotations of historic sources; for instance, <b>words</b> <b>such</b> as dæmon or æther are often treated so.|$|E
25|$|Morphology is {{the study}} of word structures, {{especially}} the relationships between related <b>words</b> (<b>such</b> as dog and dogs) and the formation of words based on rules (such as plural formation).|$|E
25|$|Affirmative and {{negative}} responses (especially, though not exclusively, to questions) are often expressed using particles or <b>words</b> <b>such</b> as yes and no, where yes is the affirmative and no the negative particle.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Esperanto lexicon contains 23 consonants, including 4 affricates and one, , {{which has}} become rare; and 11 vowels, 5 simple and 6 diphthongs. A few additional sounds in loan <b>words,</b> <b>such</b> as , are not stable.|$|E
25|$|Many {{long-established}} <b>words,</b> <b>such</b> as disgusted, degrade, and refresh, do {{not require}} a hyphen because they are fully fused {{to the point that}} their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function. Many other <b>words,</b> <b>such</b> as prewashed or repainted, may not be quite so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness), but nonetheless they require no hyphen, because (1) most readers recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus have no trouble parsing the syllables, and (2) if all such words were hyphenated, the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous.|$|E
25|$|Where {{there is}} a {{difference}} between British and US spelling (such as cancelling/canceling and jewellery/jewelry), the British spelling of double-L is universally used. The British use of single-L is also universally used in <b>words</b> <b>such</b> as enrol.|$|E

25|$|Artemis {{also uses}} pseudonyms {{to hide his}} identity. Some names include a play on <b>words,</b> <b>such</b> as Dr. F. Roy Dean Schlippe (Freudian slip), Emmesey Squire (E=mc2), Dr. C. Niall DeMencha (senile dementia), and Sir E. Brum (cerebrum).|$|E
25|$|As part of {{this state}} campaign, uses of <b>words</b> <b>such</b> as 'famine' and 'hunger' were banned because they implied {{government}} failure. Citizens who said deaths were due to the famine could be in serious trouble with the authorities.|$|E
25|$|The {{gender of}} some words' plurals {{does not agree}} with that of their singulars, such as lim and mund. Some <b>words,</b> <b>such</b> as hungr, have {{multiple}} genders, evidenced by their determiners being declined in different genders within a given sentence.|$|E

60|$|It {{is still}} more curious that when I look for more {{definite}} instruction on such points to the higher ranks of botanists, I find in the index to Dr. Lindley's 'Introduction to Botany'--seven hundred pages of close print--not {{one of the four}} words 'Volatile,' 'Essence,' 'Scent,' or 'Perfume.' I examine the index to Gray's 'Structural and Systematic Botany,' with precisely the same success. I next consult Professors Balfour and Grindon, and am met by the same dignified silence. Finally, I think over the possible chances in French, and try in Figuier's indices to the 'Histoire des Plantes' for 'Odeur'--no <b>such</b> <b>word!</b> 'Parfum'--no <b>such</b> <b>word.</b> 'Essence'--no <b>such</b> <b>word.</b> 'Encens'--no <b>such</b> <b>word.</b> I try at last 'Pois de Senteur,' at a venture, and am referred to a page which describes their going to sleep.|$|R
25|$|Some basic vocabulary, {{terminology}} {{dealing with}} agriculture, canoes, the weather, {{the sky and}} the sea, some abstract nouns, some verbs.

25|$|Some {{writers and}} publications, such as The New Yorker, {{use it in}} English <b>words</b> <b>such</b> as zoölogy and coöperate to {{indicate}} that the letter is pronounced separately. It is also commonly employed in names such as Laocoön, Coös County, and the constellation Boötes.|$|E
25|$|Within {{copulative}} clauses, however, {{there are}} restrictions. Copulas are <b>words</b> <b>such</b> as esti 'be', iĝi 'become', resti 'remain', and ŝajni 'seem', for which neither noun phrase takes the accusative case.
