25|$|By {{taking the}} limit of the {{expression}} as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the Riemann integral.

25|$|Instead {{of actions}} on sets, one can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an {{arbitrary}} category: {{start with an}} object X of some category, and then define an action on X as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of X. If X has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above can be carried over. For example, if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> category of vector spaces, we obtain group representations in this fashion.|$|E
25|$|The {{quantization}} of {{the volume}} proceeds {{the same way as}} with the area. As <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> derivative, and each time we do so we bring down the tangent vector , when the volume operator acts on non-intersecting Wilson loops the result vanishes. Quantum states with non-zero volume must therefore involve intersections. Given that the anti-symmetric summation is taken over in the formula for the volume we would need at least intersections with three non-coplanar lines. Actually it turns out that one needs at least four-valent vertices for the volume operator to be non-vanishing.|$|E

25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> one-parameter {{subgroup}} {{generated by}} any loxodromic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every {{transformation in the}} subgroup fixes the same two points. All other points flow along a certain family of curves, away from the first fixed point and toward the second fixed point. Unlike the hyperbolic case, these curves are not circular arcs, but certain curves which under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane appear as spiral curves which twist counterclockwise infinitely often around one fixed point and twist clockwise infinitely often around the other fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.|$|E
25|$|Jacques Lacan: Lacan {{went beyond}} the {{proposition}} that the unconscious is a structure that lies beneath the conscious world; the unconscious itself is structured, like a language. This would suggest parallels with Jung. Further Lacan's Symbolic and Imaginary orders may be aligned with Jung's archetypal theory and personal unconscious respectively. The Symbolic order patterns the contents of the Imaginary {{in the same way that}} archetypal structures predispose humans towards certain sorts of experience. If <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> example of parents, archetypal structures and the Symbolic order predispose our recognition of, and relation to them. Lacan's concept of the Real approaches Jung's elaboration of the psychoid unconscious, which may be seen as true but cannot be directly known. Lacan posited that the unconscious is organised in an intricate network governed by association, above all 'metaphoric associations'. The existence of the network is shown by analysis of the unconscious products: dreams, symptoms, and so on.|$|E

Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters—grappling, punching or flying away—and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So then we had a set of high-res stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment." ...|$|E
