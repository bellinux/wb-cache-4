5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{to stay in the}} barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E

25|$|Strauss {{feared that}} {{continued}} {{involvement in the}} war was a mistake that was endangering Johnson's presidency, but he felt too intimidated by the imposing Johnson to share his true feelings. Strauss immediately regretted withholding his true opinion from Johnson. He resolved that if any president ever sought his advice again, Strauss <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> the truth regardless of {{what he wanted to}} hear.|$|E

25|$|When Fancourt retired {{at the end}} of the 1952–53 season, Adams {{became the}} company's {{principal}} bass-baritone, regularly playing Dick Deadeye in H.M.S. Pinafore, the Pirate King, Colonel Calverley, the Earl of Mountararat, the Mikado of Japan, Sir Roderic in Ruddigore, Sergeant Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard, and Arac in Princess Ida (when that opera was revived in 1954). From 1961 to 1963, he also played Sergeant Bouncer in Cox and Box. Although he had admired Fancourt, when he took over the roles, Adams asked Bridget D'Oyly Carte if he could create his own characterisations, which she agreed to, saying she <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> if he overstepped the mark. Adams continued as the principal bass-baritone of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company until 1969. In 1952 he married D'Oyly Carte soprano Muriel Harding (1920–90).|$|E
25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E
500|$|Chico {{was often}} late for rehearsals, so Perrin {{would have to}} stand in {{for him on the}} read-throughs. When Chico {{eventually}} made his appearance, Perrin remembers, [...] "he'd be reading Ravelli's lines and Groucho <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> to stop [...] 'show him how the line should be read'. My Italian accent was better than Chico's, you see. But Chico didn't care." ...|$|E

If {{he were to}} die to-morrow as the penalty of doing something useful to-night, he wouldn't think twice about it. If {{you wanted to make}} him stay where he is, {{the way to do it}} <b>would</b> be to <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that his health was failing him. I don't know that he does want to give up now." ...|$|R

500|$|Povenmire {{later became}} a {{director}} on Family Guy, starting with the season two episode, [...] "Road to Rhode Island".

500|$|Initial {{reception}} of Ikaruga in Japan was mixed. Players did praise the graphics and music, but opinions were {{divided on the}} gameplay system. Director Hiroshi Iuchi noted that players <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> “this isn’t an arcade game...make it more thrilling and fast-paced.” Both Iuchi and producer Masoto Maegawa stated that this mixed reception was due to players expecting a more standard shooter offering. They both felt Ikaruga was a brand new type of shooter and that bringing variety was important {{to the growth of}} game centers. The original Dreamcast port of Ikaruga was well received by Greg Kasavin of GameSpot. He praised the game for its graphics, sound, and challenging difficulty. He also praised the game for bringing back a dead genre to the forefront, saying [...] "Ikaruga takes 20 years of great ideas in game design and somehow manages to put an entirely new spin on them...for the sake of making a game that's both familiar and utterly unique." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Road to Rhode Island" [...] was {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire and was written by Gary Janetti. It featured guest appearances from Victoria Principal as Dr. Amanda Rebecca, Danny Smith and Wally Wingert as various characters. This was the first episode directed by Povenmire. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom for directing episodes. Povenmire said that MacFarlane <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "We've got two minutes to fill. Give me some visual gags. Do whatever you want. I trust you." [...] Povenmire praised MacFarlane's management style for letting him have fun. Several years after the episode was written, in DVD commentary for the eighth and ninth season of the show, Gary Janetti, the writer of the episode, recalled that the original title of the episode {{was intended to be}} simply [...] "Brian & Stewie", but was changed by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, who wanted there to be a [...] "Road to" [...] episode each season. The name of the episode was then changed to [...] "Road to Rhode Island", with the original name later being used for the landmark 150th episode of the show, also entitled [...] "Brian & Stewie", and written by Janetti.|$|E

500|$|Ali Abu Nuwar {{was born}} in 1925 in al-Salt, Transjordan, which was then under British control. His father's family, the Abu Nuwar, was a {{prominent}} Arab clan in al-Salt. His mother was of Circassian descent. In his youth, Abu Nuwar {{was influenced by the}} discussions that his father and relatives held about the effects of the 1916 Arab Revolt, the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the 1920 Syrian Arab defeat at the Battle of Maysalun had on the fate of the Middle East. During the closing years of World War I, the Ottomans had been driven out of their Arab territories by an alliance of Hashemite-led Arab rebels and British forces, and were thereafter replaced by the British and French, who effectively occupied the Arab territories. Revolts and popular opposition against European rule in Palestine, Transjordan and elsewhere in the region emerged in the 1920s and 1930s. In his memoirs, Abu Nuwar recalled that his teachers in al-Salt <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> and his classmates that the [...] "Arab Nation was colonized and fragmented and that it was on the shoulders of our generation to take responsibility for freedom and unity".|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{parents were}} poor tenant farmers {{who worked in}} the tobacco fields as sharecroppers. The family used an outhouse, drew water from a cistern, and did laundry in a {{cast-iron}} tub over an open flame. Their house did not have running water until Robinson was ten years old. When Robinson was born, he was so seriously ill that the doctor was certain he would not survive. He was temporarily paralyzed from birth and his head was misshapen. So likely was Robinson's death that the physician asked Robinson's father Charles for a name for the baby's birth and death certificates. Robinson's parents were young (his mother Imogene was twenty) and they were hoping for a girl. They named the baby [...] "Vicky Gene Robinson" [...] for Charles' father Victor and the baby's mother Imogene. For a long time, Robinson's parents believed the boy would die soon. Much later in life, Robinson's father <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> he couldn't take any joy in the boy's development because he always thought each step {{was going to be the}} last thing. Robinson's parents were and still are members of a small Disciples of Christ congregation. Robinson describes his childhood as very religious. Robinson had perfect Sunday School attendance for thirteen years.|$|E
2500|$|Hawkins {{said his}} {{feelings}} about Keeble echo those of all who knew him. [...] "If he was alive today, I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> there's no one I respect more, and how he is everything a man should be: brave, kind and generous.

6000|$|I <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of Cato and Brutus, {{feeling that}} I could not stir him to {{grandeur}} of heart by Roman instances. He {{would have told}} me that in those days, as far as the Romans knew, ...|$|R

6000|$|This, in fine, however, she <b>would</b> never <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "You shall hear only if your smash takes place. As that's {{really out}} of the question, I won't expose myself"--a point at which, for reasons of his own, Strether ceased to press.|$|R

2500|$|He {{spent much}} of his later days {{coaching}} at the S.C.G. for the New South Wales Cricket Association, and watching closely the progress of any new player whom he had taken under his wing. He also paid close attention to his overall dress and appearance. If he took exception to this, the youngster would know it. [...] "Son," [...] he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "if you are not a cricketer, you can at least look like one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many Nisei {{worked to}} prove {{themselves}} as loyal American citizens. Of the 20,000 Japanese Americans {{who served in the}} Army during World War II, [...] "many Japanese-American soldiers had gone to war to fight racism at home" [...] and they were [...] "proving with their blood, their limbs, and their bodies that they were truly American". It was not only men either, some one hundred Nisei women volunteered for the WAC (Woman's Army Corps), where, after undergoing rigorous basic training, they had assignments as typists, clerks, and drivers. Satoshi Ito, an internment camp survivor, reinforces the idea of the immigrants’ children striving to demonstrate their patriotism to the United States. He notes that his mother <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "‘you’re here in the United States, you need to do well in school, you need to prepare yourself to get a good job when you get out into the larger society’". He said she <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "‘don’t be a dumb farmer like me, like us’" [...] to encourage Ito to successfully assimilate into American society. As a result, he worked exceptionally hard to excel in school and later became a professor at the College of William & Mary. His story, along with the countless Japanese Americans willing to risk their lives in war, demonstrate the lengths many in their community went to prove their American patriotism.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{had fallen}} in love with Jane Bridges, a girl, aged 17 who was able to tell the story 60 years {{afterwards}} to his biographers. Gordon did not declare his love until he came to say good-bye to her before leaving for Australia on 7 August 1853. [...] "With characteristic recklessness he offered to sacrifice the passage he had taken to Australia, and all his father's plans for giving him a fresh start in life, if she <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> not to go, or promise to be his wife, or even give him some hope." [...] This she could not do, though she liked the shy handsome boy and remembered him with affection to the end of a long life. It was the one romance of Gordon's life.|$|E
2500|$|In the bribery scheme, a [...] "fixer" [...] {{told people}} divorcing in Brooklyn {{that for a}} price he could steer their case to a {{sympathetic}} judge. After the fixer received a payment, he would refer the person to a lawyer contact of his, who had given Garson drinks, meals, cigars, and cash—accepting (and receiving) preferential treatment in return. The fixer and the lawyer would then bribe court employees to override the court's computer system, which was programmed to ensure that cases were assigned to judges randomly. Instead, they would have the case assigned to Garson. Garson, in turn, would then privately coach the lawyer. He <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> questions the lawyer should ask of witnesses in the case before Garson, and arguments that the lawyer should make to Garson in court. Garson would then rule {{in favor of the}} lawyer.|$|E
