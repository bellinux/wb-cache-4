It explains why computational capacity will continue to increase unabated even after Moore's Law expires, which Kurzweil predicts will happen around 2020. Integrated circuits, the current method of creating computer chips, will fade from the limelight, while some new more advanced technology <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> slack. It is this new technology that will get us to the massive levels of computation needed to create an artificial brain.|$|E
25|$|Currently some Connecticut Sun {{games are}} {{broadcast}} on WCTX (MyTV 9), a local television station {{for the state}} of Connecticut. This is the second time WCTX has aired Sun matches. They were also the original home of Sun matches prior to the 2010 season. More often than not, NBA TV <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> feed from the local broadcast, which are shown nationally. Broadcasters for the Sun games on WCTX consist of Bob Heussler and Rebecca Lobo, Jennifer Rizzotti or Kara Wolters. From 2012–2014 Sun games were broadcast on CPTV Sports (CPTV-S). For the 2011 season, Sun games were broadcast on Comcast Sports Net New England, with Mike Gorman as an announcer. In addition to Mike Gorman, broadcasters in the past have included Leah Secondo and Kara Wolters.|$|E

500|$|The stages, {{based on}} various {{locations}} from the DC Universe, {{such as the}} Batcave, Metropolis, and Fortress of Solitude, feature interactive environments and multiple areas. If an opponent is hit with a heavy attack near {{a corner of the}} arena, it launches them, triggering a transition animation and taking the fight to a new section of the stage. Each section also contains objects that characters can interact with differently depending on their class. Characters fall into two classes: [...] "power characters", who rely on brute strength and innate abilities, and [...] "gadget characters", who use weapons, items, and other external mechanisms to win. For example, a gadget character like Batman can attach a bomb to a car to cause an explosion, while a power character like Superman <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> same car and smash his opponents with it. Players have the option to turn off interactive elements and stage transitions.|$|E

2500|$|In Cambodia, a {{fork and}} spoon are the typical {{utensils}} used in Cambodian dining and etiquette. Spoons are used to scoop up food or water and the fork is there to help guide the food onto the spoon. Chopsticks are normally used in noodle dishes such as the Kuy Tiev and soup dishes. When eating soup the chopsticks will typically be paired with the spoon, where the chopsticks <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> food and the spoon {{will be used to}} drink the broth.

2500|$|After Bill McCay {{had written}} a series of five novels {{continuing}} the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite {{the success of the}} Stargate television series, Dean Devlin stated in 2006 that [...] "he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> story from the 1994 original" [...] According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the SG-1 and Atlantis series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise. The first movie already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would tie all the mythologies together. Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis producer Brad Wright said in 2002 that [...] "Devlin can wish to do a sequel to Stargate all he wants. MGM owns the rights, and I doubt very much that they'll ask him to do it. He knows better." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{the death}} of an Antandroy, family members {{organize}} a communal funeral feast. [...] Zebu are sacrificed and their meat given to the community. [...] After laying in state for several days, the deceased's body is placed in a coffin, and more zebu are slaughtered. The mood at this ceremony can be celebratory, and among some Antandroy, community members <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> coffin and run into the sea with it. Afterward the coffin is placed in a tomb for the male head of household and his immediate family members. [...] Like the neighboring Mahafaly, the tombs of the Antandroy are called fanesy ("your eternal place"). These are large and rectangular - the larger the tomb, the more wealthy the man - and are decorated with colorful paintings. Tall stones are traditionally placed on each side to represent male and female; in recent years, towers are often constructed in lieu of the stones. The skulls of the zebu slaughtered for the funeral feast are placed on top of the tomb to indicate the deceased's wealth.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} game mechanic is {{the construction}} of a road network so as to allow for an efficient transportation system, as any settlers transporting goods must use roads. To build a road, the player must place a flag, select the [...] "build road" [...] option, and then place another flag. The computer will then automatically find the shortest route between the two and build the road, although the player is also free to build the road manually. To maximize distribution, the player must set as many flags as possible on each road. Flags can only be set a certain distance apart, and serve as transport hubs; a settler will carry an item to a flag and set it down, at which point the next settler along <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> item and continue, freeing the first settler to return and pick up another item at the previous flag. The more flags the player has, the more settlers will operate on a given road, cutting down the distance each settler must travel, and reducing the time to transport one item and return for the next, thus avoiding item congestion at each flag. When more than one item is placed at a flag, the game has an adjustable goods priority system, which determines the order in which items are transported. Players can also build shipyards, which allow for the manufacture of boats (can transport goods over small stretches of water), and ships (can transport goods across oceans).|$|E
