500|$|I {{wanted the}} video {{to have the}} same rawness that both the melody and the lyrics of the song have because [...] "Dance for You" [...] is one of my most {{intimate}} songs. I wanted the video to have a classic feel; to be seductive but still keep the sense of mystery. When I write, when I perform, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> music videos, I don’t hold anything back. 'Dance for You' is about that same passion; to be free and unrestrained.|$|E
500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] is {{different}} from Knowles' previous dance-pop songs as it makes use of a retro style. It is an upbeat track that draws from the genre of R. The song also contains elements of up-tempo disco and funk music. It consists of energetic tribal beats, a drum loop, funky guitars and a bassline {{that was designed to}} make it a groovy and dance song. According to the lyrics of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me", Knowles impersonates a woman who questions her love interest about the reason for which he does not value her fabulousness, convincing him she's the best thing for him as she sings: [...] "Why don't you love me... <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> me so damn easy to love?... I got beauty... I got class... I got style and I got ass...". The singer further tells her love interest that the decision not to choose her is [...] "entirely foolish".|$|E

500|$|M.I.A. cites guerrilla art {{and fashion}} as major influences. Her mother {{works as a}} {{seamstress}} in London. An early interest in fashion and textiles – designing confections of [...] "bright fluorescent fishnet fabrics" [...] — was a hallmark of her time at Central Saint Martins College. M.I.A. was a roommate of fashion designer Luella Bartley and is a long-time friend of designer Carri Mundane. Clothes from her limited-edition [...] "Okley Run" [...] line — Mexican and Afrika line jackets and leggings, Islamic-inspired and water melon-print hoodies, and tour-inspired designs – were sold in 2008 during New York fashion week. She commented, [...] "I wanted to tie all my work together. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> an album, I make a number of artworks that go with it, and now I make some clothes that go with it too. So this Okley run was an extension of my Kala album and artwork." [...] Spin described her designs as [...] "1000 watt Malcolm McLaren-meets-Basquiat", that complimented her personal style that could [...] "run from futurist aerobic instructor to new wave pirate to queenly candy raver".|$|E
2500|$|A nervous Bhansali, who had met {{the media}} after a long time, said he was very afraid of {{handling}} a mic after so long. He thanked UTV Chairman Ronnie Screwvala for his unrelenting support. Bhansali made headlines {{for the day when}} he said that Aishwarya Rai was [...] ".. his muse, his jaan, and I get terribly excited <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> a film with her because she is very, very special. Some people are timeless and Aishwarya will be there for another 20 years". About the lead actor he said, [...] "I have never enjoyed working with any other actor as much as I have enjoyed working with Hrithik, just for the kind of talent he has, for the kind of person he is". He also revealed the reason why he became the musical director of the movie, [...] "The reason behind doing the music of the film is that I think I understand the characters and understand what they would express musically more than any other music director. Some deep thoughts are my concern, so whatever little music I knew, it was a sort of experiment. But I am happy with what I have done,".|$|E
