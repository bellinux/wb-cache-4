500|$|The mixed fanbase {{reaction}} did {{not surprise}} Lucas, who {{was familiar with}} mixed response to the Star Wars prequels, and predicted that [...] "we're all going to get people throwing tomatoes at us." [...] David Koepp said: [...] "I knew I {{was going to get}} hammered from a number of quarters [...] <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> about the way the movie ended up playing was it was popular with families. I like that families really embraced it." [...] Although Spielberg said [...] "I'm very happy with the movie. I always have been", he also said [...] "I sympathise with people who didn't like the MacGuffin [...] because I never liked the MacGuffin." ...|$|E
500|$|Ray, {{initially}} {{planning for}} the song to be a [...] "more laid-back number", later played the chords of the song to brother Dave Davies, the Kinks' lead guitarist. However, upon hearing the track, Dave decided that the riff {{would be much more}} powerful on a guitar. Ray said of the track's change to a guitar-centred track, [...] "I wanted it to be a jazz-type tune, because that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> at the time. It's written originally around a sax line... Dave ended up playing the sax line in fuzz guitar and it took the song a step further." [...] The band then began to perform the new track in some of their live shows, where it was well received.|$|E
500|$|In February 1940 Welles {{supplied}} Mankiewicz with 300 {{pages of}} notes {{and put him}} under contract to write the first draft screenplay {{under the supervision of}} John Houseman, Welles's former partner in the Mercury Theatre. Welles later explained, [...] "I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine." [...] Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, [...] "At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> of my own." ...|$|E

500|$|For the film's director, King {{wanted someone}} [...] "who would steer {{us away from}} the {{traditional}} BBC-type costume drama," [...] and [...] "make a period film for an MTV audience". By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film C.R.A.Z.Y. by French-Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée, and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered the job to Vallée on their very first meeting. Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallée agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, [...] "When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time." [...] Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because [...] "she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to yell and yell loudly to your parents and all the people, to authority... 'I'm {{going to do it}} my way.' That's what rock 'n' roll is all about. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> about her, this energy. [...] was special and had this mystical quality." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, The Hollywood Reporter {{revealed}} that Jon Bernthal and Andrew Lincoln were chosen by producers {{for the main}} cast of the series. Bernthal was to portray Shane Walsh, while Lincoln provided the role of Rick Grimes, the central character of The Walking Dead. While Hurd didn't expect to cast Lincoln, Kirkman was ecstatic with his acting, evaluating him as an [...] "amazing find". In his interview with Dread Central, Kirkman added that [...] "writing Rick Grimes month after month in the comic series, I {{had no idea he}} was an actual living, breathing human being, and yet, here he is. I couldn't be more thrilled with how this show is coming together." [...] Although he was initially shocked upon hearing of The Walking Dead, Lincoln thought the episode's script was well written. [...] "I read it and thought it was well written, and I put myself on tape just for one scene. I didn't know who was involved at this point." [...] The succeeding day, his agent called him about the development of the pilot. Lincoln described the moment as [...] "kind of like a dream list". He later communicated with Darabont via Skype; [...] "We spoke for about 40 minutes about his ideas for the project, about <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> about Episode One and then he asked would I fly over to come and test." [...] Lincoln flew to Darabont's home, where he viewed [...] "Days Gone Bye" [...] in his garage. He opined that was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "very intimate".|$|E
2500|$|When {{the details}} of the crime were made public, rumors began to {{circulate}} that Ishida's penis was of extraordinary size; however, the police officer who interrogated Abe after her arrest denied this, saying, [...] "Ishida's was just average. [...] told me, 'Size doesn't make a man in bed. Technique and his desire to please me were <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> about Ishida.'" [...] After her arrest, Ishida's penis and testicles were moved to Tokyo University Medical School's pathology museum. They were put on public display soon after the end of World War II, but have since disappeared.|$|E

2500|$|Lansman {{was brought}} up in an Orthodox Jewish family in Southgate, north London. He was a pupil at the {{independent}} Highgate School from 1970 to 1975. [...] He first visited Israel when he was 16: [...] "I worked on a kibbutz in the Negev and my aunt lived in Beersheba. [...] It was actually a very politicising experience. When I did my bar mitzvah I saw myself as a Zionist and I think after I went there I felt it less. [...] I was more interested in the kibbutz and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> about it was the pioneering spirit, the sense of community and radicalism of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following an April 2008 set visit, Meyer {{opined that}} Pattinson and Stewart had {{developed}} chemistry so good it [...] "may cause hyperventilation". Pattinson revealed that Meyer {{had given him}} an early copy of Midnight Sun—a re-telling {{of the events of}} Twilight, narrated from Edward's point of view. He explained that: [...] "That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> about [...] the job, because the guy doesn’t really exist that much, so you can just create whatever you want. Then, when I found out there was another book from Edward’s perspective, [...] we had the same perspective!" [...] In preparation for the role, Pattinson wrote journal entries as Edward and distanced from his friends and family, explaining that he [...] "wanted to feel his isolation". Physically, he revealed that; [...] "I was supposed to get a six-pack. But it didn't really work out." [...] One scene in the story sees Edward, a gifted pianist, compose a lullaby for Bella. Pattinson was given the opportunity to submit a composition for consideration for this scene, with Hardwicke stating; [...] "I told him he should write one, and let’s see if we can make it work, because that would be really cool if it was Rob’s song. He’s a beautiful musician, a very creative soul, very similar to Edward. He just totally reads the most interesting stuff, and sees the most interesting movies, and is very introspective and diving into his existential self." [...] Meyer approved; [...] "If Robert could write a lullaby, that would definitely add to some of the mystique of the movie, wouldn’t it?" [...] While two of Pattinson's compositions do feature in the final film, the lullaby piece finally selected was composed by Carter Burwell.|$|E

60|$|See--of all Obadiah's {{wealth and}} glory, the Bible {{does not say}} one word. It is {{actually}} not worth mentioning. People admired Obadiah, I doubt not, while he was alive; envied him too, tried to thrust {{him out of his}} place, slander him to King Ahab, drive him out of favour, and step into his place, that they might enjoy his wealth and his power instead of him. The fine outside of Obadiah was what they saw, and coveted, and envied--as we are tempted now to say in our hearts, 'Ah, if I was rich like that man. Ah, if I could buy <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked,</b> go where I liked, do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked,</b> like that great Lord!'-- and yet, that is but the outside, the shell, the gay clothing, not the persons themselves.
