As he walks through town, the passing townsfolk are shocked and {{somewhat}} disturbed by Griffens appearance, as he is <b>wrapped</b> <b>head</b> to toe in bandages and wears pitch-black goggles over his eyes. He eventually reaches the local motel and requests a room, his appearance scaring the inn keeper June Jaques.|$|R
50|$|For {{manual and}} semiautomated wire-wrapping, the {{direction}} of placing a wire can be optimized for right-handed operators, so that wires are placed from right to left. Fully-automated wire-wrap machines don't care. But in a semi-automated wire-wrap system, this moves the <b>wrap</b> <b>head</b> away from the user's hand when placing a wire. This increases safety. It also helps a user to use their strong hand and eye to route the wire.|$|R
40|$|Turban {{of printed}} fabric. The turban {{is made from}} fabric printed with lemon yellow, pink, black, and white {{geometric}} forms and arcs. The turban is lined in yellow mesh, and has an inner hatband of black grosgrain ribbon. Attached to the inner band are two small plastic combs to secure the hat to wearer's head.

50|$|In the 1970s, acid perms were invented. These ammonia-free acid perms, {{sometimes}} called buffered waves, use glyceryl monothioglycolate {{in the place}} of ammonia. Acid perms, or buffered wavers, are slower but gentler to the hair. Heat is usually added by placing the client under a dryer, after covering the <b>wrapped</b> <b>head</b> with a plastic cap. The reaction is endothermic and the additional heat causes the pH to rise from 6.9 to 7.2.|$|R

50|$|A final, {{very helpful}} {{optimization}} is that within each length {{and color of}} wire, the computer selects the next wire so that the <b>wrap</b> <b>head</b> moves to the nearest pin that is {{to the right of}} the previous pin. This can save up to 40% of the assembly time, almost getting two wire-wrap machines for the price of one. It also reduces wear on the wire-wrap machines. Assembly technicians paid by piecework love it, because they can place more wires per hour. Again, by usually moving from right to left, it moves away from a right-handed operator's hand, increasing safety.|$|R
50|$|In Shi'a Islam, a black <b>head</b> <b>wrap</b> {{around a}} small white cap is worn by {{descendants}} of Muhammad called Sayyids, and white turbans by other well-educated persons and scholars.
