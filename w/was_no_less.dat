5|$|BioWare's Baldur's Gate series <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> important, {{the most}} {{significant}} D series to be released since the Gold Box era. The games created the most accurate and in-depth D simulation yet, and featured support for up to six-players in cooperative mode. Baldur's Gate (1998) provided an epic story with NPC followers and written dialogue that continued through both titles and two expansion packs. Black Isle produced a more combat-oriented series, Icewind Dale, soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The film <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> {{successful}} {{than its predecessor}} in a commercial perspective. It became 1999's highest-grossing animated film, earning $245.9 million domestically and $497.4 million worldwide—beating both Pixar's previous releases by a significant margin. It became the second highest-grossing animated film of all-time, behind Disney's The Lion King (1994). Toy Story 2 opened over the Thanksgiving Day weekend at No. 1 to a three-day tally of $57,388,839 from 3,236 theaters, averaging $17,734 per theater over three days, making $80,102,784 since its Wednesday launch and staying at No. 1 {{for the next two}} weekends. By New Year's Day, it had made more than $200 million in the U.S. alone, and it eventually became 1999's third highest-grossing film and far surpassing the original. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 47.8 million tickets in North America.|$|E

25|$|This move, and the {{addition}} of then-White House correspondent Dan Rather to the reporting team, made the program into a strong ratings hit and, eventually, a general cultural phenomenon. This <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> than a stunning reversal of the historically poor ratings performances of documentary programs on network television. By 1976, 60 Minutes became the top-rated program on Sunday nights in the U.S. By 1979, it had achieved the #1 spot among all television programs in the Nielsen ratings, unheard of before for a news broadcast in prime time. This success translated into great profits for CBS; advertising rates went from $17,000 per 30-second spot in 1975 to $175,000 in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Further {{evidence}} of La Fontaine’s enduring popularity is his appearance on a playing card {{from the second}} year of the French Revolution. In this pack royalty is displaced by the rationalist free-thinkers known as Philosophes, and the ironical fabulist figures as the King of Spades. He <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> popular at the Bourbon Restoration, as is evidenced by the royal commission of his statue. Besides that, there was the 1816 bronze commemorative medal depicting the poet’s head, designed by Jacques-Édouard Gatteaux , in the Great Men of France series. More recently there has been a sideways seated view of him in the Histoire de France series.|$|E

Erik asked Åke why he, who was his man, had made such a difference between him and the Norwegian king. Åke answered that there was nothing to blame Erik for but that he had got the old things and the old hall because he was old whereas the Norwegian king was in the bloom of his youth. Åke also answered that he <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> the Swedish king's man than the Swedish king was his man. Hearing the words of treason, Erik had no other choice but to slay the impudent and treacherous Åke.|$|E

25|$|He updated {{the action}} to the 19th and 20th centuries, using {{imagery of the}} {{industrial}} age, and he achieved an unprecedented degree of naturalism in the singers' performances. Boulez's conducting <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> controversial, emphasising continuity, flexibility and transparency over mythic grandeur and weight. In its first year the production was greeted with noisy hostility by the conservative audience, and a core of around thirty orchestral musicians refused to work with Boulez in subsequent seasons. Both production and musical realisation grew in stature over the following four years {{and by the end}} of the final cycle in 1980 they received a 45-minute ovation. Boulez worked with Chéreau again on Berg's Lulu in Paris (1979) and Janáček's From the House of the Dead in Vienna (2007).|$|E
25|$|But if he {{was eager}} in his own defence he <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> so in that of others. In 1721 a drunken nobleman reeled on to {{the stage of the}} theatre and {{assaulted}} the manager, Rich, whose life was saved by Quin's prompt armed interference. This resulted in a riot, and thereafter a guard was stationed in all theatres. In 1732 Quin appeared at Covent Garden, returning to Drury Lane from 1734 to 1741, and in 1742 was again at Covent Garden, where he remained until the close of his career. On 14 November 1746 Quin played Horatio and Garrick Lothario to the Calista of Mrs Cibber in Rose's Fair Penitent. The applause of the audience was so great as to disconcert if not actually to alarm the two actors.|$|E
25|$|Willaert <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> {{distinguished}} as {{a teacher}} than as a composer. Among his disciples were Cipriano de Rore, his successor at St. Mark's; Costanzo Porta; the Ferrarese Francesco Viola; Gioseffo Zarlino; and Andrea Gabrieli. Another composer stylistically descended from Willaert was Lassus. These composers, except for Lassus, formed the core of {{what came to be}} known as the Venetian school, which was decisively influential on the stylistic change that marked the beginning of the Baroque era. Among Willaert's pupils in Venice, one of the most prominent was his fellow northerner Cipriano de Rore. The Venetian School flourished for the rest of the 16th century, and into the 17th, led by the Gabrielis and others. Willaert also probably influenced a young Palestrina. Willaert left a large number of compositions — 8 (or possibly 10) masses, over 50 hymns and psalms, over 150 motets, about 60 French chansons, over 70 Italian madrigals and 17 instrumental (ricercares).|$|E

25|$|Hungary elected Leopold as its king in 1655, with Bohemia and Croatia {{following}} suit in 1656 and 1657 respectively. In July 1658, {{more than}} a year after his father's death, Leopold was elected Emperor at Frankfurt in spite of the French minister, Cardinal Mazarin, who sought to put the Imperial Crown on the head of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria, or some other non-Habsburg prince. To conciliate France, which had considerable influence in German affairs thanks to the League of the Rhine, the newly elected Emperor promised not to assist Spain, then at war with France. This marked the beginning of a nearly 47-year career filled with rivalry with France and its king, Louis XIV. The latter's dominant personality and power completely overshadowed Leopold, even to this day, but though Leopold did not lead his troops in person as Louis XIV did, he <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> a warrior-king given the greater part of his public life was directed towards the arrangement and prosecution of wars.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Hanks' {{next project}} <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> expensive. For Saving Private Ryan, he {{teamed up with}} Steven Spielberg {{to make a film}} about a search through war-torn France after D-Day to bring back a soldier. It earned the praise and respect of the film community, critics, and the general public. It was labeled one of the finest war films ever made and earned Spielberg his second Academy Award for direction, and Hanks another Best Actor nomination. Later that year, Hanks re-teamed with his Sleepless in Seattle co-star Meg Ryan for You've Got Mail, a remake of 1940's The Shop Around the Corner. In 1999, Hanks starred in an {{adaptation}} of the Stephen King novel The Green Mile. He also returned as the voice of Woody in Toy Story 2, the sequel to Toy Story. The following year, he won a Golden Globe for Best Actor and an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of a marooned FedEx systems analyst in Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the last}} representatives of {{absolute}} monarchy in Europe, he lived during a turbulent period; his reign never saw a lasting peace. Throughout his period of rule, major powers, such as Spain, France and Great Britain, continually intervened in Portuguese affairs. Forced to flee to South America across the Atlantic Ocean into Brazil when troops of the Emperor Napoleon I invaded Portugal, he found himself faced there with liberal revolts; he was compelled to return to Europe amid new conflicts. His marriage <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> conflictual, as his wife, Carlota Joaquina of Spain, repeatedly conspired against her husband in favor of personal interests or those of her native Spain. He lost Brazil when his son Pedro declared independence, and his other son Miguel (later Miguel I of Portugal) led a rebellion that sought to depose him. According to recent scholarly research, his death {{may well have been}} caused by arsenic poisoning.|$|E
