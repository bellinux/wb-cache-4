2500|$|The world's fastest {{sprinter}} and runner Usain Bolt, {{who is from}} Jamaica (in the West Indies), once replied {{while being}} asked about who were his heroes {{when he was a}} child: [...] "When I was really small I loved the Pakistan cricket team. Waqar Younis {{was one of the greatest}} bowlers ever, and I was a bowler so I really enjoyed watching him. I was a big Pakistan fan until I got older, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that I should actually support my home team." [...] When asked what if there was a match between Pakistan and Windies, Bolt remarked [...] "I would still have supported Pakistan, that’s what I’m saying – when I was little, it was all about Pakistan." ...|$|E

The company did not travel {{with a band}} but instead used orchestra players hired locally. [...] He recalled, [...] "We would pick up perhaps eight orchestral players in the first town, take them {{with us on the}} tour and make up the orchestra with local players from each of the towns we visited.... On one occasion, I was rehearsing the Mikado overture <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that one of the double-basses was plucking the strings in the opening bars.

60|$|A {{very bright}} and nimble little matron, {{with a bunch}} of keys in her hand, responded to my request to see the House.

60|$|The {{mouth of}} the slough became our {{favorite}} playground. Here we spent many hours each day, catching fish and playing on the logs, and here, one day, we learned our first lessons in navigation. The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.

Auschwitz is not suitable for becoming a routine-of-threat, an always available intimidation or a moral club Moralkeule or also just an obligation.

40|$|As a {{leisure time}} pedagogue I {{find it hard}} to have an insight into what {{children}} are playing, and how they play when it comes to free play. My experience is that in some free play, conflicts arise, which reveal hierarchies and power structures containing violations, whereas other occasions of free play suddenly come to an end as the pedagogue interferes. In this essay I investigate my responsibility as a leisure time pedagogue during children´s free play, based on two differing play situations. I also investigate the play as a phenomenon by looking into previous research on children’s play and development psychology. By reflecting on the two play situations I can further understand how to act in a more supportive way during the children´s free play, and how I should relate to the free play I have in my essay found that the free play does not handle itself and that the leisure time pedagogue´s responsibility in the free play is to be present and observe when children are playing. In that way I can get an insight into the world of the children and I can give my support when the game becomes problematic or I can back away <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> that <b>I</b> have disturb a free play that works well...|$|R
