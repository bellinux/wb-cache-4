5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt in deeper <b>water</b> <b>for</b> larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower <b>water</b> <b>for</b> smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E

40|$|Effects of Watering Temperature on Seedling Growth of Chili (Capsicum annum L.) ABSTRACT. Researches of {{temperature}} effect on plant {{have yet to}} provide obvious results of how leaf temperature and media temperature differs plant growth. The research of objectives are to study effects of water temperature irrigated to media and water temperature sprayed to the leaves on Chili seedling growth. Completely randomized block design {{was used in the}} research. The factor studied were <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> <b>watering</b> media and <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> spraying seedling leaves. The result showed that <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> spraying seedling leaves significantly affected all variables observed, including seedling height, seedling diameter, leaf size, wet weight of seedling, wet weight of the roots, dried weigh of seedling, and dried weigh of the roots. <b>Water</b> temperature <b>for</b> <b>watering</b> media did not significantly affect all variables observed. There were significant interactions between <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> <b>watering</b> media and <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> spraying seedling leaves on seedling diameter and leaf size. Water temperature of 120 C <b>for</b> <b>watering</b> media in combination with normal <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> spraying seedling leaves was the best treatment combination, while water temperature of 120 C <b>for</b> <b>watering</b> media in combination with 120 C <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> spraying seedling leaves was the worst treatment...|$|R
5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of <b>water</b> <b>for</b> use by humans, {{and the introduction of}} exotic species.

Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, <b>water</b> <b>for</b> about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking.

5|$|During the Californication world tour, Frusciante {{continued}} to compose his own songs, {{many of which}} would be released in 2001 on his third solo album To Record Only <b>Water</b> <b>for</b> Ten Days. The album was stylistically unlike his previous records, less markedly stream-of-consciousness or avant-garde. However, the lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably stripped down. The songwriting and production of To Record Only <b>Water</b> <b>for</b> Ten Days were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings. The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Chili Peppers on Californication, focusing more on electronic and new wave elements. In addition to his guitar work, Frusciante experimented with a variety of synthesizers, a distinctive feature of the record.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh <b>water</b> <b>for</b> the city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates {{in the water}} were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking <b>water</b> <b>for</b> Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E
