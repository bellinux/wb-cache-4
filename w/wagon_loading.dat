50|$|Andrew Knowles and Sons relined the upcast shaft in 1872 {{reducing}} its diameter to 7 feet 2 inches, giving Pendleton {{the record for}} the narrowest shaft. In 1891 the company decided to modernise the colliery by sinking two 16 feet-diameter shafts but water from old workings broke through causing flooding and subsidence and the shafts were abandoned. A screening plant and <b>wagon</b> <b>loading</b> facility were built on the canal's west bank alongside the Manchester and Bolton Railway line linked to the pit by a bridge built in 1894. A small engine shed and sidings were built to connect with the railway by January 1895. A saddletank locomotive supplied by Manning Wardle in 1901 was named Knowles.|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} {{production of}} high-quality anthracite has attracted increasing global attention. Based on the coal occurrence in Yongxia Mining Area and mining conditions of a coalface in Xinqiao Coal Mine, {{we proposed a}} systematic study on the technical support {{for the production of}} high-quality anthracite. Six key steps were explored, including coal falling at the coalface, transport, underground bunker storage, main shaft hoisting, coal preparation on the ground, and railway <b>wagon</b> <b>loading.</b> The study resulted in optimized running parameters for the shearers, and the rotating patterns of the shearer drums was altered (one-way cutting was employed). Mining height and roof supporting intensity were reduced. Besides, loose presplitting millisecond blasting and mechanized mining were applied to upgrade the coal quantity and the lump coal production rate. Additionally, the coalface end transloading, coalface crush, transport systems, underground storage, and main shaft skip unloading processes were improved, and fragmentation-prevention techniques were used in the washing and railway <b>wagon</b> <b>loading</b> processes. As a result, the lump coal production rate was maintained at a high level and fragmentation was significantly reduced. Because of using the parameters and techniques determined in this research, high-quality coal production and increased profits were achieved. The research results could provide theoretical guidance and methodology for other anthracite production bases...|$|E
30|$|The {{internal}} barriers {{from the}} rail system itself provided some {{challenges for the}} InnovaTrain concept. For instance, capacity constraints in the rail network - especially the availability of daytime slots - should be mentioned. Although small in comparison to a dedicated terminal, sufficient availability of rail sidings for cargo handling purposes had to be provided by the railway infrastructure operating companies. Without these, the infrastructure investment - even if very limited in comparison to conventional intermodal terminals or single <b>wagon</b> <b>loading</b> installations - would still be substantial. It had to be guaranteed that trucks could carry out their handling on the paved surface alongside the rails. Finally, {{it may be the}} case that railway undertakings deliberately inhibited the development of the InnovaTrain system, for fear of loss of their rail freight business.|$|E
40|$|In 1999 QR {{introduced}} {{a fleet of}} 2500 new coal wagons with nylon bogie centre bowl wear liners into service in Central Queensland. Within months wheel wear on these wagons and other wagons were exceeding 5 mm per 100, 000 km. Initial investigations focused on traditional causes of increases in wheel and rail wear such as badly profiled rail and poor rail/wheel lubrication. Wagon bogie rotational resistance was not considered until later following concerns raised regarding the possible additional rotational resistance created by the constant contact side bearers. Rotational resistance testing was undertaken by QR's Rollingstock Engineering Division in conjunction with Coal & Freight Services Group and some interesting results were found. The constant contact side bearings were not the source of major rotational resistance under the loaded wagon as first thought. Also the rotational resistance of the polymer liners {{was found to be}} excessive and concluded to be the root cause of the high wheel wear. A centre bowl lubrication programme was initiated and wheel wear was under control within two measurement periods with wheel life wear improved on all wagons, old and new. Since that time QR has undertaken extensive trials of different centre bowl types and found several more suitable materials which are now in use. In keeping with the above thrust, the Rail CRC Australia’s Bogie Rotation Friction Management project (Project 82) is investigating a range of factors that affect bogie rotation friction, including centre bowl friction, curve transition design and side bearer type. An extensive simulation-based parametric study was performed {{to determine the effects of}} varying side bearer type, centre bowl friction level, <b>wagon</b> <b>loading</b> conditions and speed on the wear characteristics of the wheelsets of a rail vehicle that runs on a selected track system. A 62 degree-of-freedom vehicle model was used for the simulations; the model was developed using the VAMPIRE® simulation package. New wheel and new rail profiles were used for the analysis to give an indication of the initial wear characteristics of the wheelsets. In this paper, an analysis of the results obtained is presented and conclusions are drawn based on the findings...|$|E
