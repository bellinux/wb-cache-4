25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two reasons why we should {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, in our world today, language is by no means the only communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never just read or write; rather, we always read or write something in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text we read there are different <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> read depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that meet our particular purposes in reading them.|$|E

[...] "I'm fascinated by our subjective perception of reality, {{that we are all}} stuck in a very singular point of view, a singular perspective on what we all agree to be an objective reality, and movies are one of the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> try to see things from the same point of view". Film critic Tom Shone described Nolan's oeuvre as [...] "epistemological thrillers whose protagonists, gripped by the desire for definitive answers, must negotiate mazy environments in which the truth is always beyond their reach." [...] In an essay titled The rational wonders of Christopher Nolan, film critic Mike D'Angelo argues that the filmmaker is a materialist dedicated to exploring the wonders of the natural world.

500|$|During the 1970s, {{some critics}} pointed {{out how the}} lines of the poems were memorable and popular while others {{emphasised}} the poem's place in the greater tradition of English poetry. W. K. Wimsatt, in 1970, suggested, [...] "Perhaps we shall be tempted to say only that Gray transcends and outdoes Hammond and Shenstone simply because he writes a more poetic line, richer, fuller, more resonant and memorable in all the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> are accustomed to analyze the poetic quality." [...] In 1971, Charles Cudworth declared that the elegy was [...] "a work which probably contains more famous quotations per linear inch of text than any other in the English language, not even excepting Hamlet." [...] When describing how Gray's Elegy is not a conventional elegy, Eric Smith added in 1977, [...] "Yet, if the poem at so many points fails to follow the conventions, why are we considering it here? the answer is partly that no study of major English elegies could well omit it. But it is also, and more importantly, that in its essentials Gray's Elegy touches this tradition at many points, and consideration of them is of interest to both to appreciation of the poem and to seeing how [...] they become in the later tradition essential points of reference." [...] Also in 1977, Thomas Carper noted, [...] "While Gray was a schoolboy at Eton, his poetry began to show a concern with parental relationships, and with his position among the great and lowly in the world [...] But in the Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard these longstanding and very human concerns have their most affecting expression." [...] In 1978, Howard Weinbrot noted, [...] "With all its long tradition of professional examination the poem remains distant for many readers, as if the criticism could not explain why Johnson thought that [...] "The Church-yard abounds with images that find a mirrour in every mind". He continued by arguing that it is the poem's discussion of morality and death that is the source of its [...] "enduring popularity".|$|E

2500|$|Russell's {{epistemology}} {{went through}} many phases. Once he shed neo-Hegelianism {{in his early}} years, Russell remained a philosophical realist {{for the remainder of}} his life, believing that our direct experiences have primacy in the acquisition of knowledge. While some of his views have lost favour, his influence remains strong in the distinction between two <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> can be familiar with objects: [...] "knowledge by acquaintance" [...] and [...] "knowledge by description". For a time, Russell thought that we could only be acquainted with our own sense data—momentary perceptions of colours, sounds, and the like—and that everything else, including the physical objects that these were sense data of, could only be inferred, or reasoned to—i.e. known by description—and not known directly. This distinction has gained much wider application, though Russell eventually rejected the idea of an intermediate sense datum.|$|E
2500|$|In Blumenthal's view, {{experiments}} such {{as these}} show that our appreciation of food is subjective, determined by information sent by the senses to the brain: [...] "the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> {{make sense of what}} we are eating and decide {{whether we like it or}} not depend to a large extent on memory and contrast. Memory provides us with a range of references – flavours, tastes, smells, sights, sounds, emotions – that we draw on continually as we eat." [...] His dishes, therefore, tend to be designed to appeal to the senses in concert, and through this to trigger memories, associations and emotions. Thus the Nitro-poached Green Tea and Lime Mousse on the Fat Duck menu is served with spritz of ‘lime grove’ scent from an atomiser; and the Jelly of Quail dish includes among its tableware a bed of oak moss, as well as being accompanied by a specially created scent of oak moss that is dispersed at the table by means of dry ice.|$|E

Moreover, when answering a question during this time about whether young people were misunderstood by the older generation, she said [...] "Yes, but I'm sure that's been the case down the ages. It's too much to expect people of the older generation completely to understand people of my age. Some of the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> behave were unheard of in my mother's young days, but each generation finds different symbols to express its discontent." [...] Also, when asked at the same time about how she felt about her rapid rise to stardom at such a young age, Bazlen said [...] "I realise what a lucky person I am and I'm anxious to repay the trust a lot of important people have placed in me. Reaching so high so young has put a lot of responsibility on my shoulders, but I feel that responsibility is part of the pattern of living and it is not to be taken lightly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{develops}} {{this discussion}} of games into the key {{notion of a}} language-game. Wittgenstein introduces the term using simple examples, but intends it {{to be used for}} the many <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> use language. The central component of language games is that they are uses of language, and language is used in multifarious ways. For example, in one language-game, a word might be used to stand for (or refer to) an object, but in another the same word might be used for giving orders, or for asking questions, and so on. The famous example is {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "game". We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, [...] "war games". These are all different uses of the word [...] "games". Wittgenstein also gives the example of [...] "Water!", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or as an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game within which it is being used. Another way Wittgenstein puts the point is that the word [...] "water" [...] has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as code by members of a secret society.|$|E
