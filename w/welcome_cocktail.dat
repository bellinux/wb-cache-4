40|$|The conference format did {{not differ}} from the familiar: each paper-writer led off by {{presenting}} the paper, an official discussant offered his evaluation of it. Then a ten minute open discussion followed. Each session included two papers and two discussants. The conference was officially opened by Attilio Celant, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and began with an introductory speech by Giuseppina Capaldo, Head of the Department of Law and Economics of Productive Activities. The conference featured a number of the world’s major scholars working on fiscal federalism and provided a forum to critically discuss the challenges facing federalism building. The event stimulated scholarly discussion on issues that can be encapsulated on the following points: What is there in the-real-world federalisms which makes them different from the various forms of decentralization? Can we distinguish genuine federalisms from spurious federalisms? And how? What makes federal structures effective? What is federalism supposed to deliver and what features determine how well it performs this task? Following the remarks of <b>welcome</b> and a <b>cocktail</b> reception, the conference started with a session chaired by Giancarlo Gandolfo. The first paper by Geoffrey Brennan, Jonathan J. Pincus, ‘Fiscal Equity in Federal Systems’ was presented by Geoffrey Brennan. His presentation began by reflecting on the normative foundations of fiscal equalisation - an issue handled in a classic paper of Buchanan's (1950). Contrary to Buchanan's claims, he argued that fiscal equalisation requires extremely strong value judgements [...] at least in the case where fiscal differences arise from the interaction of public goods provision under different population size – effectively committing one to a Rawlsian maximin rule. He noted that much weaker forms of the 'social welfare function' in this public goods case will generate the requirement that private consumption levels be equalised, but specifically not public consumption levels - in which sense private goods equalisation seems normatively weaker than public goods equalisation, He concluded that the hope of justifying federal fiscal equalisation on the basis of relatively uncontroversial individualistic norms seems illusory. Richard E. Wagner commented on the paper. It followed a paper by Giuseppe Eusepi and Richard E. Wagner, entitled ‘Competitive Federalism: Can this Analytical Box Be Filled?’ Giuseppe Eusepi addressed the fundamental difference between fiscal federalism and decentralization. To this end he noted that federalism is commonly described in contradictory fashion as involving both competition and decentralization. These descriptions, which may appear similar on the surface, emanate from contradictory analytical orientations. Competition entails a polycentric arrangement of competitors where there is no locus of control over the arrangement. In contrast, decentralization is a monocentric arrangement that involves a locus of control. To treat federalism as a method for decentralizing governments leads to a spurious form of federalism because the object that has been identified is not genuinely a competitively organized system of government. He concluded by suggesting that genuine federalism requires a polycentric arrangement that is organized through openly competitive processes. In contrast, the spurious form of federalism allows hierarchy to trump open competition. Reiner Eichenberger discussed the paper. On Tuesday, September 15, there were sessions in the morning and in the afternoon. The first morning session was chaired by Antonio Pedone. The opening paper entitled “Federalism, Budget Deficits and Public Debt: On the Reform of Germany’s Fiscal Constitution” was by Lars Feld. He brought the relevant economic literature to bear of the issue of the reform of the German fiscal constitution aimed at limiting the debt/GDP ratio. He presented a rather detailed account of the mechanisms by which tax autonomy in a competitive federal setting might be expected to reduce the use of debt. The conclusion operated in terms of pulling together the evaluation of the German reforms. Geoffrey Brennan discussed the paper. It followed a paper by Richard E. Wagner entitled “Polycentric Polity: Genuine vs. Spurious Federalism”. The main message of the paper was that real federalism is not achieved when decisions are only superficially decentralized since they are tightly constrained by centralized authority. According to Wagner federalism requires a polycentric process of competition which allows autonomous decisions to be made at local levels. This federalism would not be restricted to competition between governments geographically contained with arbitrary boundaries, but with governments whose size and shape are determined by peaceful competition for citizen support. He concluded by underlining that achieving such a genuinely competition federalism would require new institutional arrangements that would somehow have to come into existence. But the first prerequisite to realizing such institutional arrangements is to consider the possibility of such a competitive federalism, something that Wagner did in a powerful way. The second morning session was chaired by Geoffrey Brennan and opened with a paper by Bruno Frey entitled “Federalism As An Effective Antidote to Terrorism”. According to Frey decentralizing the economy, the polity and other social institutions is certainly not a panacea to “solve” the problem of terrorism. However, decentralisation is likely to strongly reduce the incentives for terrorists to attack because the expected damage suffered is much smaller than in a centralized society. He emphasized that federalism would strengthen society, as economic, political and social decentralization (or polycentricity) is an essential element of a free and vigorous society. He concluded that this would make a society less vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Indeed, terrorism has no chance of success against a society that actively guards its fundamental liberal institutions of which decentralized decision-making forms an essential. Luisa Giuriato commented on the paper. It followed a paper jointly written by Laura Castellucci, Stefano Gorini, ‘The Promise and Peril of Fiscal Federalism: the Case of Italy’. Laura Castellucci presented the paper. After noting that virtues have been analyzed with much more attention than perils, she focused on the Italian setting. She argued that Italy cannot expect any welfare gains from federalism due to (i) the huge income disparities among regions; (ii) corruption at local government level; (iii) low mobility and (iv) a constitutional provision assuring a uniform basic standard of public goods to all citizens. Friedrich Schneider commented on the paper. The first afternoon session, chaired by Antonio Pedone, opened with Friedrich Schneider’s paper “The Influence of Public Institutions on the Shadow Economy: An Empirical Investigation for OECD Countries”. Using the MIMIC estimation procedure, he focused on the size and development of the shadow economy of 21 OECD-countries. He argued that the driving forces behind the shadow economy are the increased burden of taxation and social security payments, combined with intensive labor market regulation, quality of state institutions and the tax morale. The argument was concentrated on the demonstration that federalism has no statistically significant effect on the shadow economy. He concluded by suggesting incentive oriented policy means so that the “black” value added can be transformed into official value added. The official discussant was unable to attend the conference, so the floor opened for a general discussion. The second speaker was Reiner Eichenberger who presented a paper jointly written with David Stadelmann entitled ‘Federalism is Fair: Debt Capitalization as a Protector of Future Generations’. Eichenberger started by contrasting the view that sees public debt as a burden on future generations with the Ricardian equivalence based on the claim that the burden of the debt is not shifted between generations because of compensating intergenerational transfers. In pointing out that the Ricardian assumptions are too demanding to hold, Eichenberger introduced another equivalence mechanism which is supposed to work also with non-altruistic individuals: Public debts capitalize into property values. He argued that Jurisdictions with larger net debts exhibit, ceteris paribus, lower property prices. He provided empirical evidence for debt capitalization using unique data for the Swiss metropolitan area of Zurich. Philip Jones offered his comments. The second afternoon session, chaired by Bruno Frey, had only one presentation because the speaker in schedule was unable to attend. A paper by Joe A. Oppenheimer, Norman Frohlich, Maria Dimitriu, Cyrus Aghamolla, ‘Some Democracies are More Equal than Others: Using Need Satisfaction to Evaluate Democratic Performance’ occupied the entire session. Norman Frohlich presented the paper. He started his presentation by noting that democracy is often justified as a political system which protects and increases the welfare of its citizens. His first point was that the welfare of an individual may be tractable, but citizens are a group, and so {{there is a need to}} characterize aggregate welfare. This requires some way of comparing and aggregating the welfare of individuals into a measure of social welfare. He moved on to focus on the growing body of ethical reasoning and empirical data that indicates a broad cross-national consensus on one central normative aspect of welfare: meeting the basic needs of the severely disadvantaged in society. He emphasized that all the developed liberal democracies have adequate resources to provide for these. To avoid the thorny problems of characterizing overall welfare, he proposed a new metric for evaluating the performance of the developed liberal democracies based on basic needs. He focused on some preliminary measures which demonstrate significant divergence across democracies in the OECD and showed some of the statistical patterns that emerge. Bruno Frey discussed the paper. On Wednesday, September 16, there was only a morning session, chaired by Giuseppe Eusepi. The session opened with a paper by Alessandra Staderini, Emilio Vadalà, “Inter-regional Fiscal Flows: An Estimation for the Italian Case”. Emilio Vadalà presented the paper. He illustrated the methodology used in the paper for the estimation of public revenue and expenditure on regional scale with the view to quantify balances (fiscal residuals) for Italian regions. He clinched that, contrary to other works that reassess regional accounts for specific time frames, this procedure has the advantage of being easily applied without requiring ad hoc calculations. Monica Auteri commented on the paper. It then followed a paper by Philip Jones, written jointly with Nils Soguel, entitled ‘Fiscal Federalism at the Ballot Box: The Relevance of Expressive Voting’ exploring the impact of citizens’ motivation to vote on the pattern of fiscal federalism. Jones argued that if instrumental citizens’ only concern was outcome they would have little incentive to vote because the probability that a single vote might change an electoral outcome is usually minuscule. He stressed the weight expressive voters attach to instrumental evaluation of alternative outcomes and presented a case study analysis of the way Swiss voters assessed the role their local jurisdiction should play. Lars Feld discussed the paper. The conference closed with a paper by Marina Brogi, ‘Better Regulation and the Cost of Controls’. She argued that state intervention to curb the global economic downturn triggered by the subprime crisis led to massive disbursements to support banks and the economy. She presented the possible changes which may be required in corporate governance regulations and considerations on the cost of control. Laura Ferrari Bravo discussed the paper. Giuseppe Eusepi closed the conference by thanking the speakers, the discussants and all those who took part in the lively discussion, which was helpful to the speakers and stimulating to the audience. He warmly congratulated those who acted as session chairmen on their efforts in ensuring that sessions did not exceed the allotted time-span. He thanked the team hired by the ECSPC for their excellent job and a very special note of appreciation went to Maria Delle Grotti permanent secretary to the European Center for the Study of Public Choice. Finally, he expressed his gratitude to Sapienza University of Rome, the Bank of Italy, the Department of Public Economics and Icoisa for their financial support...|$|R
40|$|Drawing {{together}} leading {{scholars from}} three continents, the event provided a forum to discuss new approaches and outcomes {{in the field}} of illegal economy The conference was formally opened by Giuseppe Eusepi, Vice-President of the ECSPC and conference organizer. He welcomed the conferees, and warmly addressed a note of appreciation to those who had come from as far afield as Australia and the United States. Attilio Celant, Dean of the Faculty of Economics, also welcomed the participants and congratulated Giuseppe Eusepi on organizing the event. He pointed out that since its inception the ECSPC has been known for attracting high profile international scholars and acknowledged the ECSPC’s invaluable contribution to the academic life in the Faculty. He suggested that the ECSPC conferences should continue and become a permanent fixture as an annual gathering. Soon after, Marcello Gorgoni, Head of the Department of Public Economics, welcomed the participants on behalf of the Department. He acknowledged the ECSPC’s ability to organize a steady sequence of international conferences and encouraged Giuseppe Eusepi to continue enriching the intellectual life of the Department. Following the remarks of <b>welcome</b> and a <b>cocktail</b> reception, the conference started with a session chaired by Antonio Pedone. The first paper entitled “Crime and Punishment: An Expressive Voting View” was by Geoffrey Brennan. The paper defended the expressive account against a couple of arguments that have been arrayed against it – both of which are taken by their proponents to be pretty close to knock-down arguments, but that according to the author are fundamentally mistaken. He then offered an interpretation of some salient aspects of policy towards crime based on the expressive theory. In the second paper, “Why do Transparent Public Procurement and Corruption Go Hand in Hand?” Gustavo Piga and Raffaella Coppier tried to show why countries that adopt more “transparent procurement”, as calculated by the share of tender advertised publicly, are also the ones where corruption is considered more pervasive. Piga and Coppier argued that the more countries are prone to corruption the more they increase transparency to curb corruption itself. They, then, presented alternative ways to reduce corruption in procurement. On Friday, September 29, there were sessions in the morning and in the afternoon and a banquet in the evening. The first session was chaired by Roger Congleton. The opening paper entitled “Dura Lex, Sed Lex? Insights from the Subjective Theory of Opportunity Cost” was by Giuseppe Eusepi. The paper was an account of the failings of the objective cost theory and its view of cost qua money outlays. The first part of the presentation revolved around the identification of what Eusepi defines the “notional locus of the law”, a tool useful to draw out the cost of law enforcement. Eusepi focused on the notion of cost as an obstacle to choice and the critical importance of finding the “notional locus of the law” to determine the cost of law enforcement. The costs in self-protection that law-abiding citizens and businesses have to bear can be expected to depend in large a part on the “notional locus of the law” that lawmakers set. Thus, effective law enforcement is expected to be heavily influenced by such “notional locus of the law”. In focusing on the relationship between economic incentives and moral equality vs. moral neutrality, he showed that from the economic point of view laws are neither neutral, nor incentive-free. In addressing these issues, Eusepi highlighted the link between unlawful activities and the economy. To this end, he provided a microeconomic analysis of organized illegal activities and showed that criminal activities enjoy an oligopolistic or even a monopolistic position by presenting a diagnosis of the mafia as a collective criminal activity. He stressed that the monopoly power of the mafia lies in the “no exit” rule. He ended with a critique of the so-called repentant or judicial collaborator policy used by criminal justice to break the “no exit” mechanism. Geoffrey Brennan served as a discussant. The second paper, entitled “Laundering Money in the Wild East”, was delivered by Jürgen Backhaus. He argued that shortly before the conclusion of the German currency union in 1990, the Staatsbank der DDR proceeded to print a very large set of high-denomination Mark der DDR banknotes. These freshly printed bills were distributed according to a list to high-ranking officers of the disintegrating GDR who proceeded to travel to Eastern European Capitals. Backhaus argued that technically speaking Mark der DDR was not a currency at all, neither convertible outside the country nor serving the three functions of money inside. He explained how the money was converted in socialist brethren states such as Rumania and Bulgaria and used to buy company shares or taking silent partnerships in such companies to be privatized. He presented his theory of management buy-outs and silent partnerships. Donato Masciandaro offered his comments. The second session, chaired by Giancarlo Gandolfo, started with a paper by Donato Masciandaro entitled “Offshore Financial Centres and International Soft Laws: Explaining the Regulation Gap”. With his interesting and thoroughly researched paper, Masciandaro sought to show that the regulation gap of the Offshore Financial Centres (OFCs) vis à vis international standards defined to prevent harmful phenomena - such as financial instability, money laundering, terrorism finance and aggressive taxation - depends on specific structural features. In the designing of the regulatory framework, the OFCs policymakers define the optimal degree of compliance in terms of cost-benefit analysis. He provided evidence showing that the policymaker convenience to establish an OFC jurisdiction may depend on peculiar country endowments, consistently with a path dependency approach. He illustrated a model based on a two-hundred country sample, using different classifications of OFCs. He highlighted that the probability to be an OFC increases with higher political stability, lower crime level, lower voice in international organizations and a Common Law legal system. Furthermore, he argued that a low-resource endowment has a soft influence on the choices to be an OFC. He raised the key question of how to identify optimal international policy strategies aimed to fill the regulation gap and overcome the name and shame approach, which is irredeemably inadequate. The official discussant was unable to attend. Conferees offered very stimulating comments and a range of suggestions. The next paper by Roger Congleton focused on the “Difficulties of Policing Corruption in International Organizations”. The author argued that public corruption affects the allocation of public resources, which in turn affects private incentives {{in a number of ways}} that tend to reduce economic development. He showed how the estimates demonstrate that corruption tends to be associated with low national incomes and low public service levels. As long as culture and corruption are exogenous, corruption is simply another sociological explanatory variable that helps explain persistent differences in national income among countries. As such, the estimated effects of corruption on the quality of life within a country may be of only scientific interest. However, most nations enact laws that make various forms of corruption illegal, such as bribery, and most governments attempt to enforce those laws, at least within limits. He clinched that corruption is not entirely exogenous, insofar as corruption is affected by a nation’s enforcement efforts. He explored how domestic corruption tends to affect international agreements as well as the organizations themselves. He then presented models examining the manner in which the policies of international organizations are affected by member corruption and institutions. The paper was discussed by Luisa Giuriato. The first afternoon session was chaired by Bengt-Arne Wickström. It started with a paper by Amedeo Argentiero, Michele Bagella, Francesco Busato entitled “Money Laundering in a Two Sector Cash-In-Advance Model”. Starting out from a theoretical model, the paper presented a methodology for generating otherwise unobservable quantities relying on observable (and estimated) variables. In particular, the paper constructed a series for money laundering over the sample 1980 : 01 - 2001 : 04. The analysis showed that: (1) money laundering accounts for approximately 9 percent of aggregate GDP and (2) money laundering is more volatile than aggregate GDP and it is positively correlated with it. Bengt-Arne Wickström discussed the paper. It then followed a paper by Lucia Dalla Pellegrina entitled “Crime Deterrence and Courts Efficiency (An Application to Crimes Against Property in Italy) ”. She focused on the existence of a causal relationship between the excessive length of trials and high crime rates. Using Italian data from 1999 to 2002, she showed the impact of the length of criminal trials on the willingness to commit crimes against property, like thefts, robberies, racketeering and swindles in Italy. She concluded that criminals are sensitive to the discounting process of the burden of punishment they should bear. Marianna Belloc commented on the paper. The second afternoon session was chaired by Marcello Gorgoni. The first paper "Criminal Behavior and Social Evolution" was by Bengt-Arne Wickström. He showed that in a society with two types of individuals, honest ones and criminals, individual behavioral patterns are individually decided upon through interaction with the rest of society. In deciding its behavioral pattern, an individual considers behavior in individual encounters, aggregate behavior in society – the norm – as well as the gains from criminal activity. He demonstrated that dynamically stable equilibria with a low and a high crime rate can be obtained under various assumptions. He concluded that a small exogenous increase in the gain from crime may lead to a non-reversible structural change with a substantial increase in criminal behavior in society. Daniela Federici discussed the paper. It followed a paper by Marco Arnone and Pier Carlo Padoan entitled “Anti-money laundering by international institutions. A very preliminary assessment”. The paper was presented by Pier Carlo Padoan. He illustrated the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism program introduced at the end-of 2001 at the IMF and WB, in conjunction with the work of the FATF and other regional bodies. According to the authors although this can be seen as the birth of a “regime for financial integrity”, the program has some shortcomings such as the limited availability of country information and the multiplicity of assessors and methodologies. For the limited sample where detailed information - based on the Detailed Assessments - is available the authors found that some areas of the AML/CFT framework are consistently weaker than others. For a larger sample - based on Recommended Actions - they found that countries’ ranking of performance is confirmed. Padoan ended by suggesting greater transparency and availability of detailed countries’ information, and made an assessment of the weak areas of a country’s AML/CFT framework at higher frequency than the established five years. The paper was discussed by Francesco Busato. On Saturday, September 30, there was only one morning session, chaired by Giuseppe Eusepi. The format differed somewhat from the familiar since Friedrich Schneider and Ursula Windischbauer were unable to attend. The paper, “Money Laundering: Some Preliminary Empirical Findings” was presented by the discussant Antonio Nicita He led off by summarizing the paper and introduced his critique of it. The paper was basically a quantification of the volume and development of money laundering activities using a DYMIMIC estimation procedure for the years 1994 / 95, 1997 / 98, 2000 / 2001 and 2002 / 2003 for 20 highly developed OECD countries. The variation in presentation technique provided for a lengthy and stimulating discussion among the conferees, spearheaded by remarks from Donato Masciandaro. It followed a paper by Peter Lewisch entitled “Money Laundering Laws as a Political Instrument: The Social Costs of Arbitrary Money Laundering Enforcement”. He discussed some aspects of the political dimension behind money laundering enforcement and the economic rationale behind anti-money laundering legislation. He focused on money laundering enforcement in cross-border settings and the political dimension via practical examples. The official discussant being absent, the presentation was followed by a lively discussion from the floor. The conference closed with a paper by Debora Di Gioacchino and Maurizio Franzini entitled “Competition in Public Administration: the Right Policy against Corruption?”. The authors based their argumentation on the assumption that competition in public administration is often advocated as a solution to bureaucrats’ corruption. To carry out their analysis, the authors presented a series of models that help understand what competition in public administration can actually accomplish. Central to their discourse were bribery and extortion. They sought to demonstrate that, given the asymmetric information surrounding bureaucrats’ honesty, there is a sort of trade-off between corruption and extortion. According to the authors, trying to curb one of them through competition may result in strengthening the other. The gap left by late withdrawal of the scheduled discussant was filled by conferees who participated wholeheartedly in the discussion. Giuseppe Eusepi closed the conference by thanking the presenters for enthusiastically delivering their papers, the discussants for offering fascinating, scholarly reflections and especially for filling the gap left by absent scheduled discussants and the chairmen for working diligently to ensure that the sessions ran smoothly and to schedule. He, then, invited the participants to join him in expressing their congratulations and acknowledgment of indebtedness to Maria Delle Grotti for her untiring efforts in preparing the conference and Alessandra Cepparulo for the terrific job she did preparing the ECSPC conference website. He was deeply appreciative of the team hired by the ECSPC for their care in overseeing all the details that contributed to a splendid conference. A note of appreciation went also to the catering service for the excellent quality of the food. Finally, he expressed his deepest gratitude to the Sapienza University of Rome, the Bank of Italy and the Faculty of Economics for their generous financial support. He announced that, as for previous conferences, a collected volume of essays based on a selection of papers is planned...|$|R

The conference was sponsored by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and énosi. Financial support came from Banca d’Italia. The conference was formally opened by Professor Giuseppe Eusepi, Vice-President of the ECSPC and conference organizer. He welcomed the conferees {{on behalf of the}} ECSPC and thanked the sponsors for their financial support. He raised some key questions for the conference; whether defaulting on public debt is ethically outrageous in principle and can be contemplated only in extreme circumstances or, following the lead of Buchanan’s treatment of the issue, seeking to be sympathetic to debt default. He clinched that Contractarian logic requires a language of debt renegotiation, not of debt default. Professor Eusepi invited Professor Lars P. Feld, Director of the Walter Eucken Institut and President of the ECSPC, to extend his welcome to the conferees. Professor Feld focused on the enormous challenges inherent in trying to cope with public debt all over the world, particularly in Southern Europe. He pointed out that the conference was a topical one, covering areas of key interest going from the relation between sovereign debt and the banking system and between central banks and the banking system. Professor Eusepi then gave the floor to Dr. Gianfranco Di Vaio, Deputy Chief Economist of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. Dr. Di Vaio welcomed the participants and thanked for the opportunity to sponsor the event. He provided an overview of the role that Cassa Depositi e Prestiti has played for over a century and stressed that CDP’s future plan to foster research activity will have a beneficial impact on the development of national economy. Soon after, Professor Pietro Boria, on behalf of énosi and the Faculty of Law, addressed a note of appreciation to Professor Eusepi for drawing together leading scholars working on public debt and suggested that consideration be given to organize a conference together with the Ph. D. program at the Faculty of Law. Following the remarks of <b>welcome</b> and a <b>cocktail</b> reception, the conference started with a session chaired by Giuseppe Eusepi (Sapienza University of Rome). The first paper entitled “Political Obligations: Is Debt Special?” was by Geoffrey Brennan (Australian National University, Duke University, UNC). He led off by stating that the paper was built on a previous paper written jointly with Giuseppe Eusepi in 2002 in response to an earlier paper of Buchanan’s. He reminded us that to public choice 'government' is just a linguistic short-hand for the individuals that figure in the policy-making process - the bureaucrats and politicians and advisors and in a democratic system the voters, and the relations between them. However, he continued, it is problematic to attribute to those various players ethical commitments that we have little reason to think they possess. He emphasized that politicians break promises all the time. They commit in their electioneering to all kinds of extravagant policies, which they conveniently forget once they achieve office. For example, governments sign on to international agreements from which they subsequently defect. Witness the Stability and Growth Pact of the EU. It followed a stimulating analysis on the difference between campaign promises and what we might think of as policy contracts. One instance where government needs that capacity to pre-commit is in relation to debt financing. In his view, Buchanan's thought - to reduce the promises to bond-holders to the status of other kinds of specifically electoral promises - would have disastrous consequences. As an illustration of the intertemporal aspect, he made an analogy between climate change and public debt. In his view, debt is part of the solution to this problem. No one would ethically dispute the legitimate use of public debt financing to fund projects that will yield their benefits to future rather than present generations. Unfortunately, he concluded, scope to use public debt for such purposes has been compromised by the levels of debt already acquired for much more dubious purposes. Richard E. Wagner (George Mason University) discussed the paper. The session ended with a paper by Richard E. Wagner (George Mason University) entitled “Debt Default and the Limits of the Contractual Imagination: Pareto and Mosca Meet Buchanan”. Wagner gave a stimulating overview of Buchanan’s treatment of public debt. He clinched that while Buchanan strove to incorporate a contractarian orientation into the theory of public finance, when it came to public debt he pursued the contractual perspective only incompletely. He conceptualized a contract between a present and a future generation but not a multi-sided contract that created a complex web of contractual relationships. He then went on to argue that Buchanan wrote in support of the morality of debt default. However, what seemed strange for such a notable contractarian was not so strange when thinking of the conflictual formulations that Gaetano Mosca and Vilfredo Pareto introduced into economic sociology. Bruno S. Frey (University of Basel and CREMA) discussed the paper. On Tuesday, May 31 st, there were morning and afternoon sessions. The opening session, chaired by Lars P. Feld (Walter Eucken Institut and Albert-Ludwigs-Universität), started with a paper by Giuseppe Eusepi (Sapienza University of Rome) and Richard E. Wagner (George Mason University) entitled "De Viti de Marco vs. Ricardo on Public Debt: Self Extinction or Default?". Giuseppe Eusepi presented the paper. He argued that Antonio de Viti de Marco’s theory of public debt contains a puzzle that is in full force today. He clinched that while, as a purely formal matter, de Viti accepted Ricardo’s proposition that an extraordinary tax and a public loan are equivalent, he reasoned wholly differently than did Ricardo. He went on by contrasting Ricardo's reasoning in terms of macro aggregates with de Viti's reasoning in individualistic or contractarian terms. He highlighted that within de Viti's cooperative state public debt would be self-extinguishing. In this framework public debt is viewed within the private law logic of contractual obligation. Outside this model, democratic processes will entail competition among élites for positions of rulership and public debt can become one more means by which the members of politically dominant groups can pass cost onto the remainder of society. He noted that such Italian theorists as Mosca and Pareto thought in terms of a continual circulation among élites striving for power, hence default can become a genuine possibility. Karsten Mause (University of Münster) commented on the paper. In the second paper, “Debt Default and the Relationship of Citizens to the State" Bruno Frey (University of Basel & CREMA) argued that debt default is an explicit promise broken by government undermining the Rule of Law. He pointed out that debt default produces two major consequences: market reaction in the form of high interest rates and a worsening of the social system. Stefano Gorini (Tor Vergata University of Rome) discussed the paper. After a refreshment break, the second morning session started with a paper by Giuseppe Vitaletti (Tuscia University) entitled “Raising Public Debt, Structural Reduction of Interest, End of the Economic Crisis”. He started by arguing that public debt is usually faced as it were the evil of the economy. He distanced himself from this position and showed that in advanced economies net investments tend to zero due to declining fertility rates and a huge growth of the service sector vis à vis the industrial sector. He stressed that an excess of private savings over investments created the conditions for resorting to debt. In support of his position, he emphasized that countries with a high public debt ratio, like Japan, are those less affected by the global crisis. He presented a wealth of data to corroborate his view. Jan Schnellenbach (Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus–Senftenberg) discussed the paper. It followed a paper by Lars P. Feld and Christian Pfeil (Walter Eucken Institut and Albert-Ludwigs-Universität) entitled “Does the Swiss Debt Brake Induce Sound Federal Finances? A Synthetic Control Analysis”. He argued that the Swiss debt brake is widely appreciated for some of its features and it was thus also discussed in the debates as blue print for fiscal rules in Germany, the European Union member states and Israel. He raised some doubts regarding this rule and the presentation revolved around the effectiveness of the Swiss debt brake by employing the Synthetic Control Method. The introduction of this fiscal rule improved the budget balance by about 3. 6 percentage points on average in a post-intervention period covering five years. The paper was discussed by Geoffrey Brennan (Australian National University, Duke University, UNC) The afternoon session started with a paper by Friedrich Schneider (University of Linz), Raphael N. Markellos (University of East Anglia), Dimitris Psychoyios (University of Piraeus) entitled “Public Debt and the Shadow Economy: What Relationship Do We Observe?” Friedrich Schneider presented the paper. The paper revolved around the role of the informal sector in the official economy of 64 countries between 2003 and 2007 to see its impact on debt markets. Through the use of an ordered probit regression, he showed that the informal sector has significant adverse effects on credit ratings and lending costs. He pointed out that the research evidenced some policy implications especially {{in the context of the}} ongoing sovereign debt crisis. Lars P.
