5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|Fish thrived for {{a limited}} time in Sulphur Creek between the {{introduction}} of perennial flows and the devastating floods {{at the end of}} the 20th century.

Work is under <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed to remove non-native species and restore native riparian vegetation.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Caroline's {{daughter}} Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park {{after the}} death of Robert Walpole. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter. This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who stopped him from entering the park, to court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park. Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.|$|E

ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been through the use of an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E
