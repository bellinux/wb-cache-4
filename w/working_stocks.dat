40|$|The paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} of the dynamic rational expectations commodity storage model, to the case where speculators (speculative stocks) and processing firms (<b>working</b> <b>stocks)</b> are stockholders. So far the literature has been focused on solving the storage model for each type of stockholder independently, either for the case of speculative storage (see Williams and Wright, 1991 and Deaton and Laroque, 1992), or for the case of <b>working</b> <b>stocks</b> (Carter and Revoredo, 1999, show that the supply of storage cost approach - Miranda and Glauber, 1993; and Miranda and Rui, 1996 - reflects only the stocks carried by processing firms, when inventories of commodities (raw materials) are modeled as factors of production following Ramey, 1989). Almost no effort has been made for modeling the interaction of both agents (a notable exception is Lowry, 1988 but not {{in the context of the}} competitive storage model). The interaction of both agents is crucial to capture a higher number of stylized facts in commodity markets, such as the dynamic behavior of commodity prices (see Deaton and Laroque, 1992 and Miranda and Rui, 1996), and the Working curve (i. e., empirical curve that relates commodity price spreads with stocks, see Working, 1933). The model is solved by means of a modified version of the polynomial approximation technique used by Williams and Wright (1991). Two versions of the algorithm are presented (with and without a price responsive supply). Finally, the model is simulated to show the differences in the resulting market demand with respect to the other two models (speculative stocks and <b>working</b> <b>stocks)</b> and the differences in the resulting Working curves. ...|$|E

We model working inventories (i. e., raw material inventories carried by processors) based on Rameys (1989) model of inventories as factors of production, which allows us to represent storage under inter-temporal price backwardation, observed in commodity markets. We incorporate both speculative and <b>working</b> <b>stocks</b> in a simple model to analyze {{the interaction}} and to simulate the relationship between inter-temporal commodity price spreads and stocks.

40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) helicase-primase is {{the target}} for {{a new group of}} potent antivirals that show great promise in vivo. A claimed {{advantage}} of this class of compounds is the low rate of drug resistance, which is reported to occur at a lesser rate than acyclovir (ACV) -resistance in cell culture. We confirmed that BAY 57 - 1293 is highly active against HSV- 1 and superior to ACV when tested in Vero cells. Notably, drug resistance was detected in laboratory <b>working</b> <b>stocks</b> in two different strains of HSV at 10 (- 4) to 10 (- 5) and there was evidence that the resistant variants were present in the virus population before the selection was applied. Plaque-purified clones obtained from the parental viruses showed a lower level of resistance selection in the presence of drug (10 - 6) and this value is similar to published reports. In the case of HSV- 1 SC 16, no difference was observed between a working stock and a plaque-pure clone in the rate of resistance to the nucleoside analogue ACV. The <b>working</b> <b>stocks</b> were found to contain variants with resistance to BAY 57 - 1293 ranging from approximately 15 -fold to 4, 000 -fold suggesting that these viruses have the potential to subvert effective therapy. Sequence analysis of HSV- 1 helicase protein showed that most of the amino acid substitutions in the variants described in this study tallied with published results, with some interesting exceptions in the case of HSV- 1 strain PDK. Resistant variants did not readily revert to a sensitive phenotype {{in the absence of the}} inhibitor and representative BAY 57 - 1293 -resistant variants were cross-resistant to an alternative helicase-primase inhibitor, BILS 22 BS.

40|$|Fifteen {{years after}} the 1973 - 74 oil embargo, two of the {{programs}} designed by consuming countries to cope with oil disruptions are still in place. One is the strategic stockpiles of oil owned or controlled by {{the governments of the}} industrial nations. The other is the oil-sharing plan of the International Energy Agency. In fact, both programs received their impetus from the IEA, which was formed in 1974 by the United States, Canada, most Western European countries (except France), Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The TEA requires signatory countries to hold oil stocks equal to ninety days' imports of oil (interpreted generally as an amount over and above normal <b>working</b> <b>stocks).</b> This has largely been accomplished. Oil sharing, however, is to be imposed only in the event of oil-supply cutoffs of 7 percent or more to any individual member or the group as a whole.

40|$|Helicase–primase inhibitors (HPIs), e. g. BAY 57 - 1293, are {{extremely}} active against HSV in cell culture and animal infection models. They target the helicase–primase (HP) complex which {{is involved in}} virus DNA replication. Using BAY 57 - 1293 at inhibitory concentrations (e. g. 10 – 100 times the IC 50) {{it was possible to}} detect HPI-resistant viruses in two different laboratory <b>working</b> <b>stocks</b> of HSV- 1 following a single passage with the inhibitor in Vero cells. Furthermore, resistance selection occurred when the inhibitor was continuously present from prior to virus inoculation suggesting that certain resistance mutations may pre-exist in virus populations at relatively high frequency. PCR data will be presented to confirm these observations. It was shown subsequently that 2 out of 10 recent clinical isolates of HSV- 1 also contained BAY 57 - 1293 -resistant variants at 10 − 4 to 10 − 5 p. f. u. This is similar to the laboratory isolates and 10 – 100 times the previously reported spontaneous rate for HPI-resistance mutations (10 − 6) in plaque-purified HSV- 1 strains. The most common resistance mutations involved three amino acid residues just down-stream from the predicted helicase motif IV in HSV- 1 UL 5 and one residue near the C-terminus of the primase (UL 52). We also showed that certain HPI-resistance mutations in UL 5 are associated with increased or decreased virus growth in tissue culture with concomitant effects on pathogenicity...|$|E

Under these conditions, {{the first signs}} of cytopathic effect (c. p. e.) appeared at about 30 h post-infection and cell lysis occurred after 40 h. Before the onset of cytopathic changes, the virus induced inhibition of host cell protein, DNA and RNA (primarily rRNA) synthesis. These were designated c. p. e. (+) virus stocks. The effect of virus on host cell macromolecular synthesis and development of c. p. e, were not related to the virus isolate, but to the conditions under which the virus was produced. Thus, from a single virus clone, <b>working</b> <b>stocks</b> were derived which could or could not induce inhibition of host cell functions and c. p. e, development. The virus stocks that did not induce inhibition are defined as c. p. e. (-). Analysis of [3 H]leucine-labelled proteins from Vero cells infected with either the c. p. e. (+) or the c. p. e. (-) virus stocks revealed synthesis of two virusspecific polypeptides migrating with mobilities corresponding to mol. wt. 68000 and 79000. Thse are presumed to correspond, respectively, to the nucleoprotein and to the minor polypeptide p 79. In cells infected with the c. p. e. (+) virus stock, the virusspecific polypeptides were synthesized at times when there was a drastic inhibition of host cell protein synthesis. The yield of infectious progeny during the first 24 h of infection is similar in Vero cells infected with either the c. p. e. (+) or the c. p. e. (-) virus stocks. The proportion of defective interfering particles was much higher in the c. p. e. (-) than in the c. p. e. (+) virus stocks.
