5|$|During {{the season}} Clark {{continued}} his battles with Lex Luthor, {{who had lost}} his memory. New characters were introduced, such as Commander Hank Henshaw, a participant in LexCorp's project, Guardian Defense Platforms. In the third issue, Clark confronted Lex, during which Clark inadvertently implied that he knew Lex before his amnesia. Superman and Batman met and battled, but declared a truce, and began working together, eventually becoming friends. Clark also reunited with Bart Allen, who was seeking Clark's aid in battling the Black Flash, <b>who,</b> <b>ended</b> up killing Bart during an ensuing battle.|$|E

5|$|The {{explosion}} occurred {{shortly before}} the primary 2013 Argentine legislative elections on August 11. The governor of Santa Fe province, Antonio Bonfatti, asked the political parties to end their campaigns to allow mourning {{for the victims of}} the explosion.

The Phillies won the opener with a strong start by Williams, <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> his Phillies season with a 2.83 ERA. Although Burnett pitched decently in game two, the Braves won 4–2. The Phillies' season ended when Hamels, despite a quality start, was on the losing end of a 2–1 final score.|$|E
5|$|Columbus Crew and Toronto FC have {{competed for}} the Trillium Cup since 2008. Although a {{manufactured}} rivalry, the meetings have since sparked bitterness. On March 28, 2009, approximately 1,700 Toronto FC supporters travelled to Columbus Crew Stadium and witnessed a 1–1 draw, {{during which they}} lit a number of flares and allegedly committed vandalism. Following the game some altercations broke out between the two supporter groups. Overwhelmed security called police <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> the melees and made arrests, at which time a TFC fan was tasered while being subdued. The first rematch back in Columbus Crew Stadium following the incident was boycotted by Toronto FC supporters in wake of restrictions imposed on them by Crew officials.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E

5|$|Genealogy of the Holy War {{takes place}} on the {{continent}} of Jugdral, split between eight different countries founded by the Twelve Crusaders, an ancient group of soldiers <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> {{the rule of the}} ancient dragon Loptyr with divine aid. In the present, a cult working to revive Loptyr stir up war among the countries. The story is told over two generations — the first generation follows the Grannvalian prince Sigurd, while the second follows his son Seliph as he works to defeat the cult and avenge his father. Gameplay follows the traditional Fire Emblem system of tactical battles taking place on grid-based maps, while adding the Weapons Triangle and Support systems, which directly impacted both gameplay and story.|$|E
5|$|However, {{before the}} start of the 1947–48 NBL season, Maurice White, the {{president}} of the American Gear Company and the owner of the American Gears NBL team, pulled the team out of the league. White planned to create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America, in which he owned all the teams and arenas. However, the league folded after just a month, and the players of White's teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises. As a consequence, every team had a 9.09% chance of landing Mikan, <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> up on the Minneapolis Lakers, playing for coach John Kundla.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{has often}} been the case that league players have joined Andover after {{retiring}} from professional football. One of the most notable of these in modern times is Matt Crossley, <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> his career with the Lions after playing more than 100 matches for Wycombe Wanderers. After leaving Andover in 2001, Crossley later became assistant manager at Woking where he gained notoriety in December 2006 after he headbutted an opposing player who had tried to break up a fight. Maurice Evans is another former professional who, after briefly taking over as Andover's player-manager in 1967, went on to lead Reading to the Fourth Division championship, and Oxford United to Milk Cup victory.|$|E

5|$|John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, 9th Lord of Skipton (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461), was a Lancastrian {{military}} leader during the Wars of the Roses. The Clifford family {{was one of}} the most prominent families among the northern English nobility of the fifteenth century; and by the marriages of his sisters John Clifford had links to some very important families of the time, including the earls of Devon. He was orphaned at about twenty years of age when his father was slain at the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of St Albans in 1455. It was probably as a result of his father's death there that Clifford became one of the strongest supporters of Queen Margaret of Anjou, consort of King Henry VI, <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.|$|E
5|$|Murray next {{participated in}} the Rotterdam Open as the top seed, but he lost in the quarterfinals to Gilles Simon <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> a 12 match losing streak against Murray. Murray then played in the Dubai Championships but {{suffered}} another quarterfinal defeat to 18-year-old Borna Ćorić and as a result, Murray slipped to No. 5 in the world rankings behind Rafael Nadal and Kei Nishikori. Afterwards, Murray played the Davis Cup World Group in Glasgow against the United States. He won both his matches against Donald Young and John Isner, allowing Great Britain to progress to the quarterfinals {{for the second consecutive}} time with a 3–2 lead over the United States.|$|E

5|$|On {{returning}} from his unsuccessful mission to Japan, Nuyts {{took up his}} position as the third Governor of Formosa, with his residence in Fort Zeelandia in Tayouan (modern-day Anping). One of his early aims was to force an opening for the Dutch to trade in China — something which had eluded them since they arrived in East Asia in the early 17th century. To further this goal, he took the Chinese trade negotiator Zheng Zhilong hostage and refused to release him until he agreed to give the Dutch trading privileges. More than thirty years later {{it was to be}} Zheng's son Koxinga <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> the reign of the Dutch on Formosa.|$|E
5|$|The four Grand Slam tournaments, the ATP World Tour Finals, nine ATP Masters 1000s and the Summer Olympics, {{make up the}} 15 {{most coveted}} {{top-level}} tournaments in men's tennis. Although no player has won each of these 15 events in men's singles, this feat has been achieved in men's doubles by Canada's Daniel Nestor and the United States' Bryan Brothers, Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan. Djokovic matches the result in men's singles of Andre Agassi, <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> his career having won 13 of these 15 events, achieving a Career Grand Slam (winning all four majors in a career), a Career Golden Slam (winning all four majors and the Olympic singles gold medal in a career), and what Sports Illustrated called a Career Super Slam (winning all four majors, the Olympic singles gold medal, and the ATP World Tour Finals).|$|E
5|$|Upon his arrival, the Blues {{were in a}} mid-table {{position}} in the First Division, but a lengthy unbeaten run saw the team qualify for the play-offs. The team went on to beat Bruce's former club Norwich City in the final after a penalty shoot-out to gain promotion to the Premier League, ending a 16-year absence from the top level of English football. Birmingham spent {{the early part of}} the 2002–03 season struggling near the foot of the Premier League table, but Bruce's signing of Christophe Dugarry revitalised the team, <b>who</b> <b>ended</b> the season in 13th place and finished higher than local rivals Aston Villa for the first time since the 1970s.|$|E
