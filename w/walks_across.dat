5|$|Henri L'Estrange, {{known as}} the Australian Blondin, was an Australian {{successful}} funambulist and accident prone aeronautical balloonist. Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer ever to have walked across a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s – one being successful, one ending in Australia's first emergency parachute descent, and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried {{to return to his}} original career of tightrope walking but, with new forms of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894.|$|E
5|$|When Bart {{finds out}} her secret and reveals {{it to the}} school, her social ranking plummets to a new low until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her {{outburst}} helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her, in effect making Lady Gaga's mission successful. Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being like anyone else. Just as Lady Gaga's train begins to leave again, Moe runs {{up to her and}} asks if she can help him as well, but Lady Gaga declines, stating that she's not that good. As Moe turns and <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> the train track, a second train hits him.|$|E

500|$|However, O'Connor {{remarked that}} American audiences might find the [...] "languorous <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> meadows" [...] and [...] "ornately choreographed dances" [...] of the British {{production}} too slow. In {{one of the}} most negative reviews, People Magazine considered the adaptation [...] "a good deal more thorough than necessary" [...] and [...] "not the best Austen on the suddenly crowded market". Although the reviewer thought Firth [...] "magnificent", he rebuked the casting of Jennifer Ehle as her oval face made her [...] "look like Anaïs Nin in period clothes, and that ain't right". The official A Network magazine summarised a year later that [...] "critics praised the lavish production, audiences adored it, and women everywhere swooned over Darcy. So much, in fact, that newspapers began to joke about 'Darcy fever.'" [...] Commendation for the serial continued in the years following its original transmission.|$|E
500|$|Al Leiter {{pitched a}} {{complete}} game shutout, scattering two hits and four <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> the nine inning start. This was Leiter's first complete {{game of the}} season. Pokey Reese was the only Reds player to reach scoring position for the entire game, doubling to lead off {{the bottom of the}} ninth inning and then advancing to third on a ground out. The Bergen Record labeled Leiter the Mets' [...] "flag bearer", coming through in games such as this when the team needed him most. For example, Leiter had also defeated Greg Maddux in his previous start on September 29 to snap the Mets' seven-game losing streak. Leiter's earned run average in the second half of the 1999 season was 1.22 runs lower than in the first. Leiter's start earned an 86 game score, which tied for the 14th best total in the National League that season.|$|E
500|$|All of the Eon Bond films {{feature the}} unique gun barrel sequence, created by graphic artist Maurice Binder, {{which has been}} called by British media {{historian}} James Chapman [...] "the trademark motif of the series". As Bond <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> the screen, he is viewed by the audience through {{the barrel of a}} gun trained on him by an unknown assailant. Bond wheels around and shoots directly at the gun/viewer, followed by the assassin's blood spilling down the barrel/screen. It was originally filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an actual [...]38 calibre gun barrel, with stunt man Bob Simmons playing the part of Bond. The remake of the sequence for the wide-screen Thunderball featured Connery as Bond. This is accompanied by the opening bars of the [...] "James Bond Theme", composed by Monty Norman, orchestrated by trumpeter and composer John Barry and Burt Rhodes.|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Madonna <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> {{the city with}} M.I.A. and Minaj, and is still {{followed}} by cheerleaders and football players. She walks down a city street, as players are shot down by an unseen shooter who opens fire from a passing vehicle. She climbs a pyramid of football players, and is eventually taken to a club with Minaj and M.I.A., who sing their parts in a room filled with other cheerleaders and football players. Madonna then falls from the building but two players catch her. She makes {{her way to a}} town square, then starts dancing with her cheerleaders as they bash heads off of football players using baseball bats, revealing a climactic firework spectacle. Madonna grabs one of the heads and proudly displays it to a cheering audience. The video ends with Madonna in front of a brick wall, laughing and throwing away the baby doll, as the word [...] "Touchdown!" [...] appears in front of a pink backdrop.|$|E

[...] It's bad enough that you people get all the parking spots!" [...] To an individual with Tourette syndrome, she says, [...] "I think Tourettes is so cool. It would be great to be able to annoy people like that. You get to whoop and twitch. Any other good ones?" [...] A passing blind man accidentally taps her with his cane, and Ling cries, [...] "OW! [...] They're not weapons!...I so prefer the deaf to the blind." [...] Ling will even impersonate the blind to get her way. In one episode she puts on sunglasses, extends a telescoping white cane, and <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> a busy street, [...] tires squealing as she hits a couple of cars with her cane. [...] Ling is unapologetic for these affronts. When pointed out that [...] "there are real blind people in the world", Ling retorts, [...] "It's not like any of them saw me." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} song, Sophie Muller filmed a music video for [...] "Take Me Home" [...] which was {{released}} on the song's CD single. The video was also included in her video album Watch My Lips (2002).' It opens with Ellis-Bextor, {{dressed in a black}} one-strap dress, in front of a yellow-toned painting of a woman with red lips. Throughout the music video, Ellis-Bextor is seen in a variety of dresses and outfits—she appears {{standing in front of a}} green mural with a flowery large tablecloth, while dressing a see-through shirt, which reveals her black bra; other scene shows her with a dark green gown; other shows her with a flower and leaves pattern and holding a in front of a projected image which shows the Eiffel Tower from far. She also appears dressed in a green trench coat in another scene. Usually, costume and location scenes are accompanied by a change of gradient color, which are projected onto Ellis-Bextor. By the middle of the video, she <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> a street, surrounded by formally-dressed men, who dance around her and lift her. After the song's middle 8 plays, the lights of the street turn on and various French event posters are shown. The video concludes as they all enter a disco club. She also performed the track at the Read My Lips Tour (2002–03), serving as its encore. Ellis-Bextor would shortly introduce the song, with green eye makeup and red lipstick, dressed in a cream-colored dress and pink heels. As the backing track started playing, she would start singing and clapping her hands as the public imitated her, and the audience was showered with confetti.|$|E

2500|$|The Dashwood sisters stand {{apart from}} this world as being {{virtually}} the only characters capable of intelligent thought and {{any sort of}} deep thinking. Browstein wrote that {{the differences between the}} Dashwood sisters have been exaggerated, and in fact the sisters are more alike than they are different, with Elinor having [...] "excellent heart" [...] and capable of the same romantic passions as Marianne feels while Marianne has much sense as well. Elinor is more reserved, more polite [...] and less impulsive than Marianne who loves poetry, taking <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> picturesque landscapes and believes in intense romantic relationships, but it is very closeness between the sisters that allows these differences to emerge during their exchanges..|$|E
2500|$|Hudson did, however, {{note that}} there were some {{challenges}} during development. One of the difficulties was in deciding how much graphical detail to provide. [...] "Since our games generally have a lot of AI and scripting, numerous character models, and huge environments, we stress the hardware in a very different way than most games," [...] Hudson said. This made it difficult to predict how well the game would run. The game uses the Odyssey Engine, based on the Aurora Engine (previously developed by BioWare for use in Neverwinter Nights) but completely rewritten for Knights of the Old Republic. It was highly detailed for its time: grass waves in the wind, dust blows across Tatooine and puffs of sand rise as the player <b>walks</b> <b>across</b> the seabed.|$|E
