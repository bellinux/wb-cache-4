500|$|With Kenny Greenberg and Jason Houser {{once again}} as producers, Matthew West began {{recording}} {{for his second}} studio album in early 2005. History, co-produced by West, was released on June 21, 2005 on Universal South Records. The first single off the album, [...] "Next Thing You Know", was released June 20, a day before the album's release. The theme of the title track [...] "History" [...] {{was inspired by a}} R music news headline [...] "Matthew West Makes History", in reference to his first album, Happy. [...] "It's not every day you read a headline like that <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> in it that calls you a history maker," [...] he said. Beginning on September 14, 2005, he kicked off the 30-city History 101 tour, his first headlining tour, which included guest musicians Shawn McDonald and Paul Wright.

2500|$|Equal in foulness to {{the third}} Baldrick, Private Baldrick also matches his {{immediate}} predecessor in terms of stupidity. His [...] "cunning plans", like those of his Elizabethan ancestor, have an insane, perverse logic to them. Examples include carving his name on a bullet, {{in relation to the}} old saying [...] "a bullet <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> on it", his explanation being that if he owns the bullet, it won't ever kill him as he won't ever shoot himself ("shame", comments Captain Blackadder), and the chances of there being two bullets with [...] "Baldrick" [...] on them are [...] "very small indeed". He has also been known to eat cigarettes as seen in the last episode of the series.|$|E

The letter may never reach you, for I {{do not know how to}} address it, tho’ I feel sure your name upon the envelope will be sufficient. It is nearly two years ago, that my dear eldest son went out to the War for the last time and the day he said goodbye to me ~ we were looking together across the sun-glorified sea ~ looking towards France, with breaking hearts ~ when he, my poet son, said those wonderful words of yours ~ beginning at ‘When I go from hence, let this be my parting word’ ~ and when his pocket book came back to me ~ I found these words written in his dear writing ~ <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> beneath." ...|$|E
