5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a lower class, I am in it, and <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a criminal element, I am of it, and <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E

5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some {{evidence to support the}} role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.|$|E

5|$|Biofuel {{emphasis}} in Germany is on biodiesel, and no specific incentives {{have been granted}} for E85 flex-fuel cars, however there is complete exemption of taxes on all biofuels <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a normal tax of €0.65 per liter of petroleum fuels. The distribution of E85 began in 2005, and with 219 stations as of September 2008, Germany ranks second after Sweden with the most E85 fueling stations in the EU.|$|E
5|$|Historians' {{assessments}} of the Vengeance's career in Australian service differ. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> consensus that the type was obsolete, some argue that it nevertheless proved successful. Others, including the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre, have judged that the Vengeance's performance was mixed and the type was not suited to Australia's requirements.|$|E

The clutch size is {{reported}} to be two or three eggs. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no reliable information on incubation and feeding, it is believed that both parents are active in caring for the young. A field study by Jan Lewis and colleagues found that only females bore brood patches, suggesting they alone incubated eggs.|$|E

5|$|Negative {{effects on}} {{fisheries}} are mostly restricted to raiding by birds on aquaculture, although long-lining fisheries {{also have to}} deal with bait stealing. There have been claims of prey depletion by seabirds of fishery stocks, and <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some evidence of this, the effects of seabirds are considered smaller than that of marine mammals and predatory fish (like tuna).|$|E

5|$|The flag {{does not}} differ {{significantly}} from {{the flag of the}} Byelorussian SSR, other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the red star, and the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no official interpretation for the colors of the flag, an explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation's forefathers, while green represents life.|$|E
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a Milankovitch {{cycle in}} the range of 100,000 years, related to Earth's orbital eccentricity, its {{contribution}} to variation in insolation is much smaller than those of precession and obliquity. The 100,000-year-problem refers to the lack of an obvious explanation for the periodicity of ice ages at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not before, when the dominant periodicity corresponded to 41,000 years.|$|E

5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E
