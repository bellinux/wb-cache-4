5|$|IQ classifications from IQ testing are not {{the last}} <b>word</b> <b>on</b> how a test-taker will do in life, nor are they the only {{information}} {{to be considered for}} placement in school or job-training programs. There is still a dearth of information about how behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores. For placement in school programs, for medical diagnosis, and for career advising, factors other than IQ must also be part of an individual assessment.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{classifying}} <b>words</b> <b>on</b> four letters into equivalence classes under {{the operations of}} conjugacy and reverse complementation is solved by using a surjective mapping to <b>words</b> <b>on</b> two letters of even length. This classification problem for <b>words</b> <b>on</b> four letters arises {{in the study of}} DNA sequences. For <b>words</b> <b>on</b> two letters the concept of a lexical word, which is based on a total order relation, allows one to assign a distinguished word to each conjugacy class. The mapping between <b>words</b> <b>on</b> four letters and those on two letters is used to assign a distinguished word to the conjugacy classes of <b>words</b> <b>on</b> four letters. The Möbius inversion formulas are basic to this enumeration problem...|$|R

5|$|At 09:35, a Catalina {{made the}} first {{sighting}} of the Ryūjō force. Later that morning, several more sightings of Ryūjō and ships of Kondo's and Mikawa's forces by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines, leading Fletcher {{to believe that the}} Japanese knew where his carriers were, which actually was not yet the case. Still, Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the Ryūjō group until he was sure there were no other Japanese carriers in the area. Finally, with no firm <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the presence or location of other Japanese carriers, at 13:40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from Saratoga to attack Ryūjō. However, he kept aircraft in reserve from both U.S. carriers potentially ready should any Japanese fleet carriers be sighted.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having {{the burden of}} his professorial and garden duties, by the late 1870s the burden of {{maintaining}} himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on Synoptical Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted {{of the fact that}} other scientists often only accepted Gray's <b>word</b> <b>on</b> a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if just to look at him through his window.|$|E

5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E

Haakon casts himself down before her a second time, and Sigmund notices that Haakon is weeping. He stands up again, {{takes hold of}} the ring, and finds {{that it has become}} loose. Haakon gives the ring to Sigmund, and tells him that he must never part with it. Sigmund gives him his <b>word</b> <b>on</b> it and the men part, each returning to their ships. A storm appears and the two ships are swept apart, and many days are described as passing afterwards.|$|E

5|$|The Origin of Birds is {{an early}} {{synopsis}} of bird evolution written in 1926 by Gerhard Heilmann, a Danish artist and amateur zoologist. The book was born {{from a series of}} articles published between 1913 and 1916 in Danish, and although republished as a book it received mainly criticism from established scientists and got little attention within Denmark. The English edition of 1926, however, became highly influential at the time due to the breadth of evidence synthesized as well as the artwork used to support its arguments. It was considered the last <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the subject of bird evolution for several decades after its publication.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Sacrifice was a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and challengers Kurt Angle and Scott Steiner. At TNA's {{previous}} PPV event Lockdown on April13, Joe defeated Angle in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Prior to Lockdown on the April3 episode of Impact!, Steiner {{announced that he would}} use his Feast or Fired TNA World Heavyweight Title shot at Sacrifice. Staying true to his <b>word,</b> <b>on</b> the April17 episode of Impact!, Steiner challenged Joe to a title defense at Sacrifice. Angle and Joe fought in a rematch for the title on the April24 episode of Impact!; Joe won after Steiner interfered. In response to Steiner's interference, Management Director Jim Cornette scheduled a Three Way match between Angle, Joe, and Steiner for the title at Sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|After withdrawing, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau rendezvoused with Nürnberg and Titania at Nuku Hiva, {{where they}} resupplied and their crews took shore leave {{before moving on}} to meet the rest of the {{squadron}} at Easter Island. Although the Germans had destroyed the shipping at Papeete and wreaked havoc in the town, they had been denied their primary objective of seizing the French coal piles and replenishing their own stocks. Von Spee's raid allowed the British Admiralty to receive <b>word</b> <b>on</b> his position and heading, allowing them to inform Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock of the German intentions thus leading to the Battle of Coronel. Another effect was the reduction of ammunition available to the two German cruisers. The hundreds of shells fired by von Spee's ships at Papeete were irreplaceable. The depletion of ammunition {{as a result of the}} action at Papeete contributed to the German East Asia Squadron's failure to adequately defend itself at the Battle of the Falkland Islands against British battlecruisers. Lieutenant Destremau was chastised by his misinformed superior officer for his actions during the defense of Papeete and for the loss of the gunboat Zélée. He was summoned back to Toulon under arrest to be court-martialled, but died of illness in 1915 before the trial. In 1918, Destremau was finally recognized for his actions at Papeete and was posthumously awarded the Légion d'honneur.|$|E
