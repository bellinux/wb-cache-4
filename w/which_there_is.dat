5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph in <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> one vertex per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal {{form of the}} instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning {{that it has a}} symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E

5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, for <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E
5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no direct, purely vertical ascent {{to the safety of}} breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E

5|$|Known {{from several}} well-preserved skulls and {{abundant}} skeletal material, Majungasaurus has recently {{become one of}} the best-studied theropod dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere. It appears to be most closely related to abelisaurids from India rather than South America or continental Africa, a fact that has important biogeographical implications. Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly preying on sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of the}} few dinosaurs for <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> direct evidence of cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Most {{moments in}} <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute {{a change in}} point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events {{from the perspective of}} the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
