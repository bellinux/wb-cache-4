500|$|IV, Diamond Rio's fourth album, was {{released}} in 1996. It was the [...] "first country release recorded entirely on a digital console"; specifically, a Fairlight console which recorded the album directly to a hard drive. Produced by DuBois, Clute, and the band itself, it was also their first album not to have Powell as a co-producer. According to DuBois, Powell left this role on good terms, as he [...] "saw a need {{to go in a}} certain direction, and the guys saw a need to go in a different direction." [...] Roe thought that the album benefited from a new label policy that allowed label personnel to respond more quickly to pitches from songwriters, specifically recalling to Billboard that the label's head of artists and repertoire (A) recommended the lead single [...] "Walkin' Away" [...] while co-writer Craig Wiseman (who co-wrote [...] "Bubba Hyde") was still recording its demo, and the band was able to record the song in the same day that the demo was completed. [...] "Walkin' Away" [...] peaked at No.2 on the country charts in early 1996. Three more singles were released from the album: the top 10 hits [...] "That's <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> for Lovin' You" [...] and [...] "Holdin'" [...] (also written by Wiseman), with the top 20 [...] "It's All in Your Head", co-written by Van Stephenson, in between. The music video for [...] "It's All in Your Head" [...] featured Martin Sheen and Ramon Estevez, the former playing the part of a snake handling preacher.|$|E

[...] National Journal wrote that Bush [...] "does not acknowledge the scientific consensus that human activity drives climate change".|$|E

[...] As a producer, she can have a lot more control over the entire TV project - overseeing the scripting process, hiring and casting. Lin stated, [...] "I just kept getting offered the same type of role. Being an actress, you cannot really do much. Actresses can only wait for the roles to come."" [...] "Now I can choose everything myself, whether it's the roles or the director that I want to work with or the cast that I want to feature. I feel much more in control over <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to do." ...|$|E

[...] Inspired by their experiences working on sit-coms, the writers also looked to create [...] "a network of strong characters" [...] to surround Parker with in the film. In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a coming-of-age story to see the growth of Parker, citing Say Anything..., Almost Famous, and Can't Buy Me Love as some of his favorite films in that genre. It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations. Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and [...] "came to a new realization about why he was so popular originally: He gave a different perspective on this world that they were building. He was introduced in the ‘60s, when they had already built a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person’s perspective on it. And that ties in really nicely with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to do with this movie, which is" [...] introduce him to the MCU. Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were Ultimate Spider-Man and Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane. In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.|$|E
