5|$|As {{the river}} {{frontage}} areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by planters <b>who</b> <b>developed</b> the cotton plantation economy {{with the use}} of slave labor, Mobile's population exploded. It came to be settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi.

5|$|Cracker Barrel {{was founded}} in 1969 by Dan Evins, a sales {{representative}} for Shell Oil, <b>who</b> <b>developed</b> the restaurant and gift store concept initially as a plan to improve gasoline sales. Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he remembered from his childhood, with a name chosen {{to give it a}} Southern country theme, Cracker Barrel was intended to attract the interest of highway travelers. The first restaurant was built close to Interstate 40, in Lebanon, Tennessee. It opened in September 1969, serving Southern cuisine including biscuits, grits, country ham, and turnip greens.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial doubts by Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and {{critically}} in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed {{the game to}} Coleco, <b>who</b> <b>developed</b> home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, {{and dozens of other}} places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's victory in the courtroom helped to position the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s (1996–1999).|$|E
5|$|Duke's Meadows {{stands on}} land {{formerly}} {{owned by the}} Duke of Devonshire. In the 1920s, it was purchased by the local council, <b>who</b> <b>developed</b> it as a recreational centre.

5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 <b>who</b> <b>developed</b> symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to {{the diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.|$|E
5|$|For the music, the {{development}} team felt that symphony orchestra would {{work best for}} Knights of the Old Republic II. The musical score was composed by Mark Griskey, <b>who</b> <b>developed</b> music and themes for characters and places, including the Jedi's theme, Darth Sion's theme and Darth Nihilus's theme (which both have many similarities with the Emperor's theme from The Return of the Jedi). He also created a theme for the main character, which is heard occasionally {{when he or she}} experiences internal conflict. The 70-minute score was recorded by the Sinfonia Orchestra in Seattle. The opening crawl utilizes the version of John Williams' main Star Wars theme that was re-recorded for the prequel trilogy.|$|E
5|$|From 1967 onwards, prison {{conditions}} improved; black prisoners were given trousers rather than shorts, games were permitted, {{and the standard}} of their food was raised. In 1969, an escape plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce, but it was abandoned after the conspiracy was infiltrated by {{an agent of the}} South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who hoped to see Mandela shot during the escape. In 1970, Commander Piet Badenhorst became commanding officer. Mandela, seeing an increase in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners, complained to visiting judges, who had Badenhorst reassigned. He was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, <b>who</b> <b>developed</b> a co-operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve prison standards.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, he {{published}} The Rules of Sociological Method, a manifesto stating what sociology {{is and how}} {{it ought to be}} done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux. In 1898, he founded L'Année Sociologique, the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students <b>who</b> <b>developed</b> his sociological program). In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of quantitative methods in criminology during his suicide case study.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners <b>who</b> <b>developed</b> black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E

In 1971 she appeared on the BBC documentary, Power of the Witch, which was devoted to Wicca and also featured the prominent Wiccan Alex Sanders. That same year, she was involved in the founding of the Pagan Front, a British pressure group that campaigned for the religious rights of Wiccans and other Pagans. In November 1970 she developed a full moon inauguration ritual for local branches of the Front to use and on May Day 1971 she chaired its first national meeting, held at Chiswick, West London. It was she <b>who</b> <b>developed</b> the three principles that came to be central to the Pagan Front's interpretation of their religion: adherence to the Wiccan Rede, a belief in reincarnation, and a sense of kinship with nature.|$|E
