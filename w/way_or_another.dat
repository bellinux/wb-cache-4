5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate {{is proportional to}} , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} of {{a significant part of the}} country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students.

5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging.|$|E
40|$|The Malay {{cartoons}} {{that air}} on Indonesian television channels are now popular among children in Indonesia. The shows Upin & Ipin, Boboboi, and Pada Zaman Dahulu are especially popular with Acehnese children. Initial observations {{found that these}} cartoons have played a great role in {{the increased use of}} contemporary Malay in their Indonesian. Thus, this study discusses the cross-linguistic influences of Malay from cartoons in Indonesian children’s language use in the home domain. Data were collected through recordings and field notes. Some steps based on the framework by Lacey and Luff (2007) were taken to analyze the data. The results were transcribed and sifted to distinguish the significant data. The recording and its transcription were then re-checked. The last step was categorizing the data into cross-linguistic influences based on Ringbom (1987). These influences include borrowing, hybrids, phonetic influence, and relexification. The results showed the presence of only two aspects of cross-linguistic influences: borrowing and phonetic influences. Borrowing was the most frequent aspect, followed by phonetic influence. Relexification and hybrid did not appear in the data. Nevertheless, there were other cross-linguistic aspects that were found in the data, including intonation, parenthetic remark, and interjection. In the broad-spectrum, the initial mimic on the Malay cartoon characters has expanded to employment in the language use of the children while speaking Indonesian. This study is expected to contribute in some <b>ways</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> towards the development of sociolinguistics, especially in cross-linguistic influence in children’s language use. Indonesia and Malaysia are neighboring countries, and language contact between the two countries is inevitable and evident. Hence, the study on the influences can benefit sociolinguistics, especially when investigating language change in the future...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} analyzes {{two approaches}} to the economic evaluation of an aircraft modernization program. The Analytic Science Corporation (TASC) method is compared with the Logical Decision for Window (LDW) methodology. TASCFORM-AIR model is a method to quantitatively measure military force modernization. Logical Decisions for Windows software and methodology is based on Multiattribute Utility Theory. It also helps to evaluate decisions quantitatively. The research includes analysis of the reasons, constraints and tendencies in the modern aircraft modernization process. Weapon modernization is usually driven by several objectives, {{all of them in}} one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> an <b>another</b> are pertinent to resource allocation. Reliable analytical tools are important to make good decision. Cost- effectiveness and cost utility approaches are evaluated. Comparison of both methodologies is based on the MiG- 29 modernization situational model. TASCFORM-AIR Model provides static indicators of military force potential. This can be viewed as measures of effectiveness. The LDW program computes the alternatives' utility by combining its measure levels based on the analyst's preferences.

5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they {{got to know each}} other. They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other, highlighting the idea that Gary and Val were always destined to end up together one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn active sonar, the {{objectives}} are to detect, localize and classify an underwater target. Azimuth and range {{are often used}} in anti-submarine warfare to localize targets. The depth may {{also be used as}} the key tactical information for strategy purposes or as a good feature for target classification or discrimination. Two dimensional arrays as ank arrays, cylindrical arrays, and hullmounted arrays have access to elevation angles. Even linear towed arrays can give some information about the elevation using the different conical bearings measured when multipath propagation arises. In the context of long ranges and summer Mediterranean sound-speed profile (SSP), this paper presents a new target-depth estimation method, which uses elevation and arrival time measures from one sonar ping in a multipath environment. This method is based on ray back-propagation with a probabilistic approach. This localization algorithm minimizes the mean-squared error of elevation angles at the receiver and arrival times between a model and measures. This method is tested through Monte-Carlo simulations of classic active sonar scenarios and using experimental data from a real reduced-scaled tank. In active sonar, acoustic waves can take the same path on the <b>way</b> back <b>or</b> <b>another</b> path, so ray path combinations can occur. Our localization method discusses also about this ray identification, or how these combined acoustic paths were managed...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide proposals for a reform of the future EU Rural Development policy, in the context of the 2014 - 2020 programming period. To this end, it is necessary to take stock of the main progress achieved by this policy over the past years. Furthermore, this paper intends to discuss the role of the main variables which can influence the future debate on the reform of RD in Europe. This paper is organised in three main sections. The first section summarises the main changes in RD since Agenda 20004 until the latest revision under the Health Check. This analysis seeks to highlight progress and weaknesses emerging from the main reviews carried out in the last decade. The second section is focused on the main variables of the policy context which might in one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> in <b>another</b> shape the content of RDPs after 2013,namely: the reform of the 1 st pillar, the EUROPE 2020 strategy and the future of cohesion policy. These three elements are strictly interlinked with the budget reform. This section includes a final comment on the rationales for a common RD policy. The third section develops some proposals concerning the key issues for a more efficient and effective RD (new priorities,a different programming system, a delivery system more strongly based upon a territorial approach and fostering innovation). ...|$|R

Through by a multi-level hermeneutic, this study get the ambition to be comprehensible both to Readers who are not used to this kind of literature and to the ones advanced and skilled in symbolic thought. The main important conclusion owes the quality of the symbolic level, which is the property to refuse a single interpretation: notwithstanding, this does not prevent from a clear historical and political evaluation of the phenomena under analysis, according the methodologies of social sciences. This political evaluability drives to the main valuable output of the essay, which concerns the anthropological statement that the logical label of Masonry, with this name or many others, it exists since always. Under the category of initiatory institution, we may consider the step between individual and society, and a society inside a larger one.
