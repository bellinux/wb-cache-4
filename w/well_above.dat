25|$|This is an {{experimental}} method that employs {{a number of}} vertical air injection <b>wells</b> <b>above</b> a horizontal production well located {{at the base of}} the bitumen pay zone.

It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD.|$|R
30|$|Water {{samples were}} {{collected}} from 19 hand dug wells (drinking water sources) located within and/or around cocoa farms selected for the study.

These distances were chosen because the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that hand dug wells {{should be at least}} 30  m away from an agricultural field where chemicals are handled (Harris et al. 1996; WHO 2004). Water {{samples were collected}} from two hand dug wells from each of the distance categories (between 0 – 15 and 16 – 30  m) within each selected community.

40|$|Groundwater nitrate {{contamination}} in the Central Valley (CV) aquifer of California is a ubiquitous groundwater problem found {{in various parts}} of the valley. Heavy irrigation and application of fertilizer over the last several decades have caused groundwater nitrate {{contamination in}} several domestic, public and monitoring wells in the CV above EPA’s Maximum Contamination level of 10 mg/L. Source variables, aquifer susceptibility and geochemical variables could affect the contamination rate and groundwater quality in the aquifer. A comparative study was conducted using Geodetector (GED), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to observe which method is most effective at revealing environmental variables that control groundwater nitrate concentration. The GED method detected precipitation, fertilizer, elevation, manure and clay as statistically significant variables. Watersheds with percent of <b>wells</b> <b>above</b> 5 mg/L of nitrate were higher in San Joaquin and Tulare Basin compared to Sacramento Valley. PCA grouped cropland, fertilizer, manure and precipitation as a first principal component, suggesting similar construct of these variables and existence of data redundancy. The GWR model performed better than the OLS model, with lower corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values, and captured the spatial heterogeneity of fertilizer, precipitation and elevation for the percent of <b>wells</b> <b>above</b> 5 mg/L in the CV. Overall, the GED method was more effective than the PCA and GWR methods in determining the influence of explanatory variables on groundwater nitrate contamination...|$|R

About 21 fresh water samples were collected from different water supply sites in Kh. Y. and analyzed for nitrate, chloride, total dissolved salts (TDS) and for fecal and total bacteria. The article also analyzes the environmental situation among the population in Kh. Y. and correlates it with the current health problems.

Furthermore, only 2 <b>wells</b> <b>above</b> all are complying with the WHO standards in a horizontal comparison (comparison of all standard to the same well).
