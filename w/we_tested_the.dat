In recent years, several measures {{have been developed to}} capture job crafting. In <b>the</b> present study, <b>we</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> validity and reliability of an existing job crafting questionnaire (JCRQ) in four studies: First, <b>we</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> scale validity of the JCRQ in a Spanish diary study (Spain, N = 164, diary occasions 820). Second, <b>we</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> scale validity across two Western (Spain, N = 164, UK, N = 109) and two Eastern cultures (China, N = 170, Taiwan, N = 165). Third, <b>we</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> test-rest reliability in a Spanish three-wave longitudinal sample (N = 191). Finally, <b>we</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> criterion validity using data from the four countries. Results confirm the presence of five independent job crafting dimensions: increasing challenging demands, decreasing social job demands, increasing social job resources, increasing quantitative demands, and decreasing hindrance job demands. The JCRQ shows acceptable test-retest reliability, scale and criterion validity across the four studies...|$|R
