Sometimes I have doubted {{if it were not}} better to be poor--at least not inordinately rich. It pains me to see {{neighbouring}} tribesmen stare as they pass by, and overhear them say, reverently, one to another, [...] "There--that is she--the millionaire's daughter!" [...] And sometimes they say sorrowfully, [...] "She is rolling in fish-hooks, and I--I have nothing." [...] It breaks my heart. When I was a child and we were poor, we slept with the door open, if we chose, but now--now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> night-watchman. In those days my father was gentle and courteous to all; but now he is austere and haughty and cannot abide familiarity. Once his family were his sole thought, but now he goes about thinking of his fish-hooks all the time. And his wealth makes everybody cringing and obsequious to him. Formerly nobody laughed at his jokes, they being always stale and far-fetched and poor, and destitute of the one element that can really justify a joke--the element of humour; but now everybody laughs and cackles at these dismal things, and if any fails to do it my father is deeply displeased, and shows it. Formerly his opinion was not sought upon any matter and was not valuable when he volunteered it; it has that infirmity yet, but, nevertheless, it is sought by all and applauded by all--and he helps do the applauding himself, having no true delicacy and a plentiful want of tact. He has lowered the tone of all our tribe. Once they were a frank and manly race, now they are measly hypocrites, and sodden with servility. In my heart of hearts I hate all the ways of millionaires! Our tribe was once plain, simple folk, and content with the bone fish-hooks of their fathers; now they are eaten up with avarice and would sacrifice every sentiment of honour and honesty to possess themselves of the debasing iron fish-hooks of the foreigner.
