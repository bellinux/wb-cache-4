50|$|The circuit's {{demanding}} {{nature was}} obvious: The Minardi-Ford Cosworth of Pierluigi Martini {{spun out of}} the chicane on lap 46 and was almost collected by the Ligier-Judd of Stefan Johansson. Maurício Gugelmin (March-Judd) slowed to avoid the pair and was hit from behind by the Lotus-Honda of Satoru Nakajima who had {{just come out of}} the pits on new tyres and couldn't stop in time. Both cars were out on the spot with the front of the Lotus looking very second hand, though both drivers were unhurt. This crash also had an effect on Prost who was the first car upon the scene. The McLaren ran over some debris which broke off part of the front end <b>wing</b> <b>plate,</b> causing the car to understeer {{for the rest of the}} race, though Prost was able to play with his cars onboard settings to compensate and would set the fastest race lap later in the race.

40|$|We {{have carried}} out a {{comprehensive}} analysis of all Betelgeuse calibration observations obtained to date with the HRC. Betelgeuse is undetected {{in all of the}} individual observations as well as cumulatively. We find that the expected exposure time for detection is> 1 Ms for aimpoint observations for both HRC-I and HRC-S, and therefore recommend discontinuing them. We also find that the predicted count rate due to the UV/optical flux is sufficient to have already resulted in a detection for observations carried out over the thin filter regions at large off-axis angles of the HRC-S. The non-detections therefore suggest that the out-of-band response must be decreased, by a factor < 0 : 3.

40|$|This {{project is}} an {{extension}} of a Masters Degree thesis of a paleontology student, Tony Tobenski, who went to SIU (Tobenski, 2011). Tobenski (2011) examined the Menard Limestone of the Kinkaid Formation (Late Mississippian) to determine the function, morphology, evolution, and biostratigraphical usefulness of crinoid wing plates. I examined the Golconda and Glen Dean Formations of the Upper Mississippian Hombergian at the Golconda Marina (Type Section) in Illinois and in Western Kentucky near Cave-In-Rock, IL. Pterotocrinus is an extinct genus of crinoid (an echinoderm; related to starfish and sea urchins) and its wing plates are thought to be used for feeding or defense depending on the morphology of the plates. The goal is to test its biostratigraphic use by using the wing plates to show evolutionary changes in <b>wing</b> <b>plate</b> morphology and to possibly identify useful Pterotocrinus indices for the Golconda Formation. The Type Section had larger specimens while the Kentucky location had a higher diversity of species. Preservation bias and environmental conditions may have influenced species differences at the two localities...|$|E

40|$|Pterotocrinus is an {{echinoderm}} of {{the class}} Crinoidea that is restricted to the Chesterian Series (Chestnut and Ettensohn, 1988; Sutton, 1934). The most identifiable and best preserved remains of Pterotocrinus are the wing plates (Welsh, 1978). These wing plates are specialized tegmen plates that give Pterotocrinus its name (from pteron, Greek for 2 ̆ 2 wing 2 ̆ 2) (Welsh, 1978). This study questions whether or not wing plates {{can be used for}} biostratigraphy throughout the Chesterian Series, as well as what the functions of the wing plates were. New morphologies of Pterotocrinus found within the Menard Limestone during this study bring into question the biostratigraphical usefulness of many of the morphologies of Pterotocrinus wing plates. Certain species of Pterotocrinus appear to remain valuable index fossils within the Menard Limestone and the Kinkaid Formation. Four new morphologies were collected within the Menard Limestone during this study. These new finds draw questions about our knowledge of this genus. This study also attempted to explain the function of the <b>wing</b> <b>plate,</b> and how it may have changed over time. Pterotocrinus wing plates evolved rapidly during the Chesterian Series developing vastly different morphologies from the time the Menard Limestone was deposited to the time when the Kinkaid Formation was deposited. This study suggests a functional shift over time, with the wing plates of the Menard Limestone acting as rudders to orient the calyx to either assist in feeding or reduce stress on the calyx, and the wing plates of the Kinkaid Formation acting as an antipredatory defense mechanism. This study presents new conclusions and new questions regarding the wing plates of Pterotocrinus...|$|E

The aircraft began to sink heavily and the captain, realizing what had happened, pulled back on the control column and applied full thrust to all four engines. The nose lifted, but the aircraft still continued to sink, hitting the runway with enough force that the number four engine and pylon broke off the wing. There was also a tail strike at this time.
