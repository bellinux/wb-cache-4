5|$|During the Camillan era, {{they fought}} {{in a shallow}} phalanx formation, {{supported}} by light troops. In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. They <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> {{to be used as}} a decisive force in the battle, thus prompting an old Roman saying: 'It comes down to the triarii' (res ad triarios venit), which meant carrying on to the bitter end.|$|E

Transformation <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to create or anticipate the future. Transformation <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to deal with the co-evolution of concepts, processes, organizations and technology. Change in any one of these areas necessitates change in all. Transformation <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to create new competitive areas and new competencies. Transformation <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to identify, leverage and even create new underlying principles for the way things are done. Transformation <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to identify and leverage new sources of power. The overall objective of these changes is simply—sustained American competitive advantage in warfare." ...|$|R
5|$|From 1871 to 1880, the Corradino Lines {{were built}} on the Corradino Heights. The V-shaped trace and ditch <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> to protect the {{dockyard}} and harbour from landward attacks. They were abandoned in the early 1900s due to advancements in technology, although they saw some use once again in World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, architects Zaha Hadid and Ben van Berkel {{were invited}} to design and build two pavilions on the Chase Promenade South, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. The pavilions were privately funded and were {{designed}} to be temporary structures. They served as {{the focal point of}} Chicago's year-long celebration of Burnham's Plan, and <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> to symbolize the city's continued pursuit of the plan's architectural vision.|$|E
5|$|Instrument {{builders}} developed {{other features}} that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with solo stops {{emerged in the}} early fifteenth century. These stops <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time. Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used mutes to properly blend into chamber music.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{characters}} from other games <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> {{to have some of}} their moves changed or removed in order to balance them with KOF's new characters. However, designers focused in adjusting the imbalance of certain characters without removing any move. In the end, creators of the series noted that the Art of Fighting characters were the strongest ones in the game. Nevertheless, other characters such as Terry and Andy Bogard became the ones who got the designers' utmost attention and were given new moves.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S. Marine Corps units) {{landed on}} Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The {{landings}} {{on the islands}} <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> to deny their use by the Japanese as bases to threaten supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and secure the islands as launching points for a campaign with an eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.|$|E

60|$|All such phrases {{as these}} must appear {{of course to}} {{overstate}} the case. Pip {{is a much more}} delightful person than Nicholas Nickleby. Or to take a stronger case for the purpose of our argument, Pip is a much more delightful person than Sydney Carton. Still the fact remains. Most of Nicholas Nickleby's personal actions <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> to show that he is heroic. Most of Pip's actions <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> to show that he is not heroic. The study of Sydney Carton <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to indicate that with all his vices Sydney Carton was a hero. The study of Pip <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> to indicate that with all his virtues Pip was a snob. The motive of the literary explanation is different. Pip and Pendennis <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> to show how circumstances can corrupt men. Sam Weller and Hercules <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> to show how heroes can subdue circumstances.|$|R

5|$|On one occasion, the Cable Junction Island set, {{which was}} built on a barge, broke loose from its {{anchorage}} {{and had to be}} rescued. Szwarc was contacted one night and told that his island was drifting towards Cuba. Real hammerhead sharks circled the teen actors during the filming of one shot. Because the characters they were playing <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> to be in distress, the crew (filming from a distance) did not realize that the actors were genuinely calling for help.|$|E
5|$|Rituals {{in honor}} of Osiris are another major source of information. Some of these texts are found {{on the walls of}} temples that date from the New Kingdom, the Ptolemaic era (323–30 BCE), or the Roman era (30 BCE to the fourth century AD). Some of these late ritual texts, in which Isis and Nephthys lament their brother's death, were adapted into funerary texts. In these texts, the goddesses' pleas <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> to rouse Osiris—and thus the {{deceased}} person—to live again.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} being fired, Savage apologized {{on his radio}} program and on his website.

5|$|The three {{actors were}} given martial arts {{training}} ahead of filming. From August 1980, they were tutored by Kiyoshi Yamazaki, a karate black belt and master swordsman, who drilled them in sword-fighting styles that <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> {{to make them}} look proficient in using their weapons. They practiced each move in a fight at least 15times before filming. Yamazaki advised Leonard on the choreography of the sword fights and had a cameo role as one of Conan's instructors.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Hassett's men {{were assigned to}} play a further six first-class matches against the state teams. The fixtures <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> to revive cricket and were also used as a lead-up to the international tour to New Zealand in March 1946. Miller started his campaign with 80 against Western Australia. He finally returned to Melbourne in January, before taking on Victoria. Miller top-scored in both innings with 37 and 59 in an innings defeat.|$|E

5|$|A {{supporter}} of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-Romanian Alliance (part of the Little Entente), Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of appeasement evident in those countries' signing of the Locarno Treaties. Piłsudski therefore aimed also to maintain {{good relations with the}} Soviet Union and Germany; hence Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The two treaties <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbors.|$|E
5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and Amy Hennig {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The voice actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, and also performed the motion capture work for their characters. Many of the characters <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> to highlight different aspects of Drake's personality. Reception to {{the characters in the}} series have been fairly positive, with most commentators focusing on the believable nature of the characters and their interactions with each other. The inclusion of strong female characters has also received praise, though one commentator pointed out that the women still fall into cliché roles. The voice acting has also received acclaim, including two Interactive Achievement Award nominations.|$|E
