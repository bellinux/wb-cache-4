At least twenty unmarked and eight marked graves are at the site; Nancy Lincoln is buried next to Nancy Rusher Brooner, a neighbor who died a week earlier than she from milk sickness. [...] Henry Brooner, Nancy Brooner's son and best childhood friend of Abraham Lincoln later recalled, [...] "I remember very distinctly that when Mrs. Lincoln's grave was filled, my father, Peter Brooner, extended his hand to Thomas Lincoln and said, 'We are brothers now', meaning that they were brothers {{in the same kind of}} sorrow. [...] The bodies of my mother and Mrs. Lincoln were conveyed to their graves on sleds." [...] Her aunt and uncle, also her childhood caregivers, Elizabeth (Hanks) and Thomas Sparrow are buried nearby.

2500|$|The DIA art {{collection}} is valued in billions of dollars, up to $8.5 billion {{according to a}} 2014 estimate. After city's bankruptcy filing July 18, 2013, creditors targeted {{a part of the}} museum's collection that had been paid for with city funds as a potential source of revenue. [...] State-appointed emergency manager Kevin Orr hired Christie's Auction House to appraise the collection. [...] After months of determining the fair market value of the portion of the art that was purchased with city funds, Christie's released a report December 19, 2013, saying that the collection of nearly 2,800 pieces of the then city-owned artwork, was worth $454 million to $867 million, with one masterpiece by Van Gogh worth up to $150 million. To prevent possible sale of the works, museum proponents developed <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>named</b> the grand bargain. [...] Under the plan, which was eventually approved, the museum would raise $100 million for its portion, nine private foundations pledged $330 million, and the state of Michigan would contribute $350 million for a total of $820 million in order to guarantee municipal workers' pensions. In return, the city of Detroit would transfer its portion of the collection and the building to the non-profit entity that already operates the museum. This plan was challenged by other creditors, who claimed that it treated them unfairly and requested to conduct their own appraisal of the museum collection. Some creditors came forward with offers from other parties to buy the artworks for sums higher than Christie's appraisal. On May 13, 2014, Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr asked Detroit automakers to add $195 million to make the grand bargain stronger. The eventual settlement did not require the DIA to sell any art.|$|E

50|$|The area {{encompassed}} by Pauw's holdings on Bergen Neck likely {{included the}} eight miles (13 km) of shore line {{on each of}} the Hudson and Hackensack Rivers from Bergen Point to today's Bergen County line. His agent set up a small factorij and ferry slip at Arresick on the tidal island that stills bears his anglicized name, Paulus Hook. He operated an intermittent ferry and traded with the local Lenape population. By 1630 a plantation worked by African slaves <b>had</b> <b>been</b> set up. Pauw, however, failed to fulfill the condition of establishing a community of at least 50 permanent settlers and was required to re-sell his speculative acquisition back to the company. They commissioned construction of a homestead at Gemoenepaen for their representative Jan Evertsen Bout during 1633. During 1634 a homestead was built at Ahasimus for Cornelis Hendriksen Van Vorst (Voorst), whose later descendents would play a prominent {{role in the development of}} Jersey City. Abraham Isaacsen Verplanck received a land patent for Paulus Hook on May 1, 1638. A small farm went up at Kewan Punt. The leasehold of Aert Van Putten at Hobuk (Hoboken) was the site of North America's first brewery. Another patroonship was established farther up the river at Vriessendael. Although the settlements were small, they were strategic in that they were a foothold on the west bank of <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>named</b> the North River across from New Amsterdam and were important trading-posts for the settlers and indigenous people, who dealt in valuable beaver pelts, and they were early attempts at populating the newly claimed territory.|$|R

They are usually a few hundred meters across and 8 metres deep, with a flat base and steep sides. They tend to have similar bean-like shapes with a cusp pointing towards the south pole. The angle of the sun probably contributes to their roundness.

50|$|Besides {{observations}} of the SPCZ and movement in its position, there have been modelling studies as well. Widlansky et al. (2012) used a number of climate models of differing complexity to simulate rainfall bands in the southwest Pacific {{and see how the}} magnitude and areal extent was affected by the SPCZ and ENSO. During El Niño or warm-phase conditions, the SPCZ typically shifted northeastward with dryer conditions on islands to the southwest, in agreement with observations. Conversely, a southwestward shift in rainfall accompanied La Niña or cold-phase events in the simulations. Widlanksy et al. (2012) argued the sea surface temperature biases in models created uncertainty in the rainfall projections and produce <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>named</b> “the double ITCZ problem”. The impact of sea surface temperature bias was further investigated by using uncoupled atmospheric models with prescribed sea surface temperatures, and those 3 models each with differing complexity showed less severe double ITCZ bias than the ensemble of coupled models.|$|E
