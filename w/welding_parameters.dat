50|$|It is very {{difficult}} to achieve the highest standards of quality and safety using manual welding. This is due to certain welding positions, overhead and down-hand welds for example, often leading to faulty welds due to restricted access the user has in these welding positions. In order to have complete control over the weld pool, a perfect balance must be maintained between gravitational force and surface tension at every position of the torch.By using mechanised variants of the technique, certain parts of the welding process are handled by mechanical components. Note that a welder will always be monitoring and controlling the process. In an ideal situation, all <b>welding</b> <b>parameters</b> would be fully programmed before welding is started.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} data {{based on the results}} of a previous study into the path independence of friction stir welding (FSW). The original study was conducted in two phases using AA 2024 and AA 2198 aluminum alloy material. In Phase I, welds were made with six different tool designs, and tensile data was entered into Statgraphics® software as part of a design of experiments (DOE) approach for the purpose of optimizing the <b>weld</b> <b>parameter</b> process windows for each tool design. Phase II included a round robin study where welds were produced at four sites to evaluate site-to-site variability. In the present study, testing of the welds included additional tensile testing, full-field microhardness testing, and conductivity testing of the welds produced in the prior two phases of the program. The welds were inspected for defects, and the method of failure on the tensile specimens is discussed. Tensile data was evaluated statistically using Statgraphics® software. Previously, as part of Phase I, that data was evaluated using the techniques of chapter nine of the Metallic Materials Properties Development and Standardization (MMPDS), and design allowables were calculated at that time. In the present study, Phase II data was compared using the design allowables from Phase I. Variability was not found to be significant when evaluated according to location of the tensile coupon along the weld joint line or as a function of <b>weld</b> <b>parameters</b> in the process window. Although site-to-site variability was significant, it was low, with the highest variation for each material being 2 to 5. 5 ksi. No significant outliers were identified. There is evidence that the friction stir welding process is path-independent and that a defect-free weld is uniform in tensile strength from beginning to end. There is also evidence that a DOE approach can be used to optimize the <b>weld</b> <b>parameter</b> process window for any tool in order to identify a range of <b>weld</b> <b>parameters</b> where a defect-free weld can be produced...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Solid state joining of {{titanium}} via {{friction stir welding}} and {{diffusion bonding}} have emerged as enablers of efficient monolithic structural designs by the eliminations fasteners for the aerospace industry. As design complexity and service demands increase, the need for joints of dissimilar alloys has emerged. Complex thermomechanical conditions in friction stir weld joints and high temperature deformation behavior differences between alloys used in dissimilar joints {{gives rise to a}} highly variable flow pattern within a stir zone. Experiments performed welding Ti- 6 Al- 4 V to β 21 S show that mechanical intermixing of the two alloys is the primary mechanism for the generation of the localized chemistry and microstructure, the magnitude of which can be directly related to pin rotation and travel speed <b>weld</b> <b>parameters.</b> Mechanical mixing of the two alloys is heavily influenced by strain rate softening phenomena, and can be used to manipulate weld nugget structure by switching which alloy is subjected to the advancing side of the pin. Turbulent mixing of a weld nugget and a significant reduction in defects and weld forces are observed when the β 21 S is put on the advancing side of the weld where higher strain rates are present. Chemical diffusion driven by the heat of <b>weld</b> <b>parameters</b> is characterized using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and is shown to be a secondary process responsible for generating short-range chemical gradients that lead to a gradient of alpha particle structures. Diffusion calculations are inconsistent with an assumption of steady-state diffusion and show that material interfaces in the weld nugget evolve through the break-down of turbulent interface features generated by material flows. A high degree of recrystallization is seen throughout the welds, with unique, hybrid chemistry grains that are generated at material interfaces in the weld nugget that help to unify the crystal structure of dissimilar alloys. The degree of recrystallization is tied to the localized thermal profile in the weld nugget as well as the heating rates of a given set of <b>weld</b> <b>parameters.</b> Slow kinetics of alpha dissolution relative to the heating rate and process times of friction stir welding suggest an alpha-particle assisted super-transus recrystallization process contributes to a refined grain size in <b>weld</b> <b>parameters</b> utilizing high travel speed...|$|R
