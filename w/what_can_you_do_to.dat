Must I go hungry for you--starveling, robber! A miserable little boy alone and lost in the forest, naked, all {{scratched}} and bleeding with thorns, with no courage in his heart, no strength in his hands! Look at me! I am not weak, but strong and black and fierce; I live here--this is my home; I fear nothing; I am like a serpent, and like brass and tempered steel--nothing can bruise or break me: my teeth are like fine daggers; when I strike them into the flesh of any creature I never loose my hold till I have sucked out all the blood in his heart.

One would think that when you went down to the shore in the morning, you would say, [...] "Oh, God! without whose help I am no stronger than a piece of sea-weed floating up and down, take care of me! Take care of my wife and my children; and forgive me my sins, and do not punish me by calling me away this night to answer for them all!"

At the 2006 ACL Conference, a panel of librarians (Patty Agee, Tony Garrett, and Carol Reid) looked at two {{essential}} elements of the requirements to see how our libraries measured up. Our areas were the library’s relationships with the faculty (essential element number seven) and with the information technology personnel on our campuses (number eleven). After examining the new Library Guidelines for ABHE Colleges and Universities, which are posted on the ACL website as a member benefit under the Bible College section link, we graded ourselves {{and talked about the}} supporting evidence that we could present to a visiting team.

A natural initial thought is that you could engage in Intentionally Biased Inquiry: you could look into whether p, but do so in a way that you expect to {{predominantly}} yield evidence in favour of p. This paper hopes to do two things. The first is to argue that this initial thought is mistaken: intentionally biased inquiry is impossible. The second is to show that reflections on intentionally biased inquiry strongly support a controversial ‘access’ principle which states that, for all p, if p is (not) part of our evidence, then that p is (not) part of our evidence is itself part of our evidence...|$|E

Some of the high-lighted programs (such as a virtual chemistry lab) have pushed the boundaries {{of what can be}} ac-complished with multimedia technology. By the end of this interactive session, participants (who can range from novices to experts) should be able to identify computer-based training applica-tions that effectively use multimedia technology, generate examples of where new media tech-nology can be appropriately used to virtually teach hands-on skills, and decide where to incorpo-rate the strategies shown into their computer-based training productions...|$|E
