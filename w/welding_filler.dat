5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of <b>welding</b> <b>filler</b> metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} strain partitioning in HSLA- 65 joints, welded with three types of weld filler: 6011 undermatched <b>weld</b> <b>filler,</b> 7018 matched <b>weld</b> <b>filler,</b> and 9016 overmatched <b>weld</b> <b>filler.</b> Strain measurements were made using a three-dimensional digital image correlation system while specimens were tested on a displacement controlled servo-hydraulic test frame. Crosshead displacement rates ranged from 0. 056 mm/s to almost 56 Coupons were cut from flux-core arc welded HSLA- 65 plates to characterize the base metal, <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> materials, and mismatched welds. Constitutive material properties could be extracted reliably for all coupons at the lowest displacement rate and showed that, as expected, all <b>weld</b> <b>fillers</b> had similar elastic modulus values but different yield strengths.

Analysis of the mismatched coupons found that the failure location was a function of <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> and was independent of strain rate. Higher magnification imaging of the weld nugget showed that strain partitioning occurred within the weld zone, with slightly lower strains in the cap pass as opposed to the root pass. 9 2011 Author.

Welding residual stress measurements were carried out by X-ray diffraction technique.

40|$|Abstract. Weld {{residual}} stresses often approach, or exceed, the yield {{strength of the}} material, with serious implications for the integrity of engineering structures. It is not always feasible to measure {{residual stresses}}, so integrity assessments often rely heavily on numerical models. In ferritic steels, the credibility of such models depends {{on their ability to}} account for solid-state phase transformations that can have a controlling effect on the final residual stress state. Furthermore, a better understanding of weld transformations provides an opportunity to engineer the weld stress state and microstructure for improved life. In this paper the complementary merits of synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction are exploited both to verify and refine weld models and to inspire the development of <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> metals to control weld stresses. In terms of <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> metal design, X-ray diffraction is used to characterize phase transformations in real time during realistic weld cooling cycles, for understanding small-scale behaviour, and identifying features that need to be incorporated into finite-element models. Meanwhile, neutron diffraction is used to elucidate the practical consequences of solid-state phase transformations on the macroscopic scale, thereby providing crucial validatory structural integrity data...|$|R

Creep properties of 9 Cr heat resistant steels can be improved by the addition of boron and nitrogen to produce martensitic boron-nitrogen strengthened steels (MarBN). The joining of this material is a crucial consideration in the material design since welds can introduce relatively weak points in the structural material. In the present study, creep tests of a number of MarBN <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> metals have been carried out to determine the effect of chemistry on the creep life of weld metal. The creep life of the weld metals was analysed, and the evolution of creep damage was investigated. Significant differences in the rupture life during creep have been observed as a function of boron, nitrogen and molybdenum concentrations in the weld consumable composition. Although the creep lives differed, the particle size and number in the failed creep tested specimens were similar, which indicates that there is a possible critical point for MarBN <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> metal creep failure...|$|R
