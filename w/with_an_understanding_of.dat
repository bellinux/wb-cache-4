5|$|The {{distinction}} between {{external and internal}} environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration {{of cause and effect}} between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or holocoenotic system as it was once called. This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.|$|E

Traditional medicine refers to the use of knowledge of the use of locally grown plants coupled <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the language and culture of local villages. Modern medicine refers to the use of drugs that are regulated and produced to a high standard. Through combining these two types of medicine, natural medicine seeks to develop a new culturally appropriate and cost effective health service.|$|E
500|$|The case of North Carolina v. Butler [...] {{showed that}} a waiver of Miranda rights may be implied through [...] "the defendant's silence, coupled <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> his rights and a course of conduct {{indicating}} waiver". The court held that where a Miranda warning had been given and was understood by the accused, an accused's uncoerced statement established an implied waiver {{of the right to}} remain silent. Thompkins answer to the police question, having understood but not chosen to invoke his rights, was sufficient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver. Further corroboration was that he had sporadically made other comments as well.|$|E
500|$|Wills {{struck his}} contemporaries as {{peculiar}} {{and at times}} narcissistic, with a prickly temperament, but also kind, charismatic and companionable. Often embroiled in controversy, he seemed to lack {{an understanding of how}} his words and actions could repeatedly get him into trouble. His obsession with sport was such that he showed little interest in anything else. Through his research, journalist Martin Flanagan concluded that Wills was [...] "utterly bereft of insight into himself", and football historian Gillian Hibbins described Wills as [...] "an overbearing and undisciplined young man who tended to blame others for his troubles and was more interested in winning a game than in respecting sporting rules." [...] Wills' family and peers, though angered by his misbehaviour, frequently forgave him. It is unlikely that he sought popular favour, but his strong egalitarian streak helped solidify his folk hero status. This affection for him, coupled <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> his waywardness, found expression in the public motto: [...] "With all thy faults I love thee still, Tommy Wills".|$|E

500|$|Nuclear {{physicists}} {{knew about}} fission, {{but not the}} hydrodynamics of conventional explosions. As a result, there were two additions to the team that made significant contributions {{in this area of}} physics. First was James Tuck whose field of expertise was in shaped charges used in anti tank weapons for armour piercing. In terms of the plutonium bomb the scientists at Los Alamos were trying to wrestle with the idea of the implosion issue. Tuck was sent to Los Alamos in April 1944 and used a radical concept of explosive lensing which was then put into place. Tuck also designed the Urchin initiator for the bomb working closely with Seth Neddermeyer. This work was crucial {{to the success of the}} plutonium atomic bomb: Italian-American scientist Bruno Rossi later stated that without Tuck's work the plutonium bomb could not have exploded in August 1945. The other was Sir Geoffrey Taylor, an important consultant who arrived a month later to also work on the issue. Taylor's presence was desired so much at Los Alamos, Chadwick informed London, [...] "that anything short of kidnapping would be justified". He was sent, and provided crucial insights into the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The acute need for scientists <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> explosives also led Chadwick to obtain the release of William Penney from the Admiralty, and William Marley from the Road Research Laboratory. Peierls and Fuchs worked on the hydrodynamics of the explosive lenses. Bethe considered Fuchs [...] "one of the most valuable men in my division" [...] and [...] "one of the best theoretical physicists we had." ...|$|E

The Congregation for Catholic Education has characterized the situation as follows: [...] "The history of theology shows that an understanding of the mystery of the Virgin contributes to a more profound understanding of the mystery of Christ, of the Church and of the vocation of man." [...] Referring to this, Cardinal Raymond Burke stated that the promotion of a fuller knowledge of the Virgin Mary is the [...] "constant work of the Church".|$|E

2500|$|The 2004 {{volume of}} essays, Scopul și mijloacele ("The Purpose and the Means") is largely an {{expansion}} of Noaptea totalitară. It was followed in 2006 by a collection of his press articles, carrying the title Democrație și memorie ("Democracy and Memory"), which centers on admiring portraits: those of thinkers, politicians or activists whom he credits with having provided him <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> political phenomenons—Raymond Aron, Robert Conquest, Arthur Koestler, Jacek Kuroń, Czesław Miłosz, Susan Sontag, Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev—and those of Cold War figures such as US President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. The book also included his earlier calls to have the Securitate archives, then managed by the Romanian Intelligence Service, opened for the public, {{in the belief that}} liberal democracy has transparency as its prerequisite. Other segments of the book voiced calls for a public debate on the moral legacy of communism, and for the assumption of the [...] "democratic ethos" [...] by regular Romanians.|$|E
2500|$|Business Engineering {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and change management. Engineering management or [...] "Management engineering" [...] is a specialized field of management concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector. [...] The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> engineering), {{has resulted in the}} development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop industrial engineering skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking. [...] Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of industrial and organizational psychology principles and methods. [...] Professional engineers often train as certified management consultants in the very specialized field of management consulting applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector. [...] This work often deals with large scale complex business transformation or Business process management initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical & electronics, power distribution & generation, utilities and transportation systems. [...] This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Rhodesian ridgeback's {{bird hunting}} prowess {{has been well}} known {{throughout}} the breed's history (the original description from the South African parent club belabors this point in fact), {{it is important to}} note that the [...] "gundog" [...] classification made in 1920s Southern Rhodesia and South Africa was not specifically about bird hunting. To understand this it is necessary to understand the union's classification system at that time. The two likely categories Barnes could have chosen from within the SAKU classification system at that time were, [...] "sporting" [...] and [...] "gundog". In the [...] "sporting" [...] group were the sighthounds and scenthounds. In the [...] "gundog" [...] group were the birddogs. This raises the question why Barnes rejected the group containing the sighthounds and scenthounds, and successfully lobbied in favor of the group containing the birddogs. Barnes' reasoning becomes clear <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the distinction between the two groups. The union's [...] "sporting" [...] dogs were those that would find game above ground, and were then expected to dispatch the game without assistance. The union's [...] "gundogs" [...] were those that find game above ground, and the human hunter was then expected to dispatch the game by means of a firearm. Within this context, the Rhodesian ridgebackwhich was clearly expected to hold the lion at bay for the hunter, not to attempt to dispatch the lion unassisted by the gunplacement in the union’s gundog group becomes the logical choice within that system as it existed at that time.|$|E

60|$|He {{proposed}} amusements to her; he felt expert now in proposing amusements; {{and he had}} thus, {{for several}} days, an odd sense of leading her about Paris, of driving her in the Bois, of showing her the penny steamboats--those from which the breeze of the Seine was to be best enjoyed--that might have belonged to a kindly uncle doing the honours of the capital to an Intelligent niece from the country. He found means even {{to take her to}} shops she didn't know, or that she pretended she didn't; while she, on her side, was, like the country maiden, all passive modest and grateful--going in fact so far as to emulate rusticity in occasional fatigues and bewilderments. Strether described these vague proceedings to himself, described them even to her, as a happy interlude; the sign of which was that the companions said for the time no further word about the matter they had talked of to satiety. He proclaimed satiety at the outset, and she quickly took the hint; as docile both in this and in everything else as the intelligent obedient niece. He told her as yet nothing of his late adventure--for as an adventure it now ranked with him; he pushed the whole business temporarily aside and found his interest in the fact of her beautiful assent. She left questions unasked--she who for so long had been all questions; she gave herself up to him <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> which mere mute gentleness might have seemed the sufficient expression. She knew his sense of his situation had taken still another step--of that he was quite aware; but she conveyed that, whatever had thus happened for him, it was thrown into the shade by what was happening for herself. This--though it mightn't to a detached spirit have seemed much--was the major interest, and she met it with a new directness of response, measuring it from hour to hour with her grave hush of acceptance. Touched as he had so often been by her before, he was, for his part too, touched afresh; all the more that though he could be duly aware of the principle of his own mood he couldn't be equally so of the principle of hers. He knew, that is, in a manner--knew roughly and resignedly--what he himself was hatching; whereas he had to take the chance of what he called to himself Maria's calculations. It was all he needed that she liked him enough for what they were doing, and even should they do a good deal more would still like him enough for that; the essential freshness of a relation so simple was a cool bath to the soreness produced by other relations. These others appeared to him now horribly complex; they bristled with fine points, points all unimaginable beforehand, points that pricked and drew blood; a fact that gave to an hour with his present friend on a bateau-mouche, or in the afternoon shade of the Champs Elysees, something of the innocent pleasure of handling rounded ivory. His relation with Chad personally--from the moment he had got his point of view--had been of the simplest; yet this also struck him as bristling, after a third and a fourth blank day had passed. It was as if at last however his care for such indications had dropped; there came a fifth blank day and he ceased to enquire or to heed.|$|E
