50|$|Since its creation, Reprographics has {{undergone}} some stylistic changes, {{moving away from}} the high-contrast blurs and monotone colors that had marked the early comics and progressing to more colorful surroundings, sharper images and more varied adventures. There has also been a shift from self-contained one-shot strips http://www.chrisyates.net/reprographics/index.php?page=168, to a format that also allows for longer story arcs http://www.chrisyates.net/reprographics/index.php?page=173. Since the Reprographics universe has grown, it is possible to have entire strips without Chris in them, allowing the readers to see <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> happen the other characters on a day-to-day basis http://www.chrisyates.net/reprographics/index.php?page=206.

50|$|Radin is {{well known}} for {{developing}} the concept of market-inalienability, a term she coined to refer to <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> should not be traded in markets. Her book, Contested Commodities, explores what kinds of market trades and resulting commodification should be disallowed or curtailed. Radin is also known for re-examining the basis of freedom of choice that is basic to freedom of contract and how it is (or is not) reflected in contemporary law. Her book, Boilerplate, focuses on what types of alleged agreements between a firm and consumers should not be enforceable contracts, or at least not presumed enforceable without further investigation, and suggests other ways that standardization could be treated. Radin travels frequently to lecture and participate in workshops and seminars on these topics.|$|E

50|$|Placebos and placebo {{effects have}} {{generated}} years of conceptual confusion about <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> they are. Example definitions of a placebo may refer to their inertness or pharmacological inactivity {{in relation to}} the condition they are given for. Similarly, example definitions of placebo effects may refer to the subjectivity or the non-specificity of those effects. These type of definition suggest the view that when given a placebo treatment, one may merely feel better while not being ‘really’ better.|$|R

This expansion specifically addressed gender specific titles on books such as The Beautiful Girl's Colouring Book and The Brilliant Boys Colouring Book and the limitations in which these titles impose upon children. As Katy Guest stated in an article for the Independent in March 2014, after Let Books Be Books launched, [...] "What we are doing by pigeon-holing children is badly letting them down. And books, above all things, {{should be available to}} any child who is interested in them."

50|$|As {{detailed}} in his preface, the {{main sources of}} this work were that of historically confessed witches, judicial case history and the Bible itself, although he also amassed various dissertations on magical studies to expand his education on the relationships between infernal spirits and men. James generally sought {{to prove that the}} devilish arts have always been yet still are, but also explains the justification of a witch trial and the punishments which a practitioner of the dark arts merits. He also reasons scholastically <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> are possible in the performance of these arts, and the natural causes of the Devil's power with the use of philosophical reasoning. King James sought to prove the existence of witchcraft to other Christians through biblical teachings. As such, his work is separated into three books based on the different arguments the philosophers discuss, with citations of biblical scripture throughout the text.|$|E
5000|$|As {{ethnography}} developed, anthropologists {{grew more}} interested in less tangible aspects of culture, such as values, worldview and what Clifford Geertz termed the [...] "ethos" [...] of the culture. In his fieldwork, Geertz used elements of a phenomenological approach, tracing not just the doings of people, but the cultural elements themselves. For example, if within a group of people, winking was a communicative gesture, he sought to first determine <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> a wink might mean (it might mean several things). Then, he sought to determine in what contexts winks were used, and whether, as one moved about a region, winks remained meaningful in the same way. In this way, cultural boundaries of communication could be explored, as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence. Geertz, while still following something of a traditional ethnographic outline, moved outside that outline to talk about [...] "webs" [...] instead of [...] "outlines" [...] of culture.|$|E

40|$|Fallibilism, {{the thesis}} that no belief can be known for certain, has become a popular view in epistemology. The {{certainty}} of our perceptions, inductions, faculties of reason, and even self-knowledge are regularly challenged. On this view, most of epistemology then deals with knowledge that is probably fallible. However, knowledge of our own primitive feelings may avert the likely fallibility of other sources of knowledge. In this paper I argue that primitive feelings are an infallible source of knowledge {{even in the face}} of the strongest fallibilist challenges, by exploring <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that, if believed, must be true. I address the matter first by determining <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that, if they are true, we must be justified in believing if and when we believe them. Next I determine what can be believed only if true. Then I show that primitive feeling fulfills both of these. Finally, since primitive feelings do fulfill these requirements, I show that if the feelings are believed then necessarily they are also known for certain. Then I address challenges that pose issues for self-knowledge and explain how they do not create real problems for primitive feelings even if they do for other kinds of self-knowledge. Through this process, I refine into a tightly understandable category what constitutes these sorts of feelings that, if believable, are also infallibly knowable. From there we can come to know for certain some things about the world we exist in...|$|E

The next step is to propagate this knowledge into case frames and logic forms for use in the system. In the process we are discovering gaps in the ontology and adding concepts to it. The difficulties involved in doing this by hand led us to investigate automatic approaches. We describe algorithms for machine learning of case frames and also for clustering the frame information to obtain an ontology...|$|E
