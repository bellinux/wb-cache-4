5|$|After their {{marriage}} Chandrakumar takes Divya to Delhi, but she cannot accept him {{as her husband}} and ignores him. When he asks her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like as a wedding gift, she asks him for a divorce. Startled, Chandrakumar asks her why; in a flashback, Divya remembers {{when she was in}} love with Manohar, whom she met as a college student. Manohar and his gang assault and rob the son of Thamizhmani, an MP. Divya reports Manohar to the police, and he is arrested. She later learns that Thamizhmani's son had run over a girl with his car, and Manohar stole the money to pay for the girl's medical treatment. Divya feels guilty, and bails him out.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Day {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sabrina took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends {{let her know that}} he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{performed}} a few ceremonial functions {{for the remainder}} of Wilson's term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries. Among these was Albert I, King of the Belgians, the first European monarch to visit the United States. Edward, Prince of Wales, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him. First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government by reviewing all of Wilson's communications and deciding what he would be presented with and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> delegate to others. The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration's opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country return to war without an act of Congress. Marshall personally supported the treaty's adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States' sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.|$|E

What if we could read <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wrote home to her Mum and Dad and her best friend?

25|$|Octavia Estelle Butler {{was born}} on June 22, 1947, in Pasadena, California, {{the only child of}} Octavia Margaret Guy, a housemaid, and Laurice James Butler, a shoeshine man. Butler's father died when she was seven, so Octavia was raised by her mother and {{maternal}} grandmother in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> later recall as a strict Baptist environment.|$|E
25|$|Charlie asks Sarah <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do if Leslie {{went away}} {{and did not}} come back. Nancy becomes angry at him for asking. Sarah is upset by the {{question}} and {{wants to go back}} to the sea. Leslie hits and chokes Charlie for making Sarah cry. Leslie and Sarah decide to go back. Nancy tells them to stay because eventually they will have to come back. Nancy, and to some degree Charlie, offer their help. Leslie accepts their offer.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1997, Krause's {{stepdaughter}} got married. All of the Bulls assistant coaches and their wives were invited to the wedding, as was Tim Floyd, then the head coach at Iowa State, whom Krause was openly courting as Jackson's successor (and who would eventually succeed Jackson). Jackson and his then wife, June, were not even told of the wedding, much less invited, only finding out about the event when the wife of Cartwright, who by that time had become a Bulls assistant, asked June <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be wearing to the reception.|$|E
25|$|The {{career of}} writer-producer Fred Barron began in 1975 {{when he used}} the history of Cambridge’s The Real Paper {{as the basis for}} a screenplay, Between the Lines. When Joan Micklin Silver brought Hester Street (1975) to the Welles Cinema, she was joined at the Welles Restaurant by Barron and others. When someone asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> direct next, she {{answered}} that she was looking at screenplays. Barron stood up, left the restaurant and returned with his screenplay. The success of Between the Lines (1977) led to a short-lived television series, also titled Between the Lines.|$|E
25|$|Leslie acts {{most often}} on instinct, like an animal. When birds and jets fly overhead, he runs {{to find an}} escape route. Leslie is very {{protective}} of Sarah. When Charlie hurts Sarah—asking her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do if Leslie left and never came back—Leslie attacks him. After hitting him, Leslie nearly chokes him until the females intercede. After the incident, Leslie decides that he and Sarah will {{go back into the}} sea, to escape this threat. When Nancy tells him that they will have to come back eventually and offers them help, it is Leslie who accepts this fate.|$|E

25|$|The lizards' {{communication}} is somewhat {{similar to their}} human counterparts. Like Nancy, Sarah is more open to the humans and more interested in their world. She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question that is {{hard for her to}} understand (<b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards most everything they say with skepticism. Despite these problems, {{at the end of the}} play, some measure of trust is reached between all of them. Leslie decides that he and Sarah will stay on land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, offer to help them.|$|E
25|$|Though Sarah is more deferential than Nancy, {{she does}} assert herself to Leslie when an {{experience}} is important. For example, she insists on accompanying Leslie when {{he approaches the}} humans in act II after they have taken their submissive pose. Sarah wants to see everything for herself. Most of the new things she encounters intrigue her: the handshakes; Nancy's breasts; human gestation; and the birds flying above them, among other things. But she is also fearful. The jets frighten her, as does Charlie when he asks her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do if Leslie went away and never came back. Like Leslie, Sarah does not grasp many human concepts like emotions and nonaquatic animals, though she tries.|$|E
25|$|At that time, the men's {{basketball}} team at Indiana was coached by future Hall of Fame coach Bobby Knight. While Knight {{was not a}} direct influence on VanDerveer's choice of school, {{he may have been}} had an indirect effect. The Indiana women's coach, Bea Gorton, patterned her style of play and practices after Knight, and it was the observation of the style of play at the AIAW event that persuaded her to choose Indiana. The effect would become more direct. Because Gorton designed her practices based upon what she observed from Knight, VanDerveer started attending Knight's practices to see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be doing later that day in practice. VanDerveer carried what she learned from Knight to her practices at Stanford.|$|E

50|$|Roxy spoke {{too quickly}} during their presentation, cutting off Stephanie's line completely.

500|$|Casting {{of the new}} {{characters}} for series 1 {{was announced}} on 25 November 2009. Open auditions were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East, followed by recalls until the possible actors were reduced to eight and then four. Yorke {{described it as a}} [...] "painful process" [...] and they had difficulty finding someone to play Zsa Zsa Carter. Emer Kenny was cast in the role whilst writing the second episode. Yorke said [...] "She was so good that we suddenly went, 'It's her! Kenny said, [...] "I'm really thrilled to have been given the opportunity to both write for and act in a show connected with such an iconic drama as EastEnders. Kids these days use their laptops more than their televisions, so it's really exciting {{to be a part of}} a project that's taking drama online and connecting with these viewers." [...] To prepare for the role, Kenny had to disguise her [...] "posh" [...] accent, saying that when the director asked her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do about her voice, she travelled around the East End to listen to the way people spoke.|$|E
500|$|Directly {{influenced}} by musical theatre, Ashman strongly believed that The Little Mermaid {{would benefit from}} an [...] "I Want" [...] song, a musical number during which the main character sings about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to accomplish {{by the end of}} her story. Directors and writers Ron Clements and John Musker originally asked Ashman to write a song for Ariel in which she expresses her romantic feelings for Prince Eric, but Ashman felt that a song that details the character's fascination with the human world instead would better serve the film's plot. Ashman recruited Benson, a stage actress with whom he had first worked on the Broadway musical Smile (1986), to record [...] "Part of Your World", and worked closely with her to ensure that she delivered a desirable performance. Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg initially ordered that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] be removed from the final film due to concerns that the ballad would bore young children. However, Ashman, Clements, Musker and animator Glen Keane ultimately convinced Katzenberg that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is essential to the film's narrative, and the song was spared after audiences appeared to enjoy it during a subsequent test screening.|$|E
500|$|Gather Together, {{like much}} of African-American literature, depicts Rita's search for self-discovery, identity, and dignity in the {{difficult}} environment of racism, and how she, like other African Americans, were able to rise above it. [...] Rita's search is expressed both outwardly, through her material needs, and inwardly, through love and family relationships. [...] In Caged Bird, despite trauma and parental rejection, Rita's world is relatively secure, but the adolescent young woman in Gather Together experiences the dissolution of her relationships many times. The loneliness that ensues for her is [...] "a loneliness that becomes, at times, suicidal and contributes to her unanchored self". Rita is unsure of who she is or <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> become, so she tries several roles in a restless and frustrated way, as adolescents often do {{during this period of}} their lives. Her experimentation was part of her self-education that would successfully bring her into maturity and adulthood. Lupton agrees, stating that Rita survived through trial and error while defining herself as a Black woman. Angelou recognizes that the mistakes she depicts are part of [...] "the fumblings of youth and to be forgiven as such", but young Rita insists that she take responsibility for herself and her child.|$|E
50|$|After {{reading the}} Old Testament book of Isaiah, Heche became {{convinced}} that change was possible for her daughter, and likened <b>what</b> <b>she</b> believed <b>would</b> be their eventual reconciliation to {{the parable of the}} Prodigal Son.|$|R

500|$|American {{producers}} Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Penelope Magnet, known {{collectively as}} RedZone Entertainment, presented Spears {{with the third}} song they had written and produced, [...] "Pop Culture Whore". While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song [...] "sucked". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to [...] "get in her world", as Magnet explained, {{it was easier to}} [...] "actually write and know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> and wouldn't say, to know where her real vibe is". Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of the song; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics. American producer The-Dream became involved after Stewart proposed him to work together on the track for Spears. He explained, [...] "I was just getting into the business. I'm in Atlanta, driving home in a '92 Cadillac, and I get the call [...] I hung up and just screamed out joyous sounds." [...] During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio's air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears [...] "didn't complain or anything, and for me that shows she's where she is for a reason." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} election, with lost prestige, a divided party, {{and with her}} {{campaign}} resources partly drained by the primary fight, Romney was behind incumbent Democrat Hart from the beginning. [...] Romney issued position papers and emphasized the themes of dealing with crime and social permissiveness; she also advocated a national healthcare plan and increased attention to environmental damage caused by industry. She never made any personal attacks against Hart. [...] The only woman running for the U.S. Senate that year, she was a tireless campaigner, traveling around the state in a chartered Cessna and making as many as twelve stops a day. [...] Nevertheless, the perception grew {{that she did not}} have any vision for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do as a senator and was only in the race because she was George Romney's wife. [...] In response, she said at one point, [...] "I'm not a stand-in or a substitute for anyone". Her campaign material continued to just refer to [...] "Lenore". [...] She also was negatively impacted, in both the primary and general election, by fallout from her husband's effort as HUD Secretary to enforce housing integration in Warren, Michigan. Consistently far ahead in polls, Hart staged a low-key campaign with few public appearances; he mostly ignored her and sometimes acted condescendingly towards her in private.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> want in the video. She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which he always does with me until I get my point across. ... and then we met up and we got both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E
