500|$|By {{the end of}} 1886, Lloyd {{was playing}} several halls a night and earned £100 per week. She was now able to afford new songs from {{established}} music hall composers and writers, including [...] "Harry's a Soldier", [...] "She Has a Sailor for a Lover", [...] and [...] "Oh Jeremiah, Don't you Go to Sea". By 1887, Lloyd began to display a skill for ad lib, and [...] to gain a reputation for her impromptu performances. It was during this period that she first sang [...] "Whacky-Wack" [...] and [...] "When you Wink the Other Eye", a song which introduced her famous <b>wink</b> <b>at</b> the audience. Unlike her West End audiences who enjoyed her coarse humour, her [...] "blue" [...] performances did not impress audiences in the East End.|$|E

2500|$|The series utilises several {{techniques}} {{from the}} stage and theatre and converting them to the screen. [...] The series frequently breaks the fourth wall (purposely...and, usually, at least once per episode), as well as employing other stylised, cinematic devices such as cutaway scenes shot in a different style {{from the rest of}} the show. For example, in several episodes characters appear to [...] "stop time", interacting with other actors that remain frozen in place, while key members of the cast announce their intentions to us (the audience) or further develop their [...] "con" [...] between themselves and other characters by discussing plans with either each other—or even themselves; while certain members freeze in place, others of the cast are free to move around the set and drink other peoples drinks and pilfer other peoples pockets and the like. [...] This technique serves many purposes—chiefly of which is a stylistic approach to theater, but it can also be said that it is used here as a metaphor for how the main characters of this drama can manipulate their environment at will—as opposed to average individuals who, most of the time, remain oblivious to what is going on around them. Examples of this can be seen in the pilot episode ("The Con Is On"), the first episode of the second series ("Gold Mine") and the second episode of the fourth series ("Signing Up to Wealth"). Other fourth-wall-breaking moments are more subtle – a character might smile directly at the camera as the con begins to take shape, or an actor may make an editorial comment to the viewers, or they might even <b>wink</b> <b>at</b> us...as if we are in on it with them, or they are letting us in on a secret. Some episodes insert fantasy sequences – scenes shot like a Bollywood musical or a silent movie, for example, all well-known cinematic style choices used to elicit emotions or mood from the audience in just a few steps that might, otherwise, take up pages of dialogue in order to accomplish.|$|E
