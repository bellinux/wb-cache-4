6000|$|Not {{a muscle}} of the man's frame moved, and yet his large heart beat fast in his deep chest. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to tell him? Was {{irremediable}} mischief done? ...|$|E
6000|$|Gyp, who {{was sitting}} at her bureau, seemed to be adding up the counterfoils in her cheque-book. She did not turn round, and Fiorsen paused. How <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to receive him? ...|$|E
60|$|He went beside her, {{his soul}} clenched, his body unsatisfied. <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> {{to make this}} easy triumph over him? For him, there was now no self-bliss, only pain and {{confused}} anger.|$|E
5000|$|As her parents, we {{know how}} <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> <b>She's</b> not hard on herself; she's just always looking to get better. We go to the games now and we’re excited. Like, ‘What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to do?’ That's the fun part of it: What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to do? Horace Pugh, father ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it might}} have that effect," [...] Nat replied with an {{answering}} smile. [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> through the water now, quarter-master?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Amy, what <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to do?" [...] asked Mrs. March, well {{pleased at}} Laurie's {{decision}} {{and the energy}} with which he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|She said: [...] "Poor face!" [...] then {{covered her}} own. <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to cry, and torture him still more? But, instead, she only murmured: [...] "But you HAVE reached me!" [...] swayed towards him, {{and put her}} lips to his.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tis {{certain that}} Amy {{had no more}} {{business}} at Greenwich than I had, nor <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> thither; but we were all hampered to the last degree with the impertinence of this creature; and, in particular, I was horribly perplexed with it.|$|E
60|$|And now whither <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going?</b> Like the poor, dead leaf of the song, she was wastrel, {{torn from}} the parent bough, homeless, friendless, having {{turned against the}} one hand which, in this great time of peril, had been {{extended}} to her in kindness and in love.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so {{very glad}} to hear it," [...] said Vogelstein, who decidedly, for his career, had promise. [...] "And <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to marry him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Heaven above! Why {{did you not}} deep those cursed sugar-tongs out of [...] her sight? How <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to {{get through}} it if you frighten her [...] like this? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{told me you}} {{had been}} very kind in helping her. I daresay I should have heard more, if I had not fallen asleep. What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me go--let me go!' {{she only}} repeated, with her high, quavering, distracted note; {{and as he}} moved a little she got the door open. But he {{followed}} her out: would she see him that night? Where <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going?</b> might he not go with her? would she see him to-morrow? ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{approached}} her, I {{happened to}} be putting on my gloves. She stopped me; and, taking my right arm, lifted my hand toward her face. <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to kiss it? or to bite it? Neither. She smelt it like a dog--and dropped it again with a hoarse chuckling laugh.|$|E
60|$|Ursula's heart sank. Everybody {{seemed so}} cocksure and so bossy. How <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> {{to get on}} with such jolty, jerky, bossy people? And Miss Harby had not spoken a word to the man at the table. She simply ignored him. Ursula felt the callous crude rudeness between the two teachers.|$|E
6000|$|FATHER. [...] What! <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going!</b> [...] Well God {{forgive her}} then! {{if she has}} dealt [...] In the black art. I'll tell my dame of it, [...] And she shall send her something.|$|R
6000|$|KNOX. Who {{wants to}} turn her out? But <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to ruin us? To let {{everybody}} know of her disgrace and shame? To tear me down from the position Ive made for myself and you by forty years hard struggling? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Has {{she come}} to sit upon Quilp's knee,' said the dwarf, {{in what he}} {{meant to be a}} {{soothing}} tone, 'or <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to bed in her own little room inside here? Which is poor Nelly going to do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|With {{these words}} {{she lifted her}} eyes and looked him {{straight}} in the face. There seemed a certain pride and nobility in her {{he had not seen}} before, though her beautiful brown eyes were troubled, and there was a mark of pain on her brow. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to tell him? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{deposited}} {{our young}} {{friend on the}} floor. She took her doll, and {{stood for a moment}} deep in thought. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to do next? We were not kept long in suspense. She suddenly put her little hot fat hand into mine, and tried to pull me after her out of the room.|$|E
60|$|Had she no curiosity? <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to let pass what Auguste had hinted? Lifting up her skirts, {{she swung}} round and faced me. In her eyes was a calmness more {{baffling}} than the light I had seen there but a moment since. How to begin I knew not, and yet I was launched.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{certain that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> {{to drive to}} Seattle. <b>She</b> wasn't <b>going</b> to drive anywhere! <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to freight the car back to Minneapolis, and herself go back by train--Pullman!--drawing-room! ...|$|R
50|$|Mrs. Ridley She {{went to the}} Ranch, and <b>was</b> told <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on a {{business}} trip instead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Conyers {{is coming}} in to see you. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to {{establish}} herself here, and O'Moore and I <b>are</b> moving out. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going,</b> for the present, to be head nurse." ...|$|R
60|$|Where <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to? She {{was going}} to a place called Roxham; here it was written on the ticket. She {{was going to}} be {{companion}} to a dear young lady, very rich, like all the English, whom she had met when she had travelled with her French family to Jersey, a Miss Lee.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pounce {{presented}} herself superbly {{dressed in}} walking costume. <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> out; or had she just {{returned to the}} inn? Not a word escaped her; she waited gravely {{to hear what the}} gentlemen wanted. Cosway, presuming on his position as favorite, produced the contents of the two pocketbooks and revealed the melancholy truth.|$|E
6000|$|By this time, Elina was {{thoroughly}} frightened. <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> mad? she asked herself, or had some evil spirit taken up his abode within her? What made her spin and twirl about like this--irresponsibly, unintentionally, irrepressibly, meaninglessly? Oh, what would her mother say, {{if only she}} knew all? And what on earth would Cyril Waring think of her? ...|$|E
40|$|On a startlingly bright autumn {{night in}} 2006, Harper Regan {{walked away from}} her home, her husband and daughter, and kept walking. She told nobody that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> <b>She</b> told nobody where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> <b>She</b> put {{everything}} she ever built at risk. For two lost days and nights, until {{it looked as though}} her entire life might unravel, she didn't turn back. From Uxbridge to Stockport to Manchester and back again, Harper Regan navigates the UK, exploring family, love and delusion. It received its world premiere at the National Theatre, London, in 2008...|$|R
6000|$|... "We want to {{know how}} she feels about to-night; what report she makes of her nerves, her anticipations; how she looked, what she had on, up to six o'clock. Gracious! if I could see her I should know what I wanted, and so would she, I guess!" [...] Mr. Pardon exclaimed. [...] "You must know something, Mrs. Luna; it isn't natural you shouldn't. I won't inquire any further where <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> because that might seem a little pushing, if she does wish to {{withdraw}} herself--though I am bound to say I think she makes a mistake; we could work up these last hours for her! But can't you tell me any little personal items--the sort of thing the people like? What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to have for supper? or <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to speak--a--without previous nourishment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{particular}} reason! Why, the Antelope is a privateer; and if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> {{to cruise}} about, {{that means that}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to fight, and he may get shot." ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> {{to fulfill}} her {{deliberate}} intention? She {{began to be}} afraid of herself, and to find out a certain difficulty in doing as she liked. Already her assertion of independence in evading his advances had been carried farther than was necessary, and she was thinking with some anxiety what she might do on the next occasion.|$|E
60|$|And {{they were}} gloomy enough. Where <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going?</b> How long <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> for? What was she {{to do when}} there? On all these points she was {{absolutely}} ignorant. What was the object of this sudden flight from London? Her guardian could have separated her from the Dimsdales in many less elaborate ways than this. Could it be that he intended some system of pressure and terrorism by which she {{should be forced to}} accept Ezra as a suitor. She clenched her little white teeth as she thought of it, and registered a vow that nothing in this world would ever bring her to give in upon that point. There was only one bright spot in her outlook. When she reached her destination she would at once write to Mrs. Dimsdale, tell her where she was, and ask her frankly for an explanation of their sudden silence. How much wiser if she had done so before. Only a foolish pride had withheld her from it.|$|E
6000|$|She {{said nothing}} to him, only just smiled. And the look of {{knowledge}} in her eyes seemed, for the moment, to be contained in another look: a look of faith, and at last happiness. Aaron's heart stood still. No, in her moment's mood of faith and at last peace, life-trust, he was perhaps more terrified of her than in her previous sinister elegance. His spirit started and shrank. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to ask of him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know that; but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not <b>going</b> {{to break}} down. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to drag out the engagement, {{in the hope}} of making me relent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, that {{is where}} we are going; at least, Constance <b>is.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to work at her {{painting}} while I pay a round of visits. Wont you come with us?" ...|$|R
60|$|The Queen {{appeared}} before her Army {{dressed in an}} imposing uniform of green, covered with gold braid. She wore a green soldier-cap with a purple plume in it and looked so royal and dignified that everyone in Oogaboo except the Army <b>was</b> glad <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> The Army <b>was</b> sorry <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> alone.|$|R
