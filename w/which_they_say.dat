5|$|There are two {{longitudinal}} {{coordinate systems}} in use for Vesta, with prime meridians separated by 150°. The IAU established a coordinate system in 1997 based on Hubble photos, {{with the prime}} meridian running {{through the center of}} Olbers Regio, a dark feature 200km across. When Dawn arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10°, so that the IAU coordinate system drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0.06° per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4° from the center of Claudia, a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles. All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which is unacceptable to the IAU. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150° to coincide with Olbers Regio. It was accepted by the IAU, though it disrupts the maps prepared by the Dawn team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.|$|E

25|$|Opponents of the FMA {{argue that}} it would violate the states' rights to {{regulate}} marriage by federalizing the issue, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> {{should be left to}} the states. Many have used the federalism argument, including Senator John Kerry, Senator John McCain, and Representative Ron Paul, who opposes the FMA for several reasons, one of which that regulating marriage is not a proper role of the federal government. Constitutionally defining marriage would not only remove the states' choice, but it would reverse the choices already made in some states and territories, i.e., Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Iowa, and the District of Columbia.|$|E
25|$|In their book, The Fourth Turning, however, Strauss and Howe {{say that}} the precise {{boundaries}} of generations and turnings are erratic. The generational rhythm is not like certain simple, inorganic cycles in physics or astronomy, where time and periodicity can be predicted to the second. Instead, it resembles the complex, organic cycles of biology, where basic intervals endure but precise timing is difficult to predict. Strauss and Howe compare the saecular rhythm to the four seasons, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> similarly occur in the same order, but with slightly varying timing. Just as winter may come sooner or later, and {{be more or less}} severe in any given year, {{the same is true of}} a Fourth Turning in any given saeculum.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the release}} of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Midna's {{inclusion}} as a playable character was a popular suggestion amongst fans. In an article detailing the top ten most-wanted characters for Brawl, IGN editors Phil Pirrello and Richard George ranked Midna third, citing her controlling personality and shadow-based powers, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> would add some much-needed unconventional gameplay to the Super Smash Bros. series. Midna was also featured in two of IGN's Smash It Up editorials; first as the Reader's Choice and later amongst other dual characters. Both of these were written by Lucas M. Thomas, who also praised the character for her potential as a quality Super Smash Bros. fighter. In response to their top ten most-wanted characters list, a group of Midna fans began sending many emails to IGN, causing members of the IGN Stars staff to create an article mentioning their forum {{as well as their}} cause to have Midna appear in more video games.|$|E
25|$|Mehmet Osman was conceptualised by {{the creators}} of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mehmet, the brother of {{original}} character Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), {{was part of a}} well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the East End of London. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location. For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had {{been at the forefront of}} the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their social contacts to relay information about their own origins and lifestyles, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> allowed them to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals′ {{attempt to}} honor the Montreal-Washington franchise′s entire history in the Ring of Honor, {{as well as by}} {{tracking}} Montreal-Washington franchise records, is not without controversy. Although Nationals fans generally take little interest in the franchise′s Montreal years, some do appreciate acknowledging that the franchise has a history that predates its arrival in Washington, and former Expo Tim Raines received a warm round of applause from fans at Nationals Park at his induction ceremony on August 28, 2017, even though he had never even visited Washington, D.C., before, let alone played baseball there. Some Montreal Expos fans express appreciation that the Nationals are honoring the Expos, and Expos players inducted into the Ring of Honor have expressed gratitude that the Nationals chose to include them, especially with no MLB team in Montreal {{to honor the}}ir careers. However, few Nationals fans have taken an interest in franchise records, preferring to compare Nationals records with those of previous Washington MLB teams instead, and a segment of Nationals fans actively opposes the inclusion of Expos history into that of the Nationals, taking the view that the Montreal years are irrelevant to Washington and that the team made a complete break with its past and started anew when it arrived in Washington, inheriting the history of the two Washington Senators teams rather than that of the Expos. Similarly, Montreal Expos fans have taken little or no interest in the achievements of Nationals players, and some Expos fans strongly oppose the inclusion of former Expos in the Ring, taking the position that to do so is to co-opt the history of the Expos, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> belongs solely in Montreal.|$|E

500|$|The {{identity}} of the Astronomicas authorwho is neither quoted nor mentioned by any ancient writeris uncertain, but his name was probably Marcus Manilius. Over the years Marcus Manilius has been confused with Manilius Antiochus (fl.c.100BC, mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia); Flavius Manlius Theodorus (fl.c.AD376409, a consul in AD399) and Boëthius (the sixth-century Roman senator and author of De consolatione philosophiae, whose full name was Anicius Manlius Severinus Boëthius). Although the poem suggests that the writer was a citizen and resident of Rome, some have contended that Manilius was a non-Roman; according to Katharina Volk, a Latinist who specializes in Manilius, this belief is generally based on either [...] "the poet's supposedly inferior Latinity" [...] or [...] "the wish to see Manilius as the member of a Greek intellectual milieu at Rome". The 19th-century classicist Fridericus Jacobs and the 19th- and 20th-century historian Paul Monceaux have argued {{that he was an}} African, based largely on his writing style, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> resembles that of other African authors. Volk counters this view, arguing that Manilius writes [...] "from ... a conventional Roman perspective" [...] and [...] "takes recourse to Roman history to illustrate the astrological facts he discusses".|$|E
500|$|Kiran Bedi {{and large}} number of people on social media like Facebook and Twitter protested against the IAS officer's suspension. Several serving and retired IAS {{officers}} like former Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) N. Vittal, former cabinet secretaries T. S. R. Subramanian and Naresh Chandra, and former Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai came out in support of Nagpal, calling her actions bold and courageous, and asked the Chief Secretary to revoke her suspension. The All India IAS Association, a national body of IAS officers, termed the government's actions [...] "wrong" [...] and believes that Nagpal was suspended due to her stringent actions which hurt the sand-mafia. It has demanded immediate revocation of her suspension, and called the incident [...] "demoralising" [...] for young IAS officers. The collective voicing of these concerns by the state's IAS officers was deemed unusual and surprised the ruling Samajwadi Party. Senior officers have attributed this backlash to the general feeling of discontentment in the officer cadre, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> is due to increasing political interference in public administration. On 1 August, in a rare act, thousands of IAS officers filed a petition to the Department of personnel and training, demanding intervention by the Central government to direct the UP government to revoke Durga's suspension.|$|E
