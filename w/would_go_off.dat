5|$|On August 9, {{the same}} day ETA claimed {{responsibility}} for the July 30 attack, four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma. The bombs, which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from ETA. At 11:16 am local time, a man speaking on behalf of ETA called the firefighters of Calvià, warning that three bombs <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> in Palma. Half an hour later, another person also speaking on behalf of ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode. Finally, another warning call was mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of the bombs.|$|E
25|$|It was at {{this time}} that CTC ceased 24-hour {{broadcasting}} after only two years. CTC's branding no longer matched Network Ten, so rather than confuse Capital Television viewers with Channel 10 after midnight, the station <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> air around 1am.|$|E
25|$|Rogers was an idol {{for many}} {{children}} through his films and television shows. Most of his postwar films were in Trucolor during {{an era when}} almost all other B westerns were black and white. Some of his movies would segue into animal adventures, in which Rogers's horse, Trigger, <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> on his own for a while with the camera following him.|$|E

25|$|In {{some parts}} of China, dances are held for {{young men and women}} to find partners. For example, young women are {{encouraged}} to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd, and the young man who catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance. In Daguang, in northeast Guizhou Province, young {{men and women of the}} Dong people would make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> to a quiet place to open their hearts to each other.|$|E
25|$|In {{an abrupt}} reversal, on May 28, 1975, WHFV {{suddenly}} notified the FCC {{it was out}} of money and <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> the air the next day. The station, having waited as long as it could for FCC approval of the sale, blamed inaction on Release the World's part. The FCC agreed, stating that Release the World had been notified that it failed to submit complete financial information in its application to transfer control. The FCC placed the application on hold and did not take any action while it awaited completed information. (Potential transferees must prove they have enough cash on hand to acquire the station and run it for one year.) The FCC set an original deadline of May 22 to complete the application, after which it would close and eventually be dismissed. Release the World negotiated an extension to May 29.|$|E
25|$|Around 20:00, German ships {{received}} {{a message from}} the Naval Staff, that a large British fleet was operating off the Belgian coast and that another large force had been sighted off Norway on 23 April. This suggested that the British Fleet was still divided, giving rise to optimism that the operation <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> as planned, despite the mining of Seydlitz. At 21:30, another message indicated that British patrol boats off the Belgian coast were heading back to harbour, which was interpreted as confirmation that British submarines had reported the German movements. By 24 April the northern British ships had returned to harbour for coaling and were unaware of the moves. The ships off the Flanders coast included 12additional destroyers from the Harwich Force, which had been sent to assist with a barrage of the coast.|$|E

25|$|During development, it {{was found}} that the rifle was not only solidly {{designed}} and well engineered, but it was also capable of firing 18 to 19 aimed shots a minute when used as a single loader – faster than the standard Remington M1867's 13 aimed shots per minute. When used as a magazine loader, {{it was found}} that 11 shots – ten in the magazine and one in the chamber – could be fired in 25 seconds. Tests carried out during the evaluation also indicated that the rifle was more accurate than the Remington M1867, although both weapons were firing the same ammunition from identical barrels. The rifle was also found to be extremely rugged – one of the tests carried out consisted of throwing the rifle repeatedly from a height of 4 meters (12ft) towards a rocky surface in order to see if any of the rounds in the magazine <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off.</b> Even modern firearms would be damaged by this treatment, but the Krag–Petersson survived it with only superficial damage to the woodwork.|$|E
500|$|According to {{producer}} Nigel Wright, {{the lead}} actors would first sing the numbers {{backed by a}} band and orchestra, [...] "then they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> with Alan and David in a more intimate recording environment and perfect their vocals". However, more trouble arose as Madonna was not comfortable with laying down a [...] "guide vocal" [...] simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; [...] "I'm used to writing my own songs and I go into a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't... To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment", she recalled.|$|E

During this period Stieglitz and O'Keeffe continued to live together, although she <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> on her own {{from time to time to}} create art. [...] Stieglitz used their times apart to concentrate on his photography and promotion of modern art.|$|E

2500|$|Audio: At {{one point}} Warhol carried a {{portable}} recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He {{referred to this}} device as his [...] "wife". Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his Invisible Sculpture, a presentation in which burglar alarms <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.|$|E
2500|$|Updike {{was born}} in Reading, Pennsylvania, {{the only child of}} Linda Grace (née Hoyer) and Wesley Russell Updike, and was raised in the nearby small town of Shillington. The family later moved to the unincorporated village of Plowville. His mother's {{attempts}} to become a published writer impressed the young Updike. [...] "One of my earliest memories", he later recalled, [...] "is of seeing her at her desk... I admired the writer's equipment, the typewriter eraser, the boxes of clean paper. [...] And I remember the brown envelopes that stories <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> in—and come back in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three {{phone calls}} were made warning {{of a bomb}} in Omagh, using the same {{codeword}} {{that had been used}} in the Real IRA's bomb attack in Banbridge two weeks earlier. At 14:32, a warning was telephoned to Ulster Television saying, [...] "There's a bomb, courthouse, Omagh, main street, 500lb, explosion 30 minutes." [...] One minute later, the office received a second warning saying, [...] "Martha Pope (which was the RIRA's code word), bomb, Omagh town, 15 minutes". The caller claimed the warning on behalf of [...] "Óglaigh na hÉireann". The next minute, the Coleraine office of the Samaritans received a call stating that a bomb <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> on [...] "main street" [...] about [...] from the courthouse. The recipients passed on the information to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).|$|E

2500|$|Herbert {{went up to}} New College, Oxford in 1910, {{to study}} law. He went down in 1914, having had several pieces of his light verse published, in Punch and elsewhere, and with the {{apparent}} intent of dabbling further in writing. In the summer of 1914 he was working at a mission in Bethnal Green; on the outbreak of war, like most of his contemporaries, he promptly joined the military. Unlike most University-educated men he did not become an officer – perhaps {{in response to the}} working-class men at the mission, who assumed that the [...] "Oxford blokes <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> and take commissions [...] so be all right". He joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, rather than the army – his brother Sidney, to whom he was close, was a naval officer, and he felt this might make it more likely to run into him.|$|E
2500|$|Wingate {{was known}} for various eccentricities. For instance, he often wore an alarm clock around his wrist, which <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> at times, and had raw onions and garlic on a string around his neck, which he would {{occasionally}} bite into as a snack (the reason he used to give for this was to ward off mosquitoes). He often went about without clothing. In Palestine, recruits were used to having him {{come out of the}} shower to give them orders, wearing nothing but a shower cap, and continuing to scrub himself with a shower brush. Lord Moran, Winston Churchill's personal physician, wrote in his diaries that [...] " [...] seemed to me hardly sane—in medical jargon a borderline case". Likewise, referring to Churchill's meeting with Wingate in Quebec, Max Hastings wrote that, [...] "Wingate proved a short-lived protegé: closer acquaintance caused Churchill to realise that he was too mad for high command".|$|E
2500|$|Following Alex & Amanda's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Words of Love" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests competed in heats; the men went first, and were {{followed}} by the women. The HouseGuests were asked questions about the various quotes hanging {{on the walls of}} the house. If a HouseGuest answered a question correctly, they would eliminate one HouseGuest from the competition; the man and woman who won each round would then face off in the final round, with the winner earning both them and their partner the title of Head of Household for the week. Joshuah & Sharon were the winners. Shortly following their win, Joshuah and Allison engaged in numerous verbal arguments due to Joshuah being mad at Allison for changing her vote last minute, as well as the lesbian lie she had told earlier in the game. Due to these arguments, Allison debated quitting the game, though was later convinced in the Diary Room to stay; she did, however, have a restraining order placed on Joshuah, and he was forbidden to be within five feet of her. On Day 22, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Big Aspara-Guess!" [...] food competition. For this competition, the men were required to guess the weight of their partners and then gather enough asparagus to weigh the same amount. If they got within ten pounds of their partner's weight, the HouseGuests won the two major food groups that couple represented. Later that day, Joshuah & Sharon chose to nominate Allison & Ryan and Matt & Natalie for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Adam & Sheila were selected to compete; James was selected to host. On Day 23, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Cupid is as Cupid Does" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, the couples were required to solve a puzzle by lifting the women into the air through a harness, while the men ran the puzzle pieces to them. Matt & Natalie were the winners of the Power of Veto. On Day 24, the HouseGuests learned that sometime in the coming weeks an alarm <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> in the house, and this meant that a twist would occur. On Day 25, Matt & Natalie chose to use the Power of Veto to remove themselves from the block, with Adam & Sheila being nominated in their place. On Day 28, Allison and Ryan were announced as the fourth couple to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of two to zero. Before they could exit the house, however, the alarm went off, and the HouseGuests learned that they were officially playing the game as individuals. The HouseGuests then learned that they would be voting to evict either Allison or Ryan from the house, rather than the both of them being evicted. Allison then became the first individual HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of six to zero.|$|E

Pressburger was a musician himself and had played the violin in an orchestra in Hungary.|$|R

2500|$|Sackville-West and Trefusis eloped {{several times}} from 1918 on, mostly to France. While there Sackville-West {{dressed as a}} man when they went out together. The affair ended badly. The mothers of both women, Lady Sackville and Mrs. Keppel, joined forces to {{sabotage}} the relationship and force both women back to their husbands. Both women were deeply interested in Spain, especially the Spanish Romany, with Trefusis writing to Sackville-West that they should go to Spain to show [...] "you my pupil, I as your cicerone...I will show eyes of black velvet...the sevillana, the fandango, undulating bodies, throbbing castanets". In another letter, Trefusis wrote of her wish to live forever in Spain with Sackville-West, [...] "a world of sun and love, and singing, and dancing". Trefusis sought to appeal to Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people by telling {{her that she was}} turning into a [...] "Gypsy", writing: [...] "They said, this evening after you gone, that you were like a dazzling Gypsy. A Gypsy potentate, a sovereign-what you will, but still a Gypsy". Trefusis and Sackville-West both used Romany phrases to express intensely held feelings such as man camelo tuti ("I can't live without you"), nonero jeli ("our love"), and sartute loude gayeres ("escape with you"). Both families were concerned that the women were creating scandal. In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Trefusis, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "I never ought to marry you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you {{for as long as you}} wanted me...I ought never to have married until I was thirty. I really think that is the best solution for people like me. Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young. It's a rotten and ridiculous system at present, it's simply cheating one of one's youth. It was all right for the Victorians. But this generation is disregarding, and next will have disregarded, the chrysalis." [...] At another point, Sackville-West wrote to Nicolson [...] "if wasn't for you, I <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> with V." [...] Trefusis continued to pursue Sackville-West to great lengths until Sackville-West's affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote in her diary that she was [...] "down on" [...] herself with [...] "serious thoughts" [...] of suicide as she believed that Nicolson [...] "would be happier without" [...] her in the world. [...] The two women apparently made a bond to remain faithful to one another, meaning that although both were married, neither could engage in sexual relations with her own husband. Sackville-West, who already had two children by Nicholson, was prompted to end the affair when she heard allegations that Trefusis had been involved sexually with her own husband, indicating that she had broken their bond. When she decided to end the affair with Trefusis, Sackville-West again contemplated suicide, writing in her diary that she [...] "hated myself to the extent of thinking I better vanish" [...] from the world forever. Despite the rift, the two women were devoted to one another, and deeply in love. They continued to have occasional liaisons for a number of years afterwards, but never rekindled the affair.|$|E
