25|$|The first Soviets {{to arrive}} at Cold Bay {{were members of the}} Soviet Purchasing Commission, who disembarked at the base on 23 March 1945. Maxwell {{believed}} that a great deal of classroom training would be necessary before the Soviet personnel began to train at sea, but the Soviet officers disagreed, preferring a greater emphasis on training at sea. They worked for a <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> training program that both sides could agree on, and achieved a successful compromise before the first trainees arrived.|$|E
25|$|Watson {{was born}} on 24 November 1966 in Gildersome, West Riding of Yorkshire. Although he had been singing {{since he was a}} child, he never sought a career as a {{professional}} singer. He attended Irlam Endowed Primary School and Irlam and Cadishead High School which he left with no GCEs. He then began earning £29.50 a <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Youth Opportunities Programme as a bolt-cutter in Irlam, near Manchester. Then married and with a baby, he began to earn extra cash singing Elvis Presley and other covers in North West clubs to help support his young family.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Seahawks took up 120 to 150 of 429-room Westin Hotel, also in Jersey City. The team retrofitted some rooms into training and massage rooms and occupied the pool. The City of Jersey City renamed its main boulevard, Columbus Drive, to Super Bowl Drive to welcome the teams.|$|E

25|$|Although German {{officials}} issued decrees {{that limited}} Jewish travel outside of Kamionka and required Jews {{to identify themselves}} by wearing armbands, Blaichman took a number of risks {{in order to help}} his parents and six brothers and sisters. He rode his bicycle from the neighboring farms and villages to Lubartów (six miles east) and Lublin (12 miles south) where he bought and sold goods such as honey, chickens, butters, grains, meat, tobacco, yarns, and sugar. Blaichman was able to travel among the population without being recognized as a Jew (he refused to wear the Star of David armband and traveled without the necessary permits). He was assigned to work two days a <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nearby estate with crops, but instead he paid someone to fill his place and continued to engage in underground trading.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 {{season was}} more of the same. Even though {{injuries}} {{and a lack of}} experience wrecked the team's depth for much of the season, New England still finished as the AFC East champions and the No. 2 seed. They opened the season 4–0 before losing to the Cincinnati Bengals 13–6 in Week 5. After a home win against the New Orleans Saints on Week 6, the Patriots fell to the rival Jets 30–27 on a converted Nick Folk field goal following an unsportsmanlike penalty to rookie Chris Jones. They rebounded with a pair of home wins against the Dolphins and the Pittsburgh Steelers, but lost 24–20 on Monday Night Football to the Carolina Panthers following the bye <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> controversial end-game interception by Luke Kuechly. They went on to finish with five wins in their last six games to clinch another division title and first round bye.|$|E
500|$|While Vollmer {{traditionally}} {{worked on}} multiple games at once, Close Castles {{was his only}} project when it was in production. In March 2015, he worked three days a <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bigger project with a small team, and saved his other days for personal experimentation and Threes bugs. The next month, Vollmer released Royals, a pay what you want simulation game for OS X and Windows. The player controls a peasant who advances towards royal status by collecting resources and followers. Every player decision counts as a year of the peasant's life. Polygon Megan Farokhmanesh described the game as difficult and charming, with a [...] "quirky, subtle humor". The game {{was designed to be}} [...] "purposefully difficult and obtuse" [...] and [...] "nothing like Threes". Eurogamer Jeffrey Matulef wrote that the gameplay was like a [...] "comically minimalist roguelike" [...] for its emphasis on resource management and short player lifespans.|$|E

500|$|In March 2016, the Los Angeles Times {{announced}} that the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre would close in the fall, during its thirty-fifth year of seasonal performances. Prior to {{the news of the}} closure, City of Irvine officials discussed continuing the expansion of a local apartment development, which would be built atop the site. Representatives working with Stefani announced on September 9, 2016, that she would be the final act to perform in the theater in an event called Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre Final Shows, before deconstruction of the facilities began. She spoke of its closure: [...] "I have so many memories at Irvine Meadows [...] It has been such an important part of my life both as an artist and as a fan and it will always hold a special place in my heart. I am humbled to perform there once again as it comes to a close." [...] In an interview earlier in the <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> California radio show, she expressed her devastation at the closure. It was the venue for her first live performance with her band No Doubt opening for Ziggy Marley in 1990.|$|E

2500|$|From {{its early}} {{days as a}} boom town, the {{population}} of Saguache has shrunk to around 500 residents. In its heyday, Saquache could boast of having [...] "the Colorado Hall (serving the purest wines and liquors), the Saguache Meat Market, a boarding house, a grocery, law firms, a hardware store, a hotel, a sawmill, and The Saguache Chronicle newspaper." [...] After several name changes, The Saguache Chronicle eventually became The Saguache Crescent. The paper is still printed every <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flatbed press built in 1915 with metal type cast on a Linotype composing machine.

[...] Though Iran was continuing to install thousands of additional centrifuges, these were based on an erratic and outdated design, both in its main enrichment plant at Natanz and in a smaller facility at Fordow buried deep underground. [...] "It appears that they are still struggling with the advanced centrifuges," [...] said Olli Heinonen, a former chief nuclear inspector for the Vienna-based U.N. agency, while nuclear expert Mark Fitzpatrick pointed out that Iran had been working on [...] "second-generation models for over ten years now and still can't put them into large-scale operation".

2500|$|Hitler's {{insistence on}} holding the exposed salient {{strongly}} limited the options of German field commanders. Once the Soviets had encircled the German forces, the German relief efforts produced mixed results. The {{effectiveness of the}} German counterattack was limited by Hitler's plan for splitting his strength to attempt a counter envelopment. The XLVII Panzer Corps' attacks were ineffective due to the weakness of its divisions. [...] Though the III Panzer Corps was far more effective, the corps wasted a <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> failed attempt to encircle the Soviet forces. When III Panzer Corps was finally given the mission of driving to relieve Gruppe Stemmermann, the Germans were unable to provide Bäke's heavy tank regiment with adequate fuel supplies, leading Bäke to stop the advance on Hill 239 because one group of his tanks {{had run out of}} fuel. This logistical failure was compounded by the vagueness of the radio message to General Stemmermann ordering the breakout attempt. Hill 239 remained under Soviet control, resulting in significant casualties among Stemmermann retreating force.|$|E
2500|$|D.C. United did {{bounce back}} the next <b>week</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> trip to Columbus.

United seemed the more likely side {{for much of the}} match in Columbus, but surrendered a goal to the Crew's scoring sensation, Ola Kamara, in the 63rd minute. [...] The D.C. team did catch a break 10 minutes later as Harrison Afful was shown a red card for a sliding challenge on Sarvas. That card was rescinded later by the Disciplinary Committee, but United was able to press the man advantage and gained a point when late substitute Fabian Espindola pounced on a loose ball and shot it past the reach of the Crew goalie. That thrilling moment proved to be the coda to Espindola's career with D.C. United as [...] "Fabi" [...] was traded the next week to the Vancouver Whitecaps in what amounted to a 3-way deal that saw former University of Maryland Terrapins star Patrick Mullins move from NYCFC to D.C. United, with the NYC side getting one of D.C.'s international roster slots. The acquisition of Mullins was one local fans had hoped for since the Hermann award winner left school.|$|E
