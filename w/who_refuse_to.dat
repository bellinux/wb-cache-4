When the blacksmith attacks Süß's coach with a sledgehammer, Süß has the blacksmith hanged on the grounds that an attack on the Duke's minister is tantamount to an attack on the Duke himself.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{spoke in}} front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. {{president}} to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progresses made in education, infrastructure, and economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly {{improve the quality of life}} for Africans. During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{realizes that}} he can make the girls winners only if he can help them {{overcome}} their differences. During his first few days as coach he benches several players <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> follow his rules—including Bindia Naik (Shilpa Shukla), his most experienced player. In response, Bindia repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at McDonald's. During the lunch, local boys make a pass at Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognizing that they are acting as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting {{one of the women}} from behind with a cricket bat, telling him that there are no cowards in hockey. In an about-face, after the fight the women ask Khan to remain as their coach.|$|E

The work was commissioned by The Diaspora Pavilion in Venice combines the sculptural work of Camp and the opera by Shirley J Thompson The Woman <b>Who</b> <b>Refused</b> <b>to</b> Dance travelling on a boat on the canals in Venice with a dance performance by Tania Dimbelolo, choreography by Monique Jonas. The opera The Woman <b>Who</b> <b>Refused</b> <b>To</b> Dance, is about an unknown woman on the slave boat of Captain Kimber in 1792 <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> dance and is beaten and hung for arbitration. Although the unknown woman dies, in Shirley J. Thompson's opera, her spirit rises. In this new filmed production, All The World Is Now Richer Meets The Woman <b>Who</b> <b>Refused</b> <b>to</b> Dance, her spirit rises and additionally reunites with her ancestors. The film brings the figures and their multiple references to history of slavery into echoing with the current migrant crisis. The film and sculptures are on display until 16 November 2017 {{as part of an}} exhibition at the Venice Biennial featuring the work of 19 artists...|$|R

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of the infallibility of ecumenical councils states that solemn definitions of ecumenical councils, approved by the Pope, which concern faith or morals, and to which the whole Church must adhere, are infallible. Such decrees are often labeled as canons, and they often have an attached anathema, a penalty of excommunication, against those <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> believe the teaching. The doctrine does not claim that every aspect of every ecumenical council is infallible.|$|E

25|$|A tax protester {{is someone}} who refuses to pay a tax {{claiming}} that the tax laws are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

25|$|The {{amendments}} also authorized {{individual states}} to outlaw union security clauses (such as the union shop) entirely in their jurisdictions by passing right-to-work laws. A right-to-work law, under Section 14B of Taft–Hartley, prevents unions from negotiating contracts or legally binding documents requiring companies to fire workers <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> join the union. Currently {{all of the}} states in the Deep South and a number of states in the Midwest, Great Plains, and Rocky Mountains regions have right-to-work laws (with six states—Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, and Oklahoma—going one step further and enshrining right-to-work laws in their states' constitutions).|$|E

Pashtun society is not homogenous by religion: the overwhelming majority of them are Sunni, with a tiny Shia community (the Turi and partially the Bangash tribe) in the Kurram and Orakzai agencies of FATA, Pakistan. Pakistani Jews and Afghan Jews, have largely relocated to Israel and the United States.|$|E

25|$|Investigations are {{conducted}} {{to gather information}} {{on the need for}} future legislation, to test the effectiveness of laws already passed, and to inquire into the qualifications and performance of members and officials of the other branches.

Witnesses <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> testify may be cited for contempt of Congress, and those who testify falsely may be charged with perjury. Most committee hearings {{are open to the public}} (the House and Senate intelligence committees are the exception); important hearings are widely reported in the mass media and transcripts published a few months afterwards. Congress, in the course of studying possible laws and investigating matters, generates an incredible amount of information in various forms, and can be described as a publisher. Indeed, it publishes House and Senate reports and maintains databases which are updated irregularly with publications in a variety of electronic formats.|$|E
25|$|The series proper commences {{almost twenty}} years later in the Two Rivers, a near-forgotten {{district}} of the country of Andor. An Aes Sedai, Moiraine, and her Warder Lan, arrive {{in the village of}} Emond's Field, secretly aware that servants of the Dark One are searching for a young man living in the area. Moiraine is unable to determine which of three youths (Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, or Perrin Aybara) is the Dragon Reborn, and leads all three of them from the Two Rivers, along with their friend Egwene al'Vere. Nynaeve al'Meara, the village wise-woman, later joins them. Gleeman Thom Merrilin also travels with the group. The first novel depicts their flight from various agents of the Shadow and their attempts to reach the Aes Sedai city of Tar Valon. Thereafter the protagonists are frequently split into different groups and pursue different missions toward the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. As they struggle to unite the various kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> lose their autonomy; by the zealots styling themselves 'the Children of the Light', who do not believe in the prophecies; and by the Seanchan, the descendants of a long-lost colony of Artur Hawkwing's empire.
