OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical characteristics of parotid gland tumors submitted to surgical treatment by the same surgeon. METHODS: Retrospective study with 154 patients who had parotid gland tumors. Clinical and histological data, type of surgery, and complications were assessed and described. RESULTS: <b>The</b> main manifestation <b>was</b> a mass with a median evolution of 12 months for benign tumors and five months for malignant tumors. Ultrasonography <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent complementary exam. Pleomorphic adenoma <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common of <b>the</b> benign tumors, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent malignant tumor.
