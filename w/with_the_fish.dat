5|$|In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as {{a result}} of {{overhunting}} in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the important arapaima (Arapaima gigas), also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and the urine and faeces of the caimans may have increased primary production by contributing plant nutrients. Thus the presence of the reptiles could have benefited the fish stock; the number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> population.|$|E
5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier the Fisheries {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant overturn at the ministerial level. In {{less than three years}} Dunderdale had appointed her fourth Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. Keith Hutchings became that fourth minister after his appointment on October 9, 2013. Following his appointment a representative <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fish,</b> Food and Allied Workers union said he hoped to see the minister stay in his portfolio {{for a longer period of}} time, as he was the seventh minister in the portfolio in ten years. Dunderdale's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman, who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier. Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election, when Darin King took over the portfolio. Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year. Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the overturn in ministers showed that there was no plan for the fishery.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish,</b> the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E
25|$|Other notable fish include Pinstripe Dambas, Mudskippers, {{tropical}} reef {{fish and}} various Lake Malawi cichlids. Invertebrates such as starfish, sea urchins and {{several species of}} coral and shrimps are housed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{patterns}} of spawning and {{movement of the}} juveniles differs between the eastern and western populations. In the western population, unlike many co-occurring sillaginids, stout whiting do not move inshore to spawn and the juveniles do not {{make their way to}} shallower waters; instead they spawn offshore, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> spending their entire lives in this environment. In contrast, the eastern population do use inshore nursery areas for the juveniles including bays and surf beaches, with this difference between populations attributed to increased competition between sillaginids by some authors. In both populations, spawning occurs over summer, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> spawning multiple times between December and March.|$|E

25|$|If the shoal {{becomes more}} tightly organised, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> {{synchronising}} their swimming so they all move {{at the same}} speed and in the same direction, then the fish may be said to be schooling. Schooling fish are usually of the same species and the same age/size. Fish schools move with the individual members precisely spaced from each other. The schools undertake complicated manoeuvres, as though the schools have minds of their own.|$|E

25|$|Yuuyaraq {{defined the}} correct way of {{thinking}} and speaking about all living things, especially the great sea and land mammals on which the Yup'ik relied for food, clothing, shelter, tools, kayaks, and other essentials. These great creatures were sensitive; they were believed able to understand human conversations, and they demanded and received respect. Yuuyaraq prescribed the correct method of hunting and fishing, and {{the correct way}} of handling all fish and game caught by the hunter in order to honor and appease the spirits and maintain a harmonious relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> and game. Although unwritten, this way {{can be compared to}} Mosaic law because it governed all aspects of a human being's life.|$|E
25|$|Age can be {{determined}} by counting growth rings in fish scales, otoliths, cross-sections of fin spines for species with thick spines such as triggerfish, or teeth for a few species. Each method has its merits and drawbacks. Fish scales are easiest to obtain, but may be unreliable if scales have fallen off of the fish and new ones grown in their places. Fin spines may be unreliable for the same reason, and most fish do not have spines of sufficient thickness for clear rings to be visible. Otoliths will have stayed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> throughout its life history, but obtaining them requires killing the fish. Also, otoliths often require more preparation before ageing can occur.|$|E

The construction of the locks profoundly reshaped the topography of Seattle and the surrounding area, lowering the water level of Lake Washington and Lake Union by , adding miles of new waterfront land, reversing the flow of rivers, and leaving piers in the eastern half of Salmon Bay high and dry. The Locks are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the American Society of Civil Engineers Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks.|$|E

25|$|Trap setters – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|E

This dish also often includes collard greens or turnip broccoli which are not crushed. Other fishery dishes include the Arroz de Sardinha (sardine rice), Caldeirada de Peixe (fish caldeirada), Lulas Recheadas à Poveiro (Poveiro stuffed squids), Arroz de Marisco (seafood rice) and Lagosta Suada (steamed lobster). Mussels, limpets, cockles and rock snails are cooked in the shell {{and served as a}} snack. Iscas, pataniscas and bolinhos de Bacalhau are boiled cod snacks and also popular.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, McDonald {{developed}} {{an interest in}} fish farming and became administrator of the Virginia state fish hatchery at Wytheville. He was appointed as the sole Fish Commissioner of Virginia shortly thereafter. It was during his tenure as the Fish Commissioner of Virginia that McDonald invented the fish ladder that was named for him. In 1877, McDonald was commissioned by Virginia to conduct a survey of mineral resources within the James River basin, the findings of which he reported to the Virginia General Assembly in 1879. McDonald continued to instruct at the Virginia Military Institute until 1879, when he was invited by his former professor Spencer Fullerton Baird to a position at the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries. McDonald accepted the position <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fish</b> Commission and submitted his resignation from the Virginia Fish Commission to Governor of Virginia, Fitzhugh Lee.|$|E
