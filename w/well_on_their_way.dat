5|$|Ultimately though, it was Heisuke Yanagawa's 10th Army which, on November 19, {{abruptly}} {{crossed the}} operation restriction line and began advancing on Nanking. In {{response to this}} flagrant act of insubordination, Matsui, it is claimed, made some effort to restrain Yanagawa, but he also insisted to the high command that marching on Nanking was the right course of action. On December 1 the Army General Staff finally came around and approved an operation against Nanking, though by then many of Japan's units in the field were already <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 June 1950, ten {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was unprepared for war. The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south. Most of South Korea's forces retreated {{in the face of}} the invasion. The North Koreans were <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to South Korea's capital of Seoul within hours, forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat farther south.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} ODI against South Africa at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua-Barbuda, West Indies {{appeared}} <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> {{to a second}} consecutive loss. 200–6 in the 41st over, well short of their winning target of 301, Sammy joined Dwayne Bravo at the crease. But six sixes and two fours later, {{it looked as though}} West Indies might just win. Sammy had amassed 58 runs, the fifty coming up off just twenty deliveries. It was the fastest fifty ever by a West Indies player, and more importantly, it had brought West Indies within reach of victory.|$|E
25|$|Thirty five {{first half}} points and 547 yards of total offense set the Razorbacks <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to their second win of the season, {{at the expense}} of the South Florida Bulls. Only a field goal with a minute left in the game kept the Razorbacks from having a shutout, which would have been their first in two years. Back-up quarterback Tarvaris Jackson led a 94-yard scoring drive of his own, after three scoring drives by Matt Jones. Jackson would {{eventually}} transfer from Arkansas to Alabama A after Matt Jones became the apparent starting quarterback. South Florida had eight consecutive wins, the second-longest win streak in the nation, coming into this contest.|$|E
25|$|In fact, it was Black {{who was the}} {{original}} target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' June 1, 1954 scouting trip to Richmond. Conducted by pitching coach Clyde Sukeforth, the mission's focus quickly shifted when he witnessed Clemente's throwing and batting prowess in pre-game drills. Nonetheless, Clemente barely played during Sukeforth's three-day visit. With his suspicions further aroused by manager Max Macon's dismissive remarks ("You mean you want him?!") {{and the fact that}} Clemente took batting practice with the pitchers rather than his fellow position players, Sukeforth made inquiries and soon ascertained Clemente's status as an unprotected bonus baby. Before leaving Richmond, he informed Macon that such subterfuge was pointless since the Pirates, <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to a fourth consecutive last-place finish, would thereby secure first pick in the winter draft.|$|E

In Margaret's tent, Frank is more than a little miffed to hear that She and Hawkeye got along quite well at the aid station and the Margaret [...] "has a headache". Klinger is upset that Radar already gave away nearly all of Klinger's dresses.|$|R
25|$|The Air Ministry still {{saw little}} {{immediate}} {{value in the}} effort (they regarded it as long-range research), and having no production facilities of its own, Power Jets entered into an agreement with steam turbine specialists British Thomson-Houston (BTH) to build an experimental engine facility at a BTH factory in Rugby, Warwickshire. Work progressed quickly, {{and by the end}} of the year 1936 the prototype detail design was finalised and parts for it were <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to being completed, all within the original £2,000 budget. However, by 1936, Germany had also started working on jet engines (Herbert A. Wagner at Junkers and Hans von Ohain at Heinkel) and, although they too had difficulty overcoming conservatism, the German Ministry of Aviation (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) was more supportive than their British counterpart.|$|E
25|$|Xavier Marshall with 82 and Daren Ganga with 99 – {{both with}} ODIs for West Indies – lifted West Indies A to 228 for 2, {{but there was}} little {{resistance}} after that, and Sajeewa Weerakoon could take six wickets with his left-arm spin. However, Jermaine Lawson and Tino Best put pressure on with good and lucky fast bowling, as only wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardene passed fifty runs. The touring team had a slender lead of 37, but batting with more composure the second time around, Ryan Ramdass and Carlton Baugh, who both made fifties, ensured that the visitors would have to chase 316. They were <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> – despite two wickets from Best early on, and Avishka Gunawardene retiring hurt – with 126 for 2 at stumps on day 3. And they would have fancied their chances with the hard-hitting Gunawardene at the crease, and the score 255 for 5. Then the wheels fell off – the last five wickets went for three runs, and the West Indians took the first of the three-game series.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the order}} to {{withdraw}} was given, the first priority was to hold the large bridgehead from Makhadet Hajlah to the line now held by infantry from the 60th (London) Division in front of Shunet Nimrin, {{and on to the}} Umm esh Shert until the withdrawal from Es Salt was completed. At 17:15 Hodgson ordered the withdrawal of his force. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade covered the first stage of the withdrawal to a rearguard position south-west of Es Salt, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade took up a position across the Umm esh Shert track south-west of Es Salt, and facing east piqueting the heights covering the Umm esh Shert track all the way down from the rearguard position to the Jordan Valley. Two hours after the last wounded and camels left, a force of 3,000 German and Ottoman infantry attacked the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at Es Salt. As the wounded were now <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> down to the valley, Chauvel, the commander of Desert Mounted Corps, ordered Hodgson to withdraw to a position south-west of Es Salt covering the Umm esh Shert track.|$|E
40|$|Mortality of {{amphibians}} {{on roads}} {{is a problem}} from an animal welfare and conservation perspective. We review methods to reduce road mortality of amphibians {{that have been used}} since the early 1970 s in European countries, mainly Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, and we discuss advantages and disadvantages of these methods. No method works best for all species and situations. Although most methods work <b>well</b> for anurans <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to breeding sites, they are substantially less efficient for juveniles and Triturus newts. Underpasses (“toad tunnels”) are a common technical solution to prevent amphibian road mortality. We present details on the construction of tunnels and associated barrier walls. We also suggest measures to evaluate the efficiency of tunnels and barrier walls. The prevention of road mortality is the first goal, but from a conservation perspective long-term population viability is the more important goal. We conclude by suggesting several areas for future research, namely the use of underpasses by juveniles and newts...|$|R

Both Union Pacific and BNSF have tracks that run through the valley. In addition, BNSF has an intermodal transfer facility in San Bernardino. The valley is also crossed by two major interstates and their auxiliaries. Additionally, the communities in the mountains north of the valley are served by several state highways. Mass transit trains and buses both serve the valley. Also, goods and people movement by air is available via two commercial international airports as well as several general aviation air fields. The Greater San Bernardino Area, along with the rest of the Inland Empire, is ranked by Forbes magazine as one of the American's unhealthiest commutes.|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, as {{more and}} more Japanese units {{continued}} to slip past the operation restriction line, Tada was also coming under pressure from within the Army General Staff. Many of Tada's colleagues and subordinates, including the powerful Chief of the General Staff Operations Division Sadamu Shimomura, had come around to Matsui's viewpoint and wanted Tada to approve an attack on Nanking. On November 24 Tada finally relented and abolished the operation restriction line [...] "owing to circumstances beyond our control", and then several days later he reluctantly approved the operation to capture Nanking. Tada flew to Shanghai in person on December 1 to deliver the order, though by then his own armies in the field were already <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to Nanking.|$|E

[...] In hopes of stemming the tide, the Progressive Conservative campaign team put together a series of ads attacking the Liberal leader. The second ad appeared to mock Chrétien's Bell's Palsy facial paralysis, and generated a severe backlash from the media, with some Tory candidates calling for the ad to be pulled from broadcasts. Campbell claims to have not been directly responsible for the ad, and to have ordered it off the air over her staff's objections.|$|E

2500|$|Lucky and Luke start a {{slow process}} of {{reconciling}} when Luke kidnaps Lucky to an abandoned cabin and Lucky watches Luke distressfully dream of the rape while suffering from a delirious fever following a wolf trap accident. Lucky's relationship with his mother becomes further strained in December 1998 when he and Nikolas are told that Stefan Cassadine (Nichols) is Nikolas's father, not the presumed-dead Stavros Cassadine, and Laura had kept the secret. Lucky and Nikolas begin to bond over the betrayal of their respective families. Lucky's estrangement with his parents adds to his newfound open-mindedness about Nikolas, as Jackson told Soap Opera Magazine: [...] "Lucky's been {{trying to change the}} way he looks at things, to not become Luke. That's part of the process – not having the same relationship with Nikolas that Luke has with Stefan. (...) He's trying to find his own Spencer." [...] The former enemies become friends, a sign of Lucky's growth of character. Actress Genie Francis (Laura) explained to Soap Opera Digest in April 1999: [...] "It's huge, absolutely huge. (It's) something that really seemed impossible, but Lucky surprises [...] with his big heart and his maturity." [...] In the same interview, Guza described the acceptance Lucky had come to have about his parents, recounting scenes where Lucky bonds with each.

2500|$|Mansa Suleyman died in 1360 and was {{succeeded by}} his son, Camba, who was quickly overthrown by {{a son of}} Maghan I.

However, Musa II, while a good emperor according to written records, was {{under the control of}} his sandaki (literally [...] "high counselor", often translated as vizier). This sandaki, named Mari Djata, had no relation to anyone in the Keita dynasty, but ran the empire as if he was. According to Ibn Khaldun, Sandaki Mari Djata even tossed Musa II in jail keep him out of the way. During this time, Mali’s eastern provinces were in open rebellion. Sandaki Mari Djata mobilized the army on a campaign to restore order. He oversaw the re-subjugation of the Tuareg occupying Takedda, an important copper mining center in the north. The vizier was not entirely successful and was unable to stop re-subjugate the Songhai who were <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to their own empire {{by the end of the}} 14th century. Attempts to re-conquer the Songhai were likely doomed due to the inhabitants being under Mandinka military influence for so long and being ruled by a dynasty that had its very roots in Mali’s imperial court. The Mali Empire also laid siege to the town of Tadmekka east of Gao but was unable to take the town or force its inhabitants back into submission. The overall success of the campaign appears mixed, but Mali's ability to retain Takedda shows it was far from total collapse.|$|E
