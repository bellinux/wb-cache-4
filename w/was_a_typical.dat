5|$|Some {{writers have}} {{explained}} the crucifixion darkness {{in terms of}} sunstorms, heavy cloud cover, {{the aftermath of a}} volcanic eruption, or a khamsin dust storm that tends to occur from March to May. A popular work of the nineteenth century described it as an 'oppressive gloom' and suggested this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> phenomenon related to earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century turnpikes {{arrived in}} the area and then in the 19th {{communications}} improved with the building of the Grand Western Canal, which reached the town in 1835, and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway. Wellington station was opened when the line reached the town on 1 May 1843. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> Brunel design but was rebuilt in 1932 when two loop lines were put in. This entailed the platforms being moved back to accommodate the widened lines. These platforms are clearly visible and a goods shed still stands {{on the east side of}} the line at the Taunton end of the station, although the station closed on 5 October 1964. Wellington was an important station as it stood at the foot of a steep incline. Banking locomotives were kept here, ready to assist heavy westbound trains up to Whiteball Tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In {{these years}} he {{recovered}} the manuscript {{that he and}} Thomas Young had worked in his youth from Young's widow, who was living in Albany, and began to develop it into the work that was published in 1785 as Reason: the Only Oracle of Man. The work <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> Allen polemic, but its target was religious, not political. Specifically targeted against Christianity, it was an unbridled attack against the Bible, established churches, and {{the powers of the}} priesthood. As a replacement for organized religion, he espoused a mixture of deism, Spinoza's naturalist views, and precursors of Transcendentalism, with man acting as a free agent within the natural world. While historians disagree over the exact authorship of the work, the writing contains clear indications of Allen's style.|$|E
5|$|Stanford {{wrote of}} Bennett: He {{maintained}} his British characteristics throughout his life...The English take {{a kind of}} pride in concealing their feelings and emotions, and this is reflected in their folk-song. The Thames has no rapids and no falls; it winds along under its woods in a gentle stream, never dry and never halting; it {{is the type of}} the spirit of English folkmusic... England is as remote from Keltic fire and agony, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of Wordsworth rather than of Byron and Shelley.|$|E

5|$|When the Ionians and Persians {{arrived at}} Naxos, they were faced by a well-fortified and {{supplied}} city. Herodotus does not explicitly say, {{but this was}} presumably the eponymous capital of Naxos. He provides few details of the military actions that ensued, {{although there is a}} suggestion that there was an initial assault on the city, which was repelled. The Ionians and Persians thus settled down to besiege the city. However, after four months, the Persians had run out of money, with Aristagoras also spending a great deal. Thoroughly demoralised, the expedition prepared to return to Asia Minor empty handed. Before leaving, they built a stronghold for the exiled Naxian aristocrats on the island. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> strategy in the Greek world for those exiled by internal strife, giving them a base from which to quickly return, as events permitted.|$|E
5|$|Trans Polar made a {{demonstration}} trip to Stockholm on 13 June 1970—legal {{because it was}} without paying customers. The airline applied for permission to operate out of Sweden, but this {{was rejected by the}} Swedish Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) and appeals were rejected by the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. The reason was that it lacked a permanent organization, did not have sufficient experience in large-scale charter operations and could not document that its charter operations would be based on their own resources. Despite the lack of permission, Trans Polar sub-chartered a round trip from Stockholm to London on 28 June. It then operated four flights from Stockholm to Rhodes, Palma de Mallorca and London between 4 and 6 July. Trans Polar claimed that they were flying courtesy trips and that the passengers had agreed to be compensated the part of the package trip which would have been paid to Trans Polar. The arguments were rejected by the CAA, who stated that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> post-excuse and that in case of a courtesy trip the airline should not be collecting the fare in the first place. The incident was investigated by both Norwegian and Swedish police.|$|E

25|$|Montanoceratops <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> {{primitive}} ceratopsian in many respects, {{distinguished from}} the later species {{by the presence of}} claws, rather than hooves, and by having teeth in its upper jaw, rather than a toothless beak. It was once thought to have a horn on its nose but that was a misplaced cheek horn.|$|E
