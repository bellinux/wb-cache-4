5|$|During the {{preliminary}} round at the World Championships, Sacramone {{qualified for the}} event finals on floor and vault {{and contributed to the}} top-qualifying position of the American team. She also posted a score on beam that would have been high enough to qualify her to the beam final. However, due to an International Federation of Gymnastics rule allowing only two athletes per country to participate in each event final, Sacramone was unable to compete for a beam medal, because teammates Liukin and Shawn Johnson qualified ahead of her. In the team final, she competed on vault, beam and floor, earning scores of 15.750, 15.600 and 15.325, respectively. When the American team faltered after a difficult beam rotation, in which two gymnasts made major errors, Sacramone gathered the team for a pep talk to refocus them for floor. The American team earned 184.400 points overall, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough to secure the gold medal ahead of China and Romania.|$|E
5|$|On the Tar Heels' {{first play}} of the game, running back Jonathan Linton ran up the middle for a three-yard gain. After the gain, Carolina quarterback Chris Keldorf {{completed}} a 31-yard pass to tight end Alge Crumpler for a first down at the Virginia Tech 47-yard line. Now inside Virginia Tech territory, Linton ran for a five-yard gain, which {{was followed by a}} pass from Keldorf to Linton, who gained 26 yards on the play. Following the catch, North Carolina had a first down at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line. Linton left the field limping slightly, and backup running Mike Geter replaced him, then ran for four yards up the middle. Geter was stopped for no gain on the next play, and a third down pass by Keldorf fell incomplete. North Carolina kicker Josh McGee entered the game to attempt a 29-yard field goal, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good.</b> With 9:15 remaining in the quarter, North Carolina took a 30 lead.|$|E
5|$|Pinafore {{opened on}} 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique, before an {{enthusiastic}} audience, with Sullivan conducting. Soon, however, the piece suffered from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a heat wave {{that made the}} Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable. The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves {{in the summer of}} 1878 were short and transient. By mid-August, Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler weather had arrived, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> for the show. In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera's viability and posted closing notices. Carte publicised the piece by presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous Crystal Palace.|$|E

5|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to take}} place 20 March 2016, however, after {{it was announced that}} President Barack Obama was scheduled to arrive on the same day, concerns were raised and {{the decision was made to}} reschedule the concert to 25 March 2016. Shortly before the rescheduled concert date, Pope Francis attempted to delay it, asking that the band play on a later date as the concert was scheduled for 25 March 2016, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>Good</b> Friday, a major and solemn Christian holiday. The Vatican also suggested that the band delay the start of their concert until midnight to avoid the holy day. However, the Stones opted to play the concert at the originally scheduled date and time.|$|E
5|$|Tittle {{was then}} {{drafted by the}} San Francisco 49ers in the 1951 NFL Draft after the Colts folded. While many players {{at the time were}} unable to play {{immediately}} due to military duties, Tittle had received a class IV-F exemption due to physical ailments, so he was able to join the 49ers roster that season. In 1951 and 1952, he shared time at quarterback with Frankie Albert. In 1953, his first full season as the 49ers' starter, he passed for 2,121 yards and twenty touchdowns and was invited to his first Pro Bowl. San Francisco finished with a 9–3 regular season record, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough for second in the Western Conference, and led the league in points scored.|$|E
5|$|The Georgetown Hoyas {{participated in}} the Great Alaska Shootout to start the 198182 season. The Hoyas lost their opening game to Southwestern Louisiana 7061 after playing a sloppy game. After winning the {{following}} game against, the Hoyas lost to Ohio State by one point in their {{final game of the}} tournament. Georgetown then began a thirteen-game win streak, which was followed by losing three straight to three conference opponents. The Hoyas then finished the regular season with nine more wins and one loss, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough to finish second in the Big East regular season standings. The Hoyas won their first two games of the Big East Tournament by a collective margin of 29 points and advanced to the championship game against the Villanova Wildcats. The two teams were tied at halftime, but at halftime the Hoyas elected to use a man to man defense over a zone. This proved effective as they were able to force turnovers and shoot well from the field, which led them to win the game 7254. The Georgetown Hoyas won the Big East Tournament and also, a bid to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E

In the playoffs, they defeated the 76ers {{in the first round}} before losing to the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|Hershisher {{made his}} first start on May 26 against the New York Mets because of an injury to Jerry Reuss. He pitched six innings and allowed only one run.

In March 1919, Kamenev was elected as a full member of the first Politburo. His personal relationship with his brother-in-law Trotsky, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> {{in the aftermath of}} the 1917 revolution and during the Russian Civil War, lessened after 1920. For the next 15 years, Kamenev was a friend and close ally of Grigory Zinoviev, who exceeded him in ambition.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, The Bears {{continued}} {{to be one of}} the best teams in the NFL. However, they fell one game short of making the Championship game again. The Bears' success continued into 1950 as they began the new decade in style by finishing 9–3, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough to earn them a tie for the Western Division with the Los Angeles Rams and play in the Conference Playoff against them. However, the Bears were unable to slow down the high-powered Ram offense in a 24–14 loss in Los Angeles as the Rams advanced to the NFL Championship Game.|$|E
25|$|On October 20, {{against the}} Washington Huskies, the Oregon Ducks set {{a school record}} for rushing yards in a single game by the entire team, their total was 465 yards. The {{previous}} record was 446 yards against the Washington State Cougars in 2001. Also, during the game against the Huskies, RB Jonathan Stewart ran for 251 yards, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough for the second highest total rushing yards in a single game by an individual in Oregon football history.

25|$|On January 8, 2015, the Bears hired New Orleans Saints {{director}} of player personnel Ryan Pace as general manager. On January 16, 2015, they hired John Fox as their new head coach. The Bears finished 6-10 in 2015, a one game improvement of last season's 5-11 record, which was Marc Trestman's last. In 2016, the Bears slipped to a dismal 3-13 record, which was mainly {{the result of}} key injuries and inconsistent play. Rookie running back Jordan Howard {{was one of the}} few bright spots, as he finished with 1,313 rushing yards, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> for 2nd in the NFL (behind fellow rookie Ezekiel Elliot for the Dallas Cowboys).|$|E
25|$|Hedrick {{qualified}} for the 1000 m, 1500 m, 5000 m, and the long-track team pursuit in the 21st Winter Olympiad held in Vancouver. Hedrick lost to Håvard Bøkko in the final pair of the 5000 m event. He would ultimately finish 10 places behind the winner, Dutchman Sven Kramer, in 11th place. Hedrick skated a 1:09.32 in the 1000 m <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> for the bronze behind Davis and South Korea's Mo Tae-bum. Hedrick {{was the leader of}} the team that won a surprising silver medal in team pursuit with an upset of the heavily favored Netherlands team in the semifinals bringing Hedrick's Olympic career to an end with a total of five medals with each one in a different event.|$|E
25|$|Parcells again orchestrated a {{remarkable}} turnaround {{in his first}} year with the Jets. In his first season with the Jets, the team barely missed the playoffs with a record of 9–7 (the Jets were 1-15 the year before Parcells arrived, and had won a total of 10 games in the previous three seasons combined). In 1998, the Jets went to the playoffs with a current franchise-best 12–4 record, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough for second place in the conference and earned the Jets their third home playoff game since moving to New Jersey in 1984 (their first home playoff game was against the New England Patriots following the 1985 season), but lost to the eventual Super Bowl-champion Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game.|$|E

25|$|In {{the main}} event of the show, Dr. Wagner Jr. faced TNA worker Rob Van Dam to {{determine}} the first ever AAA Latin American Champion. Wagner, like L.A. Park, was accompanied to the ring by his son, independent worker Dr. Wagner III, with both him and Van Dam carrying the flags of their native countries. Van Dam used a steel chair on several occasions in the match, including kicking it in Wagner's face from the top rope. Eventually Wagner started a comeback with a top rope head-and-arm suplex suplex, before signaling for his finishing maneuver, the Wagner Driver. Wagner managed to hit the move, but Van Dam {{kicked out of the}} following pinfall. Wagner followed up with a rope hung DDT onto a steel chair, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough for a three count. With the win Dr. Wagner Jr. became the first ever AAA Latin American Champion. The show ended with AAA's técnicos entering the ring to celebrate Wagner's and AAA's win over TNA and La Sociedad.|$|E
25|$|In the 1986–87 NBA season, Jordan {{continued}} his {{assault on the}} record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team. The Bulls finished 40–42, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough to qualify them for the playoffs. However, they were again swept by the Celtics in the playoffs. In the 1987 draft, to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center Olden Polynice eighth overall and power forward Horace Grant 10th overall, then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, small forward Scottie Pippen. With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt, Brad Sellers and Oakley at the forward spots, Corzine anchoring center, and rookies Pippen and Grant coming off the bench, the Bulls won 50 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, where they were beaten by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions Detroit Pistons in five games. For his efforts, Jordan was named NBA Most Valuable Player, an award he would win four more times over his career. The 1987–88 season would also mark {{the start of the}} Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 to 1991.|$|E
25|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran {{for half}} an hour. The drivers' fastest lap times determined the starting order for the first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. Qualifying began under cloudy weather conditions and thus most of the field drove onto the track when the session started. Rain fell five minutes into qualifying but was not heavy enough to affect the track. Simon Trummer was the early pace setter but was soon eclipsed by his teammate Coletti, who in turn, was suppressed by Ericsson. Leimer then moved {{to the top of}} the time sheets with a new GP2 Series lap record of the Bahrain International Circuit and later lowered it to a of one minute and 39.427 seconds lap time and this secured him the pole position. Ericsson appeared to challenge Leimer for pole but eased off after losing time in the final sector to join the latter on the grid's front row with a time nearly a second off Leimer's pace. Nasr equalled his qualifying result from the previous year's race to start from third. Coletti improved on his own fastest lap <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough for fourth. Dillmann was best of the late improvers and qualified fifth. Richelmi was close in arrears in sixth position. Rossi was in the top three early in the session but fell to seventh by its conclusion.|$|E
