40|$|Consumer’s {{preferences}} for cured ham are investigated with conjoint analysis. A mixed rank-ordered logit model {{which allows the}} investigation for heterogeneous preferences and its sources is estimated. In particular, we analyse to what extent consumers’ socio-demographic traits affect their price-sensitiveness and whether consumer’s sensory (hedonic) valuations and attitudes towards ham with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) affect the {{preferences for}} specific attributes. The results show that consumers with a low-medium age and income are more price sensitive. Consumers more leaned sensorially towards the own regional product (with or <b>without</b> <b>PDO),</b> {{are more inclined to}} purchase this product, and consumers with a more favourable attitude towards PDO ham, are also more prone to purchase cured ham with quality certification in comparison with a product <b>without</b> <b>PDO.</b> Accordingly, the PDO scheme attracts a segment of consumers, but still the origin by itself is a more powerful signal of quality.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{research}} on competitive interdependency of Italian extra virgin olive oil through analysis of the sales scanner data. The paper analyses the strengths and weaknesses of Social Network Analysis approach in the olive oil market. The research addresses issues of three segments of high quality olive oils: popular extra virgin olive oil, pdo/pgi extra virgin olive oils, and finally, the " 100 % Italian olive oil". The analysis results show several aspects. The extra virgin olive oil market is highly polarized. There are large industrial companies with national products and other smes with regional products. While large enterprises have an intensive distribution in all grocery shops, in the distributions of smes the situation is much more complex. Some smes have a very strong sales organization, but fail to have similar market shares. Conversely, other small businesses, even if they have a low level of distribution, are able to gain market share more high. The analysis of sales by the sna approach remains a useful tool for smes which need to rationalize their presence in the grocery sector. Finally, the analysis shows segments of the market (<b>pdo,</b> <b>pgi,</b> bio, etc.) where smes may be able to compete with large industrial firms. ...|$|R
