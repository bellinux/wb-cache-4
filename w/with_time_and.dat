5|$|During the Portuguese Liberal Revolution of 1820, he {{supported}} the constitutionalists, who advocated a national constitution to limit {{the powers of the}} Portuguese monarchy, against the absolutists, who preferred an absolute monarchy. It is unknown whether he actively took part in the uprising, however, and if so, to what degree. Honório Hermeto {{was a member of a}} secret society called A Gruta (The Den), founded by Brazilian students at Coimbra with the primary goal of changing Brazil from a monarchy into a republic. His republicanism would fade <b>with</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> eventually be replaced by staunch support for monarchism.|$|E

If this is not sufficient physiotherapy, orthotics, splinting, or steroid injections may be options. If other measures do not work extracorporeal shockwave therapy or surgery may be tried.|$|E

5|$|The Miller {{brothers}} {{wrote the}} entire first novel, but were unsatisfied with the result; the Millers {{pointed out that}} writing a character for a novel is much harder than writing the characters of a game. Hyperion recruited author David Wingrove {{to assist with the}} project; the Millers ended up giving Wingrove a detailed draft, and the author rewrote the entire book. The book's design was made to fit the themes of the game; the novels are made to look like journals found in Myst, with embossed covers and pages darkened as though <b>with</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> use.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{doctrine}} of military deception has evolved <b>with</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> it encompasses {{a number of}} meanings. The Russian term маскировка (maskirovka) literally means masking. An early military meaning was camouflage, soon extended to battlefield masking using smoke and other methods of screening. From there it came to have the broader meaning of military deception, widening to include denial and deception.|$|E
5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him <b>with</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E

5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined <b>with</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E
5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify <b>with</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows <b>with</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a class of}} discrete time optimal control problems <b>with</b> <b>time</b> delay <b>and</b> subject to nonlinear all-time-step inequality constraints on {{both the state and}} control. By using a constraint transcription technique in conjunction with a local smoothing method, the problem is approximated by a sequence of discrete timeoptimal control problems <b>with</b> <b>time</b> delay <b>and</b> subject to nonlinear inequality constraints in canonical form. Rigorous analysis is carried out, showing the convergence of the optimal solutions of the approximate problems to the optimal solution of the original problem. We then move on to consider a general class of discrete time optimal control problem <b>with</b> <b>time</b> delay <b>and</b> subject to nonlinear constraints in canonical form. A computational method is developed based on the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approximation scheme with active set strategy. It solves the discrete time optimal control problem <b>with</b> <b>time</b> delay <b>and</b> subject to canonical constraints as a nonlinear optimization problem. As an application, {{we consider}} a tactical logistic decision analysis problem, which is formulated as a discrete time optimal control problems <b>with</b> <b>time</b> delay <b>and</b> subject to all-time-step inequality constraints. Using the computational method proposed, this practical problem is solved effectively, producing much better results than those obtained in existing literature...|$|R
