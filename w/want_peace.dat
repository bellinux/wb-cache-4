25|$|Nothing more {{happened}} in the south, until Iraq liberated the Al-Faw Peninsula while also re-capturing all land lost in the central front. Iraq could attack Iranian oil platforms and oil tankers while their own oil was transported via Kuwait and other Arab countries. Iran got frustrated and started attacking Kuwait, and later any tanker from pro-Iraq Arab countries, which ended in the US starting Operation Earnest Will to protect the ships, Iran kept on attacking and, after a US ship was heavily damaged by an Iranian mine the US launched Operation Praying Mantis. In this operation they first destroyed 2 Iranian oil-platforms, followed by the largest naval battle since World War II. The Iranian navy lost a frigate, a gunboat and several speedboats during the battle. In the north Iran continued advancing and Saddam started gassing the Kurdish population. Following this Ayatollah Khomeini finally accepted peace. But by this time Saddam didn't <b>want</b> <b>peace</b> anymore and together with the MEK conducted a joint attack to capture the town of Mehran in the Iranian province of Ilam {{as well as providing}} air support for the MEK advance in the province of Kermanshah. Saddam came under heavy international pressure which prompted him to withdraw his troops back across the border from Mehran, leaving the MEK army in occupation of the town. However the Iranian armed forces were able to defeat the MEK army which was largely destroyed in Operation Mersad. Now Saddam also accepted peace and the 8-year war was finally over.|$|E

As an outside influence, United States interference in Latin American politics is controversial and has often been severely criticized.

[...] As a theme in the dictator novel, the link between U.S. imperialism {{and the power of the}} tyrant is very important. Dictators in Latin America have accepted military and financial support from the United States when it suited them, but have also turned against the United States, using anti-American campaigning to gain favour with the people.

500|$|Maine Representative Nelson Dingley Jr. was McKinley's {{choice for}} Secretary of the Treasury; he {{declined}} it, preferring {{to remain as}} chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Charles Dawes, who had been Hanna's lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign, was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young. Dawes eventually became Comptroller of the Currency; he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate, Lyman J. Gage, president of the First National Bank of Chicago and a Gold Democrat. The Navy Department was offered to former Massachusetts Congressman John Davis Long, an old friend from the House, on January 30, 1897. Although McKinley was initially inclined to allow Long to choose his own assistant, there was considerable pressure on the President-elect to appoint Theodore Roosevelt, head of the New York City Police Commission and a published naval historian. McKinley was reluctant, stating to one Roosevelt booster, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>peace</b> and I am told that your friend Theodore is always getting into rows with everybody."
