500|$|This fungus is {{characterized}} by a fruiting body (technically an apothecia) with a pinkish-purple color and more or less gelatinous consistency. The apothecia, typically [...] in diameter, start with a roughly spherical shape, then eventually flatten out to become shallowly cup-shaped with a <b>wavy</b> <b>edge</b> and smooth upper surface. The lower surface may be covered with small particles (granular), and the apothecia are either attached directly to the growing surface (sessile), or have a rudimentary stem. The apothecia are accompanied by a conidial form, where non-sexual spores are generated. The conidial form consists of sporodochia, a cushion-like asexual fruiting body mass consisting of short conidiophores (specialized stalks that bear conidia). The sporodochia are similar in color and consistency to the apothecia but very variable in shape, typically club-, spoon-, or tongue-shaped, and bearing minute, cylindrical, straight or curved conidia. As the fungus matures and the apothecia enlarge and press against each other, the apothecia coalesce to form a gelatinous, irregular mass. [...] The flesh, similar to the appearance of the fungus, is pinkish-purple and gelatinous. The odor and taste of A.sarcoides are not distinctive. Ascocoryne sarcoides is not considered edible.|$|E
