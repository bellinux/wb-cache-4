The {{objective of this}} pilot {{study was to investigate}} the effects of locally-delivered alendronate sodium gel in adjunction to scaling and root planning on periodontal indices and bone formation <b>within</b> <b>vertical</b> defects of smokers with chronic periodontitis. Methods and Materials: In this study vertical defects (n= 8) with depth> 5 mm have been investigated. After performing the phase I of periodontal treatment, alendronate sodium gel (1) was applied into the periodontal pockets. The whole procedure was repeated after 4 weeks. Periodontal indices (plaque and bleeding), probing depth, gingival recession, and radiographic parameter (depth of bony defect) were measured at the beginning and following 6 months. Results: Compared to pre-treatment, the probing depth, radiographic depth of bony defect and bleeding and plaque indices were significantly reduced by local application of alendronate sodium gel (P= 0. 026; P= 0. 012 and P= 0. 007 respectively). Gingival recession showed significant increase (P= 0. 011).

40|$|The recent {{economic}} recession {{has brought to}} light the importance of human capitals. The fulfillment of assigned tasks by employees is no longer sufficient in response to increasing economic uncertainty and socio-cultural and technological changes (Grant, Parker, 2 ̆ 6 Collins, 2009). The contributions of employees who go above and beyond typical expectations in their performance necessitate that recreation agencies overcome their financial crises and secure their organizational survival with innovative alternatives. The notion of employee proactivity, which is characterized by self-directed and future-focused and an attempt to improve and challenge status quo in an organization (Bindl 2 ̆ 6 Parker, 2010; Crant, 2000), describes {{as a form of}} behavioral manifestation that exceeds what is specified by role prescriptions. It is imperative that managers in recreation agencies have a better understanding about the ways to solicit employee proactivity. As trust <b>within</b> <b>vertical</b> dyads {{has been shown to be}} associated with desirable employee attitudes and organizational outcomes, there is relatively little research that examines the effects of trust <b>within</b> <b>vertical</b> dyads on employee proactivity.
