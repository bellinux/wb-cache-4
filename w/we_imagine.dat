25|$|It is the {{distinctive}} feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, <b>we</b> <b>imagine</b> an action for ourselves {{as though we}} were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...|$|E
25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall we {{perceive}} {{that the system}} of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , <b>we</b> <b>imagine</b> we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. But when we come to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} Einstein brings into play the first screen {{as well and}} argues as follows: since the {{incident}} particles have velocities (practically) perpendicular to the screen S1, and since {{it is only the}} interaction with this screen that can cause a deflection from the original direction of propagation, by the law of conservation of impulse which implies that the sum of the impulses of two systems which interact is conserved, if the incident particle is deviated toward the top, the screen will recoil toward the bottom and vice versa. In realistic conditions the mass of the screen is so large that it will remain stationary, but, in principle, it is possible to measure even an infinitesimal recoil. If <b>we</b> <b>imagine</b> taking the measurement of the impulse of the screen in the direction X after every single particle has passed, we can know, {{from the fact that the}} screen will be found recoiled toward the top (bottom), whether the particle in question has been deviated toward the bottom or top, and therefore through which slit in S2 the particle has passed. But since the determination of the direction of the recoil of the screen after the particle has passed cannot influence the successive development of the process, we will still have an interference figure on the screenF. The interference takes place precisely because the state of the system is the superposition of two states whose wave functions are non-zero only near one of the two slits. On the other hand, if every particle passes through only the slit b or the slit c, then the set of systems is the statistical mixture of the two states, which means that interference is not possible. If Einstein is correct, then there is a violation of the principle of indeterminacy.|$|E

500|$|In {{preparation}} {{for his work}} on the special, Anderson researched Einstein's achievements; in his authorised biography, he admitted that he did not understand any of the physicist's theories. Byrne's script directed that E=mc2 – the Einsteinian formula that relates mass to energy – appear on-screen at intervals. Of the ending, it commented that, [...] "it's a universe not only stranger than <b>we</b> <b>imagine,</b> but stranger than we can imagine." [...] Although special relativity provides the main scientific and educational focus of the programme, The Day After Tomorrow also examines time dilation – an effect whereby time decelerates at a rate proportional to that of the acceleration of an object. For the crew of Altares, a ship capable of travelling at the speed of light, the mission to Alpha Centauri is measured in years, while whole decades pass on Earth. To encourage children to explore the topics in their own time (and thereby develop their research skills), Byrne wrote the characters {{in such a way that}} they provide only partial explanations of special relativity and related subjects.|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, the Hungarian {{mathematician}} Julius König {{published a}} paradox {{based on the}} fact that there are only countably many finite definitions.

[...] Hence in this well-order there should be a first real number that is not finitely definable. This is paradoxical, because this real number has just been finitely defined by the last sentence. This leads to a contradiction in naive set theory.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding emotion (used synonymously {{with the}} word [...] "passion" [...] in this context), which, {{following}} John Damascene, Aquinas defines as [...] "a movement of the sensitive appetite when <b>we</b> <b>imagine</b> good or evil," [...] Thomism repudiates both the Epicurean view that happiness consists in pleasure (sensual experiences that invoke positive emotion), and the Stoic view that emotions are vices by nature. Aquinas takes a moderate view of emotion, quoting Augustine: [...] "They are evil if our love is evil; good if our love is good." [...] While most emotions are morally neutral, some are inherently virtuous (e.g. pity) and some are inherently vicious (e.g. envy).|$|E

2500|$|A robust {{simulator}} is {{one that}} will react to any input in a reasonable way. For instance, if <b>we</b> <b>imagine</b> a high speed racecar video game, from one simulation step to the next, {{it is conceivable that}} the cars would advance a substantial distance along the race track. If there is a shallow obstacle on the track (such as a brick wall), it is not entirely unlikely that the car will completely leap over it, and this is very undesirable. In other instances, the [...] "fixing" [...] that posteriori algorithms require isn't implemented correctly, and characters find themselves embedded in walls, or falling off into a deep void, sometimes referred to as [...] "black hell", [...] "blue hell", or [...] "green hell", depending on the predominant color.

2500|$|These {{scholars}} {{argue that}} there can be no such thing as a [...] "theory of the origins of language". This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider— namely, human symbolic culture as a whole. Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have spectacularly failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Can <b>we</b> <b>imagine</b> a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognised within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society— one where communications technology has already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for an ape communicating with other apes in the wild. Not even the cleverest ape could make language work under such conditions.|$|E
