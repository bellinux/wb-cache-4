It is {{suggested}} that this deprivation may have caused him to develop Asperger's syndrome—some of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, maintain that this condition <b>would</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> his eccentric behaviors in later life. He was of English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} scheme covered all six greenhouse gases {{specified in the}} Kyoto Protocol and was intended to progressively apply to all {{sectors of the economy}} including agriculture. 'Participants' (who <b>would</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> their emissions) were to be few, and high in the production chain of each sector. Their compliance obligation would have been to surrender one New Zealand unit (NZU) or one internationally tradable Kyoto-compliant unit for each tonne of emissions.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} that the large crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, {{as well as other}} species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also <b>would</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the correlation between crest size and body size. There is no evidence of extra blood vessels in the crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.|$|E

5|$|According to gadget site Tom's Hardware, 3–4million {{units were}} {{expected}} to sell in 2012, which <b>would</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> most of the six million tablets Asus was expecting to sell for the year. Other sources estimated that 6–8million units of the tablet would be shipped before the year's end. Google initially expected to sell 3million units of the Nexus7 {{by the end of}} 2012, but Forrester Research estimates that Google met this sales target in mid-October 2012. Asus CFO David Chang said that by October, sales of the Nexus7 had approached 1million units per month. In light of Google not releasing official sales figures, mobile industry analyst Benedict Evans estimated that the device most likely sold between 4.5 and 4.6million units in 2012. According to Carphone Warehouse, the Nexus7 is the UK retailer's highest-selling Android tablet.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} fire and/or nuclear winter effects, the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis {{by creating a}} dust cloud that blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year. Further, the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the stratosphere, which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic. The acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7℃ for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and <b>would</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). Some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival, however.|$|E
5|$|Excavations of {{the tomb}} of Nikau-Isesi under the {{direction}} of Naguib Kanawati at Saqqara have yielded evidence in support of a shorter reign. Nikau-Isesi was an official who started his career during the reign of Djedkare Isesi, lived through that of Unas and died as overseer of Upper-Egypt under Unas' successor Teti. Nikau-Isesi is known to have died on the year of the eleventh cattle count during Teti's reign, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom and every year during the later Middle Kingdom (c.2055–c.1650 BC). Thus Nikau-Isesi would have lived for 22 years after Teti took the throne and together with the 30 years of reign credited to Unas, would have died past 70 years old. However, forensic examination of his mummy yielded an age at death of no more than 45 years old. This suggests that the cattle count occurred more than once every two years during Unas and Teti's time, possibly irregularly. If so, Unas' 30-year figure on the Turin canon, understood to mean 15 cattle counts, could translate into as little as 15 years, which together with just 11 years during Teti's reign <b>would</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> Nikau-Isesi's death at around 40 to 45 years of age.|$|E

5|$|The pediments, metopes, and {{shield of}} the Parthenos all {{illustrate}} the mythological past {{and as the}} deities are observing on the east frieze, it is natural to reach for a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara, has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King Kekrops. This explanation <b>would</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> {{the absence of the}} allies and the ship, as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite. In evidence she offers E35 as the future King Erichthonios presenting the first peplos to his predecessor Kekrops, iconographically similar to the boy’s depiction on a fragmentary kylix of the 450s. A recent interpretation by Joan Breton Connelly identifies the central scene on the east frieze (hence above the door to the cella and focal point of the procession) not as the handing over of Athena’s peplos by the arrhephoroi, but the donning of sacrificial garb by the daughter of King Erechtheus in preparation for the sacrifice of her life. An interpretation suggested by the text of the fragmentary papyrus remains of Euripides’s Erichtheus, wherein her life is demanded in order to save the city from Eumolpos and the Eleusinians. Thus, the deities turn their backs to prevent pollution from the sight of her death. A contentious subject in the field, Connelly's {{solution to the problem of}} meaning poses as many problems as it answers.|$|E

25|$|The model {{does not}} explain gravitation, {{although}} physical confirmation of a theoretical particle known as a graviton <b>would</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> it to a degree. Though it addresses strong and electroweak interactions, the Standard Model does not consistently explain the canonical theory of gravitation, general relativity, in terms of quantum field theory. The reason for this is, among other things, that quantum field theories of gravity generally break down before reaching the Planck scale. As a consequence, we have no reliable theory for the very early universe.|$|E
25|$|While {{this idea}} excited the public, the astronomical {{community}} was skeptical.
