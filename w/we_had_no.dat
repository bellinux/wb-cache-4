25|$|I'd see the bus pass every day... But to me, {{that was}} a way of life; <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> choice but to accept what was the custom. The bus was among the first ways I {{realized}} there was a black world and a white world.|$|E
25|$|We’d like {{to thank}} {{everyone}} we’ve worked with at Parlophone over the last 28 years both in the UK and abroad. When we signed to the label in 1985 <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea how long and successful a relationship we were embarking on. However it is also exciting now to commence a new phase working with a new team in a new business structure {{and we look forward}} to a creative and equally fulfilling relationship with Kobalt.|$|E
25|$|As for Picasso... the {{tradition}} {{he came from}} had prepared him better than ours for a problem to do with structure. And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots. He had already rejected them in their own century, a century <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> intention of prolonging. Whether or not the Universe was endowed with another dimension, art was going {{to move into a}} different field.|$|E

5000|$|Filming for Yes, <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> <b>No</b> Bonanza {{commenced}} between November 28 and December 1, 1938. The film's {{title is}} {{a parody of}} the 1923 song [...] "Yes, <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> <b>No</b> Bananas".|$|R

25|$|The {{standard}} {{argument against}} free will, according to philosopher J. J. C. Smart {{focuses on the}} implications of determinism for 'free will'. However, he suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not. On one hand, if determinism is true, all our actions are predicted and we are assumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, our actions are presumed to be random and as such we do not seem free because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> part in controlling what happened.|$|E
25|$|Geronimo {{was raised}} with the {{traditional}} religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E
500|$|Parlophone MD Tony Wadsworth was {{enthusiastic}} {{however as}} Coxon recalls, [...] "We played him [...] "Song 2" [...] {{as a bit}} of a test of whether he was on our wavelength. We told him this was the second single. Course, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea that it would be. He sat there, grinning—'Definitely! Definitely a single!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{it wanted}} to change the habeas statute, it could make all sorts of refined {{modifications}} about issues that we know nothing whatever about because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> only lawyers before us, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> witnesses, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> cross-examination, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> investigative staff. And we should be the ones, Justice Breyer suggests, to draw up this reticulated system to preserve our military from intervention by the courts." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "One of the ossuaries has {{the name}} Jude son of Jesus. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{historical}} {{evidence of such}} a son of Jesus, indeed <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> historical evidence he was ever married." ...|$|R
60|$|This is {{the great}} matter, for if we prosper forward rapidly, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> time for {{anything}} but prospering forward rapidly. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> time for art, even the art by which we prosper.|$|R
500|$|... "The first winter at {{the naval}} college was {{absolute}} hell, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> uniforms, we arrived in what we stood up in and had to send home for further clothing. A case of measles broke out very shortly and we were quarantined, and {{the only time we}} got out of the college was when we went to the skating rink to play hockey; and that was a great relief." [...] – Admiral Murray.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Padres {{general manager}} Joe McIlvaine stated the Padres {{would have never}} {{selected}} Hamilton if they knew his agent was Scott Boras. McIlvaine said of the situation, [...] "Basically, he lied to us. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea. That's why half the time, you don't know who he represents. [...] very good at that. His clients are very good about keeping their mouths shut." [...] McIlvaine retracted his comments about Hamilton and Boras after Boras threatened to sue McIlvaine.|$|E
500|$|The legend {{about the}} rabbit-hole {{did have some}} basis in reality: the many rabbit and fox holes {{provided}} the prospecting geologists with samples of the underlying rock (away from surface exposures of the geology at natural cliffs) at intervals along the ironstone outcrop. Marley stated [...] "I need scarcely say that, having once found this bed, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> difficulty in following the outcrop in going westward, without any boring, as the rabbit and fox holes therein were plentiful as we went." ...|$|E
60|$|In the Roman Republic {{there was}} a Tribune of the People, whose person was {{inviolable}} like an ambassador's. There was much the same idea in Becket's attempt to remove the Priest, {{who was then the}} popular champion, from the ordinary courts. <b>We</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>no</b> Tribune; for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> republic. <b>We</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>no</b> Priest; for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> religion. The best we deserve or can expect is a Fool who shall be free; and who shall deliver us with laughter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is true; but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> lived all {{our lives}} with {{superior}} people, so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> society talk like your young ladies. We are so accustomed to sensible conversation, and helping one another by telling our faults, that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> gossip to offer you.' ...|$|R

500|$|... "Grey Matters" [...] {{was written}} by screenwriters Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz, and was {{directed}} by Jeannot Szwarc. In an interview the following year, Miller noted that [...] "Your characters will often assert themselves, and remind you who they really are. In 'Grey Matters' there's a moment where pre-madness Walter wakes up in the chair — that beat emerged on the page. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea {{it was going to}} be in the script until we were writing the scene. As a writer, you live for that." ...|$|E
500|$|Jack Faber, {{who played}} for Byrd at the time, said that Maryland {{scheduled}} games against [...] "four or five schools every year <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> right beating." [...] Maryland achieved a winning record each season during Byrd's first decade of coaching, from 1911 to 1920. In that period, the team also accumulated a 7–2–1 record against arch-rival Johns Hopkins. The following decade, the team played an increasingly difficult and farther afield schedule. During the 1920s Maryland recorded wins {{against some of the}} period's powerhouses: Yale, Rutgers, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Syracuse, Cornell, and North Carolina.|$|E
500|$|It {{was unclear}} if Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) would reprise their {{respective}} roles {{for which they}} won Academy Awards in The Silence of the Lambs (best actress/actor). It {{became apparent that the}} producers and the studio could do without one of the original [...] "stars" [...] (and would go on to find a replacement). The withdrawal of both Foster and Hopkins could possibly have been terminal for the project, however. De Laurentiis confirmed this after the film's release: [...] "First and foremost, I knew <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> movie without Anthony Hopkins." ...|$|E

500|$|Sharon {{later said}} that [...] "If we had tolerated that development, the Syrian armored forces would have {{consisted}} of 600 tanks protected by an extensive missile umbrella. [...] Their missile batteries fired at our planes. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> choice {{other than to}} approve a military operation to destroy the missile buildup". [...] He called the operation [...] "the turning point" [...] in the invasion. A senior IAF officer, widely believed to be Ivry himself, later said that [...] "Syrian aircraft were fighting from a disadvantage, having {{to respond to the}} Israeli threat wherever and whenever it materialized, within a general strategic and tactical situation not in Syria's favor." ...|$|E
500|$|Superpower {{tensions}} {{culminated in}} the Cuban Missile Crisis (in the USSR, the [...] "Caribbean crisis") of October 1962, as the Soviet Union sought to install medium range nuclear missiles in Cuba, about [...] from the U.S. coast. Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned Khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret. Castro stated, thirty years later, [...] "We had a sovereign right to accept the missiles. We were not violating international law. Why do it secretly—as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> right to do it? I warned Nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage." ...|$|E
500|$|The Communist Party of the Russian Federation {{called for}} {{a ban on the}} film, accusing the {{production}} team of [...] "demonizing" [...] the Soviet Union. A party official said: [...] "In 1957 the USSR was not sending terrorists to America but sending the Sputnik satellite into space!" [...] Spielberg responded: [...] "When we decided the fourth installment would take place in 1957, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> choice but to make the Russians the enemies. World War II had just ended and the Cold War had begun. The U.S. didn't have any other enemies at the time." [...] The film's depiction of Peru also received criticism from the Peruvian and Spanish-speaking public.|$|E

500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers found {{independently}} {{producing the}} film to have both benefits and challenges. Although {{they were given a}} great amount of creative control by their executive producer Maurice Kanbar, their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to the story once production was underway. Todd Edwards related that [...] "Money doesn't just buy you more talent and more machinery, it also buys you flexibility on a story level. At Disney, if they don't like the third act, they just throw the whole thing out and re-animate the whole thing, even if it's finished... <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> such luxury, and so in a way, you're watching our first version of the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Post-war {{demobilisation}} {{had seen}} the disbandment of all the RAAF's operational training units, and conversion of new pilots to combat aircraft became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice disrupted the squadrons' normal duties, {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and the introduction of jets exacerbated shortfalls in operational training. Cresswell recalled that as commanding officer of No.77 Squadron in Korea he had to send several replacement pilots back to Australia: [...] "I don't blame the pilots, but I do blame the Air Force system. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> operational training units, no operational training system and, as a result, the pilots came to Korea poorly trained and without instrument ratings. They just couldn't operate in the area." ...|$|E
