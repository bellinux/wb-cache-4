5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were hung over while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last shot of the film where the killer is seen {{standing}} in line at the movie theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E
500|$|Despite their bloody repulse on May 19, Union {{troops were}} in high spirits, now well-fed with {{provisions}} they had foraged. On seeing Grant pass by, a soldier commented, [...] "Hardtack". Soon all Union troops in the vicinity <b>were</b> <b>yelling,</b> [...] "Hardtack! Hardtack!" [...] The Union served hardtack, beans, and coffee the night of May 21. Everyone expected that Vicksburg would fall the next day.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{years of}} this student organization are not well known. The RUF/NEKS {{began in the late}} 1910s. In December 1915 at a basketball game between Oklahoma and Oklahoma A a group of football players <b>were</b> <b>yelling,</b> cheering, and causing a ruckus. An elderly woman shouted, [...] "Sit down and be quiet you roughnecks!" [...] The name was later changed to RUF/NEKS. The first leader of the RUF/NEKS was Charles Leslie High. His most famous act was the [...] "Dallas or Bust" [...] campaign, in which he sold tickets at a cheap price to students who wished to go. While this low-cost option is not available anymore, the [...] "Dallas or Bust" [...] tradition continues as part of the modern [...] "Pre-Dally Rally" [...] that occurs to this day.|$|E

2500|$|One early recruit to {{join the}} {{regiment}} was named Jack Jackson. Jackson {{was said to be}} very large and strong-willed and quickly became a Sergeant in Company B. At some point Jackson joined the regimental recruiting parties; the officers were having trouble with convincing local field hands to join. Jackson's recruiting method was described as very forceful but ultimately successful. At the Battle of Milliken's Bend one of Jackson´s superior officers, Lieutenant David Cornwell, described the attack; saying that the 23rd Iowa was not behaving courageously but the three black infantry regiments offered great resistance. He said that Jackson, [...] "Laid into a group of Texans... smashing in every head he could reach", and that, [...] "Big Jack Jackson passed me like a rocket. With the fury of a tiger he sprang into that gang and crushed everything before him. There was nothing left of Jack's gun except the barrel and he was smashing everything he could reach. On {{the other side of the}} levee, they <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> 'Shoot that big !' while Jack was daring the whole gang to come up and fight him. Then a bullet reached his head and he fell full on the levee." ...|$|E
60|$|Several other shots followed, {{but they}} could not tell if anybody was hit. In the {{distance}} several rum-crazed sailors <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> like so many Indians.|$|E

50|$|In {{recordings}} of the 9-1-1 calls, <b>yells</b> for help <b>are</b> audible in the background. Zimmerman's family says it <b>was</b> Zimmerman <b>yelling</b> for help, Martin's family says it <b>was</b> Martin <b>yelling</b> for help, and independent audio analysts offer differing opinions as to who <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> for help. During the trial, {{friends and family members}} of both Zimmerman and Martin testified as to who they thought the voice was, but expert testimony regarding voice identification was not allowed.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} the boarder <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> and {{pounding}} at the door. When Euphemia was ready I {{opened the door and}} took her out.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Twas dead of {{the night}} when I sate in my dwelling, One glimmering lamp was expiring and low,-- Around the dark tide of the tempest was swelling, Along the wild {{mountains}} night-ravens <b>were</b> <b>yelling,</b> They bodingly presaged destruction and woe! [...] 5 ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the soldiers under Captain Moore were busy. The Indians were {{now at the}} ditch, and one had advanced {{as far as the}} stockade itself. They <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> like demons, and now the desperadoes began to show themselves, confident that the fort would soon be taken.|$|E
60|$|In {{the street}} the {{disturbance}} had now become terrible. Both sides were hard at it, and the Irishmen on the roof, rewarded at last for their long vigil, <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> encouragement promiscuously and whooping with the unfettered ecstasy {{of men who}} are getting the treat of their lives without having paid a penny for it.|$|E

5000|$|On a Sunday in March of 1996 I {{was at home}} ... and Michael Alig and Angel Melendez were loudly arguing ... {{and getting}} louder. I opened the room and started towards the other bedroom ... at which point Michael Alig <b>was</b> <b>yelling,</b> [...] "Help me!" [...] "Get him off of me" [...] Angel started shaking him violently and banging him against the wall. He <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> [...] "You better get my money or I'll break your neck" ... I grabbed the hammer ... and hit Angel over the head...|$|R

60|$|It {{was amazing}} how the father's voice could ring {{out like a}} gong, without his being in the least moved, and how the mother could speak like a queen holding an audience, though her blouse was {{sticking}} out all round {{and her hair was}} not fastened up and the children <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> a pandemonium.|$|E
6000|$|Accordingly, we {{went and}} [...] "hollered," [...] with a right good will. We were much taken aback to find that Mrs. Ray came to the gate instead of Judy, and rather sourly demanded what we <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> about. When she heard our news, however, she had the decency {{to say she was}} glad, and to promise she would convey the good tidings to Sara--"who is already in bed, where all {{children}} of her age should be," [...] added Mrs. Ray severely.|$|E
60|$|With a grim {{certainty}} of his {{mastery of the}} situation Ken threw a huge potato at his leading pursuer. Fair and square on the bronze head it struck with a sharp crack. Like a tenpin the Soph went down. He plumped into the next two fellows, knocking them off their slippery footing. The three fell helplessly and piled up their comrades in a dense wedge half-way down the steps. If the Sophs had been yelling before, it was strange to note how they <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> now.|$|E
50|$|Bárány <b>was</b> <b>yelled</b> at by the {{presidium}} at the Vetenskapsakademien for revealing in Sveriges Radio {{as to why}} {{the announcement}} of the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics 2013 was delayed.|$|R
60|$|The voice, {{smooth and}} deferential, the step, steady and silent, {{made it hard}} to believe that only a few hours before Bukta <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> and capering with naked fellow-devils of the scrub.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Too calm, my dear madam. The Eumenides {{might do}} certainly, or Philoctetes, {{if we could}} but put Philoctetes to real pain, and make the spectators sure that he <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> in good earnest.' ...|$|R
60|$|Trot, {{finding the}} window open, came and looked out, {{and she saw}} the Majordomo's tall form hastening {{along the top of}} the wall. The guards saw him, too, {{outlined}} against the sky in the moonlight, and they began yelling at him to stop, but Ghip-Ghisizzle kept right on until he reached the city Wall, when he began to follow that. More guards <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> now, running along the foot of the wall to keep the fugitive in sight, and people began to pour out of the houses and join in the chase.|$|E
60|$|He broke another loaf in two {{and thrust}} the pieces into his doublet, and then sallied out from the cottage again. Still keeping behind the houses {{he made his way}} until he got within view of the fire. Here he saw a sight which thrilled him with horror. Some eight or ten peasants and forty or fifty women <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> and shouting. Fastened against a post {{in front of the fire}} were the remains of a prisoner. He had been stripped, his ears, nose, hands, and feet cut off, and he was slowly {{bleeding}} to death.|$|E
60|$|Trace for Wayne led off in {{the seventh}} with a safe fly over short. Ken, {{attempting}} to sacrifice, rolled a little bunt down the third-base line and beat the throw. With no one out {{and the head of}} the batting list up, the Wayne players awoke to possibilities. The same fiery intensity that had characterized their play all season now manifested itself. They were all on their feet, and Weir and McCord on the coaching lines <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> hoarsely at Salisbury, tearing up the grass with their spikes, dashing to and fro, shouting advice to the runners.|$|E
6000|$|... "Vive la France! Vivent les Anglais!" [...] he <b>was</b> <b>yelling.</b> [...] "Tout va bien, n'est ce pas, Colonel? Ah, canaille! Vivent la croix et les Chretiens!" [...] He was {{incoherent}} in his delight.|$|R
50|$|The North Isles are the {{northern}} {{islands of the}} Shetland Islands, Scotland. The main islands in the group <b>are</b> <b>Yell,</b> Unst and Fetlar. Sometimes the islands in <b>Yell</b> Sound <b>are</b> included in this group.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well, well!' {{cried the}} young officer, in {{sufficiently}} bad French, 'what game {{are you up}} to here? Who was that who <b>was</b> <b>yelling</b> for help, and {{what are you trying to}} do to him?' ...|$|R
60|$|The fall of {{his uncle}} nerved Dave to greater effort, {{and as the}} Indians rushed over the rocks he, with several others, met them in a short but bitter hand-to-hand contest, in which blows were freely taken and delivered. The redskins <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> {{at the top of}} their lungs and using their tomahawks with great viciousness. Dave was confronted by a tall warrior who did his best to split the youth's head open with his hatchet, but Dave dodged and the blow merely grazed his shoulder. Then, before the Indian could aim another blow a bullet from the rear cut short the redskin's career forever.|$|E
60|$|Early in the {{day they}} came on the mangled remains of the {{emigrant}} farmers before referred to. At first it was supposed {{this must be the}} remnant of the band they were in search of, but a very brief examination convinced them, experienced as they were in men and signs, that it was another band. Soon after, they came in sight of the party for which they were searching, just as the Kafirs were making a renewed attack. Already a few volleys had been fired by the Dutchmen, the smoke of which hung like a white shroud over the camp, and swarms of savages <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> round it.|$|E
6000|$|The {{fighting}} was now incessant on all sides, but gradually the Mexicans {{concentrated on the}} northern wall. They <b>were</b> <b>yelling</b> like so many demons, and their officers urged them forward by threats and sword blows, until the first rank was fairly wedged against the stone wall of the mission. A cannon belched forth, doing fearful havoc, but those in front could not retreat because of those pushing behind them, and in a twinkle one Mexican soldier was piled above another, until {{the top of the}} wall was gained, and, as one authority states, they came [...] "tumbling over it like sheep," [...] falling, in some cases, directly on the bodies of the Texans below.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shut up, will you-all?" [...] he <b>was</b> <b>yelling.</b> [...] "Give us {{a chance}} to hear somethin'. Easy now--soho. There ain't nobody goin' to be hurt. Thet's right; {{everybody}} quiet now. Let's see what's come off." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Movies", Hecht was to recall, [...] "were seldom written. In 1927, they <b>were</b> <b>yelled</b> into {{existence}} in conferences that kept going in saloons, brothels, and all-night poker games. Movie sets roared with arguments and organ music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “They have <b>been</b> <b>yelling</b> {{the news}} in the streets since two o’clock. I bought the paper, and just ran in here. Then I saw you sitting at this table. I’ve got it in my pocket now.” ...|$|R
