2500|$|The unfinalized {{status of}} East Jerusalem has caused issues when {{attempting}} to market Jerusalem to international tourists. In 2009, 2010, and again in 2015, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled against a series of Israeli Ministry of Tourism advertising campaigns that displayed images and information about tourist sites located in East Jerusalem. The advertising authority wrote in its ruling that [...] "the status of the occupied territory of the West Bank {{was the subject of}} much international dispute, and because we considered that the ad implied that the part of East Jerusalem featured in the image was part of the state of Israel, <b>we</b> <b>concluded</b> that the ad was likely to mislead." [...] Israel rejected the ruling, with the Ministry of Tourism releasing a statement that said the ad provided [...] "basic, accurate information to a prospective UK visitor". The ruling from 2009 also included criticism about Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights being shown as part of Israel.|$|E
2500|$|In our {{schematic}} example above, <b>we</b> <b>concluded</b> that M causes M∗ by causing P∗. So M causes P∗. Now, M, as an emergent, must itself have an emergence base property, say P. Now we face {{a critical}} question: if an emergent, M, emerges from basal condition P, why cannot P displace M {{as a cause of}} any putative effect of M? Why cannot P do all the work in explaining why any alleged effect of M occurred? If causation is understood as nomological (law-based) sufficiency, P, as M’s emergence base, is nomologically sufficient for it, and M, as P∗’s cause, is nomologically sufficient for P∗. It follows that P is nomologically sufficient for P∗ and hence qualifies as its cause…If M is somehow retained as a cause, we are faced with the highly implausible consequence that every case of downward causation involves [...] overdetermination (since P remains a cause of P∗ as well). Moreover, this goes against the spirit of emergentism in any case: emergents are supposed to make distinctive and novel causal contributions.|$|E

Hutch wanted to convey the message that its service was robust enough to provide coverage in every part of its coverage areas.

2500|$|A {{great deal}} of time was also spent working out the control scheme. The game {{originally}} had a target-lock system, based on the controls in Syphon Filter and Devil May Cry. However, the developers were unhappy with this system as they felt the gameplay was based more on [...] "PC-style shooters" [...] such as Half Life, which uses a mouse and keyboard control scheme to facilitate easier free aiming, rather than a target lock system. As such, [...] "with our controls for a console-style shooter but our gameplay from a PC-style shooter, about a year into development we realized we had a dangerous disconnect in our design that made our game tedious instead of fun." [...] However, with the release of successful console third-person shooters such as Max Payne, , , and , all of which [...] "eschewed target-lock in favor of double-stick control schemes that simulated the mouse/keyboard experience from the PC," [...] the team decided to scrap their target-lock system and go with a free aim system; [...] "looking at the sales for these titles, <b>we</b> <b>concluded</b> the installed base of players who were familiar with these controls was now large enough that we could take the risk of turning off a few newbies. The change was a huge success for the game: it fixed the disconnect in our gameplay and added depth that had been completely missing." ...|$|E

In the past, St. John's College chose {{not to participate in}} any collegiate rankings surveys and did not provide requested survey information. However, the school was still included in many ranking guides. In 2014, Annapolis President Christopher B. Nelson wrote a post to address the issue in his SignPosts for Liberal Education blog: After many years of refusing to participate at all in the rankings generated by U.S. News & World Report—one of the most prominent providers of college rankings—St. John's this year submitted statistical information for its survey. This change in practice was prompted by engaged parents who increasingly were asking whether the underlying data about St. John's in U.S. News was reliable. Since we were not submitting information, we could not vouch for its reliability. Although St. John's would prefer not to be ranked, and has long asked not to be ranked, U.S. News continued to rank us. <b>We</b> <b>concluded,</b> therefore, that we had to supply statistical data in order to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information U.S. News was publishing about us.St. John's experienced an unprecedented leap upward in the 2014 U.S. News rankings after submitting data (as opposed to not providing information and still being ranked), as reported in the Washington Post.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Barger, the HSCA's {{acoustics}} expert, {{when asked}} about this discovery and the NAS analysis, replied,Barber discovered a very weak spoken phrase on the DPD Dictabelt recording that is heard at {{about the time of}} the sound impulses <b>we</b> <b>concluded</b> were probably caused by the fourth shot. The NAS Committee has shown to our satisfaction that this phrase has the same origin as the same phrase heard also on the Audograph recording. The Audograph recording was originally made from the channel 2 radio. The common phrase is heard on channel 2 about a minute after the assassination would appear, from the context, to have taken place. Therefore, it would seem [...] [...] [...] that the sounds that we connected with gunfire were made about a minute after the assassination shots were fired. Upon reading the NAS report, we did a brief analysis of the Audograph dub that was made by the NAS Committee and loaned to us by them. We found some enigmatic features of this recording that occur at about the time that individuals react to the assassination. Therefore, we have doubt about the time synchronization of events on that recording, and so we doubt that the Barber hypothesis is proven. The NAS Committee did not examine the several items of evidence that corroborated our original findings, so that we still agree with the House Select Committee on Assassinations conclusion that our findings were corroborated ...|$|E
