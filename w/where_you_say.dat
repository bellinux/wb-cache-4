So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E
2500|$|The closer, [...] "When I Needed You", {{was written}} in a session with Tavish Crowe in order to process a break up wherein she realizes the faults of her {{seemingly}} [...] "perfect" [...] relationship: [...] " [...] {{but in order to}} stay in it, I would have to be quite a different person than who I naturally am [...] and that sacrifice didn't seem worth it in the end." [...] Dan Nigro and Nate Campany composed the [...] "happier-sounding" [...] instrumental, to which Jepsen felt a sense of catharsis in concealing a [...] "very serious" [...] emotion. Ariel Rechsthaid reworked the chord progression in order to invoke a sense of [...] "desperation", droning through it with a series of bell notes that made the composition sound [...] "a little bit more somber". The [...] "five-string, funk-R" [...] bass line was played by Ethan Farmer, and the drum fill, [...] "an 80s kind-of snare with a big reverb on it," [...] was inspired by John Mellencamp's [...] "Jack & Diane". Rechsthaid further directed Jepsen's ad-libs on the track: [...] " [...] producers really love to capture those moments <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> an awkward thing and for their own, sick pleasure just keep it in there, tucked." ...|$|E

I witnessed the granting of this concession to you by the King of Bekwando. According to its wording you were virtually Monty's heir, and Monty was lying drunk, in a climate where strong waters and death walk hand-in-hand. You leave him in the bush, proclaim his death, and take sole possession. I find him alive, do the best I can for him, and here the first act ends. Then what afterwards? I hear of you as an empire-maker and a millionaire. Nevertheless, Monty was alive and you knew he was alive, but when I reach Attra he has been spirited away!

Wrote him from Levuka, before he came on to die at Peenoo-Peenee. My father had saved his life one rough-house night in Valparaiso. A Chink pearler, out of Thursday Island, {{prospecting}} for new grounds {{to the north of}} New Guinea, traded for the three spikes with a nigger. Johnny Black bought them for copper weight. He didn't dream any more than the Chink, but coming back he stopped for hawksbill turtle at the very beach <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> the mate of the Flirt was killed. Only he wasn't killed. The Banks Islanders held him prisoner, and he was dying of necrosis of the jawbone, caused by an arrow wound in the fight on the beach. Before he died he told the yarn to Johnny Black. Johnny Black wrote my father from Levuka. He {{was at the end of}} his rope--cancer. My father, ten years afterward, when captain of the Perry, got the spikes from German Oscar. And from my father, last will and testament, you know, came the spikes and the data. I have the island, the latitude and longitude of the beach where the three spikes were nailed in the trees. The spikes are up at Lavina's now. The latitude and longitude are in my head. Now what do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the matter}} of style, there is another {{excellent}} way. You need not neglect it, but you may study it wrongly. You may be affectedly self- conscious, you may imitate the ingenious persons who carefully avoid the natural word, the spontaneous phrase, and employ some other set of terms which can hardly be construed. You may use, like a young essayist whom I have lovingly observed, a proportion of eighty adjectives to every sixty- five other words of all denominations. You may hunt for odd words, and thrust them into the wrong places, as <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that a man's nose is [...] "beetling," [...] that the sun sank in [...] "a cauldron of daffodil chaos," [...] and the like. {2} You may use common words in an unwonted sense, keeping some private interpretation clearly before you. Thus you may speak, {{if you like to}} write partly in the tongue of Hellas, about [...] "assimilating the ethos" [...] of a work of art, and so write that people shall think of the processes of digestion. You may speak of [...] "exhausting the beauty" [...] of a landscape, and, somehow, convey the notion of sucking an orange dry. Or you may wildly mix your metaphors, as when a critic accuses Mr. Browning of [...] "giving the irridescence of the poetic afflatus," [...] as if the poetic afflatus were blown through a pipe, into soap, and produced soap bubbles. This is a more troublesome method than the mere picking up of every newspaper commonplace that floats into your mind, but it is equally certain to lead--where you want to go. By combining the two fashions a great deal may be done. Thus you want to describe a fire at sea, and you say, [...] "the devouring element lapped the quivering spars, the mast, and the sea-shouldering keel of the doomed Mary Jane in one coruscating catastrophe. The sea deeps were incarnadined to an alarming extent by the flames, and to escape from such many plunged headlong in their watery bier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She cannot come here," [...] Porus agreed; [...] "but I {{do not see}} why {{you should}} not bring her from that dismal place <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> she is, and {{establish}} her near at hand, either {{at one of the}} upper farmhouses, or in a town by the sea. Let me think it over. In an hour I will tell you what seems to me the best plan. My counsel is this," [...] he said, after he had been absent for an hour from the hut, [...] "I myself will go with the lad to fetch her. A Roman lady, even though a fugitive, should not be travelling about the country under the protection of a lad. I dare not go into Rome. I am known to too many of the gladiators, and, disguise myself as I might, I should be recognized before I had been there an hour. I will obtain a dress such as would suit a respectable merchant; I will go down to one of the ports below and take passage in a trading craft bound for Ostia. There I will take lodgings, and giving out that my daughter, who has been staying with friends for her education in Rome, is about to return to Messina with me, will purchase two or three female slaves. When she arrives with Philo, who can pass as her brother and my son, we will take ship and come down hither. I can then bring her up and place her in the house of one of the farmers; or can, if you like, take a house in the town, or lodge her there with people to whom one of the farmers might recommend her. But, at any rate, she could come up to one of the farm houses first, to see you, and then you could arrange matters between you. She would really run no danger. You say she went out but little in Rome, and it would be ill luck indeed were there anyone on this coast who met her there. If it were not for your preposterous height, your yellow hair and blue eyes, there would be no difficulty about the matter at all, for you would have but to cross the straits into Sicily, to buy a small property there, and to settle down quietly; but it is impossible with your appearance to pass as one of the Latin race." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These robberies are {{becoming}} more and more frequent," [...] he said; [...] "and so bold and reckless are the criminals that they seem to care not a jot whether they add murder to their other crimes. <b>Where</b> do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> the wound is?" ...|$|R

6000|$|And now {{passing by}} {{many things that}} I might justly examine, and also many unseemly expressions, I come to the next thing, and that is, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> you wrest not the scriptures in John 1:9. But it is evident, that you do most horribly wrest it, in the you, though you seem {{to take it in}} the plain words, yet would hold, that that light is the Spirit of Christ, {{notwithstanding}} here is no such thing mentioned in that scripture. For mark, as I have sometimes said, and now also will say, that that light wherewith Christ, as he is God, hath lightened every one with, is not the Spirit of Christ, as is clear, in that some are sensual having not the Spirit, which they must needs have, if it were given to every one that comes into the world, and therefore, in that you say, I say you lay down that scripture false; I say again, that you say many things which I do know to be blasphemy, as I shall prove clearly anon, as also I have already. And therefore, to take thee of from this, I shall say, that Christ as he is a mediator, a Man between God and man, so he doth not lighten every man that comes into the world, though as he is God he doth. And this is manifest, where he often, (as he was Man) saith, These things are spoken to them that are without in parables; [...] "that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand," [...] (Luke 8:10). And again, where Judas (not Iscariot) said; Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world? He saith, [...] "If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we (I as mediator, and my Father as reconciled in me) will come unto him, and make our abode with him" [...] (John 14:23). And again, [...] "No man knoweth him as a father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him (Matt 11:27). But above all, take that scripture where the Son saith, [...] "I thank thee O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes" [...] (verse 25). Here the Son and the Father are speaking one to another; the Father he hides the glorious things of the gospel from the, world (Matt 11:25-27), and the Son he rejoices in so doing. At the same hour Jesus rejoiced in Spirit, and said, [...] "I thank thee, O Father, &c. Therefore understand thus much, that though Christ as he is God, doth give to every man a light, which is conscience, otherwise called nature (Rom 2:14; 1Cor 11;14), yet it doth not follow, that every man hath enlightening from Christ as he is mediator. No, Christ as he is mediator doth neither pray for the world (John 17:9), neither doth he give his Spirit to all that are in the world; for some are sensual, and have it not. But now the argument that thou dost bring to colour the contrary with, is this; for what the Father doth, sayest thou, the Son doth also. Answ. Though this be true, that the Son doth what the Father doth; yet it doth not appear that either the Father or the son hath given the Spirit to every one that comes into the world (Jude 19).|$|E
