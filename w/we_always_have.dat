500|$|Thatcher {{refused to}} meet the union's demands and {{compared}} the miners' dispute to the Falklands conflict, declaring {{in a speech in}} 1984: [...] "We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> {{to be aware of the}} enemy within, which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty." [...] After a year out on strike, in March 1985 the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The cost to the economy was estimated to be at least Â£1.5billion, and the strike was blamed for much of the pound's fall against the US dollar. The government closed 25unprofitable coal mines in 1985, and by 1992 a total of 97 mines had been closed; those that remained were privatised in 1994.|$|E

5000|$|Steve Jones of Sex Pistols stated [...] "Slade never compromised. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> {{the feeling}} that they were on our side. I don't know but I think we were right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, indeed,' said Claude. 'Suppose we set it again, more clearly; {{but how is}} this? When I was in the schoolroom <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> {{a sponge}} {{fastened}} to the slate.' ...|$|R

"We had {{to fight}} the enemy without in the Falklands. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> {{to be aware of}} the enemy within, which is much more {{difficult}} to fight and more dangerous to liberty".

2500|$|Stewart {{said that}} the dispute was over one {{communication}} on behalf of her client to his supporters via a Reuters article, followed by a clarification after it {{appeared to have been}} misinterpreted.

2500|$|When {{asked how}} {{being married to}} Marion Ravenwood and having a son would affect the {{character}} in a fifth film, Ford only replied: [...] "He's seen something. Remember those are the only witnesses to what he's seen. That's kind of interesting." [...] In January 2010, Ford said, [...] "I {{think it would be}} interesting to advance the understanding of the character, as <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> had that ambition throughout the series. [...] I think {{it would be interesting to}} deepen the relationship between he and his son and play on that relationship... It's full of opportunity. The series is full of opportunity." ...|$|E

5000|$|She {{said of her}} childhood:"I {{was brought}} up on unions. Mum would wake us by singing, [...] "Wake up darlings from your slumbers".

2500|$|Hussain was {{alleged to}} have stated: [...] "More than praying we {{discussed}} work, politics, the war in Iraq ... <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> new films {{of the war in}} Iraq ... more than anything else those in which you could see Iraqi women and children who had been killed by US and UK soldiers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did, but <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> so much cake I {{thought it}} was foolish to lay in rolls," [...] exclaimed Augusta, rather mortified at the neglect.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't like it, Mother? I'm glad of it. Let's {{send him}} about his business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy {{together}} as <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> been." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "When I {{first started}} in the Dominican, all our profit, we stuck it back. All our profit was always {{invested}} in tobacco.

And as we started aging more and more, we started doing better." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The other {{military}} orders {{were there to}} fight the Saracens and to save Spain or the Holy Land or Prussia from the pagans. But <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> this special commitment {{to the poor and}} the sick. Our aims today are exactly the same as they were in 1099, the sanctification of our members through service to the sick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paul, {{whatever}} happens, {{remember we}} cling together and share {{good or evil}} fortune as <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> done. I am a burden, but I cannot live without you, for you are my world. Do not desert me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come in, now. Coffee is ready. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> coffee {{the first}} thing, except in very hot weather, {{when we have}} fruit sherbet. After that we ride or shoot till the sun gets hot, and then come in to the morning meal, at ten." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Basically <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> the {{attitude}} that the band should be fun and the second it stopped being fun is the second we stop playing.

60|$|The {{next day}} we filled water again, and shot some ducks, {{and the day after}} weighed and stood over for the main, as we thought it to be.

6000|$|... "Very like," [...] said Mick; [...] "there's {{nothing that}} makes one so thirsty as {{listening}} to a song, particularly if it touches the feelings.

6000|$|... "Five minutes, my dear sir?" [...] he exclaimed, with warmth, motioning his visitor blandly {{into the}} leather-covered chair.

6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{have your}} {{admission}} of that {{without any of the}} prevarications that are usual in your kind. And I will say this, that here prevarication would avail you little. For <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> the truth in the end. Be sure of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{must say}} bye-bye and run home. I feel cheered up--you always cheer people up, Aunt Emmy. How grey it is outdoors. I do hope we'll have snow soon. Wouldn't it be jolly {{to have a}} white Christmas? <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> such faded brown Decembers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Spofforth {{taught us}} how to bowl and Blackham taught {{us how to}} keep wicket. When I was young <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> another fielder, called the long- stop, who stood behind the wicket-keeper. I {{used to be a}} thick, solid boy, so they put me as long-stop, and the balls used to bounce off me, I remember, as if I had been a mattress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{we might}} try that, and then <b>we</b> shall <b>always</b> <b>have</b> our horses,' said Geirald. So {{they went up}} the rocks silently and carefully.|$|R
5000|$|Happy {{news for}} the Left was that U.S. {{soldiers}} were demoralized and the war was being lost... Happy {{news for the}} Right {{was that there was}} no insurgency, then no civil war; <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> enough troops, and we were winning hands-down, except for the left-wing lunatics who were trying to unravel it all. They say heroin addicts are happy, too, when they are out of touch with reality.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> {{our regular}} eleven and a scrub eleven, and, besides that, {{we have two}} or three games with rival schools.

6000|$|... "Well, well, {{you may see}} for yourself. If not, there's no harm done. Of course, <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> the {{optician}} clue to {{fall back}} upon, but I take a short cut when I can get it. Ah, here is the good Mrs. Marker! Let us enjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll see to that. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> {{things on}} hand for the Pointers as they come along and can soon fit Dulce out. You may make some {{inquiries}} about the father if you will, for I don't want to have her taken away just as I get fond of her. Do you know anything about him?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In November 2010, {{the actor}} and comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar {{recalled}} the fear which the speech instilled in Britons of Indian origin: [...] "At {{the end of}} the 1960s, Enoch Powell was quite a frightening figure to us.

My parents held the notion that we may have to leave." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} cloudless, {{and there was}} a {{brilliant}} moon behind us, so that <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> three black horsemen riding down the white road in front of us. The country is so thickly wooded, however, that we could not see very far. The great palace clock had already struck ten, {{but there was no sign}} of the Countess.

6000|$|... "I {{should not}} mind so much if <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a dry hut to sleep in, but {{as often as}} not we have to sleep on the drenched ground in the open and, consequently, {{get up in the morning}} more tired than when we lie down. I have no doubt that, after all this is over, I shall become a cripple from rheumatism, or be laid up with some other disorder." ...|$|R
