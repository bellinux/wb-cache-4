5|$|June 5, 2007— Tropical Storm Barry {{produces}} 3.91inches (99mm) {{of rain in}} New York City. The {{heavy rainfall}} leads to flooding in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> roads and driveways. Roads and several driveways were washed out.|$|E
5|$|Although Blanca {{remained}} {{far from}} Jalisco, large swells and rip currents {{produced by the}} hurricane claimed four lives. In Northwestern Mexico, watches and warnings were raised prior to the storm's landfall. Blanca caused generally light damage in the region, consisting of downed trees and power lines. Remnant moisture from the system spread across the Southwestern United States, resulting in several days of scattered thunderstorms. Flash flooding occurred in multiple states, <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> roads and damaging homes, though the overall effects were limited.|$|E
50|$|This {{acceleration}} of erosional channel degradation {{has resulted in}} the collapse of several bridges. In 1955 a flood <b>washed</b> <b>out</b> the old U.S. Highway 61 bridge at Kingston, the Illinois Central Railroad bridge at Rosetta, and a country road bridge on the tributary Second Creek. In 1969 a bridge on the tributary Crooked Creek was <b>washed</b> <b>out,</b> and in 1971 the State Highway 33 bridge at Rosetta was <b>washed</b> <b>out.</b> During the flood of 1974 both the State Highway 33 bridge and the Illinois Central bridge at Rosetta were <b>washed</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R

5|$|As an extratropical cyclone, Frances {{passed through}} {{southern}} Ontario. The storm dropped up to , <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> roads and causing localized flooding in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland. This rainfall smashed all-time rainfall records in a 24-hour period (most {{of the rain}} fell in a 6 to 8hour-period). Ottawa's O-Train Trillium Line was halted because of a landslide that obstructed the railroad corridor. Several major roads in Gatineau and Ottawa were under several inches of water, locally chest-high. More than $45million (2004 CAD; $41million USD) in insured damage was reported in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|High winds {{brought down}} {{telegraph}} wires {{and left the}} city almost entirely cut off from communication with outside locations. At Coney Island, the storm completely destroyed many buildings, walkways, piers, and beach resorts. Brighton Beach was hit particularly hard. The raging seas swept inland, <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> tracks of the Marine Railway. Bathing houses were moved a great distance by the cyclone. Near the Sheepshead Bay, Emmons Avenue was heavily damaged. Further to the east, at Greenport, numerous yachts were wrecked and scattered. Corn crops on land were ruined and fruit trees lost their fruits.|$|E
5|$|October 29, 2012– Hurricane Sandy makes {{landfall}} {{north of}} the state. However, due to the tremendous size of the storm, its effects were felt all over Maryland. During {{the peak of the}} storm, 60mph sustained winds were felt from Frederick, Maryland eastward. However, power outages were not widespread and any problems were solved quickly due to better preparation. Heavy rain affected the state, with up to a foot of rain falling in some spots. Storm surge was also a large factor along the beaches, <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> many piers and some boardwalks along Ocean City. Hurricane Sandy is the deadliest tropical cyclone to affect the state, causing 11 deaths.|$|E

30|$|Static {{factors such}} as {{permeability}} and porosity that affect {{the intensity of the}} flow field during the ultra-high water-cut stage in the sedimentary point bar of a meandering river with medium–high permeability are reflected in the geological model and the dynamic parameter changes. For the dynamic parameters of accumulated injection <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> multiple, water saturation, fluid velocity and pressure gradient, the flow velocity can be characterized by the pressure gradient. The injection <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> multiple has a relationship with the water saturation and the fluid flow rate {{is a reflection of the}} accumulated injection <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> multiple derivative over time, so the accumulated injection <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> multiple is selected as the index of flow field strength.|$|R
5|$|For the Meteora shoots, a Greek bishop {{was paid}} to allow filming in the monasteries, but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly {{critical}} of production rolling in their installations. After a trial in the Greek Supreme Court, {{it was decided that}} the monks' only property were the interiors – the exteriors and surrounding landscapes were from the local government. In protest, the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting, and tried to sabotage production as much as possible, hanging their <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> of their windows and covering the principal monastery with plastic bunting and flags to spoil the shots, and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters. The production team solved the problem with back lighting, matte paintings, and building both a similar scenographic monastery on a nearby unoccupied rock, and a monastery set in Pinewood.|$|E
5|$|As {{most of the}} livable land in West Virginia is in {{the flood}} plain, the high river {{flooding}} caused heavy damage, wrecking many small rural towns and <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> miles of roadways. A total of 43bridges were destroyed and another 80 were damaged. Near Moorefield, the bridge carrying U.S. Route 220 was closed, but was reopened after emergency repairs. In Paw Paw, a flooded river washed a swept up building into a bridge, washing it away. Much of Pendleton County became isolated after 18bridges were washed out and roads were covered by mudslides. The Cheat River destroyed 110 of the 132houses in Albright, and washed away a trailer park in Rowlesburg. The flooding downed thousands of trees, which were carried into houses and recreation areas to cause additional damage. Agriculture losses were heavy after the floods washed away the topsoil and left behind miles of debris. Many farm structures were washed away, {{and hundreds of thousands}} of chicken or turkeys were killed. Statewide, at least 8,968houses were damaged, and another 4,000 were destroyed, which left nearly 2,600people homeless. In addition, the floods damaged or destroyed 711businesses. Agriculture damage was estimated at $97million, and damage to the United States Forest Service in the state was estimated at $3.9million. Statewide damage totaled nearly $700million, and 38people were killed in West Virginia. This made it the most damaging flood in the state's history, according to then-Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Offshore the Arabian Peninsula, the cyclone {{produced}} rough {{waves that}} disabled an oil tanker; {{the crew was}} rescued by the Omani Coast Guard after being stranded for a few days. A fishing boat was damaged after being washed ashore near Ras Madrakah, killing {{one person in the}} crew of nine. Near where the storm moved ashore, the storm's strong winds heavily damaged the village of Ras Madrakah. Considered the worst storm in memory, the cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings, including damaging the roof of the desalination plant, leaving residents without water for several days. Strong winds of over 93km/h (58mph) knocked down 20trees in Rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings. Across the storm's track through Oman, the rains replenished water levels in aquifers, while also <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> roads and isolating villages. This lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work. The Jiddat al-Harasis desert was flooded for over a month due to the storm, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. The floods provided grazing for the endangered oryx population, although many livestock were killed. Three airports in the country were closed due to floods up to four days.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the regular}} season games {{resulted}} in a tie, which is unusual in baseball given the provision in {{the rules of the game}} to play extra innings to determine a winner. The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of a makeup doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> two games, and so had been shortened to seven innings. A rain delay during the first game of the day forced the second game to a later start. Under a provision in the ABL rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation's tiebreaker rule, in any extra inning that starts within an hour of the curfew time for the game—a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series—each team starts with runners at first and second base with nobody out. In addition, no new inning may start within 15minutes of the curfew time. The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings, and was tied at 1–1 at the end of the eighth inning, which ended at the curfew time. Though the game was an official game, the result did not count towards the season standings.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{grilling}} was {{to permit the}} canceling ink to be better absorbed into the stamp paper, thus preventing reuse of stamps by <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> the cancellation marks.

25|$|In 1972 Hurricane Agnes {{flooded the}} valley again, <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> large {{portions}} of the line. The B considered abandoning the line, and several years passed before service was restored. For many years much of the line remained dark (i.e. operating without signals), but eventually the entire line was re-signalled.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of July 6, 1881, heavy thunderstorms caused a flash flood of Honey Creek, <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> timbers that supported the railroad trestle. A pusher locomotive sent from Moingona to check track conditions crossed the Des Moines River bridge, but plunged into Honey Creek when the bridge fell away at about 11pm, with a crew of four— Ed Wood, A.P. Olmstead, Adam Agar, and Patrick Donahue.|$|E
25|$|The {{hurricane}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} {{of up to}} , exacerbating existing flood conditions across all of southernmost Florida. High waves pounded the southeast coast, heavily damaging beachfront structures, <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> much of the coastal highway, and piling deep sand drifts on nearby grounds. In the Everglades, many cattle were drowned and the dike on Lake Okeechobee nearly overtopped. Off the west coast, the storm caused a ship to get lost and another to sink. In all, the storm claimed 17 lives and caused $31.6 million in damage.|$|E

25|$|The monsoon also complicates {{transportation}} with {{roads and}} trails <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> while unpaved roads and airstrips may become unusable and cloud cover reduces safety margins for aviation. Rains diminish in September and generally end by mid-October, ushering in generally cool, clear, and dry weather, {{as well as}} the most relaxed and jovial period in Nepal. By this time, the harvest is completed and people are in a festive mood. The two biggest and most important Hindu festivals—Dashain and Tihar (Dipawali)—arrive during this period, about one month apart. The post monsoon season lasts until about December.|$|E
25|$|Farmer {{grew up in}} Peoria, Illinois, {{where he}} {{attended}} Peoria High School. His father was a civil engineer and a supervisor for the local power company. A voracious reader as a boy, Farmer said he resolved to become a writer in the fourth grade. He became an agnostic {{at the age of}} 14. At age 23, in 1941, he married and eventually fathered a son and a daughter. After <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> of flight training in World War II, he went to work in a local steel mill. He continued his education, however, earning a bachelor's degree in English from Bradley University in 1950.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} infections {{of the mouth}} {{include the use of}} {{chlorhexidine}} mouth wash in those with poor immune function and <b>washing</b> <b>out</b> the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk, antifungal medications may be used preventatively.|$|E
