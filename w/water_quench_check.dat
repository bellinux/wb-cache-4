In this paper, considering {{the existence of the}} overmatch welds and uneven temperature field during oil-feeding and <b>water</b> <b>quenching</b> as well as quenching conditions, the bulging behavior of the coke drum is investigated. Firstly, the uniaxial tension and ratchetting experiments of parent metal and weld of coke drum are carried out at 20 oC, 200 oC, 300 oC, and 400 oC. Secondly, the ratchetting strains are predicted by OW-II kinematic hardening model and the predicted ratchetting strain rates of steady stage are in qualitative agreement with the experimental results. By comparison, weld has significantly smaller ratchetting strain rate than parent metal under the same loading conditions, which shows that the anti-ratchetting ability of weld is better than that of parent metal. Thirdly, the transient temperature field during oil-feeding and <b>water</b> <b>quenching</b> are numerically simulated with the help of dynamic coordinate system method, which yields the axial temperature difference and its characteristic value for the simplified characteristic load {{to be used in the}} cyclic plastic analysis of coke drum cycled between oil-feeding and <b>water</b> <b>quenching.</b> Fourthly, the ratchet boundaries are determined under moving axial temperature gradient by cyclic plasticity analysis for the parent metal.
