40|$|The {{deformation}} and fracture {{characteristics of}} a low carbon Si–Mn steel with ferrite/bainite dual–phase structure were investigated by thermo–mechanical controlled process (TMCP). The {{results showed that the}} curves of the instantaneous <b>work–hardening</b> <b>factor</b> n* value versus true strain ε are made up with three stages during uniform plastic deformation: n* value is relatively higher at stage I, decreases slowly with ε in stage II, and then decreases quickly with ε in stage III. Compared tothe equiaxed ferrite/bainite dual–phase steel, the quasi–polygonal ferrite/bainite dual–phase steel shows higher tensile strength and n*value in the low strain region. The voids or micro–cracks formed not only at ferrite–bainite interfaces but also within ferrite grains in the necked region, which can improve the property of resistance to crack propagation by reducing local stress concentration of the crack tips. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between plane strain fracture toughness, KIc, the tensile properties, and the microstructure of the overaged 7449 aluminum-plate alloy, and compares them to the 7150 alloy. The 7449 alloy has a higher content of ??/? precipitates; and, the 7150 alloy contains a greater amount of coarse intermetallic particles, as it contains an appreciable amount of coarse S phase (Al 2 CuMg), which is largely absent in the 7449 alloy. The toughness of the alloys shows an increase on overaging, and the 7449 alloy shows a reasonably linear toughness—yield strength relation on extended overaging. Several mechanisms of failure occur: coarse voiding at intermetallics and a combined intergranular/transgranular shear fracture mode, with the former becoming more important as overaging progresses. Drawbacks of existing models for toughness are discussed, and a new model for plane strain fracture toughness, based on the microstructurally dependent <b>work-hardening</b> <b>factor,</b> KA, introduced in Ashby's theory of work hardening, is developed. This model predicts a linear relation between KIc and K 0. 85 A/? 0. 35 ys, where ?ys is the yield strength, {{which is consistent with}} the experimental data...|$|E
