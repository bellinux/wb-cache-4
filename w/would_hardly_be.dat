Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue that as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E
5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E

500|$|Despite his knee, Orr's {{performance}} in the Canada Cup led to him being named to the tournament All-Star team and he was named the overall MVP for the tournament. According to teammate Bobby Clarke, Orr [...] "would hardly {{be able to walk}} {{on the morning of the}} game. And he <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> able to walk in the afternoon. And then, at night, he would be the best player on one of the greatest teams ever assembled. He was the best player in every game; he was the best player in the tournament. He couldn't skate like he used to, but he could still go." [...] According to teammate Darryl Sittler, [...] "Bobby Orr was better on one leg, than anybody else was on two." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ugly" [...] {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Phil Udell of Hot Press regarded it as a [...] "classy, catchy pop tune {{with a human}} heart". Peter Robinson of The Observer felt that the track {{was one of the}} album's standouts, stating that it [...] "immediately hits on the Sugababes' core values", which according to him are [...] "cool, but so unswervingly radio-friendly that it <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> out of place as this year's Children in Need single". Talia Kraines of BBC described [...] "Ugly" [...] as a [...] "ballad full of true Sugababes attitude". K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic considered the track as an [...] "aptly pitched inspirational mini-epic", and a writer for The Liverpool Daily Post & Echo characterised it as an [...] "empowering anthem". Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine called it [...] "vastly superior self-help pop" [...] and [...] "lovingly produced". However, Ben Hogwood of musicOMH thought the song was unconvincing, while Alex Roginski of Sydney Morning Herald criticized the songwriting as [...] "flat".|$|E

500|$|For {{many years}} {{it was assumed that}} Monteverdi had written much of the music for Licori before its sudden cancellation; Redlich says the music was {{finished}} by 10 September 1627. The work's rejection and subsequent disappearance have been blamed on Striggio's disregard for Monteverdi's efforts. However, Tomlinson's reading of the correspondence suggests a different conclusion: Monteverdi, in his view, [...] "did not even come close to completing the score" [...] and may have written very little of the music. It is likely that he stopped composing at the end of July, having become suspicious of Striggio's true commitment to the work. Tomlinson suggests that, mindful of Mantua's earlier cancellation of Le nozze di Tetide, Monteverdi avoided extending himself on the new project, while maintaining a diplomatic impression of activity. Tomlinson writes: [...] "t <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> surprising if Monteverdi were preternaturally sensitive to signs of Mantuan vacillation [...] if, at the first such signs in 1627, he decided to move cautiously in the composition of Licori." [...] Strozzi's libretto has vanished along with whatever music Monteverdi managed to write, but Strozzi wrote a second libretto under the same name, which was set by Francesco Sacrati and produced in Venice in 1641.|$|E
500|$|Davidson places {{emphasis}} {{on the fact that}} valkyrie literally means [...] "chooser of the slain". She compares Wulfstan's mention of a [...] "chooser of the slain" [...] in his Sermo Lupi ad Anglos sermon, which appears among [...] "a blacklist of sinners, witches and evildoers", to [...] "all the other classes whom he [...] mentions", and concludes as those [...] "are human ones, it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well." [...] Davidson points out that Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan's detailed account of a 10th-century Rus ship funeral on the Volga River features an [...] "old Hunnish woman, massive and grim to look upon" [...] (who Fadlan refers to as the [...] "Angel of Death") who organises the killing of the slave girl, and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters. Davidson says that [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> surprising if strange legends grew up about such women, who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties. Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed, the idea that the god [...] "chose" [...] his victims, through the instrument of the priestesses, must have been a familiar one, apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war." [...] Davidson says that it appears that from [...] "early times" [...] the Germanic peoples [...] "believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god, stirring up disorder, taking part in battle, seizing and perhaps devouring the slain." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second great quintet {{was where}} Hancock found {{his own voice}} as a pianist. Not only did he {{find new ways to}} use common chords, but he also popularized chords that had not {{previously}} been used in jazz. Hancock also developed a unique taste for [...] "orchestral" [...] accompaniment – using quartal harmony and Debussy-like harmonies, with stark contrasts then unheard of in jazz. With Williams and Carter he wove a labyrinth of rhythmic intricacy on, around and over existing melodic and chordal schemes. In {{the latter half of the}} 1960s their approach became so sophisticated and unorthodox that conventional chord changes <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> discernible; hence their improvisational concept would become known as [...] "Time, No Changes".|$|E

2500|$|The {{one player}} on Vanderbilt's roster {{not from the}} 1923 varsity team was Hek Wakefield's younger brother Robert Allen [...] "Jack" [...] Wakefield. [...] He was a highly renowned back of the {{freshman}} team; [...] "One <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> wrong in calling Jack Wakefield, Vanderbilt fullback, the greatest player in Southern freshman football for the past season." [...] It was the only game he ever played with a varsity team at Vanderbilt. He soon left to play professional baseball with the Saint Louis Cardinals. Jack twice broke his leg in preliminary work with the Cardinals, leaving him out for the season. [...] On December 10, 1924, after a quarrel with his fiancee, Jack went {{to the house of}} a friend in Memphis and committed suicide with a pistol. By all accounts he played an inspired game, [...] "he cut an all Princeton line into shreds of Black and Orange. He threw all America tackles aside as he would throw sacks of straw, and trampled great names into the turf." [...] Then Centre head coach Charley Moran called Jack [...] "the greatest football player I ever saw, barring nobody." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard, Powellism {{was seen}} as a proper step toward free markets in the early 1970s, writing [...] "There is only {{political}} strategy that carries hope for Britain in the foreseeable future: that of the dissident stormy petrel of British politics, Enoch Powell. Decades of horrific British policies have created a rigid, stratified, and cartellized economy, a set of frozen power blocs integrated with Big Government: namely, Big Business and Big Labor. Even the most cautious and gradualist of English libertarians now admit that only a radical political change can save England. Enoch Powell is the only man on the horizon who could be the sparkplug for such a change. It is true, of course, that for libertarians Enoch Powell has many deficiencies. For one thing he is an admitted High Tory who believes in the divine right of kings; for another, his immigration policy is the reverse of libertarian. But on the critical issues in these parlous times: on checking the inflationary rise in the money supply, and on scuttling the disastrous price and wage controls, Powell is by far the soundest politician in Britain. A sweep of Enoch Powell into power <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> ideal, but it offers the best existing hope for British freedom and survival." ...|$|E
