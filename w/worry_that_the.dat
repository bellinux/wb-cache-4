5|$|Soon afterward, however, McCarthy leaves Homer {{for another}} client. Without McCarthy {{to keep him}} in shape, Homer starts eating again and gains all the weight back. Homer can no longer fit into his costume or even his trailer, and the movie begins to go over budget. The studio {{executives}} and Comic Book Guy <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film will not be successful. The final version of the movie features scenes with the fat Homer and the physically fit Homer merged, upsetting and confusing the audience. After the premiere of the film, McCarthy returns and offers to get Homer into shape again, which Homer accepts. The studio executives offer to let Comic Book Guy direct the sequel, on the condition that Comic Book Guy lie to the fans and say he liked the film. Though pleased by the offer, Comic Book Guy rejects it and openly criticizes the movie online, and thus it becomes a box office failure and Everyman is never adapted again.|$|E

Dan {{finds it hard to}} relate to Susan and begins to question her part in his and Libby's lives. Karl books a holiday for them all to get away and talk.

40|$|Abstract.

In order to ensure national security and stable reigning position of Communist Party of China (CPC), and realize people as masters of the country, Mao Zedong has made great contributions. Based on change of time background and time features, some of his specific judgments {{may be out of}} date; however, generally speaking, there still exist many reasonable places in Mao Zedong’s theories and practices about how to safeguard national security, stabilize reigning position of CPC, and realize people as masters of the country, and those theories and practices are worth our deep thinking...|$|R

25|$|Larger cannon {{were used}} in greater numbers during the Fall of Constantinople: Sultan Mehmet II used 68 Hungarian-made cannons, the largest of which was 26 feet long and weighed 20 tons; this fired a 1,200 pound stone cannonball, and {{required}} an operating crew of 200 men, as well as 70 oxen and 10,000 men just to transport them. For the defenders, the Walls of Constantinople could not be adapted for the operation of artillery, and towers were not good gun emplacements. There was even <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> largest Byzantine cannon could cause more damage to their own walls than the Turkish cannon. The changing needs of cannon operation thus {{led to the development}} of trace italienne of Italy and the Tudors' Device Forts in England, using specially built cannon batteries to their greatest effect.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, {{scientists}} {{isolated the}} {{yellow fever virus}} in West Africa. Following this, two vaccines were developed in the 1930s. The vaccine 17D {{was developed by the}} South African microbiologist Max Theiler at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City. This vaccine was widely used by the U.S. Army during World War II. Following the work of Ernest Goodpasture, Theiler used chicken eggs to culture the virus and won a Nobel Prize in 1951 for this achievement. A French team developed the French neurotropic vaccine (FNV), which was extracted from mouse brain tissue. Since this vaccine was associated with a higher incidence of encephalitis, FNV was not recommended after 1961. Vaccine 17D is still in use, and more than 400 million doses have been distributed. Little research has been done to develop new vaccines. Some researchers <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 60-year-old technology for vaccine production may be too slow to stop a major new yellow-fever epidemic. Newer vaccines, based on vero cells, are in development and should replace 17D at some point.|$|E
25|$|In Flemish circles, {{there is}} an ever {{continuing}} <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> status of Dutch in Brussels will continue to deteriorate, and that the surrounding region will undergo even more Francization. On the political level, {{the division of the}} bilingual Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (BHV) electoral and judicial district caused much linguistic strife. The district is composed of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region in addition to the 35 municipalities of the Flemish administrative arrondissement of Halle-Vilvoorde. For elections to the Belgian Senate and to the European Parliament, which are organized by linguistic region, residents from anywhere in the arrondissement can vote for French-speaking parties in Wallonia and Brussels. For elections to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, which is usually done by province, voters from Halle-Vilvoorde can vote for parties in Brussels, and vice versa. It was feared that, if BHV was divided, the francophones living in Halle-Vilvoorde would {{no longer be able to}} vote for candidates in Brussels, and they would lose the right to judicial proceedings in French. If a division were to take place, francophone political parties would demand that the Brussels-Capital Region be expanded, a proposal that is unacceptable to Flemish parties. This issue was one of the chief reasons for the 200-day impasse in Belgian government formation in 2007, and it remained a hotly contested issue between the linguistic Communities, until this issue was resolved mid-2012.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the {{dismantling}} project, there was debate by local residents {{on whether the}} wrecked stern should be removed. Some local officials believed the stern, which lay on a remote area of the beach, was not a hazard or an eyesore. Arnie Roblan, a state representative from Coos Bay, called the wreck a potential tourist attraction. For some residents, uncertainty remained surrounding Titan's removal plan, with the <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stern {{would be unable to}} withstand the force of the hydraulic pullers and that parts of the ship already buried in the sand would be unmovable. The president of the Coos Bay city council expressed concern that the proposed removal operation could cause ecological damage that would not occur if the ship were left on the beach. He further noted that [...] "shipwrecks on the Oregon Coast are part of our history. There are a lot of ways you could better spend the money here." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{difficulties}} and unforeseen circumstances delayed construction. [...] First, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission had been conducting archaeological digs {{in the area}} since 1996, and had found a variety of artifacts dating from the Clovis period, with radio carbon age dating around 10,900 BCE, making them {{one of the oldest}} sites in the eastern United States; the sites also includes evidence of food, {{making it one of the}} rarer paleolithic finds. The next circumstance was that there was <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> construction of the bridge might affect the river ecosystem, particularly some of the river water organisms. After some regulations were added and problems were sorted out, the construction continued. The third issue was that the bridge may run into problems with boaters, and therefore, the bridge was given the same regulations as bridges upstream. Finally, the Delaware's low water level meant that barges could not be used in the construction. When Hurricane Ivan struck in 2004, the water level rose, allowing for the use of the barges, but destroying several construction items used for the bridge in the process.|$|E
