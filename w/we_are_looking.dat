What is the {{probability}} that exactly 4 of the 10 are green? Note that although <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> at success/failure, the data are not accurately modeled by the binomial distribution, because the probability of success on each trial is not the same, as the size of the remaining population changes as we remove each marble.|$|E
25|$|Because f(η) is real valued, {{the three}} roots η1, η2 and η3 are either all three real, or {{otherwise}} one {{is real and}} the remaining two are a pair of complex conjugates. In the latter case, with only one real-valued root, {{there is only one}} elevation η at which f(η) is zero. And consequently also only one elevation at which the surface slope η’ is zero. However, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for wave like solutions, with two elevations—the wave crest and trough (physics)—where the surface slope is zero. The conclusion is that all three roots of f(η) have to be real valued.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{historian}} of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade: Ada saw something that Babbage {{in some sense}} failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw—what Ada Byron saw—was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation—to general-purpose computation—and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.|$|E

500|$|British critic Leslie Halliwell {{states the}} film's {{influence}} as [...] "it {{led directly to}} all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties". In particular, the visuals and storyline are credited with inspiring The Monkees' television series. The [...] "Can't Buy Me Love" [...] segment borrowed stylistically from Richard Lester's earlier The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film, {{and it is this}} segment, in particular using the contemporary technique of cutting the images to the beat of the music, which has been cited as a precursor of modern music videos. Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a more pervasive influence, even constructing [...] "a new grammar": [...] "he influenced many other films. Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> at the children of A Hard Day's Night". In an interview for the DVD re-release of A Hard Day's Night, Lester said he had been labelled the father of MTV and had jokingly responded by asking for a paternity test.|$|E
500|$|The {{casting process}} {{continued}} into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Clark Gregg. Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back. [...] "We {{have made the}} decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers," [...] stated Feige. [...] "Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks." [...] In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it [...] "purposefully misleading" [...] and an [...] "inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be associated with only one character.|$|E
