500|$|Not {{everyone}} in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and {{many members of the}} Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the [...] "screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap."

500|$|... 300 writer Frank Miller said: [...] "The Spartans were a {{paradoxical}} people. They were the biggest slave owners in Greece. But {{at the same}} time, Spartan women had an unusual level of rights. It's a paradox that they <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of people who in many ways were fascist, but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy. The closest comparison you can draw {{in terms of our}} own military today is to think of the red-caped Spartans as being like our special-ops forces. They're these almost superhuman characters with a tremendous warrior ethic, who were unquestionably the best fighters in Greece. I didn't want to render Sparta in overly accurate terms, because ultimately I do want you to root for the Spartans. I couldn't show them being quite as cruel as they were. I made them as cruel as I thought a modern audience could stand." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{novel is}} {{told in the}} first-person voice by various characters, and each short chapter is told from a {{different}} character's perspective. Linguistic drift has given the people of Eden unique nouns ("police veekle", [...] "rayed yoh", and [...] "Jesus Juice" [...] instead of [...] "police vehicle", [...] "radio", and [...] "Jesus and the Jews"). The adverb [...] "very" [...] has dropped from the language, and emphasis is created by reduplication ("bad bad" [...] instead of [...] "very bad"). Linguistic relativity has yet to set in, so that Family lacks words to describe much of their world ("Cold Dark" [...] instead of [...] "high, dark mountain wreathed in glaciers"). Beckett said he adopted the unsophisticated, childish language of the Edenites after realizing he had crafted {{a society in which}} [...] "the Eden settlers <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of kids and two adults... There's no external adult world as a reference point". With the two adults constantly speaking baby-talk to their children, pre-teens and teens never adopted more adult ways of speaking.|$|E
