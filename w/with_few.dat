40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to quantitatively compare two types of dual-permanent-magnet-excited (DPME) machines, one is <b>with</b> <b>fewer</b> stator poles and the other is <b>with</b> <b>fewer</b> rotor poles. Four {{different}} magnetization patterns of permanent magnets (PMs) are considered. Calculation results obtained using finite-element analysis demonstrate that with exactly the same usage of magnets and copper windings, the DPME machine <b>with</b> <b>fewer</b> rotor poles can offer significantly higher electromagnetic torque than that <b>with</b> <b>fewer</b> stator poles, and the torque ripple of the DPME machine <b>with</b> <b>fewer</b> rotor poles is lower than that <b>with</b> <b>fewer</b> stator poles. Another finding is that DPME machines can offer satisfactorily high-torque capability only when the two sets of PMs are with the same magnetization directions.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{accidents}} {{took place at}} the bridge over the years, with vessels colliding with the piers due to the hazardous nature of the waterway. In 1960, two river barges hit one of the piers on the bridge, causing two spans to collapse into the river. Repair work was under consideration when a similar collision occurred the following year, after which it was decided that it would be uneconomical to repair the bridge. It was demolished between 1967 and 1970, <b>with</b> <b>few</b> traces remaining.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} Democratic foe of Bradley {{had begun}} his {{rise to power}} in the Kentucky Senate.

Goebel was known as aloof and calculating. Unmarried and <b>with</b> <b>few</b> close friends of either gender, he was singularly driven by political power.|$|E

The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained.

5|$|After the {{adoption}} of a new Constitution in 1923, the traditional local administrative systems of the newly acquired regions of Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia were made uniform in 1925 with that of the Romanian Old Kingdom.

5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen <b>with</b> <b>few</b> warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor that}} helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was {{a shift in}} {{attitude}} among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, <b>with</b> <b>few</b> delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.|$|E
