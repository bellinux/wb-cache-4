5000|$|Collu-alluvial {{fans are}} flat to almost flat (0-8% slopes) land, {{moderately}} to <b>well</b> <b>drain</b> areas, fine loamy to clayey soil texture, shallow to very deep soils, none to moderately eroded and no flooding. These areas {{are found in}} barangay Ditumabo and Nonong Sr. with an extent of 520 ha.|$|E
5000|$|River {{terraces}} {{are areas}} with slopes of 0 to 3% (flat to almost flat), moderately to <b>well</b> <b>drain</b> soils, fine loamy to clayey soil textures, moderately deep soils, no apparent erosion and flooding. These areas {{are found in}} barangays Diteki and Ditumabo along the Diteki River. Around 384 ha or 0.7% of the municipalities land area is covered by this landform.|$|E
50|$|Camellias {{should be}} {{planted in the}} shade in organic, {{somewhat}} acidic, semi-moist but <b>well</b> <b>drained</b> soil. If the soil is not <b>well</b> <b>drained,</b> it can cause the roots to rot.|$|R

50|$|Congo grass {{does have}} certain stress {{tolerances}} that are disadvantages to poor farmers and breeding these {{out in the}} future would add significant value to this crop. It demands a relatively high fertility soil for good growth as well as adequate fertiliser use if there is persistent grazing or cutting of the crop. Heavy frosts will kill this crop and a light frost will make future regrowth very slow. Congo grass flourishes well in a <b>well</b> <b>drain</b> soil and has a poor tolerance to floods and heavy rains.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{should be}} potted in a <b>well</b> <b>drain</b> medium such as medium fir bark. Plants should be watered often while {{actively}} growing, but drainage should be excellent, and conditions around the roots should become rather dry between the watering. Water should be reduced in late autumn after new growth has matured; water should be reduced further in winter, particular for plants grown in dark, short-day conditions common in temperate latitudes. Plants should not, however, {{be allowed to}} dry out completely. Fertilizer should be reduced or eliminated until heavier watering is resumed in spring.|$|E
5000|$|Central City Stone Works was {{established}} by Bassett Brothers in 1864. They were succeeded by M. G. Fields & Company in 1867 who expanded the firm and opened a manufacturing facility on January 15, 1877. The company produced goods from English imported Portland Cement such as chimney, <b>well,</b> <b>drain,</b> sewer and culvert pipe. They also manufactured ornamental building stone, step stone and cement sidewalks, lawn vases [...] "of which there are many samples in our local parks and cemeteries." [...] The company office and works were located on South Onondaga Street and the branch office was located at James Finegan's Stone Yard {{on the corner of}} Olive and Fulton Streets. They were known as Central City Pipe Works by 1884 and were located at 51 West Railroad street and were producing miscellaneous types of pipes such as cement, sewer, drain, chimney and well pipes.|$|E
50|$|The soils of Clarks Hill are {{moderately}} <b>well</b> <b>drained</b> or <b>well</b> <b>drained.</b> They have brown {{sandy loam}} topsoils which are underlain by red clay. This fine-textured material may form a distinct layer or comprise the entire subsoil.http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx They support forests in which loblolly pine and shortleaf pine dominate.|$|R
50|$|Soils in Harlingen {{range in}} texture from fine sandy loam to clay. They are neutral to {{moderately}} alkaline with pH of 7.2 to 8.5 (most commonly around 8.2), and are moderately <b>well</b> <b>drained</b> or <b>well</b> <b>drained</b> in most cases. There are small areas of poorly drained, saline clays.|$|R

50|$|HSG Group B Soils with {{moderate}} infiltration rates when thoroughly wetted. These consist chiefly of soils that are moderately deep to deep, moderately <b>well</b> <b>drained</b> to <b>well</b> <b>drained</b> {{with moderate}}ly fine to moderately coarse textures. These soils have a moderate {{rate of water}} transmission (final infiltration rate of 0.15 to 0.30 in./h).|$|R
