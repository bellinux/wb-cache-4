5|$|During the 1980s, Lundgren had {{relationships}} with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella {{so much that}} they rented accommodation there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> their children as normal a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April Model {{met with}} Hitler {{to review and}} express his concern for {{reconnaissance}} information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at {{the shoulders of the}} salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk. He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel. Though in mid-April Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings. He asserted that the best course of action would be for the German forces to take the strategic defensive, ceding ground to allow the anticipated Soviet forces to extend themselves and allow the German panzer forces to counterattack in the type of fluid mobile battle at which they excelled. Convinced that the Red Army would deliver its main effort against Army Group South, he proposed to keep the left wing of the army group strong while moving the right wing back in stages to the Dnieper River, followed by a counterattack against the flank of the Red Army advance. The counteroffensive would continue until the Sea of Azov was reached and the Soviet forces were cut off. Hitler rejected this idea; he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up so much terrain, even temporarily.|$|E
5|$|The baby drifts downriver to {{a village}} of the Nelwyn (dwarves). She comes into the care of Willow Ufgood, a kind farmer and conjurer who hopes to become a real sorcerer; his wife Kiaya and his {{children}} {{fall in love with}} the baby immediately, and Willow too soon grows to love her as one of his own. During a town festival, the village is attacked by a Nockmaar hound which is quickly killed by the village warriors. The High Aldwin, the village sorcerer, learns about the baby and selects Willow, due to his devotion to the child, to accompany a party of volunteers returning the baby to the Daikini (human) people. At a crossroads, they find a human warrior named Madmartigan trapped in a crow's cage. The rest of the party <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the baby to Madmartigan and go home immediately, but Willow and his friend Meegosh refuse, so the others leave. After spending the night at the crossroads and meeting an army led by Airk Thaughbaer, an old friend of Madmartigan's marching against Bavmorda, Willow reluctantly decides to free Madmartigan so that he can take care of the baby for them.|$|E

25|$|When Shunryu {{had first}} come to Zoun-in, eight other boys were {{studying}} there. By 1918, {{he was the}} only one who stayed.

25|$|According to the Soviet law of 29 November 1939, all {{residents}} of the annexed area, referred to as citizens of former Poland, automatically acquired the Soviet citizenship.

25|$|Although the Danish Army {{had been}} forewarned of the attack, it was denied {{permission}} to deploy or prepare defensive positions as the Danish {{government did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Germans any provocation for their actions. All that was available to meet the land invasion were small and scattered units of the frontier guard and elements of the Jutland division. Believing attack was imminent, the troops were placed on full alert at 13:30 on 8 April.|$|E

25|$|There {{has existed}} in the Kingdom of Spain a {{persistent}} trend of republican thought, especially throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, that has manifested itself in diverse political parties and movements over the entire course {{of the history of}} Spain.

25|$|As more Palestinians regrouped in the South, Assad's anxiety grew, as he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Israel {{the pretext}} for another invasion.

Assad benefited from this alliance, which enabled him to exert {{a greater degree of}} control over Lebanese affairs through his local Lebanese allies. The benefit for Amal was the revenge for decades of Palestinian arrogance and gain further control over Shia-populated areas of Lebanon.|$|E

25|$|On November 29, 2012, a House {{subcommittee}} met {{to consider}} replacing the dollar bill. This action took {{place after the}} seventh Government Accountability Office report on the subject.

Recent budgets passed by Congress have included provisions to prevent the Treasury Department from spending any of its funds to redesign the one dollar bill, largely because of potential cost impacts on the vending machine industry.|$|E

Furthermore, Burnside was encountering difficulties in moving supplies through the rugged territory and was concerned that if he moved even farther from his supply base, he might get into serious difficulty.|$|E
