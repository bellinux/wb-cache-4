5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Dawson {{had decided}} that the two French troops should take the lead into Ouistreham, {{followed}} by the six British troops. The French were unopposed apart from some mortar rounds and machine gun fire as they neared their objective. No. 8 French Troop occupied houses at the front and sides of the Casino strong point. An assault to capture the Casino was driven back. While {{this was going on}} the other French troop, No. 1, approached the Casino from the rear. Taking up firing positions they too started to engage the strong point but their fire had almost no effect. The French commander Capitaine de frégate Philippe Kieffer <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> order an all out assault by both troops, when reports that British amphibious tanks were in Ouistreham reached him. Sending a guide to bring one forward, the tank arrived in front of the Casino and proceeded to destroy the German gun emplacements. Within 30 minutes of the tanks' arrival, all the strong point guns were silenced and No. 1Troop had assaulted and captured the objective. With its capture the French Commandos were now in control of the western suburbs of Ouistreham.|$|E

25|$|Al-Tabari {{reports that}} al-Mahdi <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> promote Harun as heir {{apparent}} ahead of Musa when he died, and adds {{by way of}} corroboration another report that al-Mahdi set off for Masabadhan in a great hurry. However, it may be doubted that al-Mahdi at the time shared the reporter's subsequent knowledge of his imminent demise there, {{and none of the}} other reported circumstances of his death suggest that he was in a hurry to go anywhere. On the contrary, the sources in general make it clear that he had gone to Masabadhan for recreation, and they occasionally say so explicitly. Al-Tabari does say explicitly that envoys were sent to the provinces, where they obtained the oath of allegiance not only to al-Hadi as caliph but also to Harun as heir apparent (wali l-'ahd) (38). This was probably the first occasion on which Harun was so acknowledged. Harun himself, with the advice of al-Rabi', sent out these envoys, and all of this must have been presented to his brother on his return as a fait accompli.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that Wood would take a brief break from the program to film the fifth installment in the Final Destination film series, Final Destination 5. Wood recorded several scenes in advance of her planned absence. In May 2012, when The Bold and the Beautiful was shooting [...] Hope and Liam's wedding on location in Italy, Wood performed her own stunts in a drowning scene. Wood learned about her Daytime Emmy nomination just before filming a scene in the Adriatic sea, stating, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> shoot a scene in the Adriatic sea in Italy.

500|$|Potemkin {{argued with}} Suvorov and Catherine herself, who were both anxious to assault Ochakov, which the Turks twice managed to supply by sea. Finally, on 6 December, the assault began and {{four hours later}} the city was taken, a coup for Potemkin. Nearly ten {{thousand}} Turks had been killed {{at a cost of}} (only) two-and-a-half thousand Russians. Catherine wrote that [...] "you [...] have shut the mouths of everyone... show magnanimity to your blind and empty-headed critics". Potemkin then visited the naval yard at Vitovka, founded Nikolayev, and traveled on to St. Petersburg, arriving in February 1789. In May he left once more for the front, having agreed contingency plans with Catherine should Russia be forced into war with either Prussia or the upstart Poland, which had recently successfully demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from its territory. (Catherine herself <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> change favorites for the final time, replacing Dmitriev-Mamonov with Platon Zubov.) Back on the Turkish front, Potemkin advanced towards the fortress of Bender on the Dniester river.|$|E

500|$|Earl Sigurd {{had a hard}} {{battle against}} Kerthialfad, and Kerthialfad came on so fast that he laid low all {{who were in the}} front rank, and he broke the array of Earl Sigurd right up to his banner, and slew the banner-bearer. Then he got another man to bear the banner, and there was again a hard fight. Kerthialfad smote this man too his death blow at once, and so on one after the other all who stood near him. Then Earl Sigurd called on Thorstein the son of Hall of Sida, to bear the banner, and Thorstein <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> lift the banner, but then Asmund the White said, [...] "Don't bear the banner! For all they who bear it get their death." [...] "Hrafn the Red!" [...] called out Earl Sigurd, [...] "bear thou the banner." [...] "Bear thine own devil thyself," [...] {{answered}} Hrafn. Then the earl said, [...] "`Tis fittest that the beggar should bear the bag;'" [...] and with that he took the banner from the staff and put it under his cloak. A little after Asmund the White was slain, and then the earl was pierced through with a spear.|$|E
500|$|The first issue, dated August 1938, {{appeared}} on newsstands in May of that year. It contained [...] "Survival" [...] by Arthur J. Burks {{as the lead}} novel; this was well received by the readers, and did not contain any sexual content. The first couple of issues contained several stories that did little to offend readers, but they also contained two stories by Henry Kuttner, who was selling regularly to the Goodmans' other publications. Erisman and the Goodmans had asked Kuttner to spice up his submissions to Marvel Science Stories. He obliged with [...] "Avengers of Space" [...] in the first issue, which included [...] "scenes of aliens lusting after unclothed Earth women", {{in the words of}} sf historian Mike Ashley, and [...] "The Time Trap" [...] in the second issue. Reader reaction was strongly negative: a typical letter, from William Hamling, later to become a publisher and editor of science fiction magazines in his own right, commented, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> write you a letter of complete congratulations when my eyes fell upon Kuttner's [...] "The Time Trap". All I can say is: PLEASE, in the future, dislodge such trash from your magazine". In addition to these two stories published under Kuttner's name, there were two more stories in the same two issues by him under pseudonyms which were equally offensive to readers such as Hamling.|$|E
500|$|The {{second half}} {{started off with}} Crayston briefly taking {{on the role of}} a forward, driving in a shot that Smith did well to save. Arsenal's {{forwards}} followed this with a flowing move from James, Hulme and Bastin, with the final move resulting in Bastin heading just wide of the post. Although play in the first half was relatively equal, in the second half Arsenal were the superior side, simply outclassing the Second Division Sheffield United. In the 74th minute a movement was started by James, who passed the ball to Bastin. Bastin dribbled the ball past Hooper before crossing the ball into the centre for Drake, who drove the ball into the roof of the net with his left foot. Moments after the goal United were on the attack, Barton broke down the right wing, crossing the ball in for Dodds who, finding his marker out of position, headed the ball against the bar. Dodds later said in an interview, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> direct the ball down into the net when a wee fellow called Wilf Copping went up behind me and, in striving to get to the ball, punched me in the back. This had the unfortunate effect of knocking my head backwards so the ball thudded against the crossbar instead of nestling itself {{in the back of the}} net. But for that, who knows, things might have turned out different." [...] Arsenal won the game with a single goal, the match having been mostly full of positive play and relatively free of fouls, although Drake was penalised on five occasions for using his elbows too much.|$|E

2500|$|Owen Chadwick, a {{professor}} of history at Cambridge, having studied the papers of D'Arcy Osborne, the British ambassador to the Vatican during the war, argued that the British Political Warfare Executive (PWE) [...] "found it excellent propaganda to put it about that Hitler <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> kidnap the Pope". The British propaganda office fabricated at least two German wireless broadcasts in support of the theory, building upon a pre-existing [...] "rumour". First, on October 9, 1943 the British released a fake German broadcast claiming that all preparations had been made for such a kidnapping. Then, two days later, another falsified transmission stated that the Lichtenstein Castle in Württemberg was ready to imprison the Pope and cardinals.|$|E

[...] In early September, Peenemünde machinery and personnel for production (including Alban Sawatzki, Arthur Rudolph, and about ten engineers) were moved to the Mittelwerk, which also received machinery and personnel from the two other planned A-4 assembly sites.

2500|$|At about 6:00 p.m. on Saturday evening, Virgil and Dante {{begin their}} escape from Hell by clambering down Satan's ragged fur, feet-first.

Dante is confused as to how, after about an hour and a half of climbing, it is now apparently morning. Virgil explains that as a result of passing through the Earth's center into the Southern Hemisphere, which is twelve hours ahead of Jerusalem, the central city of the Northern Hemisphere (where, therefore, it is currently 7:30 p.m.).|$|E

[...] He scored first blood, {{which was an}} {{important}} occasion in bare-fist boxing; there were bets made on who would draw first blood. [...] But as the rounds went on, Donnelly's strength began to tell. [...] Hall would slip down onto his knee, without being in any danger. This was a tactic, because once he went down the round was over, he got a 30-second rest, and came back refreshed. [...] He was doing this just a bit too often for Donnelly's liking, and at one stage, Donnelly <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> lash out when he was down, and his second shouted out an admonishment that Dan would lose the fight if he did so.

In 2013, Wood garnered her second consecutive nomination in that category at the 40th Daytime Emmy Awards, in which she submitted the scenes where Steffy surprises Liam (Scott Clifton) by presenting him with signed annulment papers. In May 2013, news broke that Wood had opted not to renew her contract with the show in order to take another break. A representative for the show stated: [...] " [...] is taking short a break, as she has done in the past, from B. She remains as the character of 'Steffy Forrester' and is continuing to tape, currently with episodes airing through July 2013 and then beyond". It was later announced that Wood has decided to remain with the series on a recurring basis.

2500|$|Bertie Meyer, a backer {{of plays}} whose {{association}} with Christie's stage works dated back to Alibi in 1928, {{signed a contract}} to produce The Hollow in 1950 and plans were made with Christie's agent, Edmund Cork, to open the play in London {{to coincide with the}} start of the Festival of Britain. These plans came to nothing and Christie was annoyed at the treatment she was starting to receive from Meyer on this and his slow response to staging another play she had written, Towards Zero. Meyer [...] turned it down as he believed that it would be too difficult to cast, although it has been speculated that the anti-Semitism in the novel was the primary reason, him being Jewish. During the year, Peter Saunders, a young and new theatrical producer had sustained a significant loss when he staged an adaptation by Dan Sutherland of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1913 book, The Poison Belt. Desperate to make up these losses, he cast around for a play that he could take on tour which would not involve too much expense and which would be sure to attract a paying audience. Charles and Toy's adaptation of Christie's Murder at the Vicarage <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> finish a four-month run at the Playhouse Theatre and, desperate to minimise his costs, he hit upon the idea that the name of the actors who starred in the production wouldn't really matter as Christie herself was enough of a public name to attract the audience. He therefore deliberately advertised the play as Agatha Christie's [...] "Murder at the Vicarage" [...] rather than [...] "Murder at the Vicarage" [...] by Agatha Christie. This small piece of showmanship worked. He recouped his losses and, more importantly, brought himself to the attention of Christie who, annoyed with the slow progress of Bertie Meyer, gave The Hollow to Saunders instead.|$|E
