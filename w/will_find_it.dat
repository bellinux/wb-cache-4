5000|$|... "Love <b>Will</b> <b>Find</b> <b>Its</b> Way to You" [...] is {{the title}} of a song written by Dave Loggins and J.D.

500|$|There {{are many}} ways to collect Liberty Head double eagles. [...] Some, wishing only a few pieces, may choose one each of the three major types, or seek pieces from the five mints that struck them. Carson City double eagles are highly popular.

500|$|Notorious {{scenes in}} the play include [...] "the china scene", a {{sustained}} double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection {{with two of his}} lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner [...] "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it lest I should beg some. But I <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> out, and have what I came for yet" [...] (IV.iii.110).
