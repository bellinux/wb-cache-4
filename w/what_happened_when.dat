In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his {{high-tech}} underground laboratory in his Ferrari 288 GTO during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a particle accelerator, attempting to reconstruct <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>when</b> the universe was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren, alien planet.|$|E

It is revealed {{that he is a}} paedophile who has been grooming and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery.

5|$|<b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>when</b> the Spanish galleys {{came under}} fire of the English ships differs {{depending}} on sources: from one side it is asserted that the San Felipe was nearly battered into submission by Victory's guns and she was only able to escape when the other galleys came up in support drawing Victory's and Hopes fire. On the other hand, it is also claimed that Spinola's galleys succeeded in passing almost unscathed between the English ships by rowing at full strength. Mansell decided on creating as much damage as possible; instead of concentrating on one galley, he ordered his guners to blaze away at anything they saw in the moonlight {{and as a result}} be believed that damage was inflicted on most of the galleys. A number of galleys slaves leapt into the sea from the damaged ships - a few even made it to shore where they were captured and interrogated at Dover Castle. By the time both fleets reached Goodwin Sands the Spanish galleys started to retreat in desperation for the Flemish coast. A gale was now blowing strongly from the West which also hampered Spanish attempts and they were hotly pursued by the English ships and soon the gunfire warnings were signals for the Dutch to engage.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to avoid {{cultural}} friction similar to <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>when</b> Euro Disney Resort opened in France, Disney has taken efforts to make this new park reflect the local culture.

500|$|The anime's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by the principle purpose of the Nameless: to suffer in battle for the goals of others. A subtitle attached to the project during development was [...] "The Road to Kubinka", which referenced the Kubinka Tank Museum in Moscow. The game's main theme was how the characters regained their sense of self when stripped of their names and identities, along with general themes focused on war and its consequences. While making the anime, the production team were told by Sega to make it as realistic as possible, with the consequence that the team did extensive research into aspects such as <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>when</b> vehicles like tanks were overturned or damaged. Due to it being along the same timeline as the original game and its anime television adaptation, the cast of Valkyria Chronicles could make appearances, which pleased the team.

Until the letter arrived, Toyah had been piecing her life back together by getting her job back at the Rovers and starting a romance with Sam. Of how Toyah felt about the letter, Taylor told Adrian Lobb from Inside Soap, [...] "By the time Toyah gets the letter, she has grown a little stronger. But it comes as a complete surprise. Toyah doesn't trust Phil, obviously, and she thinks he's playing games. While part of her wants to confront him about the attack, there's another side of her that wants to let it go, and just leave it to the courts to deal with him." [...] Toyah agreed to Phil's request to visit him and Taylor said that Toyah believed that seeing Phil in person would help her {{to come to terms with}} <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> <b>When</b> Toyah came face to face with Phil, her first thought was how pathetic he looked.
