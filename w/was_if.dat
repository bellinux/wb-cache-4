5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner <b>was</b> <b>if</b> the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E
5|$|Ifs origins can {{be traced}} to 1948 and 1949, when Raymond Palmer founded two {{magazines}} while working at Ziff-Davis in Chicago: Fate and Other Worlds. Fate published articles about occult and supernatural events, while Other Worlds was a science-fiction magazine. The two were sufficiently successful to attract the notice of James L. Quinn, a New York publisher. When Ziff-Davis moved to New York City in late 1950, Paul W. Fairman, a prolific writer, went with them, and was soon in touch with Quinn, who decided to found a pair of magazines modelled after Palmer's. One was a nonfiction magazine entitled Strange; the other <b>was</b> <b>If.</b>|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come to a quick end <b>was</b> <b>if</b> there was a new president.|$|E

5|$|On the April 8 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Christian was {{defeated}} by Alberto Del Rio in a number one contender's match for the World Heavyweight Championship after a distraction from Brodus Clay. After Edge's sudden retirement from wrestling on the April 15 episode of SmackDown, Christian won a 20-man battle royal to determine who will face Del Rio for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship at Extreme Rules, where Christian defeated Del Rio to win the World Heavyweight Championship. On the May 6 episode of SmackDown, Christian lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Randy Orton. At the Over The Limit pay-per-view event, he failed to regain the championship from Orton. On the June 3 episode of SmackDown, Christian was the Special Referee for a World Heavyweight Championship defense by Orton against Sheamus. Orton went on to successfully defend the title. After the match, Christian hit Orton with the title belt, turning heel {{for the second time}} since 2005. At Capitol Punishment, Christian faced Orton for the World Heavyweight championship once again, however he failed to capture the title. At Money in the Bank, Christian won the World Heavyweight Championship, after Orton was disqualified for kicking him in the groin; the stipulation <b>was</b> <b>if</b> Orton was disqualified or the referee made a bad call, he would lose the title. At SummerSlam, Christian lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Orton in a No Holds Barred match. On the August 26 episode of SmackDown, special guest General Manager Bret Hart announced that Christian would face Orton in a steel cage match on the August 30 episode of SmackDown for the championship, in which Christian went on to lose the encounter, thus ending the feud. Christian then began feuding with Sheamus, leading to a match between the two at the Hell in a Cell and Vengeance pay-per-views, both of which Christian lost.|$|E
5|$|Peckham laid {{stress on}} discipline, which often {{resulted}} {{in conflict with}} his clergy. His first episcopal act was calling a council at Reading in July 1279 to implement ecclesiastical reform, but Peckham's specifying that a copy of Magna Carta should be hung in all cathedral and collegiate churches offended the king as an unnecessary intrusion into political affairs. Another ruling was on non-residence of clergy in their livings. The only exception Peckham was prepared to make on non-residence <b>was</b> <b>if</b> the clerk needed to go abroad to study. At the Parliament of Winchester in 1279, the archbishop compromised and Parliament invalidated any regulation of the council dealing with royal policies or power. The copies of Magna Carta were taken down. One reason the archbishop may have backed down {{was that he was}} in debt to the Italian banking family of the Riccardi, who also were bankers to Edward and the pope, and Peckham was under threat of excommunication from the pope unless he repaid the loans.|$|E
5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required <b>was</b> <b>if</b> homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted {{out of a sense of}} paternalism.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Cage {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Samoa Joe. The added stipulation to this bout <b>was</b> <b>if</b> Joe lost, he {{would be forced to}} retire from professional wrestling forever. Frank Trigg provided commentary for this match. The match was primarily technical, with each combatant switching through various holds and submission maneuvers. One such submission was the Figure-Four Leglock, which Angle applied to Joe. Angle was forced to release the hold when Joe grabbed the bottom rope. Joe then applied a Boston Crab, before switching to an STF, which Angle countered into an Ankle Lock. Following the hold being broken, Angle performed his signature Olympic Slam maneuver on Joe for a near-fall. Later, Joe applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission on Angle, which was forced to be released when Angle grabbed the bottom rope. The match finally came to a conclusion when Joe lifted up Angle and slammed him to the mat back-first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then covered for the pinfall at 17 minutes and 45 seconds to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the first time.|$|E

Due to the regulations, it only acted as a ground handling agent for overseas airlines, the largest being Cathay Pacific.|$|E
25|$|Abe, and indirectly, the Tokugawa shogun, were {{disturbed}} by Nariakira’s removal from responsibility over the Ryūkyū Western Trade Treaty crisis because their policy concerning {{the crisis was}} predicated on their trust in him, not in his father or Zusho Hirosato.

25|$|In Lee's book Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going, he {{was asked}} about {{homosexuality}} again. The questions touched on his personal views of LGBT, LGBT people adopting children and hurdles for LGBT Singaporeans. He was asked how he would react if one of his grandchildren turned out to be homosexual. He replied that he would accept his grandchild because homosexuality is a genetic code. One of the questions asked <b>was</b> <b>if</b> LGBT couples could adopt children. He did not think LGBT people were suited to bringing up a child as they have no maternal instinct aroused by the process of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the third book is described as {{the climax of the}} whole work. This is the exposition of the mystical passage of the Chariot found in Ezekiel (cf. Merkavah mysticism). Traditionally, Jewish law viewed this passage as extremely sensitive, and in theory, did not allow it to be taught explicitly at all. The only way to learn it properly <b>was</b> <b>if</b> a student had enough knowledge and wisdom to be able to interpret their teacher's hints by themselves, in which case the teacher was allowed to teach them indirectly. In practice, however, the mass of detailed rabbinic writings on this subject often crosses the line from hint to detailed teachings.|$|E
