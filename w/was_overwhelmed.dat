5|$|By {{tradition}} dated {{back to the}} Byzantine era, {{the king}} was regarded by the Church {{as part of her}} head. On the issue of Church's Autocephaly and his role as king within the Church, Otto <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by the arcana of Orthodox Church doctrine and popular discontent with his Roman Catholicism (while the Queen was Protestant).|$|E
5|$|Gen. Howard, {{witnessing}} this disaster, sent forward {{an artillery}} battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr's reserve force, under Col. Charles Coster. Coster's battle line {{just north of}} the town in Kuhn's brickyard <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by Hays and Avery. He provided valuable cover for the retreating soldiers, but at a high price: of Coster's 800 men, 313 were captured, as were two of the four guns from the battery.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Taejon (14–21 July 1950) was {{an early}} battle of the Korean War, between American and North Korean forces. Forces of the United States Army {{attempted}} to defend {{the headquarters of the}} 24th Infantry Division. The 24th Infantry Division <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by numerically superior forces of the Korean People's Army (KPA) at the major city and transportation hub of Taejon. The 24th Infantry Division's regiments were already exhausted from the previous two weeks of delaying actions to stem the advance of the KPA.|$|E

5|$|The Gengshi Emperor (r.23–25 AD), a {{descendant}} of Emperor Jing (r.157–141 BC), attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang'an as his capital. However, he <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by the Red Eyebrow rebels who deposed, assassinated, and replaced him with the puppet monarch Liu Penzi. Emperor Gengshi's brother Liu Xiu, known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu (r.25–57 AD), after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Kunyang in 23 AD, was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor.|$|E
5|$|Troilus, however, {{after he}} had learned of his father's {{intention}} {{to go ahead and}} release Briseida and restore her to the Greeks, <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> and completely wracked by great grief, and almost entirely consumed by tears, anguished sighs, and laments, because he cherished her with the great fervour of youthful love and had been led by the excessive ardour of love into the intense longing of blazing passion. There was no one of his dear ones who could console him.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 6 April, the JNA {{launched}} a fresh attack towards Kupres and Kupreška Vrata, leaving {{the bulk of}} the 13th Partisan Brigade in reserve and employing the rest of the force at the plateau. The artillery was used so intensely that the 30th Partisan Division had to request resupply of its depleted stocks. The most effective part of the advance was the 9th Tank Company, which quickly pushed through the defensive positions, bypassed Zlosela and reached Olovo. In contrast, the Bosnian Croat TO command in Kupres <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by the complexity of the situation and could not track which units it had at its disposal—even losing track of units physically near the command post.|$|E

5|$|Buenos Aires and Montevideo {{successfully}} resisted two British invasions. In 1806, a small British army led by William Carr Beresford seized Buenos Aires {{for a brief}} time; a Montevidean army led by Santiago de Liniers liberated the city. The following year, {{a larger}} army seized Montevideo, but <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> {{by the forces of}} Buenos Aires; the invaders capitulated and returned Montevideo to the viceroyalty. There was no aid from Spain during either invasion. Liniers organized criollo militias during the preparations for the second invasion, in spite of the prohibition against them. The Patricios Regiment, led by Cornelio Saavedra, was the biggest criollo army. These events gave criollos military power and political influence {{that they did not have}} before and, since the victory was achieved without any help from Spain, it boosted criollo confidence in their independent capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In 468, Leo chose Basiliscus {{as leader}} of the famous {{military}} expedition against Carthage. The invasion of the kingdom of the Vandals {{was one of the greatest}} military undertakings recorded in the annals of history, a combined amphibious operation with over ten thousand ships and one hundred thousand soldiers. The purpose of the operation was to punish the Vandal king Geiseric for the sacking of Rome in 455, in which the former capital of the Western Roman Empire <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed,</b> and the Empress Licinia Eudoxia (widow of Emperor Valentinian III) and her daughters were taken as hostages.|$|E
5|$|In late 1993 Shonekan's {{caretaker}} regime <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by {{the military}} coup of General Sani Abacha, who used military force on a wide scale to suppress the continuing civilian unrest. He shifted money to offshore accounts in western European banks and defeated coup plots by bribing army generals. In 1995 the government hanged environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa on trumped-up charges {{in the deaths of}} four Ogoni elders. Lawsuits under the American Alien Tort Statute against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of Shell's Nigerian operation, settled out of court with Shell continuing to deny liability.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not long}} before the PVA 173rd Regiment {{attacked}} the western and the southern perimeter, while the 172nd Regiment struck the hills on the northern perimeter. Despite the preparations, the understrength garrison <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed,</b> with the Chinese opening several gaps in the defenses and reaching the rear areas. The resulting chaos, however, caused a breakdown in discipline among the Chinese soldiers, who began looting food and clothing instead of exploiting the situation. The defending Americans managed to destroy the Chinese forces in counterattacks, while a breakdown of communications between the Chinese regiments allowed the gaps to close. When the fighting stopped, the Chinese had only gained the East Hill on the northern perimeter. Another attack was planned for the night of 29 November, but air raids by VMF-542 broke up the Chinese formations before it could be carried out.|$|E
5|$|Payton's legacy {{continues}} through the charitable Walter and Connie Payton Foundation. His own appeals—and after his death, his foundation's—for {{greater awareness of}} the need for organ donations are widely credited with bringing national attention to the problem. After his appeals, donations in Illinois skyrocketed, and the regional organ bank of Illinois <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> with calls. In response, the City of Chicago inserted organ donation requests into city-vehicle-registration mailings in early 2000, and by August 2000, 13,000 people had signed on to the program. The foundation continues to run a program that Payton organized to donate toys to underprivileged children across the Chicago area each Christmas. The family established the Walter Payton Cancer Fund in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the lack}} of {{information}} about homosexuality in scholarly texts, another forum for learning about lesbianism was growing. A paperback book titled Women's Barracks describing a woman's experiences in the Free French Forces was published in 1950. It told of a lesbian relationship the author had witnessed. After 4.5 million copies were sold, it was consequently named in the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1952. Its publisher, Gold Medal Books, followed with the novel Spring Fire in 1952, which sold 1.5 million copies. Gold Medal Books <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> with mail from women writing about the subject matter, and followed with more books, creating the genre of lesbian pulp fiction.|$|E

5|$|The four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, {{moved to}} the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw {{identical}} scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent. A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1–0 half-time lead. In the second half, {{the strength of the}} United States team <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6–1 to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} camp held 160 men and {{was later}} used to hold prisoners of war. Italian, but not German, prisoners were allowed to attend dances at the anti-aircraft camp at nearby Stiffkey. Near {{the end of the}} war, the camp was used to house East European refugees, and it was finally pulled down in 1948. Many of the wartime buildings were destroyed by the Royal Engineers in 1955, but the generator house was taken over by the coastguard service as an observation post. It was acquired by the NWT in 1983, and the upper part was used as a look-out, while the larger lower section became a beach café. The building <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by shingle in a storm in 2008 and subsequently demolished.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{was forced}} to regroup at Cheonan and oppose the North Korean forces again, and it suffered heavy casualties before being forced to withdraw after the Battle of Cheonan. The 24th Infantry Division would continue to fight in delaying actions {{such as this one}} for two more weeks until it <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> at the Battle of Taejon, however by that time the Pusan Perimeter would be in place, and other US divisions would be able to hold the line for several more months during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter until the Inchon Landings, when American forces would finally defeat the North Korean Army, ending {{the first phase of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|While the Dutch rearguard <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by British numbers, a {{more equal}} combat was being contested to the north. There the combat was centred around the two flagships, Duncan's Venerable {{engaging}} De Winter's Vrijheid 18 minutes after Monarch broke {{the line to}} the south. Duncan had originally intended to break the line between Vrijheid and the next ship Staaten Generaal under Rear-Admiral Samuel Story, but Story ensured {{that there was no}} gap between his vessel and the flagship to break through, and their combined fire was so dangerous to the advancing Venerable that Duncan instead cut through behind Staaten Generaal, raking Story's ship twice and causing it to drift off in confusion as Duncan engaged Vrijheid from the east.|$|E
5|$|Years after Gwen Stacy's death, it is {{revealed}} that Osborn had {{a one-night stand}} with Gwen after she <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by his charisma, which led to Gwen's pregnancy with her twin children Gabriel and Sarah. Osborn thus has three motives for killing Gwen; revenge against Spider-Man, to prevent Gwen talking of their affair and creating a scandal, and to take their children to raise by himself thus becoming his ideal heirs. Mary Jane Watson {{was the only person}} who knew of their liaison and their children's existence prior to Gwen's death and her eventual relationship with Peter, despising Osborn for his immoral behaviors long before through her later romance with Spider-Man discovering he is the villainous Green Goblin.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Belgrade, he began writing poetry {{at an early}} age and {{published}} a number of literary reviews under a pseudonym while he was still a teenager. He rose to prominence during the Balkan Wars, writing about his experiences in territories newly retaken from the Ottoman Empire. The outbreak of World War I interrupted Bojić's studies at the University of Belgrade and forced him to postpone marrying his girlfriend, Radmila Todorović. The couple were separated in the chaos of war, and Bojić left Belgrade with his family and relocated to Niš, where he worked as a military censor and wrote articles for a local newspaper to pay his family's bills. In October 1915, the Serbian Army <b>was</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by a combined Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German invasion and forced to retreat to neutral Greece via Albania. Bojić and his younger brother joined the exodus, marching for several weeks through Kosovo, Montenegro and northern Albania, where they were finally reunited with Bojić's fiancée. Bojić was not allowed to accompany his brother and fiancée on a ship destined for Italy because he was of fighting age, and had to continue marching to Greece without them.|$|E
