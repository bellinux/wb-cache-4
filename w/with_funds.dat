5|$|In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in Stockholm, {{where he}} married Greta Knutson, {{with whom he}} had a son, Christophe (born 1927). A former student of painter André Lhote, she was known for her {{interest}} in phenomenology and abstract art. Around the same period, <b>with</b> <b>funds</b> from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned Austrian architect Adolf Loos, a former representative of the Vienna Secession whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris. The rigidly functionalist Maison Tristan Tzara, built in Montmartre, was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples of African art. It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.|$|E

After Churchill's death, Lady Churchill surrendered her lease on the house and it was {{opened to the public}} by the Trust in 1966. A Grade I listed building, for its historical significance rather than its architectural merit, Chartwell has become among the Trust's most popular properties; some 232,000 people visited the house in 2016, the fiftieth anniversary of its opening.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} speed the {{dismantling}} of the third-class forts, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) that the guns and ammunition removed from the dismantled forts should be kept in storage. Fort Corcoran was chosen as one of the storage locations and thus avoided the immediate demise of the other third-class fortifications. By the end of August 1865, however, <b>with</b> <b>funds</b> running low, and no further appropriations likely, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Corcoran stored the cannon of the dismantled forts located south of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|Liberty Bell {{refers to}} one of two replicas in Portland, Oregon, United States, of the {{original}} Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. The first replica was purchased in 1962, and installed in the rotunda of City Hall in 1964. On November 21, 1970, it was destroyed in a bomb blast that also damaged the building's east portico. The second replica was installed outside of City Hall soon after the blast (c. 1972) <b>with</b> <b>funds</b> from private donations. It was constructed at the McShane Bell Foundry in Baltimore and dedicated on November 6, 1975. The bell is listed as a state veterans memorial by the Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs.|$|E

5|$|The statue was {{restored}} in 2006 <b>with</b> <b>funds</b> {{donated by the}} university's alumni from the Class of 1956. Approximately $150,000 in reunion campaign funds were used to restore the four historic gates on the university's historic Queens Campus and the William the Silent statue.

5|$|To this end, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) {{that the}} guns and {{ammunition}} removed from the dismantled forts {{should be kept in}} storage. Fort Greble was chosen as one of the storage locations. As a second-class fort, Fort Greble continued to receive regular maintenance and upkeep. By the end of August 1865, however, <b>with</b> <b>funds</b> running low, and no further appropriations likely, this work began to slack off. As the money ran out, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Yugoslav government provided Pećanac <b>with</b> <b>funds</b> and arms to raise guerrilla units in southern Serbia, Macedonia and Kosovo. He formed a detachment of about 300 men, {{mostly in the}} Toplica river valley in southern Serbia, which avoided destruction during the invasion. In {{the first three months}} after the surrender, Pećanac gathered more troops from Serb refugees fleeing Macedonia and Kosovo. However, his Chetniks fought only Albanian groups in the region, and did not engage the Germans. Following the uprising in the occupied territory in early July 1941, Pećanac quickly resolved to abandon resistance against the occupiers, {{and by the end of}} August had concluded agreements with the German occupation forces and the puppet government of Milan Nedić to collaborate with them and fight the communist-led Partisans. In July 1942, rival Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor, and his continuing collaboration with the Germans ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.|$|E

5|$|The Madras Stock Exchange was {{established}} in Madras city in 1920 with a strength of 100 members but gradually faded away and membership had reduced to three by 1923 when {{it had to be}} closed down. Nevertheless, the Madras Stock Exchange was successfully revived in September 1937 and was incorporated as the Madras Stock Exchange Association Limited. EID Parry, Binny and Co. and Arbuthnot Bank were the largest private-owned business corporations {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. EID Parry manufactured and sold chemical fertilizers and sugar while the Binnys marketed cotton garments and uniforms manufactured at its spinning and weaving facility, the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Otteri. Arbuthnot, owned by the Arbuthnot family, was the largest bank in the Presidency until its crash in 1906.

5|$|The eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568–1627) {{dominated}} {{the court of}} the Tianqi Emperor (r. 1620–1627) and had his political rivals tortured to death, mostly the vocal critics from the faction of the Donglin Society. He ordered temples built in his honor throughout the Ming Empire, and built personal palaces created <b>with</b> <b>funds</b> allocated for building the previous emperor's tombs. His friends and family gained important positions without qualifications. Wei also published a historical work lambasting and belittling his political opponents. The instability at court came right as natural calamity, pestilence, rebellion, and foreign invasion came to a peak. The Chongzhen Emperor (r. 1627–44) had Wei dismissed from court, which led to Wei's suicide shortly after.|$|E

5|$|The {{men came}} close to mutiny at Aux Cayes in February 1819 when MacGregor failed to produce the 80 silver dollars per man on arrival promised by his recruiters. MacGregor persuaded South American merchants in Haiti to support him <b>with</b> <b>funds,</b> weapons and ammunition, but then procrastinated and gave the order to sail for the island of San Andrés, off the Spanish-controlled Isthmus of Panama, only on 10 March. Going first to Jamaica to arrange {{accommodation}} for Josefa and Gregorio, MacGregor was almost arrested there on charges of gun-running. He joined his troops on San Andrés on 4 April. The delay had led to renewed dissension in the ranks that the stand-in commander Colonel William Rafter had difficulty containing. MacGregor restored morale by announcing that they would set out to attack Porto Bello on the New Granadian mainland the following day.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls were}} again {{restored}} under Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) and again under his successor Andronikos III Palaiologos (r. 1328–1341), when, on 12 February 1332, a major storm caused breaches {{in the wall}} and forced the seaward gates open. In 1351, when the empire was {{at war with the}} Genoese, John VI Kantakouzenos again repaired the walls, and even opened a moat in front of the wall facing the Golden Horn. Other repairs are recorded for 1434, again against the Genoese, and again in the years leading up to the final siege and fall of the city to the Ottomans, partly <b>with</b> <b>funds</b> provided by the Despot of Serbia, George Brankovic.|$|E

Construction of the GNP and the CCE began in July 1902 and proceeded quickly so that the UERL was able to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the GNP's and 75 per cent of the CCE's tunnels had been completed.|$|E
