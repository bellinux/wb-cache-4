50|$|After {{the tire}} has been cured, {{there are several}} {{additional}} operations. Tire uniformity measurement is a test where the tire is automatically mounted on <b>wheel</b> <b>halves,</b> inflated, run against a simulated road surface, and measured for force variation. Tire balance measurement is a test where the tire is automatically placed on <b>wheel</b> <b>halves,</b> rotated at a high speed and measured for imbalance.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1950s {{agriculture}} was {{the biggest}} employer, {{and most of the}} inhabitants earned their wage within the village. The municipality-crest is related to that time. The blue background reflects the water of the lakes and the rivers, the corn is a reminder of the agricultural history and the naturally grown power, and the <b>wheel</b> <b>halves</b> represent movement, momentum and drive.Today most of the people work in Bad Segeberg, Lübeck or Hamburg, and farming has been reduced to the hobby level or has died out.|$|E
5000|$|The Secret of Monkey Island {{offered a}} {{rotating}} <b>wheel</b> with <b>halves</b> of pirate's faces. The game showed a face {{composed of two}} different parts and asked when this pirate was hanged on a certain island. The player then had to match the faces on the wheel, and enter the year that appeared on the island-respective hole. Its sequel had the same concept, but with magic potion ingredients. Other games that employed the code wheel system include Star Control.|$|R

There I was, sawed in half and laying there in two pieces with solid steel blades going right through my waist, unable to move and nothing to do except wait to be put back {{together}} again. And then in they come and start <b>wheeling</b> my <b>halves</b> off in opposite directions. I was like 'hey, {{what are you guys}} doing?' At least they put me back together again afterwards - Although it was a while before I agreed to be sawed in half again." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDevelopment of railway {{transport}} strongly depends on reliable, energy effective cars. This paper shows the simulation results of with designed wheel pair {{for a new}} cars generation. Using the new design of a <b>wheel</b> will <b>halve</b> the power consumption for train traction; it will become possible to raise the axial load up to 35 tons and double the motion speed. Article investigates design and modeling of new wheel pair movement. Comparative mock-up runs of the three models of wheel pairs with changing {{the parameters of the}} wheel set-track system are performed. Research of wheel pair was conducted using behavior prototype (scale 1 to 20) and simulation model...|$|R
50|$|The pall {{reversed}} (that is, upside-down Y-shape) {{symbolizes the}} forks of the rivers Main and Aschaff, which, in a way, {{also makes the}} arms canting, as the community’s name is drawn from a fusion of these two rivers’ names. The stripes on the dexter (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) side come from the arms formerly borne by the Counts of Rieneck, to whom parts of the community historically belonged. The <b>halved</b> <b>wheel</b> comes from the Electorate of Mainz’s coat of arms, the community having belonged to this state until 1803. The tinctures azure (blue) in the escutcheon’s base and argent (silver) in the pall reversed are Bavaria’s colours, which have flown over Mainaschaff since 1816.|$|R
50|$|None of the {{original}} class survive, but a static replica of The Queen was commissioned by Tussauds for the Railways and Royalty exhibition at Windsor and Eton Central railway station. The replica loco was completed in December 1982 and displayed outside Steamtown in January 1983 (where it was constructed), before being transported by road to Windsor on 12 January 1983 and arriving on 14 January.The main frames, footplate, 'boiler', smokebox, cab and splashers were fabricated by Babcock's of Tipton. The tender was modified from an LBSCR C2x tender. Parts from a GWR tender, {{that came from the}} Dumbleton Hall Preservation Society, were used to provide the wheels for the front bogie and the real <b>wheels.</b> The top <b>halves</b> of the driving wheels do not exist, and were cast from 2 quarters, being bolted together to make a half, and the driving wheels also don't sit on the rail, so the loco could be wheeled into position on its front bogie and rear wheels.Some boiler fittings were obtained from the Great Western Society and sandblasted, and the dome and safety valve bonnet were made by Newcastle Metal Spinners.Tussaud's fitted smoke and steam generators, so steam was emitted from the cab, whistles, safety valves and smoke from the chimney. A sound unit was also fitted.|$|R
