5|$|An {{important}} symbol {{among the}} Nri religion was the omu, a tender palm frond, used to sacralize and restrain. It {{was used as}} protection for traveling delegations or safeguarding certain objects; a person or object carrying an omu twig was considered protected. The influence of these symbols and institutions extended well beyond Nri, and this unique Igbo socio-political system proved capable of controlling areas <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> villages or towns.|$|E
5|$|Back country skis: Designed for ski touring {{on natural}} snow conditions. Recommended lengths are between 150 and 195 centimeters for adult skiers, {{depending}} on {{height and weight}} of the user. Back country skis are typically heavier and <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> classic and skate skis; they often have metal edges for better grip on hard snow; and their greater sidecut helps to carve turns.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced plans to}} build a new bridge, a segmental concrete bridge <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> the original, over the Susquehanna River. In 2004, work began on building the new, six-lane bridge which cost $150 million. On May 16, 2007, a ribbon-cutting took place to mark the completion of the westbound direction of the bridge, which opened to traffic the following day. The eastbound direction of the bridge opened a month later.|$|E

5|$|One {{interpretation}} on how megalodon appeared {{was that}} it was a robust-looking shark, and may have had a similar build to the great white shark. The jaws may have been blunter and <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> the great white, and the fins would have also been similar in shape, though thicker due to its size. It may have had a pig-eyed appearance, in that it had deep-set and small eyes.|$|E
5|$|P. sinensis {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} species by numerous features of the skull. Adult skulls are smaller than those of P. mongoliensis and have less teeth. Uniquely, the premaxillary bone contacts the jugal (cheek) bone {{on the outside of}} the skull. The jugals flare out sideways, forming 'horns' proportionally <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> in any other known Psittacosaurus species except P. sibiricus and P. lujiatunensis. Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the eye, at the contact of the jugal and postorbital bones, a feature also seen in P. sibiricus. The mandible (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or fenestra, seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an underbite. The skull of an adult P. sinensis can reach 11.5centimeters (4.5in) in length.|$|E
5|$|The THSR 700T {{trainset}} {{is based}} on the 700 Series Shinkansen trainset used by JR Central and JR West in Japan. This marked the first time Shinkansen technology was exported to a foreign country. Customization was focused on adapting to Taiwan's climate and geography, and the nose shape was optimized for tunnels <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> those in Japan.|$|E
50|$|The optical {{parametric}} amplifier has a <b>wider</b> bandwidth <b>than</b> a -amplifier, {{which in turn}} has a <b>wider</b> bandwidth <b>than</b> an optical parametric oscillator because of white-light generation even one octave wide. Therefore, a subband can be selected and fairly short pulses can still be generated.|$|R

The nave {{measures}} 44feet 9inches long by 15feet 6inches wide (13.6 by 4.7m) and the chancel measures 32feet 9inches long by 20feet 6inches (10 by 6.25m) wide. The nave has three bays, and the chancel {{at the east}} end of the nave has two bays; it is slightly <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> the nave. The nave and the chancel have external buttresses.|$|E
5|$|While the Constitution of Congress Poland was {{relatively}} liberal in theory, {{and gave the}} Sejm significant powers (<b>wider</b> <b>than</b> those of the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw), in practice those competences were limited, as they were often not respected by the tsar. Jews and peasants lost rights they had previously enjoyed under the Duchy of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E
5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing response {{and are the}} most common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E
5|$|Neila's {{interactions}} with choreographers and dancers of different cultural backgrounds and traditions in Singapore inspired her {{to create new}} Indian dance steps based on classical foundations; for instance, her dance-drama Kannagi, staged for the Singapore Festival of Arts in 1998, {{was said to have}} stretched tradition to its limits and offered something to a range of audiences far <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> a traditional dance-drama would have done. Up to 2007, Neila had choreographed dance segments for the last 13 Chingay Parades, street parades held annually in Singapore as part of Chinese New Year festivities.|$|E

5|$|The {{blast furnace}} {{used at the}} Nyrstar Port Pirie lead smelter differs from most other lead blast {{furnaces}} in {{that it has a}} double row of tuyeres rather than the single row normally used. The lower shaft of the furnace has a chair shape with {{the lower part of the}} shaft being narrower than the upper. The lower row of tuyeres being located in the narrow part of the shaft. This allows the upper part of the shaft to be <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> the standard.|$|E
5|$|The floury {{baker is}} {{distinguished}} {{from a similar}} undescribed species A. sp. nr curvicosta (the little floury baker) by {{the structure of the}} male genitalia and an audibly distinct call. Members of Aleeta and Tryella are easily distinguished from other Australian cicadas as they lack tymbal covers, while the costal margin of their forewings gets larger toward the point where the wing is attached to the body. In these genera it is clearly <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> the costal vein.|$|E
5|$|The harbour from Church Point, {{where the}} two arms meet, to the Atlantic Ocean is {{referred}} to as Sheet Harbour. It is <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> either arm. It is approximately 11-15 metres (36-49 ft) deep at low tide. It gradually widens as it flows southward the Atlantic Ocean. After Church Point, it flows southeast-ward past the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port and west of the small community of Watt Section. It then curves and flows southwest-ward to southward toward the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with a blunt and rounded snout. Still, the head is much <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> the neck. The rostral scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. Across {{the top of the}} head, there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact the chin shields, of which there is only one pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E

These trails were {{pathways}} no <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> approximately , permitting single-file traffic. Many of the modern highways in the state follow the path of these old trails, including the Great Trail from Fort Pitt to Fort Detroit which is now US24 from Detroit to Toledo, Ohio. This trail connected with Braddock's Road which led to the Atlantic Coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the onefin electric ray is <b>wider</b> <b>than</b> long and almost circular in shape. The two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The eyes are small and protruding; the larger spiracles lie closely behind and have three small finger-like projections on their rims. The nostrils are placed rather close together, and between them is a long skirt-like flap of skin that reaches the mouth. The small and protrusible mouth is nearly straight and surrounded by prominent furrows. The teeth are tiny and pointed. There are five pairs of small gill slits on the underside of the disc.|$|E
