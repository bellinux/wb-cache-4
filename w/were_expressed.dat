5|$|The gods' complex {{characteristics}} <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> in {{myths and}} in intricate relationships between deities: family ties, loose groups and hierarchies, and combinations of separate gods into one. Deities' diverse appearances in art—as animals, humans, objects, and combinations of different forms—also alluded, through symbolism, to their essential features.|$|E
5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} after his death, Scott's status as tragic hero was unchallenged, and few {{questions}} were asked {{about the causes of}} the disaster which overcame his polar party. In the final quarter of the 20th century the expedition came under closer scrutiny, and more critical views <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> about its organization and management. The degree of Scott's personal culpability, and more recently, the culpability of certain expedition members, remain controversial.|$|E

5|$|In his {{monograph}} Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions, Deputy Administrator Seamans {{wrote that}} NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment {{was not to}} run a fire test on the Command Module before the plugs-out test. In the first episode of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph and Tragedy, Jim McDivitt said that NASA {{had no idea how}} a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> in the 2007 documentary film In the Shadow of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In tribal societies, kilim were woven {{by women}} at {{different}} stages of their lives: before marriage, in readiness for married life; while married, for her children; and finally, kilim for her own funeral, to be given to the mosque. Kilims thus had strong personal and social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for personal and family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> in the weaving motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, a comb, an earring, a trousseau chest, a jug, a hook.|$|E
5|$|Miller's character, {{joie de vivre}} {{and love}} of cricket <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> on the field during the tour, {{particularly}} in the tour games, when he played several carefree innings, hitting many sixes. He also showed his disdain for Bradman's obsession with annihilating the opposition. In one match against Essex, he deliberately {{allowed himself to be}} bowled first ball in protest against Australia's ruthless approach to batting; that day, his side set a world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket (721).|$|E

Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop nuclear weapons, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> in the Einstein-Szilard letter.

As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracked the volume of traffic that used Bus. US41. These volumes <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. In the department's last survey, conducted in 2004, there were 10,272vehicles per day using Washington Street between Lincoln Avenue and Front Street, the lowest traffic count for the trunkline. The highest volume was 19,036vehicles between McClellan and Lincoln Avenues, while the Front Street section received 16,309vehicles on an average day. The former business loop has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{missions}} established Western {{educational institutions}} in the Protectorates. Under Britain's policy of indirect rule and validation of Islamic tradition, the Crown did not encourage the operation of Christian missions in the northern, Islamic part of the country. Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education. By independence in 1960, regional differences in modern educational access were marked. The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present day. Imbalances between North and South <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> in Nigeria's political life as well. For instance, northern Nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936 whilst {{in other parts of}} Nigeria slavery was abolished soon after colonialism.|$|E

In 1999, Governor Gray Davis approved allocating $27million in federal funding to complete the freeway. Concerns <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> by local residents and municipal officials regarding the apparent priority of SR125 over SR905 in terms of funding, especially since SR125 was to be constructed as a toll road, and SR905 would compete with the toll road enterprise.

5|$|Mayer was {{introduced}} to topology by his colleague Vietoris when attending his lectures in 1926 and 1927 at a local university in Vienna. He was told about the conjectured result {{and a way to}} its solution, and solved the question for the Betti numbers in 1929. He applied his results to the torus considered as the union of two cylinders. Vietoris later proved the full result for the homology groups in 1930 but did not express it as an exact sequence. The concept of an exact sequence only appeared in print in the 1952 book Foundations of Algebraic Topology by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod where the results of Mayer and Vietoris <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> in the modern form.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made {{the development of}} an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939. Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5–10 kilograms of isotopically enriched uranium-235 was needed for a bomb instead of tons of un-enriched uranium and a neutron moderator (e.g. heavy water).|$|E

At the Pupin Laboratories at Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be achieved. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> in the Einstein-Szilard letter.

5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, the English {{began to}} {{consider}} themselves {{superior to the}} Welsh, Scots and Bretons. The English perceived themselves as civilised, economically prosperous and properly Christian, while the Celtic fringe was considered lazy, barbarous and backward. Following the invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, similar feelings <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> about the Irish, with the distinctions clarified and reinforced in 14th-century English legislation. The English also felt strongly about the foreign traders {{who lived in the}} special enclaves in London in the Late Middle Ages; the position of the Jews is described below, but Italian and Baltic traders were also regarded as aliens and were frequently the targets of violence during economic downturns. Even within England, different identities abounded, each with their own sense of status and importance. Regional identities could be important - men and women from Yorkshire, for example, had a clear identity within English society, and professional groups with a distinct identity, such as lawyers, engaged in open fighting with others in cities such as London.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company Ltd was {{established}} by a private Act of Parliament in 1853 to provide water to the residents of Cambridge and the surrounding area; by 1976, the population served had risen to approximately 275,000. With the rising demand, the company purchased a borehole outside Sawston, constructing pumping equipment and integrating the water from that borehole into their system in 1979. Tests undertaken both before the purchase, and in 1979, had demonstrated that the water was safe for public consumption. During the late 1970s, concerns <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> {{about the presence of}} perchloroethene (PCE) in water, and as a result a European Directive was issued in 1980 requiring nations of the European Community to establish maximum acceptable levels of PCE in water; the United Kingdom did this in 1982. PCE was discovered in the borehole; it was not tested for earlier because {{there was no need to}} regulate the levels. As a result, the Cambridge Water Company was forced to cease pumping the water, and instead find a new borehole elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher, sociologist, {{town planner}} and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932) coined the phrase Scottish Renaissance in his {{magazine}} Evergreen. He argued that technological development {{needed to be}} in parallel with the arts. These ideas were taken up by a new generation, led by the poet Hugh MacDiarmid who argued for a synergy between science and art, the introduction of modernism into art {{and the creation of}} a distinctive national art. These ideas <b>were</b> <b>expressed</b> in art in the inter-war period by figures including Stanley Cursiter (1887–1976), William McCance (1894–1970), William Johnstone (1897–1981) and Fergusson. Stanley Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and Futurism, as can be seen in his Rain on Princess Street (1913) and Regatta (1913). He went on to be a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney, director of the National Gallery of Scotland and proposed the creation of a National Gallery of Modern Art in 1930. Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism and probably played a major part in the formulation of MacDiarmid's thought. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings like Damaged Destroyer (1918). He co-operated with MacDiarmid on the journal Scottish Art and Letters and MacDiarmid quoted extensively from his work.|$|E
