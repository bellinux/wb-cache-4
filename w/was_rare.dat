50|$|A plant {{community}} can <b>be</b> <b>rare</b> even {{if none of}} the major species defining it <b>are</b> <b>rare.</b> This <b>is</b> {{because it is the}} association of species and relationship to their environment that may <b>be</b> <b>rare.</b> An example <b>is</b> the Sycamore Alluvial Woodland in California dominated by the California sycamore Platanus racemosa. The community <b>is</b> <b>rare,</b> being localized to a small area of California and existing nowhere else, yet the California sycamore <b>is</b> not a <b>rare</b> tree in California.|$|R
5|$|In earlier {{historical}} periods obesity <b>was</b> <b>rare,</b> and achievable {{only by a}} small elite, although already recognised as {{a problem}} for health. But as prosperity increased in the Early Modern period, it affected increasingly larger groups of the population.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon longiceps {{would have}} shared {{the sky with}} the giant-crested {{pterosaur}} Nyctosaurus. Compared to P. longiceps, which was a very common species, Nyctosaurus <b>was</b> <b>rare,</b> making up only 3% of pterosaur fossils from the formation. Also less common was the early toothed bird, Ichthyornis.|$|E
5|$|Female Quakers local to {{the area}} {{organized}} the meeting along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, {{who was not a}} Quaker. They planned the event during a visit {{to the area}} by Philadelphia-based Lucretia Mott. Mott, a Quaker, was famous for her oratorical ability, which <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> for non-Quaker women during an era in which women were often not allowed to speak in public.|$|E
50|$|As a {{quantitative}} example, suppose a collector has 1000 postage stamps, of which 300 are pretty and 100 <b>are</b> <b>rare,</b> with 30 being both pretty and rare. 10% {{of all his}} stamps <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> and 10% of his pretty stamps <b>are</b> <b>rare,</b> so prettiness tells nothing about rarity. He puts the 370 stamps which <b>are</b> pretty or <b>rare</b> on display. Just over 27% of the stamps on display <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> (100/370), but still only 10% of the pretty stamps <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> (and 100% of the 70 not-pretty stamps on display <b>are</b> <b>rare).</b> If an observer only considers stamps on display, she will observe a spurious negative relationship between prettiness and rarity {{as a result of}} the selection bias (that is, not-prettiness strongly indicates rarity in the display, but not in the total collection).|$|R

5|$|If Hahn's {{account is}} disregarded, the Mascarene parrot {{probably}} became extinct prior to 1800. The last account of wild specimens on Réunion {{is from the}} 1770s. It is thought that the Mascarene parrot went extinct in the wild while captive specimens still survived in Europe, since specimens {{are known to have}} lived there after the last mention of wild birds. In the 1790s, French author, explorer, and naturalist François Levaillant stated that the bird <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> and that he had seen three specimens in France.|$|E
5|$|In another {{stable isotope}} analysis, {{half of the}} Beringian wolves {{were found to be}} muskox and caribou specialists, and the other half were either horse and bison specialists or generalists. Two wolves from the full-glacial period (23,000–18,000 YBP) were found to be mammoth specialists, {{but it is not clear}} if this was due to {{scavenging}} or predation. The analysis of other carnivore fossils from the Fairbanks region of Alaska found that mammoth <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> in the diets of the other Beringian carnivores.|$|E
5|$|It {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that Nicholas was born later than the 1230s, as he was styled Magister by 1259, indicating that by that date he possessed a Master's degree.

5|$|Justinian and {{his successors}} modernized {{frontier}} fortifications throughout the century. The example at Qasr ibn Wardan (564) {{in the desert}} of eastern Syria is particularly impressive, containing a governor's palace, barracks, and a church built with techniques and to plans possibly imported from Constantinople. The church dome is unusual in that the pendentives sprang from an octagonal drum, rather than the four main arches, and {{in that it was}} made of brick, which <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Konsu, and {{monolithic}} pillars with phallic representation {{have also}} been discovered in Madagascar. In ancient Maya, phallic architecture <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> but Uxmal in particular has {{a considerable number of}} phallus-like architectural pieces. It contains a temple known as the Temple of the Phallis and phallic sculptures and motifs.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to {{the very nature of}} Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried men and women to intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, off-limit to visitors and suitors. It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.|$|E

5|$|Race meetings, concert parties (including drag acts– good drag queens were {{in great}} demand), {{trips to the}} seaside and {{football}} matches were organised to keep men entertained. There were various unofficial publications, including the “Wipers Times”– these give an insight into the views of ordinary soldiers and junior officers. Overt patriotism <b>was</b> <b>rare,</b> and politicians such as (Prime Minister) Asquith and Ramsay MacDonald (an opponent of the war, later Labour Prime Minister) were satirised.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of a woman writing {{in the press and}} composing poetry in this dark era was a significant event. Our recent history shows that it <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> for even men to read and write; her appearance in these dark nights was thus like a bright star {{in the center of the}} heavens.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} among the first two launch titles for the Nintendo64, but missed the release window. Gold released in North America on November 25, 1996, and in other countries the following year, on May 9, 1997. Its soundtrack received a compact disc release, which <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> for Western video games in the 1990s.

40|$|I criticize Kuhn’s (1962 / 1970) taxonomic incommensurability thesis as follows. (i) His {{argument}} {{for it is}} neither deductively sound nor inductively correct. (ii) It clashes with his account of scientific development that employs evolutionary theory. (iii) Even if two successive paradigms are taxonomically incommensurable, they have some overlapping theoretical claims, as selectivists point out. (iv) Since scientific revolutions <b>were</b> <b>rare</b> in the recent past, as historical optimists observe, they will also <b>be</b> <b>rare</b> in the future. Where scientific revolution <b>is</b> <b>rare,</b> taxonomic incommensurability <b>is</b> <b>rare,</b> and taxonomic commensurability is common. For these reasons, taxonomic commensurability rather than incommensurability should be advanced as an image of science...|$|R
5|$|Travel to {{the area}} before it was a {{national}} park <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, {{and the absence of}} real roads in southern Utah. Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910, and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917 leading to the Grotto, short of the present road that now ends at the Temple of Sinawava.|$|E
5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E
5|$|After his graduation, Wai {{enlisted in}} the Hawaii National Guard and was called into active duty before the United States' {{entrance}} into World War II. He received a commission as an officer and completed Officer Candidate School in 1941. His commission <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> {{at a time when}} few Asian Americans were allowed to serve in combat leadership roles. He was eventually assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division with the rank of Captain.
