Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make it more likely to spin.

5|$|The scripted feud between James and Melina was rekindled {{during her}} photo op on Raw. At a house show in Paris, France on April 24, James won her third Women's Championship during a triple threat match that also {{involved}} Victoria. Since James pinned Victoria and not Melina, an immediate rematch was scheduled, in which James dropped the title back to Melina, {{giving her the}} shortest Women’s Championship reign in WWE history. James later received a rematch for the title at Backlash, but was unsuccessful. After Backlash, James <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> sporadic appearances on television, wrestling occasionally in tag-matches and rarely in singles competition. On the November 26 episode of Raw, James defeated Melina in a number one contender's match for Beth Phoenix's Women's Championship, setting up a title match between the two at Armageddon, in which Phoenix retained the title.|$|E
5|$|On July 17, 1962, the NYCTA {{announced}} that it had asked the city for money to build a $190,000,000 high-speed, non-stop subway line from Midtown to the Bronx. The line would have only operated during rush hours. It was estimated that if the funds {{were given to the}} project, it would be completed in 1970. The line would be a two-track line running from 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues to the Bronx, running under Central Park. Running non-stop for 6.5 miles, {{it would have been the}} longest continuous run in the subway system. The line, on its southern end, would connect to the BMT Broadway Line at Seventh Avenue near 59th Street and to the IND Sixth Avenue Line near 58th Street and Sixth Avenue. The line would then run through a deep tunnel under Central Park until 110th Street. There would be provisions for a future crosstown line under 76th Street to Queens. The line would then turn east and run along Madison Avenue to 138th Street. One branch would connect to the express track of the IRT Pelham Line, which would be converted to accommodate larger B Division trains. In the morning rush hour, trains from Pelham Park <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> express stops. A new stop would be built at 138th Street and Grand Concourse where transfers would have been available to the IRT White Plains Road and IRT Jerome Avenue Line trains. The second branch would continue under the Grand Concourse until 161st Street where it would connect to the IND Concourse Line at 161st Street. This connection would allow for the diversion of Concourse Line express trains onto the new line, allowing for the addition of an equal number of trains to the Washington Heights express service and provide relief to that line. The construction of this line was viewed as necessary to relieve the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.|$|E

50|$|Laboratory rats share origins {{with their}} cousins in domestication, the fancy rats.

25|$|The {{age of the}} {{universe}} is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> sense if the flat, static Minkowski spacetime conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, spacetime is curved in a way that corresponds to the expansion of space, as evidenced by Hubble's law. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.|$|E
25|$|Those in {{opposition}} of dam removal state that demolishing O'Shaughnessy Dam {{would take away}} a valuable source of clean, renewable hydroelectric power in the Kirkwood and Moccasin powerhouses; even if measures such as seasonal water diversion into the powerhouses were employed, it <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> up {{for a fraction of}} the original power production. The remaining deficit would likely have to be replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. The removal of the dam would be extremely costly, at least $3–10 billion, and the transport of the demolished material away from the dam site along the narrow, winding Hetch Hetchy Road would be a logistical nightmare with possible environmental impacts. Most importantly, San Francisco would lose its source of high-quality mountain water, and would have to depend on lower-quality water from other reservoirs – which would require costly filtration and re-engineering of the aqueduct system – to meet its needs.|$|E

Not satisfied with the amount of money Wetch handed over, they placed a bag over his head and beat him. Though he escaped the ordeal with only minor injuries, he promised himself he <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> one more road trip to gather a stake, and then he would quit. He made that final trip and used the money to open up a pool room with partner David Wagner, Jimmy's Pro Billiards in Columbia Heights, Minnesota.

Faith finds {{a piece of paper}} with the name [...] "Icarus" [...] on it in Pope's hand. Kate refuses to flee with Faith, saying it <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> her look guilty, and is arrested. From a former Runner, Jacknife, Faith learns that Pope's head of security, former wrestler Travis [...] "Ropeburn" [...] Burfield, may be connected to Pope's murder. Faith meets Lt. Miller, at Kate's behest, narrowly avoiding arrest. At Ropeburn's office, she overhears him setting up a meeting at a new place downtown. At the meeting, Ropeburn discovers Faith's presence and attacks her, but Faith gains the upper hand and throws him off the roof. As he is hanging above a long drop, she tries to interrogate Ropeburn, but before he can reveal anything he is killed by an unknown assassin.|$|E
500|$|After Edward's {{death on}} 6 July 1553 Northumberland {{undertook}} {{the enforcement of}} the King's will. Lady Jane Grey accepted the Crown only after remonstrances by her parents and parents-in-law. On 10 July the Duchess of Northumberland accompanied her son and daughter-in-law on their ceremonial entry into the Tower of London, where they were to reside {{for the rest of the}} short reign. According to Jane's own exculpatory letter to Queen Mary a few months later, Guildford now wanted to be made king. The young people agreed on having him declared king by Act of Parliament; but then Jane changed her mind and declared she <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> him a duke. [...] "I will not be a duke, I will be King", Guildford replied and went to fetch his mother. Furious, the Duchess took the side of her son, before she told him to leave the Tower and go home. Jane, however, insisted that he remain at court. According to her the Duchess also [...] "induced her son not to sleep with me any more", and it is clear from her writings that Jane disliked her mother-in-law.|$|E

500|$|The {{document}} was unilateral in form, describing only what Lobengula {{would do to}} prevent any of these conditions being broken. Shippard was dubious about this {{and the fact that}} none of the izinDuna had signed the proclamation, and asked Robinson if it would be advisable to negotiate another treaty. Robinson replied in the negative, reasoning that reopening talks with Lobengula so soon <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> him suspicious. Britain's ministers at Whitehall perceived the unilateral character of the treaty as advantageous for Britain, as it did not commit Her Majesty's Government to any particular course of action. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister, ruled that Moffat's treaty trumped Grobler's, despite being signed at a later date, because the London Convention of 1884 precluded the South African Republic from making treaties with any state apart from the Orange Free State; treaties with [...] "native tribes" [...] north of the Limpopo were permitted, but the Prime Minister claimed that Matabeleland was too cohesively organised to be regarded as a mere tribe, and should instead be considered a nation. He concluded from this reasoning that the Grobler treaty was ultra vires and legally meaningless. Whitehall soon gave Robinson permission to ratify the Moffat agreement, which was announced to the public in Cape Town on 25 April 1888.|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, {{four months}} before the release of Superman Returns, Warner Bros. {{announced}} a summer 2009 theatrical release date for a sequel, with Bryan Singer returning as director. Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, Sam Huntington, Frank Langella, and Tristan Lake Leabu were expected to reprise their roles, however, {{with the release of}} Superman Returns in July 2006, Warner Bros. was hesitant on moving forward with development. Warner Bros. President Alan F. Horn explained that Superman Returns was a very successful film, but that it [...] "should have done $500million worldwide. We should have had perhaps a little more action to satisfy the young male crowd." [...] Singer reacted incredulously to the studio complaints, saying, [...] "That movie made $400million! I don't know what constitutes under-performing these days..." [...] Filming was supposed to start in March 2008; no screenplay was ever written, but Singer would have titled it Man of Steel, with an interest in Darkseid as the main villain. Singer stressed {{that it would have been}} more action-packed than Superman Returns. while writer Michael Dougherty was interested in using Brainiac. [...] "In my mind, if the Kryptonians really were a space-faring race... it <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> sense that there would've been colonies and off-planet missions... other Kryptonians making their way to Earth seemed like a pretty big one.

500|$|It's {{human nature}} to look to {{external}} forces when faced with our own inadequacies but the ethicist is against this. Comparison is an esthetic exercise and {{has nothing to do}} with ethics and religion. He says, [...] "Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> him completely unhappy." [...] He also asks if a person [...] "absolutely in love can know if he is more or less in love than others." [...] He completes this thought later in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript and expands on looking inward in Practice in Christianity.The ethical and the ethical-religious have nothing to do with the comparative. … All comparison delays, and that is why mediocrity likes it so much and, if possible, traps everyone in it by its despicable friendship among mediocrities. A person who blames others, that they have corrupted him, is talking nonsense and only informs against himself. Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 549-550Comparison is the most disastrous association that love can enter into; comparison is the most dangerous acquaintance love can make; comparison is the worst of all seductions. Søren Kierkegaard, Works of Love (1847), Hong, p. 186 Lord Jesus Christ, our foolish minds are weak; they are more than willing to be drawn-and there is so much that wants to draw us to itself. There is pleasure with its seductive power, the multiplicity with its bewildering distractions, the moment with its infatuating importance and the conceited laboriousness of busyness and the careless time-wasting of light-mindedness and the gloomy brooding of heavy-mindedness-all this will draw us away from ourselves to itself in order to deceive us. [...] But you, who are the truth, only you, Savior and Redeemer, can truly draw a person to yourself, which you have promised to do-that you will draw all to yourself. Then may God grant that by repenting we may come to ourselves, so that you, according to your Word, can draw us to yourself-from on high, but through lowliness and abasement.
