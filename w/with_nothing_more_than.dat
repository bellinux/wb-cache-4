5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the middle of nowhere. During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E
5|$|An Enclosure Act is a {{parliamentary}} authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure {{is the name}} given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was {{acting on behalf of}} the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.|$|E

He afterwards moved to Lion Books, a small paperback publisher. Lion's Arnold Hano was his ideal editor, offering the writer essentially free rein about content, yet {{expecting him to}} be productive and reliable.

25|$|On 15 May 1948, the Egyptians {{attacked}} two settlements: Nirim, using artillery, armoured cars carrying cannons, and Bren carriers; and Kfar Darom using artillery, {{tanks and}} aircraft. The Egyptians attacks met fierce {{resistance from the}} few and lightly armed defenders of both settlements, and failed. On 19 May the Egyptians attacked Yad Mordechai, where an inferior force of 100 Israelis armed <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> rifles, a medium machinegun and a PIAT anti-tank weapon, held up a column of 2,500 Egyptians, well-supported by armor, artillery and air units, for five days. The Egyptians took heavy losses, while the losses sustained by the defenders were comparatively light.|$|E
25|$|Wise {{had been}} {{commander}} of the so-called Wise Legion, but his troops did not accompany him. The Legion was broken up, although {{he was able to}} retain two of his old regiments, the 46th and 59th Virginia. He also had three regiments of North Carolina troops, the 2nd, 8th, and 31st North Carolina, plus three companies of the 17th North Carolina. The men from North Carolina were ill-equipped and poorly clothed, often armed <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> their own shotguns. All told, the number came to about 1,400 infantrymen, but the number available for duty was smaller than that because the living conditions put as many as one-fourth of the command on the sick list.|$|E
25|$|Crosby's musical endeavors {{began at}} the age of 13, where he was noted in Guitar Player Magazine as a {{promising}} guitarist of the future. He often recorded home demos <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a guitar] and a drum machine, sometimes a bass player with him as well. He nearly signed onto a guitar-based label Shrapnel, but turned it down to work on his budding songwriting skills. Crosby eventually left Rancho Cotate High School in Rohnert Park, California, to do home study and begin his own band, which he dubbed VAST. Much like fellow alternative rock/industrial band Nine Inch Nails, Crosby was the only member but found a touring band who knew the songs well enough to play with him live.|$|E

25|$|Pulver battled back in {{the third}} round, {{successfully}} defending Penn's attempts {{to take him to}} the ground, and even scoring defensive takedowns on Penn. Pulver frustrated Penn <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> sheer will power, not only winning the later rounds, but out-grappling the world-renowned Penn. In the fifth round, Penn, frustrated and down on points, chose to stand and trade with Pulver. For the entire five minutes of the fifth round the two stood toe to toe exchanging strikes. With 45 seconds left in the round, a left hand from Pulver staggered Penn, who looked in trouble. However, Penn countered with a right kick straight to the groin, resulting in a 50-second time-out. Although the time-out gave Penn time to recover, when the bout was restarted, Pulver staggered him a second time with 20 seconds remaining. However, the round drew to a conclusion and the fight went into the judges' hands.|$|E
500|$|According to John Coplans's Roy Lichtenstein, {{the artist}} {{was fascinated by the}} drawings: [...] "isolating the woman out of the context of the {{painting}} seemed to Lichtenstein to be such an oversimplification of a complex issue as to be ironical in itself"; the oversimplification referred to was Loran's representing Cézanne's work <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> black lines. The work marked the first of Lichtenstein's [...] "artistic appropriations of the canonical works of Modernism" [...] that resulted from his realization of the interrelation [...] "between avant-garde and kitsch".|$|E

He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate eye could have evolved. Darwin concludes: [...] "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case." ...|$|E

However, as this date again passed without incident, media attention faded and the group sank back into obscurity.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1860s semi-rural Stepney was the haunt of some rather {{colourful}} characters who operated around Adelaide’s parklands. The {{area around the}} Maid and Magpie Hotel {{was the scene of}} various robberies by the romantically named Captain Moonlight, {{not to be confused with}} the better known bushranger in New South Wales named Captain Moonlight. Stepney's highwayman, it later transpired, was armed <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> lethal <b>than</b> a camouflaged pipe-case and, after incarceration, became a respected member of society.|$|R
500|$|Tegulae were {{originally}} made perfectly flat, or <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a ridge underneath the upper border, which allowed the tile to be [...] "hung" [...] upon a sloping roof {{so that it}} would not slide to the ground. Later, tegulae were formed with a raised border on the two vertical sides, which would channel rainwater {{to the bottom of the}} tile, rather than allowing it to seep between tiles to dampen the roofing materials. Another improvement occurred when these two raised borders were made to converge, forming a broad v-shaped trapezoid with the narrowest edge downwards, nestling into the widest part of the tile below it to form a continuous channel.|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{stated that}} there were two reasons for what he {{considered}} to be the show's failure. The first was Rodgers and Hammerstein's overconfidence; they thought of themselves as Broadway's [...] "Golden Boys" [...] who could do no wrong. The other was the play-within-the-play, which had not been thoroughly thought out by anyone. According to Abbott, Hammerstein remained [...] "positively Sphinx-like" [...] on the subject. At a loss to understand the characters of the play-within-the play, Alton came up <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> routine song-and-dance numbers. During the run, the duo approached choreographer Jerome Robbins and asked him if he could fix the dances. Robbins said that he could, but he would not, as [...] "it would kill Bob Alton". According to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin, [...] " [...] intended contrast between onstage and backstage life was never achieved because the onstage show was so tepid and confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|Imperatritsa Mariya ( [...] , [...] "Empress Maria") was {{launched}} on 19 October 1913 and arrived in Sevastopol on 13 July 1915, where she completed her fitting {{out during the}} next few months and conducted sea trials. She provided cover while the pre-dreadnought battleships conducted shore bombardment missions in October 1915. She encountered the ex-German light cruiser Midilli twice during 1916, but the cruiser escaped <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> splinter damage. On 20 October 1916, she capsized and sank in Sevastopol harbor after a magazine fire and subsequent explosion. Following a complex salvage operation, she was eventually raised and placed in drydock in May 1918. However, in the chaos of the Russian Revolution and subsequent Civil War, no further repair work was done, and the ship was scrapped beginning in 1926. Her guns and their turrets, which had fallen out of the ship when she capsized, were later salvaged in 1931–33. Two of the guns were used in the 30th Coast Defense Battery defending Sevastopol during World War II, also known as Maksim Gor'kii I by the Germans.|$|E

Ironically, although the initial assessment of Young's wound was that he would probably end up <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> serious <b>than</b> a stiff knee, he died a few days later, presumably of tetanus.|$|R

2500|$|The World Is Not Enough {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Although {{the game was}} seen as an improvement over Tomorrow Never Dies, some reviewers felt that it was inferior to its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Doug Perry of IGN described The World Is Not Enough as [...] "a short, rudimentary shooter <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a few good gadgets and a great license backing it up", while Samuel Bass of Daily Radar stated that the game [...] "succeeds reasonably well" [...] as [...] "a shallow movie-licensed action experience."

He himself often took pictures <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a Nikon snapshot camera, saying he needed nothing more.

50|$|Many {{problematic}} {{situations in}} real life arise from the circumstance that many different propositions in many different modalities are {{in the air at}} once.

In other words, if my “self” is identical <b>with</b> and <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> my body, could my unique and particular “self” come to exist again on Earth after my death?
