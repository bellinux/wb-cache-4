25|$|Feeney and Thrush (2010) have {{identified}} three main functional components of secure base caregiving. First, individuals can support their relationship partner's exploratory, autonomous behaviour by being available in case support is needed. This can include actions such as removing obstacles to the partner's goal pursuit (for example, taking over some household chores {{to free up}} time for the partner {{to engage in a}} new activity), being sensitive and responsive to the partner's communications of distress, and communicating readiness to help in the event that support becomes needed. Second, effective caregiving does not unnecessarily interfere with exploration. That is, effective caregivers do not provide support when it is neither needed nor desired, attempt to take over or control the activity, or disrupt the partner's goal strivings. Third, partners should communicate encouragement and acceptance of exploration (i.e., convey enthusiasm about the pursuit rather than suggest that it is not worthwhile or <b>will</b> <b>somehow</b> detract from the relationship). Individuals who perceive their partners to be available to help are more persistent in the performance of challenging activities, whereas individuals whose partners show more interference during an activity show less persistence at the task, poorer performance, less enthusiasm for the challenge, greater negativity/hostility toward their partner, and decreases in self-esteem. Partners' communications of enthusiasm are related to better performance, heightened enthusiasm, better mood, increases in state self-esteem, enhanced self-perceptions, greater enjoyment, and more positive feelings toward the partner.|$|E
500|$|The {{international}} media reported that expectations {{for a successful}} summit were deliberately set low, because NATO leaders wanted to avoid a flare-up over the Iraq War. Therefore, they agreed to meet the modest goals the Alliance had already set for itself in trying to stabilize Afghanistan, and endorsed a tepid version of the Bush administration’s initiative to promote modernization and democracy in the Arab world. The newspaper further commented that the summit had [...] "a sort of [...] "Waiting for Godot" [...] quality about it — European leaders biding time, neither creating a crisis nor mending fences, {{in the hope that}} the American election in November <b>will</b> <b>somehow</b> spare them from the choice between having to deal with Bush and letting Iraq, and NATO, slide into further disarray." [...] Other analysis were even more critical: [...] "There have been NATO summits at which neither a special occasion was acknowledged nor decisions of particular relevance made. One example is the NATO summit in Istanbul in 2004, where the concluded measures hardly required a meeting of the heads of state and government, and the media presence was not justified by the agreed-upon resolutions." [...] US and other government officials however emphasized that the summit was significant in terms of the alliance's unprecedented outreach beyond its traditional North Atlantic focus and its aggressive emphasis on force planning to tackle new challenges worldwide.|$|E

But if love should cease, then God himself would have divorced us, punished us by taking away a priceless gift of which we were not worthy. He would have shut the gates of Eden in our faces because we had sinned against the Spirit. It would be quite as true to say 'whom God has put asunder no man may join together.'

2500|$|Despite {{the intense}} and careful {{screening}} that most {{who wish to}} adopt children must go through, sometimes the adoption does not succeed. The child may have developmental or psychological issues that the parents cannot handle, had not been informed of prior to the adoption, or both.

[...] The adoptive parents themselves may have psychological or family issues themselves that led them down the path to adopt.

A survey by End Child Poverty estimated that roughly 1.5million parents have reduced spending on basics like food and fuel. According to Gavin Kelly of the Resolution Foundation, tax credits help raise living standards of low paid workers. He {{wrote in the}} New Statesman, [...] "Perhaps the biggest misconception is the voguish notion that if tax credits are cut, employers <b>will</b> <b>somehow</b> decide to offer pay rises to fill the gap.

2500|$|Critics {{also point}} out that proponents of the new {{calendar}} tend to use worldly rather than spiritual justification for changing the calendar: wanting to [...] "party with everyone else" [...] at Christmas; concern that the gradual shift in the Julian calendar <b>will</b> <b>somehow</b> negatively affect the celebration of feasts that are linked to the seasons of the year. However, opponents counter that the seasons are reversed in the southern hemisphere, where the liturgical celebrations are no less valid. The validity of this argument is questionable, since the feasts of the Orthodox Church were not changed no matter where they were celebrated, and Orthodox services were held in the southern hemisphere with little issue centuries before the introduction of the new calendar.|$|E
2500|$|Merezhkovsky {{had never}} seen Fascism as an {{alternative}} to Communism. As early as 1930 he wrote of doomed Europe stuck between the two [...] "stores of explosives: Fascism and Communism," [...] expressing hope that some day these two evils <b>will</b> <b>somehow</b> destroy one another. But the danger of Fuhrer's possible taking over Europe was still the lesser evil for him than the possible Communist expansion. The [...] "Hitler dilemma" [...] was the only thing husband and wife have ever disagreed on. Gippius hated and despised Fuhrer, referring to him as [...] "an idiot". Merezhkovsky thought he found a leader who'd be able to take the whole of Antichrist Kingdom upon himself, this outweighing for him such trivia as the fact that his own Joan of Arc (1939) was banned in Germany on the day of its release.|$|E
2500|$|The Altamont concert {{is often}} {{contrasted with the}} Woodstock festival that took place less than four months earlier. While Woodstock {{represented}} [...] "peace and love", Altamont came {{to be viewed as}} the end of the hippie era and the de facto conclusion of late-1960s American youth culture: [...] "Altamont became, whether fairly or not, a symbol for the death of the Woodstock Nation." [...] Rock music critic Robert Christgau wrote in 1972 that [...] "Writers focus on Altamont not because it brought on the end of an era but because it provided such a complex metaphor for the way an era ended." [...] Writing for the New Yorker in 2015, Richard Brody said what Altamont ended was [...] "the idea that, left to their own inclinations and stripped of the trappings of the wider social order, the young people of the new generation <b>will</b> <b>somehow</b> spontaneously create a higher, gentler, more loving grassroots order. What died at Altamont is the Rousseauian dream itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike Made in the Dark, {{the song}} writing {{approach}} to One Life Stand was {{less of a}} collaborative effort. Only three or four songs were written as a group whilst the rest were written by Goddard and Taylor, though Doyle said [...] "we did have input {{in the way it}} was produced". Doyle described the writing process for the album as [...] "a bit like writing a poem" [...] because there was [...] "a certain structure" [...] that the band needed to work to whilst exercising [...] "as much freedom" [...] as they could. Goddard described the band's approach to song-writing as a [...] "mix of things [...] a lot of very careful thinking about rhythms, and interlaying a lot of different ideas and influences" [...] though, at certain points, there would be the sense that something needed to occur and these elements in songs were created spontaneously from the interaction between himself and Taylor: [...] "this melody <b>will</b> <b>somehow</b> suddenly explode in your mind. It's never planned, it just seems to happen; almost like it has to." [...] "Hand Me Down Your Love" [...] and [...] "Slush" [...] were written by Taylor whilst Goddard wrote [...] "Brothers". Doyle stated that [...] "One Life Stand" [...] and [...] "I Feel Better" [...] were put together [...] "in a slightly more piecemeal way".|$|E
