5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood <b>who</b> <b>look</b> exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents <b>who</b> <b>look</b> and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves around too much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E
5|$|Thomson and Thompson (Dupont et Dupond in Hergé's {{original}} version) are two incompetent detectives <b>who</b> <b>look</b> like identical twins, {{their only}} discernible difference being {{the shape of}} their moustaches. First introduced in Cigars of the Pharaoh, they provide much of the comic relief throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic spoonerisms. They are extremely clumsy, thoroughly incompetent, and usually bent on arresting the wrong character. The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks except when sent abroad; during those missions they attempt the national costume of the locality they are visiting, but instead dress in conspicuously stereotypical folkloric attire. The detectives were in part based on Hergé's father Alexis and uncle Léon, identical twins who often took walks together, wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks.|$|E
5|$|Warriors is {{a series}} of novels {{published}} by HarperCollins; it is written by authors Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, Tui Sutherland, with the plot developed by editor Victoria Holmes, who collectively use the pseudonym Erin Hunter. The series follows the adventures of four Clans of wild cats—ThunderClan, ShadowClan, WindClan, and RiverClan —in their forest and lake homes, <b>who</b> <b>look</b> up to StarClan, their warriors ancestors, and spirits in the stars, who guide the four clans. SkyClan, the long-forgotten fifth Clan of the forest, is later introduced in the stand-alone novel Firestar's Quest. It receives additional focus in the novel SkyClan's Destiny, the manga trilogy SkyClan and the Stranger, and the 2013 novella Cloudstar's Journey.|$|E

25|$|It is {{this second}} step {{which makes the}} {{technique}} one of non-probability sampling. In quota sampling {{the selection of the}} sample is non-random. For example, interviewers might be tempted to interview those <b>who</b> <b>look</b> most helpful. The problem is that these samples may be biased because not everyone gets a chance of selection. This random element is its greatest weakness and quota versus probability has been a matter of controversy for several years.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the Leicester City trio of Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie {{spent a week}} {{in prison}} after being accused of sexual assault while on a {{training}} break at the La Manga resort in Spain with their team. However, the case was dropped after forensic evidence showed the accusations to be baseless. Although the players accused were ultimately innocent, the scandal led to a media outcry about footballers and their behaviour, {{especially with regard to}} children <b>who</b> <b>look</b> up to them.|$|E
25|$|Character {{designer}} Kōsuke Fujishima {{noted that}} while Luke's clothing {{makes him look}} lazy, {{it was okay to}} have clothes that are outrageous since the setting was designed to have him wear the most fashionable clothes of his time. He decided to show Luke's abdomen to demonstrate that he was a combatant in the game. Fujishima remains anxious about Luke's design wondering what people think about his abdomen always showing. Luke's pose is the result of Fujishima's research in fashion books which feature images of boys <b>who</b> <b>look</b> like they hang out at Shibuya.|$|E

25|$|In the {{controversial}} matter of interpreting prophecy {{such as that}} in the Book of Daniel, Calvin proposed a preterist view, {{which is to say}} that he believed that the prophecies in the book of Daniel apply only to the history between prophet Daniel (530 BC) and Jesus' first coming (30 AD). In this view he was out of line with the early church and the Reformers who came before him, who maintained more fully to historical-continuous view. Calvin is also in distinction to many of his later successors <b>who</b> <b>look</b> a future fulfillment.|$|E
25|$|Non-Euclidean {{geometry}} {{is sometimes}} {{connected with the}} influence of the 20th century horror fiction writer H. P. Lovecraft. In his works, many unnatural things follow their own unique laws of geometry: In Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, the sunken city of R'lyeh is characterized by its non-Euclidean geometry. It is heavily implied this is achieved as a side effect of not following the natural laws of this universe rather than simply using an alternate geometric model, as the sheer innate wrongness of it is said to be capable of driving those <b>who</b> <b>look</b> upon it insane.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} {{categories}} of purchasable weapons, four being guns {{and the final}} being utilities: rifles, sub-machine guns (SMGs), heavy, pistols, and grenades. All guns have different stats and all grenade types have different in-game effects. The hand grenade deals damage in a small radius, the smoke grenade temporarily places a smoke screen, the decoy grenade emulates the player's primary gun, the flashbang temporarily blinds players <b>who</b> <b>look</b> at it explode, and the Molotov cocktail and Incendiary Grenade set a small radius of the map on fire {{for a short period}} of time. Alongside all of these weapons, the Zeus x27, a taser, can also be purchased.|$|E

25|$|The College gymkhana was {{established}} in 1914.

The Gymkhana General Secretary is the elected representative of the students. It co-ordinates the team delegations to various function, competitions and organises the college gathering and annual functions.

25|$|No {{evidence}} {{has been found that}} links the picture to Josephine before Boyer's book was published in 1976, and no primary sources have been found that link the photo to Josephine's time in Tombstone. Many individuals share similar facial features and faces on people <b>who</b> <b>look</b> radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers and collectors require provenance or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that might exist. Experts will rarely offer even a tentative identification of new or unique images of famous people based solely on similarities shared with other known images.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{artifacts}} are clay figurines or statues. Archaeologists have identified {{many of these}} as fetishes or totems, which {{are believed to be}} imbued with powers that can help and protect the people <b>who</b> <b>look</b> after them. These Cucuteni-Trypillia figurines have become known popularly as Goddesses, however, this is actually a misnomer from a scientific point of view. There have been so many of these so-called clay Goddesses discovered in Cucuteni-Trypillia sites that many museums in eastern Europe have a sizeable collection of them, and as a result, they have come to represent one of the more readily-identifiable visual markers of this culture to many people.|$|E

25|$|Dexter when {{he arrived}} began at once to turn the green field into a cloth of gold...He took chances - thank {{goodness}} for those <b>who</b> <b>look</b> on batting as a challenge! - but he made superb strokes, with his driving tremendous in power and placement. Sometimes, in fact, the placement didn't matter so much because the power sent the ball through men recognized as outstanding fielders. Once such stroke, a cover-drive, was through Thomas's legs just as he got his hands there. I felt glad that the ball went between his legs and that his hands were not behind it. Not even Jehu drove more furiously than Dexter, and a direct hit on the leg or hands might well have put this accomplished fieldsman out of action.|$|E
