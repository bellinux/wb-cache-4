And now, my dear Edward, I advise that <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> journey together, as your youth and inexperience will stand in need of the wisdom of my gray head.

Therefore, I propose that <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> work at once. We will divide into watches now. It will be twelve hours before we get our {{allowance}} of bread again, therefore that will give three hours' work, and nine hours' sleep to each. They will be just setting the first watch on deck, and, as we shall hear them changed, it {{will give us a}} good idea how the time is passing." ...|$|E

60|$|As story-tellers {{of every}} {{description}} have, from time immemorial, been considered free from those niceties by which all attempts in the nobler classes of literature are, {{or should be}} restrained, we consider no apology necessary for requesting the reader to leap over with us the space of four months; but still, before <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> tale from that date, it will be as well that we should give a short outline of the principal events which produced the state in which {{the circumstances of the}} Macdermots will then be found, and we are sorry to say that they were not such as could offer much consolation to them.|$|E
60|$|Our native love {{of reality}} joins with this {{experience}} {{to teach us}} a little reserve, and to dissuade a too sudden surrender to the brilliant qualities of persons. Young people admire talents or particular excellences; as we grow older we value total powers and effects, as the impression, the quality, the spirit of men and things. The genius is all. The man,--it is his system: we do not try a solitary word or act, but his habit. The acts which you praise, I praise not, since they are departures from his faith, and are mere compliances. The magnetism which arranges tribes and races in one polarity is alone to be respected; the men are steel-filings. Yet we unjustly select a particle, and say, 'O steel-filing number one! what heart-drawings I feel to thee! what prodigious virtues are these of thine! how constitutional to thee, and incommunicable.' Whilst we speak the loadstone is withdrawn; down falls our filing in a heap with the rest, and <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> mummery to the wretched shaving. Let us go for universals; for the magnetism, not for the needles. Human life and its persons are poor empirical pretensions. A personal influence is an ignis fatuus. If {{they say it is}} great, it is great; if they say it is small, it is small; you see it, and you see it not, by turns; it borrows all its size from the momentary estimation of the speakers: the Will-of-the-wisp vanishes if you go too near, vanishes if you go too far, and only blazes at one angle. Who can tell if Washington be a great man or no? Who can tell if Franklin be? Yes, or any but the twelve, or six, or three great gods of fame? And they too loom and fade before the eternal.|$|E
60|$|We cannot {{have a more}} decided {{proof of}} Bunyan's great powers, and of his being much in advance of his times, than by the {{opinions}} {{of which he was}} the Christian pioneer having spread so extensively through the Baptist denomination. In this his predictions were fully verified. It is surprising that pious dissenters should ever have made uniformity in outward ceremonies of more importance than inward holiness, as a term of communion. Such sentiments naturally attach to state churches; and ought to be found only with those bodies which exist merely for political purposes, and for it are rewarded with earthly power, pomp, and wealth. I close these observations by quoting the words of Bunyan's learned antagonists, published within a few years of this controversy, and during his lifetime. his sentiments appear to have had a hallowed effect even upon their minds, and produced an apology for their conduct. It is in the appendix to the Baptist confession of faith, republished in 1677: 'We would not be misconstrued, as if the discharge of our consciences did any way disoblige or alienate our affections or conversations from any others that fear the Lord: earnestly desiring to approve ourselves to be such as follow after peace with holiness. <b>We</b> <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> practice, not out of obstinacy, but we do therein according {{to the best of our}} understandings, in that method which we take to be most agreeable to the scriptures. The christening of infants, we find by church history, to have been a very ancient practice; still we leave every one to give an account of himself to God. And if in any case debates between Christians are not plainly determinable by the scriptures, we leave it to the second coming of Christ.' In 1689, the year after Bunyan's death, this appendix was omitted from the Baptist confession of faith.|$|E
