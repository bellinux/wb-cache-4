This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties were not always to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in his}} tenure, Kosygin {{challenged}} Brezhnev's {{right as}} general secretary to represent the country abroad, a function Kosygin believed should {{fall into the hands}} of the head of government, as was common in non-communist countries.

Kosygin, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> chief negotiator with the First World during the 1960s, was hardly to be seen outside the Second World after Brezhnev consolidated his position within the Politburo, but also due to Andrei Gromyko's dislike of Kosygin meddling into his own ministerial affairs.|$|E

Instead, the sultan stated that he supported John Sigismund and had Łaski arrested.|$|E
