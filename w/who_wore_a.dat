25|$|The Paris {{police force}} was {{completely}} re-organized {{after the fall}} of Napoleon III and the Commune; the sergents de ville were replaced by the gardiens de la paix publique (Guardians of the Public Peace), which by June 1871 had 7,756 men under the authority of the Prefect of Police named by the national government. Following a series of anarchist bombings in 1892, the number was increased to 7,000 guardians, 80 brigadiers and 950 sous-brigadiers. In 1901, under the prefect Louis Lépine, in order {{to keep up with the}} technology of the time, a unit of policemen on bicycles (called the hirondelles after the brand of the bicycles) was formed. They numbered 18 per arrondissement and reached 600 by 1906 for the whole city. A unit of river police, the brigade fluviale, was organized in 1900 for the Universal Exposition, as well as a unit of traffic police <b>who</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> symbol of a Roman chariot embroidered on the sleeve of their uniform. The first six motorcycle policemen appeared on the streets in 1906.|$|E
25|$|Hamburg was hit {{much more}} severely. When the plague had reached Pinneberg and Rellingen {{just north of}} the Hamburg {{territory}} in the summer of 1712, Hamburg restricted travel to the town, which the Danish king used as a pretext to encircle Hamburg with his forces and confiscate Hamburg vessels on the River Elbe, demanding 500,000 thalers (later reduced to 246,000 thalers) to make up for this alleged discrimination against his subjects in Altona. 12,000 Danish soldiers were moved before Hamburg's gates. When the plague broke out in Hamburg less than three weeks later, it was carried there from the Danish troops by a prostitute from Hamburg's Gerkenshof lane, where out of 53 people 35 fell ill and 18 died. The lane was blocked and isolated; however, the quarantine could not prevent the disease from spreading through the densely built-up neighborhoods. Among the dead was the plague doctor Majus, who belonged to those physicians <b>who</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> beak-shaped mask containing a vinegar-soaked sponge to protect him against the miasma. In December, the plague faded out.|$|E

25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner table near a female student <b>who</b> <b>wore</b> <b>a</b> cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E
