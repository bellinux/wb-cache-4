500|$|In the 2007 book Children's Literature and Culture, writer Harry Edwin Eiss chastised the {{depiction}} of Blair's bulimia. [...] "If handled properly, the inclusion of her illness could have provided a powerful lesson for young adult readers <b>who</b> <b>worry</b> about their weight and food consumption. Unfortunately, Cecily von Ziegesar, {{the author of the}} series, presents a seriously flawed treatment of the problem. In a failed attempt at humor, the writer regards Blair's sickness as just another source of gossip," [...] he said. Emily Nussbaum of New York magazine had similar comments, calling the bulimia [...] "more of an icky weakness than a full-fledged pathology." [...] However, she went on to commend Blair as [...] "hilariously self-centered".|$|E
500|$|His next film, {{entitled}} How Do You Know, {{was released}} December 17, 2010; Brooks produced, directed and wrote it. The film stars Reese Witherspoon {{as a professional}} softball player involved in a love triangle. Brooks began work on the film in 2005, wishing to create a film about a young female athlete. While interviewing numerous women for hundreds of hours in his research for the film he also became interested in [...] "the dilemmas of contemporary business executives, who are sometimes held accountable by the law for corporate behavior of which they {{may not even be}} aware." [...] He created Paul Rudd and Jack Nicholson's characters for this concept. Filming finished in November 2009, although Brooks later reshot the film's opening and ending. The New York Times described it as [...] "perhaps the most closely guarded of Columbia's movies this year." [...] Brooks was paid $10 million for the project, which cost $100 million. The film was negatively received. Patrick Goldstein wrote in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "the characters were stick figures, the jokes were flat, the situations felt scarily insular." [...] He felt the film showed Brooks had [...] "finally lost his comic mojo" [...] concluding [...] "his films used to have a wonderfully restless, neurotic energy, but How Do You Know feels like it was phoned in from someone resting uncomfortably on his laurels." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge also felt the film showed Brooks had lost his [...] "spark". Richard Corliss of Time was more positive, writing [...] "without being great, it's still the flat-out finest romantic comedy of the year," [...] while [...] "Brooks hasn't lost his gift for dreaming up heroes and heroines <b>who</b> <b>worry</b> amusingly." ...|$|E
2500|$|The dubious {{assumption}} that [...] "only the cockroaches" [...] would survive the post-war fallout environment was frequently {{used in an}} attempt to criticize [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] {{during the height of the}} cold war, contextually at a time when discussion of a total war involved the much greater US-Soviet arsenal of nuclear weapons that were then in existence. However even at that time, this assumption was shown to be misled, as scientifically detailed in the 1988 book Would the Insects Inherit the Earth and Other Subjects of Concern to Those <b>Who</b> <b>Worry</b> About Nuclear War.|$|E

2500|$|Conservative {{columnist}} Cal Thomas also {{disagreed with}} allegations of anti-Semitism, saying [...] "To {{those in the}} Jewish community <b>who</b> <b>worry</b> that the film [...] might contain anti-Semitic elements, or encourage people to persecute Jews, fear not. The film does not indict Jews {{for the death of}} Jesus." [...] Two Orthodox Jews, Rabbi Daniel Lapin and conservative talk-show host and author Michael Medved, also vocally rejected claims that the film is anti-Semitic. They have noted the film's many sympathetic portrayals of Jews: Simon of Cyrene (who helps Jesus carry the cross), Mary Magdalene, the Virgin Mary, St. Peter, St. John, Veronica (who wipes Jesus' face and offers him water) and several Jewish priests who protest Jesus' arrest (Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea) during Caiaphas' trial of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there has}} been little publicized {{criticism}} of the concept of cognitive liberty itself, drug policy reform and the concept of human enhancement, both closely linked to cognitive liberty, remain highly controversial issues. The risks inherent in removing restrictions on controlled cognitive-enhancing drugs, including of widening the gap between those able to afford such treatments and those unable to do so, have caused many to remain skeptical about the wisdom of recognizing cognitive liberty as a right. Political philosopher and Harvard University professor Michael J. Sandel, when examining the prospect of memory enhancement, wrote that [...] "some <b>who</b> <b>worry</b> about the ethics of cognitive enhancement point to the danger of creating two classes of human beings – those with access to enhancement technologies, and those who must make do with an unaltered memory that fades with age." [...] Cognitive liberty then faces opposition obliquely in these interrelated debates.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{extensive}} fallout, Nevil Shute wrote the novel On the Beach, which was released in 1957. The novel is about a war that released so much radioactive fallout that all the life in the Northern Hemisphere disappeared, while the Southern Hemisphere awaited a similar fate. However, the American government voiced a criticism of this premise—a threat of extinction from nuclear war—because they did not have enough nuclear weapons to cause human extinction. Similarly the premise that all of humanity would die following a nuclear war and only the [...] "cockroaches would survive" [...] is critically dealt with in the 1988 book Would the Insects Inherit the Earth, and Other Subjects of Concern to Those <b>Who</b> <b>Worry</b> About Nuclear War. A combination of the Castle Bravo detonation, alongside the subsequent poisoning of the Lucky Dragon 5, increased levels of anti-nuclear protests in Japan and the resultant comparisons to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to Castle Bravo frequently being mentioned or involved in the plots of numerous Japanese media, most prominently with what is perhaps Japan's most widely recognized media icon, Godzilla.|$|E

2500|$|Pete Vonder Haar of the Film Threat {{gave the}} film a mixed review, stating: [...] "It's a {{reasonably}} entertaining actioner, and Zwick doesn't {{shy away from}} depicting violence or the horrors of war, but as a social statement it falls a little short. And emeralds are prettier anyway." [...] Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle also gave the film a mixed review, he stated: [...] "While the film never quite reaches the emotional peaks it so obviously seeks to scale, Zwick's film is still potent enough to save you three months salary." [...] Nathan Lee of the Village Voice, like Vonder Haar and Savlov, also gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "De Beers can relax; the only indignation stirred up by Blood Diamond won't be among those <b>who</b> <b>worry</b> about where their jewelry came from, but with audiences incensed by facile politics and bad storytelling." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film [...] "C", he stated: [...] "Much like Zwick's Glory and The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond strives to be an [...] "important" [...] film while stopping well short of being genuinely provocative and artistically chancy." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a negative review, stating that [...] "director Edward Zwick {{tried to make a}} great movie, but somewhere in the process he forgot to make a good one." ...|$|E

His mother was nervous, in suspense, wanting to be at rest as to whether she should have his company on the voyage or be obliged to make it alone. But as he stood there smiling and slowly moving his fan he struck me somehow as a person on whom this fact would not sit very heavily. He was of the type of those whom other people worry about, not of those <b>who</b> <b>worry</b> about other people. Tall and strong, he had a handsome face, with a round head and close-curling hair; the whites of his eyes and the enamel of his teeth, under his brown moustache, gleamed vaguely in the lights of the Back Bay. I made out that he was sunburnt, as if he lived much in the open air, and that he looked intelligent but also slightly brutal, though not in a morose way. His brutality, if he had any, was bright and finished. I had to tell him who I was, but even then I saw that he failed to place me and that my explanations gave me in his mind no great identity or at any rate no great importance. I foresaw that he would in intercourse make me feel sometimes very young and sometimes very old. He mentioned, as if to show his mother that he might safely be left to his own devices, that he had once started from London to Bombay at three-quarters of an hour's notice.|$|E
