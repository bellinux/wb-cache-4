5|$|In late 1941, Wiesenthal and {{his wife}} were {{transferred}} to Janowska concentration camp and forced to work at the Eastern Railway Repair Works. He painted swastikas and other inscriptions on captured Soviet railway engines, and Cyla <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> work polishing the brass and nickel. In exchange for providing details about the railways, Wiesenthal obtained false identity papers for his wife from a member of the Armia Krajowa, a Polish underground organisation. She travelled to Warsaw, where she <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> work in a German radio factory. She spent time in two different labour camps as well. Conditions were harsh and her health was permanently damaged, but she survived the war. The couple was reunited in 1945, and their daughter Paulinka was born the following year.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of her seventh and final journey for American Export, Siboney was handed over on 28May 1941 to the U.S.Army for transport duty. After a hasty outfitting, the redesignated USAT Siboney <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> work transporting troops. Based in New York, she made trips {{up and down the}} Atlantic and into the Caribbean, and, by the end of 1941, had called at Bermuda, San Juan, Trinidad, St. John's, Charleston, Newport News, Cristóbal, Jamaica, and Panama.|$|E
5|$|Devolution {{continued}} {{to be part of}} the platform of the Labour Party which, in May 1997, took power under Tony Blair. In September 1997, the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh. An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Fort Stikine joined Convoy OS69KM, which {{departed}} from Liverpool on 23 February 1944. The convoy, consisting of 49 merchant ships escorted by twelve warships, split at sea on 5 March. The two convoys thus formed were OS69, which arrived at Freetown on 15 March; and Convoy KMS43G, which arrived at Gibraltar on 6 March. During the voyage to Gibraltar, a stowaway was discovered. He <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> {{work under the}} charge of the ship's Chief Engineer.|$|E
5|$|Greenewalt {{favored the}} bismuth {{phosphate}} process {{due to the}} corrosive nature of lanthanum fluoride, and it was selected for the Hanford separation plants. Once X-10 began producing plutonium, the pilot separation plant <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> the test. The first batch was processed at 40% efficiency {{but over the next}} few months this was raised to 90%.|$|E
5|$|However {{effective}} dazzle camouflage {{may have}} been in World War I, it became less useful as rangefinders and especially aircraft became more advanced, and, by the time it <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> use again in World War II, radar further reduced its effectiveness. However, it may still have confounded enemy submarines.|$|E

5|$|In September 1786, at the Annapolis Convention, {{delegates from}} five states {{called for a}} Constitutional Convention {{in order to discuss}} {{possible}} improvements to the Articles of Confederation. The Constitutional Convention took place in Philadelphia on May 14, 1787. Rhode Island, fearing that the Convention would work to its disadvantage, boycotted the Convention and, when the Constitution <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> the states, initially refused to ratify it.|$|E
5|$|In {{their new}} form the {{locomotives}} {{were similar in}} outline to the N15 class, though suffered from the expectation amongst crews that they were an improved version of this type. Despite this, their ability to accelerate well <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> good use on cross-country trains between main lines. The class saw service into nationalisation in 1948. All had been withdrawn by 1957, with none preserved.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{they decided}} to compromise, {{entering}} into talks with the parliamentary opposition. As a result, 100 of the 411 elements of the Constitution were changed, with both sides compromising on certain issues. Nevertheless, the governors of the eastern provinces rejected the changes, believing it gave them insufficient autonomy, while various Indianist and leftist members of MAS felt that the amendments conceded too much to the political right. The constitution <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> a referendum in January 2009, {{in which it was}} approved by 61.4% of voters.|$|E

5000|$|No {{sentence}} {{carries with}} it {{any change in the}} civil status of the convict's family. The Pentateuchal law provides (Deut. xxiv. 16), [...] "The parents shall not <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for the children, neither shall the children <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for the parents; every man shall <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for his own sins," [...] and rabbinic jurisprudence follows this principle both to the letter and in spirit. Nor is a sentence attended by confiscation of the convict's goods. All his possessions descend to his legal heirs (Tosef., Sanh. iv. 6; Sanh. 27b, 48b; see Confiscation).|$|R

5|$|The {{idea that}} McGarty play a child groomed for sex <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> the actress on 9 January 2008. Santer has stated that, had McGarty or her parents {{objected to the}} storyline, {{they would not have}} gone ahead with it. In the event, McGarty's parents merely {{requested}} that their daughter not be asked to publicise the role, and the actress began filming her first scenes on 14 January 2008.|$|E
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> one side.|$|E

50|$|McGarvie's {{preferred}} process involved asking all the parliaments of Australia {{to establish}} model development committees, which would design very detailed models. The models would then <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> a plebiscite.

5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Docherty's body indicated she {{had probably been}} suffocated, but {{it could not be}} proven. Although the police suspected the men of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards, his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2017, it remains.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{formed the}} bulk of the English economy {{at the time of the}} Norman invasion. Twenty years after the invasion, 35% of England was covered in arable land, 25% <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> pasture, 15% was covered by {{woodlands}} and the remaining 25% was predominantly moorland, fens and heaths. Wheat formed the single most important arable crop, but rye, barley and oats were also cultivated extensively. In the more fertile parts of the country, such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, legumes and beans were also cultivated. Sheep, cattle, oxen and pigs were kept on English holdings, although most of these breeds were much smaller than modern equivalents and most would have been slaughtered in winter.|$|E
5|$|Although Æthelred {{had been}} Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers {{proved to be}} equally hostile to Eardwulf. In 798 a dux named Wada, {{who was one of}} those who had killed King Æthelred, fought with Eardwulf on Billington Moor, near Whalley, Lancashire. Wada <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> flight and may have gone into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. The {{evidence}} for Osbald's continued ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald is known to have become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that he had given up his ambitions.|$|E

5|$|Another origin tale {{claims that}} King Solomon {{was given a}} pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad ("the pure") by the Queen of Sheba. A {{different}} version says that Solomon gave a stallion, Zad el-Raheb or Zad-el-Rakib ("Gift to the Rider"), to the Banu Azd people {{when they came to}} pay tribute to the king. This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> stud, he became a founding sire of legend.|$|E
5|$|Bletchley Park is {{a former}} private estate located in Old Bletchley and modern Museum of Cryptography. Conveniently located at the {{junction}} of the Varsity Line with the West Coast Main Line, Bletchley Park, code-named Station X, was {{the location of the}} Allied main code-breaking establishment during World War II. Codes and ciphers of several Axis powers were deciphered there, most famously the German Enigma. Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic digital computer <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> work here as part of the codebreaking effort. The high-level intelligence produced by Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is frequently credited with aiding the Allied war effort and shortening the war, although Ultra's effect on the actual outcome of World War II is debated.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the large}} number of {{introduced}} species that harm Lord Howe's native flora and fauna, feral pigs and cats were eradicated by the early 2000s. The goat population has been reduced to just a few animals, and there are ongoing efforts to control rodents and introduced plants. In July 2012 it was announced by the Australian federal Environment Minister Tony Burke and the New South Wales Environment Minister Robyn Parker that the Australian and NSW Governments would each contribute 50% of the estimated A$9 million cost of implementing a rodent eradication plan for the island, using aerial deployment of poison baits. The plan <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> a local vote and is considered controversial. A recovery program has restored the Lord Howe woodhen numbers from only 20 in 1970 to about 200 in 2000, which is close to carrying capacity.|$|E
