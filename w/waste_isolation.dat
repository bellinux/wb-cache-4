40|$|The {{rising cost}} of remediating cont~inated sites bas made {{long-term}} isolation {{a viable alternative to}} the removal and treatment of contaminated soils and <b>wastes.</b> <b>Isolation</b> generally consists of installing subswface barriers (vertical cutoff walls and/or horizontal liners placed in situ) and caps. In some cases, where lateral and vertical migration of contR. minR. nts can be limited by minimi 7 :ing percolation, isolation may consist of only installing a cap. The focus of this paper is on caps constrocted with earthen materials. Caps may also be constructed with geosynthetic materials (geomembranes, geonets, etc.). However, for large remediation projects, the costs of constructing a cap with geosynthetics may be enormous relative to the cost of a cap constructed with earthen materials. Furthermore, in some regions such as the semi-arid and arid parts of the United States, caps constructed with earthen materials may perform equally as well as caps constructed with geosynthetics. An effective cap design requires that the cap limit percolation into the underlying soils. For earthen caps, design consists of selecting an arrangement of earthen materials {{that can be used to}} divert water away from the cap or store the water until it can be removed later by evaporation and/or transpiration.

40|$|Abstract. TOUGH 2 is {{a widely}} used {{reservoir}} simulator for solving subsurface flow related problems such as nuclear <b>waste</b> geologic <b>isolation,</b> environmental remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, and geothermal reservoir engineering. It solves a set of coupled mass and energy balance equations using a finite volume method. This contribution presents the design and analysis of a parallel version of TOUGH 2. The parallel implementation first partitions the unstructured computational domain. For each time step, a set of coupled non-linear equations is solved with Newton iteration. In each Newton step, a Jacobian matrix is calculated and an ill-conditioned non-symmetric linear system is solved using a preconditioned iterative solver. Communication is required for convergence tests and data exchange across partitioning borders. Parallel performance results on Cray T 3 E- 900 are presented for two real application problems arising in the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site study. The execution time is reduced from 7504 seconds on two processors to 126 seconds on 128 processors for a 2 D problem involving 52, 752 equations. For a larger 3 D problem with 293, 928 equations the time decreases from 10, 055 seconds on 16 processors to 329 seconds on 512 processors...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a new outphasing energy recovery amplifier (OPERA) which replaces the isolation resistor {{in the conventional}} matched combiner with a resistance-compressed rectifier for improved efficiency. The rectifier recovers the power normally <b>wasted</b> in the <b>isolation</b> resistor back to the power supply, while a resistance compression network (RCN) reduces the impedance variation of the rectifier as the output power varies.
