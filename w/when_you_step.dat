25|$|Amber Lewis' {{sculpture}} {{is similar}} to the readymade in that each component of the artwork is readily available <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>step</b> outside (tree and rocks) or can be easily bought at any local hardware store (rope and bucket.) This piece diverts from Duchamp's readymades in that Lewis' sculpture can not be easily moved since it is site specific and is hung from a tree which is immobile. Part of the sculpture is the way the tree changes over time and never looks the same from day to day. The tree from which the bucket hangs is constantly changing with the seasons. In winter the tree has no leaves, but blooms in the spring to eventually create leaves in the summer, only to drop them in the fall.|$|E

I'm not resigned to let the story go on. It has all to be sorted out before the season." [...] He added that if Vieira chose to leave, the club could sufficiently replace him: [...] "We've worked very hard {{in the last five years}} to get good young players in and you saw that today." [...] Reyes, who was named man of the match, was frustrated at his missed chance early in the second half, but continued: [...] "I set one up and then scored myself so I was much happier." [...] Bergkamp was impressed with Fàbregas's performance in the match: [...] "Normally at 17, you might be a bit unsure <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>step</b> out. But with players like Cesc, the way he has developed in one year is quite amazing." ...|$|E

When she was interviewed about parenting with Tennis.com she said [...] "Being a mother is so different; it’s not that it’s quieter or faster, it’s just different. Being a mom is tough.

It’s fun because you have a different life <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>step</b> on the court but when the baby is sick you go crazy.

6000|$|So {{naturally}} Central Square {{with its}} trees and its fountains and its statues {{is one of}} the places of chief interest in the City. But especially because there stands along one side of it the vast pile of the Grand Palaver Hotel. It rises fifteen stories high and fills all one side of the square. It has, overlooking the trees in the square, twelve hundred rooms with three thousand windows, and it would have held all George Washington's army. Even people in other cities who have never seen it know it well from its advertising; [...] "the most homelike hotel in America," [...] so it is labelled in all the magazines, the expensive ones, on the continent. In fact, the aim of the company that owns the Grand Palaver--and they do not attempt to conceal it--is to make the place as much a home as possible. Therein lies its charm. It is a home. You realize that when you look up at the Grand Palaver from the square at night when the twelve hundred guests have turned on the lights of the three thousand windows. You realize it at theatre time when the great string of motors come sweeping to the doors of the Palaver, to carry the twelve hundred guests to twelve hundred seats in the theatres at four dollars a seat. But most of all do you appreciate the character of the Grand Palaver <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>step</b> into its rotunda. Aladdin's enchanted palace was nothing to it. It has a vast ceiling with a hundred glittering lights, and within it night and day is a surging crowd that is never still and a babel of voices that is never hushed, and over all there hangs an enchanted cloud of thin blue tobacco smoke such as might enshroud the conjured vision of a magician of Baghdad or Damascus.|$|E

Wynn responded by throwing three straight pitches under his teammate's chin.

According to Rod Carew, Wynn's competitiveness did not end when his playing career did. [...] "Early would knock you down in batting practice.

5000|$|The video {{depicts the}} nine members of Slipknot playing {{in groups of}} three as well as footage of each {{individual}} member submerged underwater. Percussionist and co-director Crahan explained that {{when he tries to}} write treatments for their music videos he always thinks, [...] "What has Slipknot not done? What can we embark upon that will be fun and knowledge-enhancing instead of the same old song and dance?", saying that the members themselves are the treatment for this video. This further shows that they always try to give their fans as much of themselves as they can even although they are tired of live performances, revealing that in order to change things up they shot the members performing in groups of three. The concept of the band members appearing individually underwater was modeled after a video installation entitled [...] "Ascension" [...] by video artist Bill Viola. Crahan explained that the smell of sulfur is [...] "something people either love or hate, and if you hate it, then it can be suffocating", so they incorporated water as a visual representation of this. He also went on to reveal that the members felt more uncomfortable when shooting in an eleven-foot glass tank, explaining, [...] "you had to go up this really weird ladder and the water was dirty and it was a five-foot by five-foot tank and it looked like <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stepped</b> into it <b>you</b> were gonna hit your head on the frame that holds the glass and it would just rip your nose off", but {{he went on to say}} that it was his favorite video so far [...] "because it involved that fear". Chris Fehn expressed some anxiety about the jump and Taylor was at one point [...] "impaled" [...] by one of Craig Jones' spikes. When Shawn comes up he does it with his baseball bat.|$|R

40|$|If {{critics are}} to be believed, the use of video on the {{theatrical}} stage had {{become something of a}} fad by {{the early years of the}} new millennium. "Multimedia," wrote Lyn Gardner in the Guardian, "is a word I've come to dread in the theatre. There was a period around five years ago <b>when</b> <b>you</b> could hardly <b>step</b> inside a theatre to see a new play without encountering a bank of video monitors. " Diedrich Diederichsen recounts the similarly exasperated tone of a Berlin critic, who wrote in December 2003 of her wish for the coming year that the Berlin Volksbuhne might resist using video projections just once. Opera, meanwhile, has been no stranger to this fascination with video.
