5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that there is still much to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|The {{first house}} on the site was built as a hunting lodge in 1717 for the Duke of Schomberg, a British army {{commander}} of German origin. He {{is said to have}} been very argumentative, to the point where he <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> with all those around him bar the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{to suicide}} include Christian {{philosophers}} such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant and, arguably, John Stuart Mill – Mill's {{focus on the}} importance of liberty and autonomy meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions. Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice. Supporters of this position maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age, with no possibility of improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. A stronger stance <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that people should be allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume and American bioethicist Jacob Appel.|$|E
5000|$|Derrida <b>would</b> even <b>argue</b> that in {{a certain}} way he was more close to Austin, than Searle that, in fact, was more close to {{continental}} philosophers that himself tried to criticize.He <b>would</b> also <b>argue</b> about the problem he found in the constant appeal to [...] "normality" [...] in the analytical tradition from which Austin and Searle were only paradigmatic examples.|$|R

5|$|Tarbosaurus bataar was {{originally}} {{described as a}} species of Tyrannosaurus, an arrangement that has been supported by some more recent studies. Others prefer to keep the genera separate, while still recognizing them as sister taxa. A 2003 cladistic analysis based on skull features instead identified Alioramus as the closest known relative of Tarbosaurus, as the two genera share skull characteristics {{that are related to}} stress distribution and that are not found in other tyrannosaurines. If proven, this relationship <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> against Tarbosaurus becoming a synonym for Tyrannosaurus and would suggest that separate tyrannosaurine lineages evolved in Asia and North America. The two known specimens of Alioramus, which show juvenile characteristics, are not likely juvenile individuals of Tarbosaurus because of their much higher tooth count (76 to 78 teeth) and their unique row of bony bumps along the top of their snouts.|$|E
25|$|Xenoarchaeology is {{sometimes}} called astroarchaeology or exoarchaeology, although some <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that the prefix exo- would be more correctly applied {{to the study of}} human activities in a space environment.|$|E
25|$|The figures do {{not include}} the cost of {{operating}} military resources deployed to provide aid, and it is unclear how this should be quantified. While some <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that military resources are already paid for and that the relief effort can be regarded as a logistics training exercise, the increased operational costs are an unbudgeted expenditure. Others <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that the military resources provide the only infrastructure that will deliver aid in a timely manner to save lives to the hardest hit and neediest areas, and without this quickly deployable infrastructure the other contributions, no matter how large would be useless or arrive too late.|$|E

25|$|An objectivist <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> {{that the}} {{religious}} experience is a proof of God's existence. However, others have criticised the reliability of religious experiences. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes asked how {{it was possible to}} tell the difference between talking to God in a dream, and dreaming about talking to God.|$|E
25|$|Book-burning censorship, Bradbury <b>would</b> <b>argue,</b> was a side-effect {{of these}} two primary factors; this is {{consistent}} with Captain Beatty's speech to Montag {{about the history of the}} firemen. According to Bradbury, it is the people, not the state, who are the culprit in Fahrenheit 451. Nevertheless, the role on censorship, state-based or otherwise, is still perhaps the most frequent theme explored in the work.|$|E
25|$|Many historians {{consider}} these {{to be merely}} the immediate causes of the war. They <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that the underlying cause was the growing resentment {{on the part of}} Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs. The war lasted 27 years, partly because Athens (a naval power) and Sparta (a land-based military power) found it difficult {{to come to grips with}} each other.|$|E

25|$|There {{are those}} in golf who <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> into next month that the final two rounds of the 1977 British Open were the {{greatest}} head-to-head golf match ever played. Not having been around {{for the first five}} hundred or so years of the game, I'm not qualified to speak on such matters. What's for sure, however, is that it was the most thrilling one-on-one battle of my career.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the model}} is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three {{different}} types of English— ENL, ESL and EFL, are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes pidgins, creoles and L2 Englishes. Most scholars <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that English pidgins and creoles {{do not belong to}} one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.|$|E
25|$|Still more pacifists <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that a nonviolent {{reaction}} may {{not save}} lives immediately but would {{in the long}} run. The acceptance of violence for any reason {{makes it easier to}} use in other situations. Learning and committing to pacifism helps to send a message that violence is, in fact, not the most effective way. It can also help people to think more creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.|$|E

25|$|Nicolas Sarkozy (Union for a Popular Movement) {{proposed}} a simplified European treaty {{which would be}} ratified by the French Parliament instead of being submitted to a referendum. He also declared himself against the rule of unanimity in European decisions and opposed the accession of Turkey to the European Union. Furthermore, he said he <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> in favour of revaluing the euro, increasing the European defence budget and creating a European Foreign Affairs Minister.|$|E
25|$|Jones's and Nebel's {{claims were}} first made public in 1976 (in Donald Bain's The Control of Candy Jones, {{published}} by Playboy Press). Nebel apparently accepted his wife's claims, and openly discussed killing Dr. Jensen in revenge. However, Nebel was a prankster and a hoaxer of long standing {{and as he}} was not above hoaxing his radio audience, some of whom doubted the recovered memories of Candy Jones's past were genuine. Later skeptics <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that an alleged false memory syndrome was a more plausible explanation.|$|E
25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always morally wrong, the casuist <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that, {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal testimony under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized a doctrine of mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|E

25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} things. And I <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{stands by}} its doctrines on sexual {{intercourse}} {{as defined by}} the Natural law: intercourse must at once be both the renewal of the consummation of marriage and open to procreation. If each of these postulates are not met, the act of intercourse is, according to Natural Law, an objectively grave sin. Therefore, since artificial contraception expressly prevents {{the creation of a new}} life (and, the Church <b>would</b> <b>argue,</b> removes the sovereignty of God over all of Creation), contraception is unacceptable. The Church sees abstinence as the only objective moral strategy for preventing the transmission of HIV.|$|E
25|$|No one {{can prove}} {{conclusively}} {{that he was}} a primary cause of the end of communism. However, the major figures on all sides—not just Lech Wałęsa, the Polish Solidarity leader, but also Solidarity's arch-opponent, General Wojciech Jaruzelski; not just the former American president George Bush Senior but also the former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev—now agree that he was. I <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> the historical case in three steps: without the Polish Pope, no Solidarity revolution in Poland in 1980; without Solidarity, no dramatic change in Soviet policy towards eastern Europe under Gorbachev; without that change, no velvet revolutions in 1989.|$|E
