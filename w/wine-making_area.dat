25|$|Lake breezes {{in spring}} tend to retard fruit bloom until the frost danger is past, {{and in the}} autumn delay the onset of fall frost, {{particularly}} on the south shore. Cool onshore winds also retard early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season, protecting them from possible frost damage. Such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate, with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area. Apples, cherries, pears, plums, and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around Rochester. Between Stoney Creek and Niagara-on-the-Lake on the Niagara Peninsula is a major fruit-growing and <b>wine-making</b> <b>area.</b> The wine-growing region extends over the international border into Niagara and Orleans counties. Apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lake's north shore, around Cobourg.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, some {{terms of}} Artificial Intelligence are defined. Some present and {{potential}} applications of knowledge based systems {{are presented in}} the field of <b>wine-making.</b> <b>Areas</b> of concern were: multi sensor fusion, prediction by model cooperation, and diagnosis. Artificial intelligence techniques can indeed be applied for aiding the wine-maker in his choices. They facilitate the combination between experience and recent progress in technology. When associated with statistical processing, they allow knowledge sources to be used more effectively. Beyond wine-making, the prospects of artificial intelligence are promising for research and food industry, especially for improving the robustness of measurement systems (multi-sensors, sensors interpreted or validated by models), and for process diagnosis (risk prediction, action proposal) ...|$|R
50|$|Principal {{industries}} are the balnearios (spa hotels) and a lighting factory. There are extensive fruit farms and some <b>wine-making</b> in the <b>area.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} <b>wine-making</b> in the <b>area</b> {{goes back to}} at least the 3rd century when the Romans commented on <b>wine-making</b> in the <b>area.</b> It was boosted by monks of the Abbey of Roncesvalles in the 11th century who planted the first large scale {{vineyards}} to provide wine for pilgrims travelling along the Way of St James. Following the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, the monks {{had to give up}} wine-making and the vineyards which were taken over by the local villagers.|$|R
50|$|Roero is a {{recognized}} <b>wine-making</b> <b>area</b> of the Province of Cuneo in the Piedmont region; {{along with its}} neighbours Langhe and Monferrato it forms the “Distretto Langhe, Roero e Monferrato” wine district.|$|E
50|$|Bugey {{is located}} outside {{any of the}} major French wine regions, and is {{therefore}} usually counted as a small <b>wine-making</b> <b>area</b> of its own. Since the closest vineyards of Bugey and Savoy are within a few kilometers of another, {{it is not surprising}} that Bugey sometimes is thought to be a part of the Savoy wine region. However, it was historically a part of Burgundy and is located in another department (Ain) than Savoy.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the main track between Sydney and Newcastle, there is an extension that goes north to the Hunter Region. The extension departs from the main track {{in the vicinity of}} Brunkerville, and proceeds along a country road to the village of Paxton, passing abandoned coal mines along the way. From Paxton it proceeds north and follows the Mount View Range, where there are extensive views in the direction of Cessnock. The track then descends the northern end of the range before terminating in the <b>wine-making</b> <b>area</b> of Pokolbin.|$|E
50|$|Agricultural {{activities}} of the Dayuan reported by Zhang Qian included cultivation of grain and grapes for <b>wine-making.</b> The <b>area</b> of Fergana was thus the theater of the first major interaction between an urbanized culture speaking Indo-European languages and the Chinese civilization, {{which led to the}} opening up the Silk Road from the 1st century BC onwards.|$|R
40|$|Having {{reviewed}} {{a variety}} of approaches to understanding the essence of wine industry, having studied the modern ideas about the future of wine industry, having analyzed more than 50 maps from the Internet we have set the trends and special features of wine industry mapping in the world, such as: - {{the vast majority of}} maps displays the development of the industry at regional or national level, whereas there are practically no world maps; - wine-growing regions are represented on maps very unevenly; - all existing maps of the industry could be classified as analytical ascertaining inventory type; - the dominant ways of cartographic representation are area method and qualitative background method, sign method and collation maps are rarely used; - basically all the Internet maps have low quality as they are scanned images with poor resolution; - the special feature of maps published lately is lack of geographical basis (except for state borders and coastline).  We created wine production and consumption world map «Wine Industry» in the scale of 1 : 60 000 000 with simple geographical basis (state names, state borders, major rivers, coastline).  It was concluded that from the methodological point of view it is incorrect not to show geographical basis on maps of wine industry.  Analysis of this map allowed us to identify <b>areas</b> of traditional <b>wine-making,</b> potential <b>wine-making</b> <b>areas</b> and countries which claim to be the world leaders in the field of wine production. We found disbalans between wine production and wine consumption - increasing wine production in South America, China and the United States and increasing wine consumption (mainly due to the import products) in countries where the grape is not the primary agricultural product...|$|R
50|$|Fossils of Vitis teutonica {{vine leaves}} near the Naslavcia {{village in the}} north of Moldova {{indicate}} that grapes grew here approximately 6 to 25 million years ago. The size of grape seed imprints found near the Varvarovca village, which date back to 2800 BC, prove that at that time the grapes were already being cultivated. The grapegrowing and <b>wine-making</b> in the <b>area</b> between the Nistru and Prut rivers, which began 4000-5000 years ago, had periods of rises and falls but has survived through all the changing social and economic conditions.|$|R
50|$|In the 16th and 17th {{century the}} {{principal}} wine growing {{area of the}} Americas was in the central and southern coast of Peru, specifically {{in the area of}} Ica and Pisco. Apart from Peru and Chile Paraguay developed despite its high temperatures into a <b>wine-making</b> <b>area</b> in the 16th century. Hernando Arias de Saavedra who visited the city of Asunción in 1602 said there was 187 vineyards totalling 1.768.000 individual plants. Other sources cite 2.000.000 and 1.778.000 plants around the same time. Paraguayan wine was exported downstream to Santa Fe and from there to the Platine market. Paraguayan wine is also known to have reached Córdoba in central Argentina.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} areas in Mexico where wine grapes are grown. The North area {{includes}} Baja California and Sonora; the La Laguna area is in Coahuila and Durango and the Center area consists of Zacatecas, Aguascalientes and Querétaro. Most {{of these areas}} have a fairly warm climate, which tend to make Mexican wines spicy, full-bodied and ripe; however, Northern Baja California's humid winters, dry warm summers and sea breezes allow {{for most of the}} same varietals produced in California.The La Laguna region is the oldest <b>wine-making</b> <b>area</b> of Mexico, and straddles the states of Coahuila and Durango, with grapes thriving in the Parras Valley. This valley is a microclimate in the desert area of these states at an altitude of 1,500 meters. The valley has warm days, cool nights and low humidity which inhibits insect and fungus damage to the vines. Mountain springs provide sufficient water in this arid part of Mexico. The temperature difference of [...] between day and night is also beneficial to the grapes. The valley primarily produces reds based on Bordeaux such as cabernet sauvignon, Shiraz, merlot and Tempranillo. Some whites are produced as well. More than 400 families come to the Parras Valley in August and September for the annual grape harvest called “la vendimia.” ...|$|E
