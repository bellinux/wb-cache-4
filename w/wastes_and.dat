5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided {{it was not necessary}} to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic <b>wastes,</b> <b>and</b> low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E
5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide {{the best way to}} get in and out of the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both <b>wastes</b> <b>and</b> toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they move through the tunnel, in order to avoid blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies to get rid of the deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E

Fourty males Spraque dowley rats, aged two months with average body weight was 195. 62 g, were randomly assigned to one of ten experimental treatments according to completely randomised design with four replication for each treatment. The treatments were R 0 (control diet), ASA 20 LU 0 (20 % sago <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> 0 % shrimp waste), ASA 0 LU 10 (0 % sago <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> 10 % shrimp waste), ASA 17. 5 LU 2. 5 (17. 5 % sago <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> 2. 5 % shrimp waste), ASA 15 LU 5 % (15 % sago <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> 5 % shrimp waste), ASA 12. 5 LU 7. 5 (12. 5 % sago <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> 7. 5 % shrimp waste), ASA 10 LU 10 (10 % sago <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> 10 % shrimp waste), ASA 7. 5 LU 12. 5 (7. 5 % sago <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> 12. 5 % shrimp waste), ASA 5 LU 15 (5 % sago <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> 15 % shrimp waste %), ASA 2. 5 LU 17. 5 (2. 5 % sago <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> 17. 5 % shrimp waste). Variables measured included feed intake, live weight gain, plasma cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride and meat cholesterol. The results showed that treatments had no (P> 0. 05) effects on feed intake, live weight gain, feed efficiency, plasma HDL and LDL as well as meat cholesterol. However significant differences (P< 0. 01) were found on plasma cholesterol and plasma triglyceride due to treatment. The lowest levels of plasma cholesterol and plasma triglyceride were observed for treatment ASA 15 LU which were 45. 95 mg/dl and 43. 81 mg/dl,crespectively. It can be concluded that levels of sago <b>waste,</b> shrimp <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> the combinations in the ration do not affect feed intake, weight gain, feed efficiency, plasma HDL, plasma LDL and meat cholesterol but it affected plasma triglycerides and plasma cholesterol of rat...|$|R

The characteristics of solid <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> recycling programs vary greatly across North Carolina, achieving variable levels of recyclable material recovery rates. Given that solid waste disposal is increasing at a significant rate in North Carolina and approximately 20 years of landfill space remain in the state’s landfills, solid <b>waste</b> directors <b>and</b> recycling coordinators face an enormous amount of pressure to divert as much materials as possible to recycling programs. Through a survey of North Carolina solid <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> recycling program managers, this study collected vital data regarding characteristics of <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> recycling collection programs including pickup frequencies, weekly <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> recycling collection capacities, recycling separation requirements, and other variables presumed to be related to recyclable material recovery rates. Using correlation analyses and significance tests, the study revealed which solid <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> recycling program characteristics are most closely related to recyclable materials recovery. The study showed the three variables most closely related to recyclable materials recovery are recycling pickup frequency, separation methods and provision of recycling equipment. Solid <b>waste</b> <b>and</b> recycling program managers interested in maximizing recyclable material recovery rates should evaluate these three program attributes first to determine if improvements could be made. Recycling pickup frequency should be maximized, separation methods should be minimized and local governments should increase convenience for residents to obtain recycling bins or carts...|$|R
