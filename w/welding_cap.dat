40|$|Ultrasonic {{inspection}} is {{the primary}} technique {{for the detection of}} planar flaws within the nuclear industry. Current inspections are typically limited to the application of rigid wedge, single element transducers to components with regular surface geometry. This thesis addresses some of the limitations of this approach and develops new methods and techniques that are suitable for application in an industrial environment. Inspection modelling is a cost effective technique for inspection design and qualification; {{it can be used to}} aid understanding of the inspection process, and provides valuable insight into inspection data interpretation. In this work semianalytical and numerical modelling tools have been used to accurately and efficiently simulate the ultrasonic inspection of large complex components. Modelling tools have also been applied to aid in the design of a membrane coupled conformable phased array device. The membrane coupled array is a low-cost, robust device that uses a conventional phased array coupled to the outer surface of the component under test via a water path encapsulated by low-loss membrane. Early design of this device was performed by Long and Cawley at Imperial College, London. The work reviewed in this thesis discussed the further development of this membrane coupled device and its application for the inspection of a specific target application component. The target application is a safety critical, thick-walled stainless steel section of pipework that contains an austenitic weld. The current inspection of this component is carried out by first removing the component <b>weld</b> <b>cap</b> and then mechanically raster scanning a large number of rigid wedge single element transducers. <b>Weld</b> <b>cap</b> removal is an expensive time consuming task that can lead to excessive wall thinning and the exposure of small surface breaking defects. The motivation for this work is to provide complete inspection of the weld and heat affected zone with the <b>weld</b> <b>cap</b> in place. It is also designed to improve inspection speed and accuracy, and to reduce the amount of user intervention required to complete the inspection in a hostile environment Inspection results from the 2 nd and 3 rd generation membrane coupled device on multiple test-pieces representative of the target application are presented. These results demonstrate that the membrane coupled device can be used to detect defects in locations that cannot be inspected using conventional techniques. The amount of scanning required can be significantly reduced, simplifying the inspection and helping to improve inspection speed by over 60 % in comparison to the single element approach.

40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} inspection of components with irregular surface geometry is challenging. Flexible arrays {{are available to}} improve the inspection {{of this type of}} component but inspection performance is adversely affected by errors in the assumed or measured position of each element within the flexible array. This can result in image aberration and reduced defect detection and characterisation performance. A novel autofocus algorithm has been developed specifically for ultrasonic nondestructive testing and evaluation (NDE). This autofocus algorithm is used for estimating and correcting errors in the assumed element positions for a flexible ultrasonic array coupled to a specimen with an unknown surface profile. Experimental results are provided using a prototype flexible array to inspect a component containing a realistic, undressed <b>weld</b> <b>cap.</b> The results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of generating autofocused imagery that is comparable in quality to benchmark imagery generated using accurately known imaging parameters...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{and safe}} {{management}} of nuclear plant components relies on accurate prediction of welding-induced residual stresses. In this study, {{the distribution of}} residual stress through the thickness of austenitic stainless steel welds has been measured using neutron diffraction and the contour method. The measured data are used to validate residual stress profiles predicted by an artificial neural network approach (ANN) {{as a function of}} welding heat input and geometry. Maximum tensile stresses with magnitude close to the yield strength of the material were observed near the <b>weld</b> <b>cap</b> in both axial and hoop direction of the welds. Significant scatter of more than 200 MPa was found within the residual stress measurements at the weld center line and are associated with the geometry and welding conditions of individual weld passes. The ANN prediction is developed in an attempt to effectively quantify this phenomenon of ‘innate scatter’ and to learn the non-linear patterns in the weld residual stress profiles. Furthermore, the efficacy of the ANN method for defining through-thickness residual stress profiles in welds for application in structural integrity assessments is evaluated...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{control of}} steel welds {{is crucial in}} {{the oil and gas}} transportation industry. The state-of-the-art method is zonal focusing which consists in focusing the ultrasonic beam at specific distances using a wedge in order to check the integrity of specific zones in the weld. Advanced methods such as the total focusing method (TFM) give potentially better images in terms of signal to noise ratio and flaw resolution [1]. Moreover, a complete view of the weld is possible using TFM, contrary to zonal focusing. In this paper, we present a fast implementation of the TFM imaging for weld inspection using wedges. In particular, we propose a GPU implementation that tremendously accelerates the process and makes nearly real-time applications possible. The configuration with two media necessitates an optimization iterative procedure to estimate the proper times of flight, which is implemented in the GPU as well. We also present several skip modes in order to visualize different flaw orientations and locations in the <b>weld</b> (<b>cap,</b> root, etc.). First, we give imaging results on an aluminum block containing artificial flaws such as porosity or lack of fusion. We make a comparison between TFM and conventional imaging, and show that TFM gives better results in terms of image quality (SNR, resolution). Finally, we show results of a real girth weld inspection and demonstrate that the use of TFM is definitely interesting in this context...|$|R

40|$|One of OPG thermal {{station was}} {{designed}} for a stand-by situation to supply within 10 minutes 2, 000 MW to the grid during the summer/winter peaks. These starts-stops led to a high stress on economizer piping welds. Fatigue cracks filled with oxides were developed at the toe root and in the counterbores. Finite element stress analysis (FESA), supported by operating experience data, predicted the life of these welds based on cracks located namely in the counterbore areas (see Figure 1). Periodic and inservice inspections, including TOFD, were performed during a 20 + years of service and the crack growth was monitor based on ISI results. ECA team was asked OPG-Inspection and Maintenance Services (IMS) to detect and size fatigue cracks in the counterbore area of carbon steel boiler feedwater piping welds (OD x t = 324 mm x 38 mm) of a thermal station. A sizing accuracy of ± 1 mm for the outer ligament was required. It was documented the fatigue cracks could be branched, change the morphology (from oxide-filled wide width to hair-tight aspect); they are tilt at different angles and the cracks have different shapes, with the crack starting location eroded by water and oxide products (see Figure 2). <b>Weld</b> <b>cap</b> may not be totally removed {{in the field and}} access from fitting (Tee) side is limited.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} transverse {{residual stress}} and strain measurements aimed at quantifying end effects in single and multi-pass weld-runs. Two test specimens are examined: a 60 mm long weld bead deposited {{on the surface of}} a 180 mm × 120 mm × 17 mm thick stainless steel plate, and a 62 ° arc-length multi-pass repair weld in a 432 mm outer diameter, 19. 6 mm thick stainless steel pipe girth weld. The residual stress measurements were made by employing the relatively new Contour method and by neutron diffraction using ENGIN-X, the engineering spectrometer at the ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK). The measured underlying transverse residual stress levels are observed to be essentially uniform directly beneath the weld bead in the plate specimen and in the heat affected zone beneath the capping passes moving from mid-length towards the stop-end of the pipe repair. However, results from both test components demonstrate the existence of short-range concentrations of transverse residual stress along the welding direction owing to individual <b>weld</b> <b>capping</b> bead start and stop effects. Such short length-scale stress variations must be allowed for when interpreting residual stress measurements from line-scans. The experimental work also demonstrates the importance of knowing the expected stress or strain distribution prior to choosing measurement lines for detailed study. The Contour measurement method and neutron strain scanning are powerful tools for mapping residual {{stress and strain}} fields. Copyright © 2005 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|Laser welding is a {{promising}} technique for welding thick metal sheets, {{which is usually}} used for achieving full penetration in a single weld pass. However, among the imperfections that can occur, dropout formation becomes an increasingly larger problem when the sheets to be welded get thicker. When the sheets are 15 mm or thicker {{it is a challenge}} to suppress and countermeasures to suppress dropouts get less impact. If full penetration is not achieved, the dropout formation cannot be formed and the melt flows to form better <b>weld</b> <b>caps.</b> Therefore a typical method when welding 15 mm and thicker is to use partial penetration {{from both sides of the}} joint and thereby achieving full penetration, at a cost of increasing plate handling complexities and time losses. If the mechanisms behind the dropout formation can be understood, countermeasures may be developed and applied in order to be able to laser weld thicker plates with full penetration single pass welding. In order to understand the mechanics of the formation of dropout during full penetration welding in 15 mm thick plates, experiments have been conducted using laser hybrid arc welding (LAHW) using the laser in CW mode and also applying power modulation. During the experiments, the root has been observed with High Speed Imaging (HSI) to observe the mechanisms behind the formation. It is determined that the downward flow from the keyhole along with the surface tensional forces of the molten steel and its cooling rate play the most significant roles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} is to document the structural adequacy of Multi-Canister Overpacks (MCOs) in two separate normal configurations for the 40 -year interim period in the storage tubes at the Canister Storage Building (CSB). The two configurations apply when the lower MCO is arranged with (1) just a shield plug mechanical closure or (2) with the canister cover welded over the shield plug. Multiple analyses have been conducted to show the MCO design is adequate for drop events involving a lower, passive MCO being struck by an overhead drop load MCO both in vertical position. Minimal plastic deformations are experienced for either the MCO with shield plug or the MCO with cover cap. This survivability at 35 g's demonstrates the package's worthiness for 40 years of storage. The force between the two MCOs created by a drop event far exceed that resulting from stacking two loaded MCOs. The stacking load condition is not a structural concern and is, therefore, acceptable for the design duration of 40 years of storage. Both mechanical and <b>welded</b> <b>cap</b> models have the lifting ring and associated flat plate for the top unit to rest on and, therefore, easily fit together. Both designs were analyzed for the top unit to be dropped onto the lower unit. The mechanical seal unit only has high localized stress.

Each weldment was sliced into several pieces, and various locations on the surfaces of these pieces were specified for measurements. In addition, some locations on the <b>weld</b> <b>caps</b> and <b>weld</b> roots were given different finishes (as-welded, lightly polished, ground flush, and filed flush) to assess {{the effect of these}} surface finishes on the measurements. The specimens were circulated to 17 different laboratories in 9 different countries around the world. A Summary Report (distributed to two Commissions within the International Institute of Welding in 2001, as IIW Documents II- 1440 - 01 and IXH- 512 - 01) presented the data and some preliminary analysis of the data. That report recommended a more comprehensive statistical analysis, which {{is the subject of this}} report. First, a two-way analysis of variance showed that the laboratory and area (location within the specimen) were both statistically significant variables and so both were considered in further analyses. Next, Tukey analyses showed the large number of statistically distinct subsets into which both the laboratory and area data could be divided. Box-and-whiskers plots for these weldments show the distribution of the data, both by laboratory and by area.

5000|$|To be {{representative}} of the average temperature of fluid, the thermowell must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the process pipe or vessel (Normally 1/3 rd of the pipe inside diameter). A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (approximately 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the thermowell projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element. So, for a grounded thermocouple spring-loaded into a thermowell with a 1-inch-diameter shank and a tip thickness of [...]25 inch, a typical immersion length would equal 5.5 inches (1 inch OD x 5 + [...]25 inch well tip thickness +.25 inch sensor wall thickness = 5.5 inches). A thermowell is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long straight bore that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a [...]260-inch bore matching a [...]250-inch sensor). A thermowell is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, <b>welded,</b> sanitary <b>cap</b> or flanged process connection. The temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or resistance temperature detector is inserted in the open end of the thermowell and typically spring-loaded to ensure that the outside tip of the temperature sensor is in metal to metal contact with the inside tip of the thermowell.|$|R

40|$|In two-sided {{structural}} cold plates, typically {{there is}} a structural member, such as a honeycomb panel, that provides the structural strength for the cold plates that cool equipment. The cold plates are located {{on either side of}} the structural member and thus need to have the cooling fluid supplied to them. One method of accomplishing this is to route the inlet and outlet tubing to both sides of the structural member. Another method might be to supply the inlet to one side and the outlet to the other. With the latter method, an external feature such as a hose, tube, or manifold must be incorporated to pass the fluid from one side of the structural member to the other. Although this is a more compact design than the first option, since it eliminates the need for a dedicated supply and return line to each side of the structural member, it still poses problems, as these external features can be easily damaged and are now new areas for potential fluid leakage. This invention eliminates the need for an external feature and instead incorporates the feature internally to the structural member. This is accomplished by utilizing a threaded insert that not only connects the cold plate to the structural member, but also allows the cooling fluid to flow through it into the structural member, and then to the cold plate on the opposite side. The insert also employs a cap that acts as a cover to seal the open area needed to install the insert. There are multiple options for location of o-ring style seals, as well as the option to use adhesive for redundant sealing. Another option is to <b>weld</b> the <b>cap</b> to the cold plate after its installation, thus making it an integral part of the structural member. This new configuration allows the fluid to pass from one cold plate to the other without any exposed external features...|$|R

The triggers that cause landslides are well understood and include intense precipitation events, seismic shaking, destabilizing activities, and the over-steepening of slopes. However, these triggers were absent when the Silt Creek Landslide initiated, and determining this landslide’s subsurface hydrologic conditions {{is the focus}} of this study. Located on the western slopes of the Cascade mountain range in Oregon and within an active logging area, the landslide reactivated during the summer of 2014 at a site that had previous landslides dating back to at least 1994. The area is underlain by poorly <b>welded</b> tuffs <b>capped</b> with basaltic flows. Considering the near-drought to drought conditions that existed 3 years’ prior, it has a relatively high rate of slip of approximately 15 m/yr. On March 4 th, 2016 I obtained twelve water samples from surface flow and springs on the landslide for isotope analysis of oxygen (18 O) and deuterium (D). Comparing the resultant mean, - 10. 09 ‰ δ 18 O, against well-defined linear elevation/ δ 18 O relationships for western Oregon and the Global Meteoric Water Line for δ 18 O / δD the source of surface flow and groundwater likely originates from a pond above the head scarp. Analysis of precipitation data over a 42 -year period prior to reactivation confirms the drought-like conditions existing at time of reactivation. These conditions align with the ‘bathtub’ model wherein an older landslide creates the conditions for repeated failures by aligning platy clay minerals such that the hydraulic conductivity is reduced to the point that a perched aquifer forms. This provides lubrication for subsequent landslides even during periods of low precipitation. Understanding the mechanisms operating on this landslide can inform future assessments of hazard and risk as well as appropriate mitigation strategies...|$|R

It consists of a C-C (carbon-carbon) shell made from poly-acrylonitride fibers that are woven in an angle interlock pattern and densified with pitch at high process temperature with integrally woven fins. The fins are 2. 5 cm long and 1 mm thick, and provide an extended radiating surface at the colder condenser section of the heat pipe. The weave pattern features a continuous fiber bath from the inner tube surface to the outside edges of the fins to maximize the thermal conductance, and to thus minimize the temperature drop at the condenser end. The heat pipe and radiator element together are less than one-third the mass of conventional heat pipes of the same heat rejection surface area. To prevent the molten potassium working fluid from eroding the C C heat pipe wall, the shell is lined with a thin-walled, metallic tube liner (Nb- 1 wt. % Zr), which {{is an integral part of}} a hermetic metal subassembly which is furnace-brazed to the inner surface of the C-C tube.

The shell has a nominal thickness of 1 / 2 inch. The top closure consists of a shield plug with four processing ports and a locking ring with jacking bolts to pre-load a metal seal under the shield plug. The fuel is placed in one of four types of baskets, excluding the SPR fuel baskets, in the fuel retention basin. Each basket is then loaded into the MCO which is inside the transfer cask. Once all of the baskets are loaded into the MCO, the shield plug with a process tube is placed into the open end of the MCO. This shield plug provides shielding for workers when the transfer cask, containing the MCO, is lifted from the pool. After being removed from the pool, the locking ring is installed and the jacking bolts are tightened to pre-load the metal main closure seal. The cask is then sealed and the MCO taken to the Cold Vacuum Drying (CVD) facility for bulk water removal and vacuum drying through the process ports. Covers for the process ports may be installed or removed as needed per operating procedures. The MCO is then transferred to the Canister Storage Building (CSB), in the closed transfer cask. At the CSB, the MCO is then removed from the cask and becomes one of two MCOs stacked in a storage tube. MCOs will have a cover <b>cap</b> <b>welded</b> over the shield plug providing a complete welded closure.

40|$|A {{significant}} amount of effort {{has been devoted to}} determining the properties and understanding the behavior of the alloy MA 957 to define its potential usefulness as a cladding material, in the fast breeder reactor program. The numerous characterization and fabrication studies that were conducted are documented in this report. The alloy is a ferritic stainless steel developed by International Nickel Company specifically for structural reactor applications. It is strengthened by a very fine, uniformly distributed yttria dispersoid. Its fabrication involves a mechanical alloying process and subsequent extrusion, which ultimately results in a highly elongated grain structure. While the presence of the dispersoid produces a material with excellent strength, the body centered cubic structure inherent to the material coupled with the high aspect ratio that results from processing operations produces some difficulties with ductility. The alloy is very sensitive to variations in a number of processing parameters, and if the high strength is once lost during fabrication, it cannot be recovered. The microstructural evolution of the alloy under irradiation falls into two regimes. Below about 550 C, dislocation development, {alpha}{prime} precipitation and void evolution in the matrix are observed, while above about 550 C damage appears to be restricted to cavity formation within oxide particles. The thermal expansion of the alloy is very similar to that of HT 9 up to the temperature where HT 9 undergoes a phase transition to austenitic. Pulse magnetic <b>welding</b> of end <b>caps</b> onto MA 957 tubing can be accomplished {{in a manner similar to}} that in which it is performed on HT 9, although the welding parameters appear to be very sensitive to variations in the tubing that result from small changes in fabrication conditions. The tensile and stress rupture behavior of the alloy are acceptable in the unirradiated condition, being comparable to HT 9 below about 700 C and exceeding those of HT 9 at higher temperatures. Neither tensile nor rupture strength appear to be degraded by irradiation to fast fluencies on the order of 8 x 10 {sup 22 } n/cm{sup 2 } in the range of 370 [...] 760 C, although some loss of ductility has been observed.
