She <b>writes</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> about Verona: [...] "I {{was really in}} Italy. Not Maya Angelou, the person of pretensions and ambitions, but me, Marguerite Johnson, who had read about Verona and the sad lovers {{while growing up in}} a dusty Southern village poorer and more tragic than the historic town in which I now stood." ...|$|E

In {{the second part of the}} section, Murasaki Shikibu is musing about her melancholic life because of an [...] "extraordinary sorrow", wishing to be more adaptable and mindless. Wondering whether she is too sinful, she yearns for a religious life. Seeing waterfowl playing heedlessly in a pond, she <b>writes</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> waka: ...|$|E

2500|$|The first results {{concerning}} binomial {{series for}} other than positive-integer exponents were given by Sir Isaac Newton {{in the study}} of areas enclosed under certain curves. John Wallis built upon this work by considering expressions of the form ynbsp&=nbsp&(1nbsp&minus&nbsp&x2)m where m is a fraction. He found that (written in modern terms) the successive coefficients c'k of (-x2)k are to be found by multiplying the preceding coefficient by [...] (as in the case of integer exponents), thereby implicitly giving a formula for these coefficients.

2500|$|Tantric {{iconography}} including sharp weapons, shields, and corpses similarly {{appears in}} conflict with those tenets of non-violence but instead represent the transmutation of aggression into a method for overcoming illusion and ego. Both Kālacakra and his dharmapala protector Vajravega hold a sword and shield in their paired second right and left hands. This {{is an expression of}} the Buddha's triumph over the attack of Mara and his protection of all sentient beings.

The document has been conscientiously edited and neatly written. It contains reminders to foster better relations with his father; commentary on a letter from a Professor of Literature; a list of vocabulary words to study and notes on his meditation schedule - all matters of self-improvement. While making his daily entry, he <b>writes</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> non sequitur: “It will either happen today or February 14, 1958 when I am sixteen.

2500|$|The Dutch {{habit of}} naming newborns after another family member {{originates}} with a then-widespread superstition {{that the name}} in some way contributed {{to some form of}} reincarnation of the person the child was named after, who was usually much older. This superstition disappeared after some time, even though a certain Le Francq van Berkeij <b>writes</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> in 1776: [...] "bij veelen, een oud, overgeloovig denkbeeld, dat iemand weldra sterft, wanneer hij, gelijk men zegt, vernoemd is" [...] (many have a superstitious belief that a person will soon die when someone, as they say, has been named after him).|$|E
2500|$|Johannes Climacus, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, <b>writes</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> cryptic line: [...] "Subjectivity is Truth". To {{understand}} Climacus's {{concept of}} the individual, {{it is important to}} look at what he says regarding subjectivity. What is subjectivity? In very rough terms, subjectivity refers to what is personal to the individual—what makes the individual who he is in distinction from others. It is what is inside—what the individual can see, feel, think, imagine, dream, etc. It is often opposed to objectivity—that which is outside the individual, which the individual and others around can feel, see, measure, and think about. Another way to interpret subjectivity is the unique relationship between the subject and object.|$|E
