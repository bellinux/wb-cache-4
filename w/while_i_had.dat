500|$|During his 1966 tour, Dylan was {{described}} as exhausted and acting [...] "as if on a death trip". D. A. Pennebaker, the film maker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as [...] "taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else." [...] In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I {{was on the road}} for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things... just to keep going, you know?" [...] In 2011, BBC Radio 4 reported that, in an interview that Robert Shelton taped in 1966, Dylan said he had kicked heroin in New York City: [...] "I got very, very strung out for a <b>while...</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> about a $25-a-day habit and I kicked it." [...] Some journalists questioned the validity of this confession, pointing out that Dylan had [...] "been telling journalists wild lies about his past since the earliest days of his career." ...|$|E
2500|$|R.H.Mallett, {{about to}} return to England after {{managing}} the 1929–30 MCC touring party, met the West Indies Board and recommended G C 'Jack' Grant as captain for the Australian tour, even though Grant had no experience of captaincy and had never played in West Indies before. In his biography Grant confessed [...] "I was younger {{than all of the}} sixteen players, save three; and most of these sixteen had already played for the West Indies, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not. Yet I was the captain. It could not be disputed that my white colour was a major factor in my being given this post." ...|$|E
2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
