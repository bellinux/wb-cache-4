40|$|We study a {{workforce}} {{planning and}} scheduling problem in which <b>weekly</b> <b>tours</b> of agents must be designed. The {{problem is to}} satisfy estimated weekly demand for services provided by agents with workable <b>weekly</b> <b>tours</b> for the workforce. Our motivation comes from a call center application where agents serve customers in response to incoming phone calls. A weekly tour consists of five daily shifts and two days-off, where daily shifts within a tour may be different from each other. The starting times of any two consecutive shifts, however, may not differ {{by more than a}} specified bound. Furthermore, a tour must also satisfy constraints regarding the days-off, for example, it may be required that one of the days-off is on a weekend day. The objective is to determine a set of tours so that the demand for agents' services is well-served, while minimizing the total labor cost of the workforce. The difficulty of the problem arises {{from the fact that the}} demand for service varies significantly within [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Call centers face {{demand that}} varies {{throughout}} the week across multiple service categories and typically employ non-standard workforce schedules to meet this demand. In call centers, cross-training provides a buffer against fluctuation of demand between categories and is widely used. Full cross-training, however, is financially impractical in most cases, which has created a challenging problem in how to optimize a cross-trained workforce, i. e., a) what categories should be cross-trained, b) what portion of the workforce should be cross-trained, and c) how to schedule their weekly assignments. This problem is motivated by the need of a Fortune 50 company 2 ̆ 7 s technology support center to schedule its workforce with multiple service categories. To solve this problem to its fullest extent, a mixed integer programming model that addresses staff assignment composition, shift scheduling, days off assignment, and break assignment across multi-skilled agents is proposed. The model is gigantic in size with thousands of general integer variables and is hard to solve. To improve computational efficiency, a two-phase sequential optimization approach is developed. The first phase {{is to find the}} optimal composition of the workforce to decide what categories should be cross-trained and when they should be deployed; the second phase is a staff scheduling model to find the size of the workforce with their skill sets and their shifts and <b>weekly</b> <b>tours.</b> The two-phase approach is an order of magnitude faster than the original model and is able to obtain better solutions orders of magnitude faster. Experimental results with real data from the company clearly demonstrate the significance of cross-training; even partial limited cross-training, where 30...|$|E

40|$|For a given {{planning}} horizon, workforce {{composition and}} set of labor requirements, personnel scheduling often reduces to solving three problems. The first {{is concerned with}} the assignment of days off; the second involves assigning workers to shifts during the day; and the third involves the construction of <b>weekly</b> <b>tours.</b> In many manufacturing facilities, tour scheduling is easy because the start and end times of shifts are invariant, and no work takes place on the weekend. But when daily patterns vary, such as in the airlines, processing, and public service industries, and when part-timers make up a portion of the workforce, the complexity of the overall problem increases dramatically. This paper presents a new methodology for solving the combined shift and days-off scheduling problem when the labor requirements span less than 24 hours per day. We begin with an integer programming formulation and then introduce a set of aggregate variables and related cuts. When the aggregate variables are fixed the original problem decomposes into seven subproblems (one for each day of the week) that are much easier to solve. A partial enumeration scheme and a heuristic for ensuring feasibility are employed to find upper and lower bounds which converge rapidly to near-optima. The methodology is applied to tour scheduling at general mail facilities (GMFs). These facilities are located in most urban areas and process millions of mail pieces daily for local and regional distribution. The model accounts for the principal constraints in the U. S. Postal Service labor contract, including half-hour breaks, minimum full-time to part-time ratios, and variable start times. Also considered are four and five day work weeks, and the possibility of assigning workers across labor categories. A full analysis of the Providence, Rhode Island facility is presented. shift scheduling, days-off scheduling, tour scheduling, integer programming, branch and bound, U. S. postal service...|$|E
40|$|How many agents {{should be}} {{employed}} medium-term to optimize costs? And {{how can the}} agents available be used in short-term planning to satisfy the fluctuating demand? These are fundamental questions for Call Centers as human resource costs account for 60 %- 70 % of operating expenses. The problems specified above, {{the one of the}} medium-term labor staffing problem and the one of the short-term labor scheduling problem, are closely related. The output of the result of the labor staffing problem determines the workforces size and composition that are available for the labor staffing problem in particular weeks. Moreover while planning the labor staffing one has to anticipate the scheduling of the labor to satisfy the fluctuating demand within {{the course of a day}} and a week. Hence both problems should be solved simultaneously. The existing literature shows different approaches to solve parts of the labor staffing and the labor scheduling problem. So far there has not been any approach to determine a constant workforce size and composition that is able to compensate the strong fluctuation of demand and anticipate labor staffing problems at the same time. Such an approach is presented in this thesis. A mixed integer model for solving the staffing and scheduling of labor simultaneously is introduced. In doing so the labor scheduling problem is implemented in an aggregated manner concerning the duration of a period and the tours an agent can work. To get the <b>weekly</b> <b>tours</b> of the agents in the required duration of a period the output of the proposed model has to be disaggregated. Due to the complexity of the model an exact solution cannot be found in general. Hence different heuristic approaches are developed. After having them formulated various test instances are implemented to test the heuristic approaches. It turned out that the model and the approaches are able to determine a cost-efficient workforce size and composition that meets the weekly labor scheduling requirements. This is the first approach to model and solve the problem of labor staffing and scheduling problems simultaneously...|$|E

Several steps are taken for the staffing and tour scheduling of an IT help desk agents. First, data on the number of calls is used to estimate hourly labour requirements. Next, new scheduling options are proposed to better match these requirements. An Integer Programming (IP) model is then formulated and solved to determine tour scheduling assignments. Finally, alternative schedules are evaluated in terms of tradeoffs between workforce size and cost, service level and employee utilisation. The chosen tour schedules provide better service with a lower cost and a smaller number of employees.

40|$|An {{extensive}} literature {{exists on}} the problems of daily (shift) and <b>weekly</b> (<b>tour)</b> labor scheduling. In representing requirements for employees in these problems, researchers have used formulations based either on the model of Dantzig (1954) or on the model of Keith (1979). We show that both formulations have weakness in environments where management knows, or can attempt to identify, how different levels of customer service affect profits. These weaknesses results in lower-than-necessary profits. This paper presents a New Formulation of the daily and weekly Labor Scheduling Problems (NFLSP) designed to overcome the limitations of earlier models. NFLSP incorporates information on how changing the number of employees working in each planning period affects profits. NFLP uses this information during the development of the schedule to identify the number of employees who, ideally, should be working in each period. In an extensive simulation of 1, 152 service environments, NFLSP outperformed the formulations of Dantzig (1954) and Keith (1979) at a level of significance of 0. 001.

40|$|Many {{organizations}} face personnel scheduling decisions {{under conditions}} of variable demand for service across a seven-day planning horizon. These organizations must assign employees to daily shifts that efficiently satisfy the demand for labor, yet allow adequate time for rest between subsequent shifts of an employee's <b>weekly</b> <b>tour</b> schedule. To meet these diverse objectives, managers may permit shifts to begin (and end) in any planning period of the day, but place bands on shift-start times to which individuals may be assigned on each day of their tour schedule. We present a compact integer programming model that implicitly represents start-time band scheduling flexibility. We demonstrate the new model by applying it to requirements for toll collectors on the Illinois Tollway. Problems requiring up to two million variables using a general set covering formulation were represented using the new implicit programming model and often solved to optimality {{in just a few}} minutes on a Pentium-based microcomputer. The results indicate that start-time bands can provide an important improvement in scheduling efficiency when compared to the exclusive use of schedules that require workers to begin work on the same hour of the day on each day of their tour. integer programming, implicit formulation, personnel scheduling...|$|R
