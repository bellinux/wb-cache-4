5|$|Another {{prominent}} initiate was Gabriel Carillo (Caradoc ap Cador), who in {{the late}} 1970s developed a written body of Feri teachings, and began offering paid classes in the tradition in the 1980s, generating the Bloodrose lineage; doing so generated controversy among Feri initiates, with critics believing that it was morally <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> charge for teaching.|$|E

5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
60|$|But why so cruel? Because, {{with many}} of these men, I more than suspect, there were <b>wrongs</b> <b>to</b> be avenged deeper than any <b>wrongs</b> done <b>to</b> the sixth sense of vanity. <b>Wrongs</b> common <b>to</b> them, and to a great portion of the respectable middle class, {{and much of the}} lower class: but <b>wrongs</b> <b>to</b> which they and their families, being most in contact with the noblesse, would be {{especially}} exposed; namely, <b>wrongs</b> <b>to</b> women.|$|R

5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{family would}} have {{preferred}} him to have remained at Charterhouse for two more years {{and then go on}} to Cambridge University. They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling it would be <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E
5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} destroy them. With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E
5|$|Charles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916. Following the {{coronation}} {{there was a}} banquet, but after that the festivities ended, as the emperor and empress thought it <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> have prolonged celebrations {{during a time of}} war. At the beginning of the reign, Charles was more often than not away from Vienna, so he had a telephone line installed from Baden (where Charles's military headquarters were located) to the Hofburg. He called Zita several times a day whenever they were separated. Zita had some influence on her husband and would discreetly attend audiences with the Prime Minister or military briefings, and she had a special interest in social policy. However, military matters were the sole domain of Charles. Energetic and strong-willed, Zita accompanied her husband to the provinces and to the front, as well as occupying herself with charitable works and hospital visits to the war-wounded.|$|E

5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had been <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, news of Henry's {{death had}} reached Stephen of Blois, {{conveniently}} placed in Boulogne, {{and he left}} for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless Stephen reached the edge of London by 8 December {{and over the next}} week he began to seize power in England. The crowds in London proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return, and his brother, Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, delivered the support of the Church to Stephen. Stephen had sworn to support Matilda in 1127, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had been <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> insist that his court take the oath, and suggested that the King had changed his mind on his deathbed. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 26 December.|$|E
5|$|On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed {{a lawsuit}} against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, {{claiming}} that the PTC's statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that it was <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> blame the World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to blame the death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.|$|E

5|$|Passing through Cicuruk, the car {{breaks down}} and, while the chauffeur {{attempts}} to fix it, Kioe Lie takes shelter {{in a nearby}} home. He learns that it belongs to Kioe Gie and Hap Nio, who have built up a vast farm, garden, and orchard that provide them with ample income. The two philanthropists are friends with the area's elite, and Hap Nio is happily married to a rich plantation administrator. When Kioe Gie and his companions return from playing tennis, they discover Kioe Lie hiding shamefully under a piano. Kioe Lie admits that he was <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> be greedy. When a police officer arrives, Kioe Lie confesses to poisoning Tam Bing, then runs outside and shoots himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowds in}} London {{traditionally}} claimed {{a right to}} elect the king of England, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return. Henry of Blois delivered {{the support of the}} church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, who was both the Bishop of Salisbury and the Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen. On 15 December, Henry delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had been <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> insist that his court take the oath.|$|E
5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E
