There have been two seasons where the Islanders did not have a captain: 1996–97 and 2000–01.

30|$|The {{results from}} Sections 2 and 2.1 {{indicate}} that less-acculturated Indigenous workers {{have a significant}} penalty compared to Indigenous workers <b>who</b> speak <b>only</b> Spanish or those who are Mestizos. It is clear that Indigenous workers <b>who</b> speak <b>only</b> an Indigenous language have an earnings disadvantage because the dominant language in the Mexican labor market is Spanish. But, {{it is not clear}} why Indigenous workers <b>who</b> speak <b>only</b> Spanish have an earnings advantage compared to Indigenous workers who are bilingual. Indigenous bilingual individuals speak both Spanish and an Indigenous language; hence at a minimum, there should be no significant difference in their earnings compared to the earnings of Indigenous workers <b>who</b> speak <b>only</b> Spanish. However, the results from the Census data indicate that Indigenous <b>who</b> speak <b>only</b> Spanish have a significant earnings advantage over Indigenous who speak both Spanish and an Indigenous language (see Tables 2 and 3). The results from the MxFLS are less precise but also suggest an earnings advantage for more acculturated individuals (see Tables 6 and 7).|$|R

The main writers for the season were Tina Fey, Robert Carlock, Matt Hubbard, Jack Burditt and John Riggi, who all wrote, or co-wrote at least two episodes. Jon Pollack, Kay Cannon, Ron Weiner, Tami Sagher, Donald Glover, and Andrew Guest only wrote, or co-wrote, one episode each.|$|E
5|$|After Béla's {{withdrawal}} from Halych, Roman Mstislavich {{returned with the}} assistance of Rurik Rostislavich, Prince of Belgorod Kievsky. They tried to expel Andrew and his Hungarian retinue, but the Hungarians routed the united forces of Mstislavich and Rostislavich. A group of local boyars offered the throne to Rostislav Ivanovich, a distant cousin of the imprisoned Vladimir Yaroslavich. Béla III sent reinforcements to Halych, enabling Andrew's troops to repel the attacks. Andrew's reign remained unpopular in Halych, because the Hungarian soldiers insulted local women and did not respect Orthodox churches. Consequently, the local boyars allied with their former prince, Vladimir Yaroslavich, who had escaped from captivity and returned to Halych. Duke Casimir II of Poland also supported Vladimir Yaroslavich, and they expelled Andrew and his retinue from the principality in August 1189 or 1190. Andrew returned to Hungary after his defeat. He did not receive a separate duchy from his father, <b>who</b> <b>only</b> gave him estates and money. On his deathbed, Béla III, who had pledged to lead a crusade to the Holy Land, ordered Andrew to fulfill his vow. Andrew's father died on 23 April 1196, and Andrew's older brother, Emeric, succeeded him.|$|E

She was moved to Spithead in 1806, but was back in Portsmouth on 23 November, and was moved into a dock on 24 March 1807 to undergo a refit. The refit lasted until November 1807 and involved having her copper sheathing removed and her hull refitted. She was then recoppered, having had a sum of £29,053 expended on her. She was recommissioned on 18 August 1807 under her old commander, Captain Sir Thomas Williams, and was relaunched three days later on 21 August to complete her refit. She was initially assigned {{to serve in the}} English Channel, but was moved to the West Indies in 1808. On 9 November Williams was superseded by Captain Thomas Pinto, <b>who</b> <b>only</b> spent six weeks in command before being succeeded by Captain Charles Dilkes on 20 December.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's {{first ever}} {{silverware}} was won as the Royal Arsenal in 1890. The Kent Junior Cup, won by Royal Arsenal's reserves, was the club's first trophy, {{while the first}} team's first trophy came three weeks later when they won the Kent Senior Cup. Their first national senior honour came in 1930, when they won the FA Cup. The club enjoyed further success in the 1930s, winning another FA Cup and five Football League First Division titles. Arsenal won their first league and cup double in the 1970–71 season and twice repeated the feat, in 1997–98 and 2001–02, as well as winning a cup double of the FA Cup and League Cup in 1992–93. In 2003–04, Arsenal recorded an unbeaten top-flight league season, something achieved only once before by Preston North End in 1888–89, <b>who</b> <b>only</b> had to play 22 games. To mark the achievement, a special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned and presented to the club the following season. Their most recent success came in 2017, when they became the most successful club in FA Cup history with 13 titles.|$|E
5|$|By 1933, Alabama again {{switched}} conferences, {{joining the}} SEC as a charter member. Alabama {{won the first}} SEC title in 1933 and its fourth and fifth national championship in the 1934 and 1941 seasons. After winning five national championships and nine conference championships through 1946, Alabama saw a decline between 1946 and 1957 and captured a single conference title. After they only won four games {{over a period of}} three seasons, Bear Bryant was hired as head coach in 1958. Under his guidance Alabama won thirteen SEC championships and national championships in the 1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978 and 1979 seasons. After the retirement of Bryant in 1982, Alabama had two coaches, and won one SEC championship before Gene Stallings was hired in 1990. Stallings coached Alabama for seven years, won a national championship in 1992 season, an SEC championship that same season, and four SEC West Division titles. His retirement was followed by a succession of four coaches <b>who</b> <b>only</b> won one SEC championship among them.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the Lakers, the 1970s were {{characterized}} by a major breakthrough of the league's western franchises. In 1975, after compiling a 48–34 regular-season record, the Golden State Warriors swept the heavily favored Washington Bullets 4–0 in the 1975 NBA Finals. In 1976, the Phoenix Suns, <b>who</b> <b>only</b> enjoyed eight years of existence as a franchise, overcame a losing record early in the season to build a remarkable win streak to finish 42–40. The events culminated in upset victories over the Seattle SuperSonics and the Warriors, before facing Boston in the Finals. The teams split the first four games, before Game 5 went into three overtimes before Boston won 128–126. The Celtics managed to secure their 13th championship quickly after, defeating the Suns 87–80 in Game 6.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th century on, the {{crossbow}} (called , tzangra in Greek) {{became increasingly}} important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon available until {{the advent of}} fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery.

Cannons were introduced {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, <b>who</b> <b>only</b> had a few artillery pieces for the defence of the land walls of Constantinople.

The 2004–05 season saw the squad finish sixth. With its stadium closed for repairs, the team played at Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium (except for two games at Makario Stadium). Nea Salamina returned to Ammochostos Stadium for the 2005–06 season, again finishing sixth. It finished 10th in the 2006–07 season and 13th in 2007–08, again relegated to the second division. After a difficult season in 2008–09, the team returned to first division, winning in the final game and leaving opponents Olympiacos, <b>who</b> <b>only</b> needed a draw to win the promotion, in the second division.|$|E
