5|$|Four middle-aged friends <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> {{each other}} since sixth form, Baxter (John Simm), Quinn (Philip Glenister), Rick (Marc Warren) and Woody (Max Beesley), get {{together}} for a holiday in Majorca at the villa of Alvo (Ben Chaplin), a mutual friend who became wealthy in the property business. Over time Alvo's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and he is later killed by {{a man in a}} Tony Blair mask for taking a drug boat the group used earlier. The four clean the boat to remove evidence of their presence, when they are mistaken for drug dealers and paid three million euros. Afterwards, the four learn from María (María Botto), a local detective, that they are caught up in a Serbian mafia drug smuggling operation. Using video camera footage of their holiday, Baxter learns the real perpetrators are corrupt police officers, including María and her superior Dominic (Tim Woodward). Alvo is revealed {{to be a part of}} the operation, and was murdered when he no longer wanted to take part in it. María later attempts to kill the four when employing scare tactics to make them part with the cash fails to work, but is shot to death by Quinn. The other three run over Dominic to save Quinn. They leave with the money and accidentally board a ferry to Ibiza (their intention is to go to Barcelona).|$|E

The documentary included sections on her relationship with John Dunbar and Mick Jagger, and brief interviews with Keith Richards. It concluded with footage from a 30-minute live concert, originally broadcast on PBS for the series Sessions at West 54th.

25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (<b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E
25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> them, to all of us here who are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Lauren is {{the most}} famous {{basketball}} player in Australia, a position she reached by 2003. [...] Prior to this, Australia's most famous player was Michelle Timms, Australia's first player of either gender to play internationally. [...] She was recognised {{as one of the}} world's best basketball players {{by the time she was}} 21. [...] She has been described as Australia's answer to Michael Jordan or Shaquille O'Neal, and the best female basketball player in the world. [...] She has said regarding being the best female basketball player in the world: [...] "I don't really think about it. Nobody really talks to me like that. It's not something I'm conscious of. My family and people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> me all my life, they see me for who I am, and crack open a beer or a bottle of wine with me. They know I have to train, but the rest of it is really laid-back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Crusie, who {{has often}} defended the romance genre against critics, wrote the novel to {{deconstruct}} the complaints levied against the genre. [...] The novel examines perceptions of reality versus fantasy and concludes that embracing a fantasy {{may lead to}} greater self-awareness. [...] Through imagery and plot points, Crusie shows the shift in the power dynamics between the couple change as their relationship progresses, resulting in a more equal balance of power. [...] Sophie's movie, which includes scenes taken from her courtship with Phin, provides an opportunity to explore the boundaries between private acts and public events. [...] Using a protagonist {{who is also a}} con artist, Crusie highlights the inherent con in romance novels - that two extremely different people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> each other for only a short time could live happily ever after.|$|E
2500|$|Morvan {{brings a}} {{briefcase}} with him containing depositions from witnesses <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> Croker {{as well as}} “confidences” from the subject himself all neatly filed by subject matter: “Work, family … finances, art and nature, heart and conscience...” – in short {{what used to be}} referred to as ‘the human condition’. Prodded by Bertrand, he reads from these dossiers. The two speaking characters are there to carry out a pro bono investigation into “the temperament, character and past life of this potential suicide, who never [...] speaks … in an apparent attempt to help him decide whether he should or should not take his own life.” This is something they do. A previous subject named “Smith” who had been injured in a shooting accident and ends up trying to gas himself is discussed as is their up-and-coming visit to someone “at Bury St. Edmunds.” ...|$|E
