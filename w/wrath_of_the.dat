Much like <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, Horner's music was a direct continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> score he wrote for the previous film.

While the Genesis theme supplants the title music Horner wrote for <b>The</b> <b>Wrath</b> <b>of</b> Khan, <b>the</b> end credits were quoted [...] "almost verbatim".|$|R
