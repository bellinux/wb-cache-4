40|$|The {{deposition}} of atmospheric nitrogen is now {{recognized as a}} major driver of biodiversity changes at mid to high latitudes. It has previously been shown that regional variations in <b>wet</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> in the British Isles are reflected in broad targeted chemical parameters in the common heathland lichen Cladonia portentosa. A more detail analysis of alterations in the metabolic pathways in Cladonia portentosa collected from different locations within the UK was undertaken by applying the environmental metabolomics approach. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were applied in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression analysis (PLSR). The latter statistical method was used to correlate measured variables with modelled atmospheric data including <b>wet</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition,</b> nitrogen concentration and precipitation. While FTIR in combination with PCA and PLSR revealed signatures of broad metabolic classes, LC-MS in combination with PCA and PLSR allowed the identification of betaine lipids (BL) as potential biomarkers of nitrogen enrichment. A compound tentatively identified as monoacylglycerol-(N,N,N trimethyl) -homoserine (MGTS) showed the strongest positive relation to increasing <b>wet</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> regimes and consequent phosphorus deficiency. In contrast, the structurally related phosphatidylcholine containing a C 18 : 2 ester showed the opposite trend in natural populations of C. portentosa. Results obtained for C. portentosa collected from the N manipulation site Whim Moss indicated that ammonium is causal for the increase {{of two of the}} identified betaine lipids in natural populations in C. portentosa. Betaine lipids as well as the phosphatidylcholine biomarker could potentially be used to monitor nitrogen regimes and resulting phosphorus limitation on the lichen C. portentosa. The approach used for this study represented an effective integration of the complementary analytical techniques of FTIR and LC-MS in combination with multivariate statistical tools for environmental metabolomic studies.

40|$|Abstract Critical {{loads of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) from atmo-spheric deposition were determined for alpine lake ecosystems {{in the western}} US using fossil diatom assemblages in lake sediment cores. Changes in diatom species {{over the last century}} were indicative of N enrichment in two areas, the eastern Sierra Nevada, starting between 1960 and 1965, and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, starting in 1980. In contrast, no changes in diatom community structure were apparent in lakes of Glacier National Park. To determine critical N loads that elicited these commu-nity changes, we modeled <b>wet</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> rates for the period in which diatom shifts first occurred in each area using deposition data spanning from 1980 to 2007.

40|$|Coastal dunes {{around the}} Baltic Sea have {{received}} {{small amounts of}} atmospheric nitrogen and are rather pristine ecosystems in this respect. In 19 investigated dune sites the atmospheric <b>wet</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> is 3 - 8 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1.

Comparison with EMEP-deposition data showed that Cladonia reflects the deposition history of the last 3 - 6 years. With increasing nitrogen load, we observed a shift from lichen-rich short grass vegetation towards species-poor vegetation dominated by the tall graminoid Carex arenaria. Plant species richness per field site, however, does not decrease directly with these low to medium N deposition loads, but with change in vegetation composition.

Abstract: A 2 -year Open-Top Chamber (OTC) experiment with young Quercus robur trees that were exposed to different levels of ozone (O 3) and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> was performed in Curno (Northern Italy) for the FP 7 Project ÉCLAIRE. The plants were exposed to four levels of ozone (− 40  % of ambient ozone in charcoal-filtered OTCs, − 5  % in non-filtered OTCs, and + 30 and + 75  % in O 3 -enriched OTCs) and two levels of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>wet</b> <b>deposition</b> (tap water and tap water + 70  kg N ha− 1  year− 1). The stomatal conductance and A/Ci response curves were measured during the two experimental seasons, and in October, the plant dry biomass partition between the roots and stem was assessed. Oak plants were moderately sensitive to O 3. After the second year of treatments, the dose–response relationships based on the O 3 stomatal flux indicated a 4. 6  % of root biomass loss and a 12. 1  % of reduction of the number of leaves per 10  mmol O 3  m− 2 absorbed by plants grown with no nitrogen addition. Ozone also decreased both the stomatal conductance and the maximum carboxylation rate allowed by Rubisco (Vcmax) {{during the first year of}} treatments. However, the effect on Vcmax was lost during the second year, and the plants showed an uncoupling between leaf-level physiological responses and plant-level biomass responses.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze a long term {{database}} of the chemical composition of precipitation at three African dry savanna sites in the Sahel. The precipitation samples were collected during the monsoon season at Agoufou (15 ° 20 ′N, 01 ° 29 ′W, Mali) from 2004 to 2006, Banizoumbou (13 ° 31 ′N, 02 ° 38 ′E, Niger) from 1994 to 2009 and Katibougou (12 ° 56 ′N, 07 ° 32 ′ W, Mali) from 1997 to 2008. pH and major inorganic and organic ions in precipitation were analyzed by ionic chromatography. A characterization of mean precipitation chemistry with the associated wet deposition fluxes for each species is presented. The first important result is that interannual variability of all volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentrations is low, ranging between ± 5 % and ± 25 %. Acidity in dry savannas is low and indicates the strong alkaline nature of the precipitation. The average annual pH at Agoufou is 6. 28, 5. 75 at Banizoumbou and 5. 54 at Katibougou. This result is correlated with the important terrigenous contribution measured in the chemical content of precipitation, implying acidity neutralization by mineral species such as Ca 2 + and NH 4 +. Mg 2 + and K+ are found to play a minor role in neutralization. Enrichment factor calculations for Ca 2 +, SO 42 −, K+ and Mg 2 + with respect to the sea reference reveal a significant influence of Saharan and Sahelian crustal sources. VWM concentrations of these species dominate the composition of measured precipitation. An estimation of the potential particulate and gas contribution to the total precipitation composition is given for each site: At Agoufou, the mean relative contribution in rainwater is 80 % for particles and 20 % for gases, while at the Banizoumbou and Katibougou sites, results indicate 70 % for particles and 30 % for gases. The high particulate phase contribution to precipitation emphasizes the importance of multiphase processes between gases and particles in the atmospheric chemistry typical of African semi-arid savanna ecosystems. The second highest contribution is nitrogenous, with high VWM concentrations of NO 3 − and NH 4 + measured at the three sites. Monthly evolution of NO 3 − and NH 4 + concentrations are studied in relation to gaseous emission sources in the Sahelian region, i. e. biogenic soil emission and ammonia sources from animals. The calculated <b>wet</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> flux presents a regular increase throughout the wet season at the three sites. Results suggest total mean nitrogen deposition fluxes of 1. 80 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 at Agoufou, 2. 10 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 at Banizoumbou, and 3. 30 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 at Katibougou. The marine contribution is lower, 23 % at Agoufou, 17 % at Banizoumbou and 13 % at Katibougou. The last contribution concerns organic acidity, which ranges from 5 % at Agoufou, 10 % at Banizoumbou to 14 % at Katibougou. Terrigenous and marine contributions present a negative gradient, whereas nitrogenous and organic contributions a positive gradient along the Sahelian transect defined by Agoufou-Banizoumbou-Katibougou...|$|E

The difference in RERCA between hummocks (78 g C m− 2 yr− 1) and hollows (65 g C m− 2 yr− 1) was significant. Increased RERCA over the past 50 years was found in hummocks and hollows in regions of higher N deposition and related to both elevated N deposition and growing degree-days above + 5 °C. There was a statistically significant positive relationship between N deposition alone and present-day C accumulation in both hummocks and hollows (R 2 = 0. 28 and 0. 38, respectively).

40|$|Coarse {{sea salt}} {{particles}} are emitted ubiquitously {{from the ocean}} surface by wave-breaking and bubble-bursting processes. These particles impact the atmospheric chemistry by affecting the condensation of gas-phase species and, thus, indirectly the nucleation of new fine particles, particularly in regions with significant air pollution. In this study, atmospheric particle concentrations are modeled for the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions in northwestern Europe using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system and are compared to European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) measurement data. The sea salt emission module is extended by a salinity-dependent scaling of the sea salt emissions because the salinity in {{large parts of the}} Baltic Sea is very low, which leads to considerably lower sea salt mass emissions compared to other oceanic regions. The resulting improvement in predicted sea salt concentrations is assessed. The contribution of surf zone emissions is considered separately. Additionally, the impacts of sea salt particles on atmospheric nitrate and ammonium concentrations and on <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> are evaluated. The comparisons with observational data show that sea salt concentrations are commonly overestimated at coastal stations and partly underestimated farther inland. The introduced salinity scaling improves the predicted Baltic Sea sea salt concentrations considerably. The dates of measured peak concentrations are appropriately reproduced by the model. The impact of surf zone emissions is negligible in both seas. Nevertheless, they might be relevant because surf zone emissions were cut at an upper threshold in this study. Deactivating sea salt leads to minor increases in NH 3 +  NH 4 + and HNO 3 +  NO 3 − and a decrease in NO 3 − concentrations.

Ship emissions were generated for 2008 using the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model, and ship <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> was calculated using the Hilatar chemistry-transport model over the Baltic Sea. The annual ship <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> in the Gulf of Finland was 1. 6 kt N, about 12 % of the annual atmospheric deposition, and increased in summer, up to 30 % compared to the monthly atmospheric <b>deposition.</b> Ship <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> caused an increase in spring and post-bloom primary production in two functional groups (diatoms and flagellates), at the same time reducing phosphate resources in the upper layer. Nitrogen fixation due to ship <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> decreased by 1 – 1. 6 kt N year− 1 (2 – 6 %). The effect of ship <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> on <b>nitrogen</b> fixation was greater in the western and central Gulf of Finland.

We assess the potential value of using typical species, as defined in the European Union Habitats Directive, for determining the impact of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> on acid grasslands. Although some species could potentially be used as indicators of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition,</b> many of the typical species do not respond strongly to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> and are unlikely to be useful for identifying impact on an individual site.

40|$|Mediterranean-type {{ecosystems}} {{of southern}} California {{are exposed to}} atmospheric <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> with some areas receiving 20 - 45 kg N ha- 1 annually. Although nitrogen is a limiting nutrient to plant growth, most <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> in southern California occurs as dry deposition when plants are physiologically inactive due to seasonal drought. Due to this inactivity, {{it is unclear whether}} or not plants can utilize the additional nitrogen. The effects of nitrogen fertilization on aboveground plant production were tested in coastal sage scrub and chaparral ecosystems, and the effects of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> on post-fire recovery were observed in chaparral ecosystems. I found that experimentally added nitrogen did not result in increased production in either coastal sage scrub or chaparral sites.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{atmospheric}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> on the species richness in acid grasslands was investigated by combining {{data from a}} large Danish monitoring program with a large European data set, where a significant non-linear negative effect of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> on species richness already had been demonstrated (Stevens, et al., 2010 a). The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> range in Denmark is relatively small and when only considering the Danish data a non-significant decrease in the species richness with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> was observed.

Furthermore, by combining the two data sets, which were sampled with different protocols, a more comprehensive picture of the threats to the biodiversity of acid grasslands emerge; i. e., species richness in remnant patches of acid grassland in intensively cultivated agricultural landscapes is under influence not only from <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition,</b> but also from current and historical land use...|$|R
40|$|Aims Our {{objectives}} were {{to determine the}} effect of increased <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> on soil organic carbon and nutrients of Pleioblastus amarus plantations. Methods Beginning in November 2007, we conducted a two-year field experiment of simulated <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> in a P. amarus plantation, Rainy Area of West China. The levels of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> were 0, 5, 15 and 30 g N·m– 2 ·a– 1 for control (CK), low, medium and high nitrogen, respectively. For one year beginning in November 2008, we monthly collected 0 – 20 cm horizon soil samples and measured soil total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), extractable dissolved organic carbon (EDOC), liable carbon (LC), total nitrogen (TN), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), NH 4 +-N, NO 3 –-N, available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK). Important findings <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> increased concentrations of TOC, MBC, TN, MBN, NH 4 +-N and AP in soil and had no effect on the other indicators. MBC and MBN exhibited significant seasonal patterns that were positively related to temperature. AP and AK were significant negatively correlated with MBC and MBN. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> stimulated availabilities of C, N and P and increased the accumulation of these elements in the soil.

40|$|The Mediterranean Basin {{presents}} an extraordinary biological richness but very little {{information is available}} on the threat that air pollution, and in particular reactive nitrogen (N), can pose to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. This study represents the first approach to assess the risk of N enrichment effects on Spanish ecosystems. The suitability of EMEP and CHIMERE air quality model systems as tools to identify those areas where effects of atmospheric N deposition could be occurring was tested. For this analysis, wet deposition of NO₃− and NH₄+ estimated with EMEP and CHIMERE model systems were compared with measured data for the period 2005 – 2008 obtained from different monitoring networks in Spain. Wet N deposition was acceptably predicted by both models, showing better results for oxidized than for reduced nitrogen, particularly when using CHIMERE. Both models estimated higher wet deposition values in northern and northeastern Spain, and decreasing along a NE–SW axis. Total (<b>wet</b> + dry) <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> in 2008 reached maxima values of 19. 4 and 23. 0 kg N ha¯¹ year¯¹ using EMEP and CHIMERE models respectively. Total N deposition was used to estimate the exceedance of N empirical critical loads in the Natura 2000 network. Grassland habitats proved to be the most threatened group, particularly in the northern alpine area, pointing out that biodiversity conservation in these protected areas could be endangered by N deposition. Other valuable mountain ecosystems can be also threatened, indicating the need to extend atmospheric deposition monitoring networks to higher altitudes in Spain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The EMEP/MSC-W {{model has}} been used to compute {{atmospheric}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> into the Baltic Sea basin for the period of 12 yr: 1995 – 2006. The level of an-nual total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> into the Baltic Sea basin has changed from 230 Gg N in 1995 to 199 Gg N in 2006, de-creasing 13 %. This value corresponds well with the total nitrogen emission reduction (11 %) in the HELCOM Con-tracting Parties. However, inter-annual variability of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> to the Baltic Sea basin is relatively large, ranging from − 13 % to + 17 % of the averaged value. It is mainly caused by the changing meteorological conditions and es-pecially precipitation in the considered period. The calcu-lated monthly deposition pattern is similar for most of the years showing maxima in the autumn months October and November. The source allocation budget for atmospheric <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> to the Baltic Sea basin was calculated for each year of the period 1997 – 2006.

40|$|Our {{results show}} that both AOB and AOA {{communities}} are highly influenced by <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> in both their abundance and community structure. These changes are linked to increased nitrification rate in the elevated <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> plots. Our results further show {{that the relationship between}} the AOB and plant communities fundamentally changes under long-term <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> manipulation. This positive feedback loop may enhance the rate of change in ammonia-oxidizer communities, which may further elevate nitrification rates. This study provides strong evidence that incorporating microbial community and abundance information into global change predictions is crucial for understanding how ecosystem-level nutrient cycling rates may change. |$|R

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Primary {{succession}} was studied in acid inland drift sands. Main research questions were: 1) How do vegetation and soil change during succession? 2) How are soil parameters and species abundance affected by atmospheric <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition?</b> Methods One hundred sixty-five plots were selected in 21 drift sands throughout The Netherlands, divided over eight succession stages from bare sand to dry heath {{and within a}} gradient in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition.</b> Vegetation development and soil parameters were described and water-extractable elements measured and differences between high (> 30 kg N ha− 1 year− 1) and lower <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> sites calculated. Results Vegetation cover and height increased during succession. Lichens contributed most to plant species diversity. Thickness of Ah horizon increased and pH decreased and concentrations of Fe, Al, S increased. Base cations increased as well, despite the drop in pH. Also, water-extractable ammonium, nitrate and phosphate increased, along with the NH 4 :NO 3 ratio. Sites with high <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deposition</b> had higher NH 4 :NO 3 and Al:Ca ratios, lower pH, higher cover of algae, lower lichen and total species diversity, more Pinus sylvestris seedlings and more species of late succession stages.
