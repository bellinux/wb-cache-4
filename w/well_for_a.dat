5|$|Mark McGhee {{was named}} as Millwall's new manager in September 2000, and {{eight months later}} the club won {{promotion}} as Division Two champions, with the team built by Keith Stevens, after {{five years in the}} third tier of the league. They finished with 93 points, a club record. Winning the first match of the 2001–02 season 4–0 at home to Norwich City set the team up <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good year, in which Millwall qualified for the Division One play-offs, but lost to eventual winners Birmingham City 2–1 in the semi-finals. Millwall finished mid-table in the 2002–03 season and McGhee was sacked soon after the start of the 2003–04 season.|$|E
5|$|Other {{businessmen}} reaped great rewards in retail, shipping, entertainment, lodging, or transportation. Boardinghouses, food preparation, sewing, {{and laundry}} were highly profitable businesses often run by women (married, single, or widowed) who realized men would pay <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> service {{done by a}} woman. Brothels also brought in large profits, especially when combined with saloons and gaming houses.|$|E
5|$|Richard hit <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pitcher, going 20-for-87 in {{the season}} with two triples, two home runs and seven runs batted in. After the season was completed, Richard {{underwent}} an emergency appendicectomy on October 26, 1977 at a Houston hospital. He {{spent most of the}} off-season working out at the Houston Astrodome and, for relaxation, fishing. In early 1978, he was a participant in ABC's Superstars all-around sports competition.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the {{reactors}} for plutonium production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, {{and so it was}} chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as <b>well.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> neutron moderator, graphite was chosen {{on the basis of its}} availability compared with beryllium or heavy water.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, though the {{original}} draft of the plot was much different. Originally, Homer was to learn {{that he was a}} Native American, and would try to exploit it to not have to pay taxes. The idea had been going <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days, but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to pay taxes. When the writers found out that they did, the whole plot had to be scrapped. Executive producer Mike Scully's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion-dollar bill, which they accepted, as they were out of ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{match between}} Taylor and Bigelow brought the WWF {{mainstream}} press coverage. The {{reactions to the}} match were mixed; some people thought that Taylor performed surprisingly <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> non-wrestler. Others thought that the WWF pushing a football player to defeat a wrestler made professional wrestling look bad. Reviews of the event as a whole have also been mixed, and the event has been called both the worst WrestleMania of all time and the event that saved the WWF.|$|E

5|$|Shuffle! {{had much}} pre-sale hype as the {{development}} team was largely composed of {{former members of}} BasiL, including Hiro Suzuhira and Aoi Nishimata, the illustrators for Shuffle!. Shuffle! was released at {{around the same time}} as Fate/stay night, a highly anticipated visual novel by Type-Moon. The limited edition of Shuffle! was the second highest-selling computer game for the last two weeks of January 2004 the top 50 best-selling Bishōjo games semi-monthly sales chart in Japan, behind Fate/stay night.

25|$|Acute {{insomnia}} is {{the inability}} to consistently sleep <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> period of less than a month. Insomnia is present when there is difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or when the sleep that is obtained is non-refreshing or of poor quality. These problems occur despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep and they must result in problems with daytime function. Acute insomnia {{is also known as}} short term insomnia or stress related insomnia.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{reserves}} {{denote the}} amount of crude oil that can be technically recovered at a cost that is financially feasible at the present price of oil. Hence reserves will change with the price, unlike oil resources, which include all oil that can be technically recovered at any price. Reserves may be for a <b>well,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reservoir, for a field, for a nation, or for the world. Different classifications of reserves are related to their degree of certainty.|$|E

25|$|Vega also forms one vertex of a {{much smaller}} triangle, along with Epsilon and Zeta Lyrae. Zeta forms a wide binary star visible in binoculars, {{consisting}} of an Am star and an F-type subgiant. The Am star has an additional close companion, bringing {{the total number of}} stars in the system to three. Epsilon is a more famous wide binary that can even be separated by the naked eye under good conditions. Both components are themselves close binaries which can be seen with telescopes to consist of A- and F-type stars, and a faint star was recently found to orbit component C as <b>well,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> total of five stars.|$|E
25|$|Simpson, who has {{consistently}} professed his innocence in the Brown and Goldman killings, {{was acquitted of}} the murder charges almost a month after Nigg's death. Alternative theories of the murders, supposedly shared by Simpson, have suggested they were related to drug trafficking in the Los Angeles area, and that Nigg's was as well; Nigg apparently lived very <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> waiter, {{and there were some}} allegations he, too, had been involved in the drug trade while working at the Mezzaluna branch in Colorado before. Nigg and Goldman, it has also been noted, were not the only waiters at Mezzaluna to be the victims of criminal activity during the mid-1990s.|$|E
25|$|Jews are overrepresented in American Buddhism {{specifically}} {{among those}} {{whose parents are}} not Buddhist, and without Buddhist heritage, with between one fifth and 30% of all American Buddhists identifying as Jewish though only 2% of Americans are Jewish.

Notable American Jewish Buddhists include: Robert Downey, Jr. Allen Ginsberg, Goldie Hawn and daughter Kate Hudson, Steven Seagal, Adam Yauch of the rap group The Beastie Boys, and Garry Shandling. Film makers the Coen Brothers have been influenced by Buddhism as <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E

25|$|Hibernian's {{most recent}} relegation to the First Division {{came at the}} end of the 1997–98 season, just months after Alex McLeish had been {{appointed}} as manager. The club immediately won promotion back to the newly formed Scottish Premier League in the 1998–99 season, helped by a run of 12 wins in a row on as they were crowned Scottish First Division champions. Hibs earned a record total of 89 points and finished 23 points ahead of second-placed Falkirk. On their return to the top tier in 1999–2000, Hibs performed relatively <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> newly promoted side and finished 6th in the SPL. Hibs also reached the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup that year, but lost 2–1 to Aberdeen. The famous Easter Road slope was removed {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|The {{docudrama}} Flight 93, {{about the}} hijacking {{of the plane}} which crashed in Pennsylvania during the September 11, 2001 attacks was the most watched program on the network; it attracted 5.9 million viewers for its initial telecast on January 30, 2006. This was later surpassed by Duck Dynastys third season premiere. The previous record-holder for the network was a World War II docudrama, Ike: Countdown to D-Day, starring Tom Selleck and broadcast in 2004, with 5.5 million viewers. A later acquired rights to rerun the critically acclaimed HBO series The Sopranos; its A premiere on January 10, 2007, averaged 3.86 million viewers, making it the most-watched premiere of a rerun off-network series in cable television history at the time. The series has continued to perform <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>A,</b> and the network now regularly ranks in the top ten basic U.S. cable channels in prime time ratings.|$|E
25|$|CSS {{has been}} in use by Imperial Oil at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by Canadian Natural Resources at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by Shell Canada at Peace River. In this method, the well is put through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is {{injected}} into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees Celsius {{for a period of}} weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the hot oil is pumped out of the <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil.|$|E
