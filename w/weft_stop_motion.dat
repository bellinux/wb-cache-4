50|$|The early textile trade {{relied on}} {{domestic}} outworking. Handloom weavers {{would take the}} yarn to their cottage loom shops, and return the completed fabric to the mill. Reliable power looms that could be worked from an overhead line shaft were not available before Kenworthy and Bulloughs <b>weft</b> <b>stop</b> <b>motion,</b> the roller temple and the loose reed {{which appeared in the}} 1840s. The first weaving floors were {{on the ground floor of}} the existing narrow mills, where the workpiece was lit by tall exterior windows. The weaving shed appeared around this time. They initially adjoined existing mills, and then were built as standalone mills by speculating investors or by industrial co-operatives of former handloom weavers. Either group would run the looms themselves or operate the shed as a room and power mill. Here as the name suggests, space was rented to other companies who could specialise in weaving with out the skills needed to finance, build and maintain a building. Weaving sheds were cheap to build and fireproof having no wooden beams. They were also safer, because their north-facing roof windows meant they were not as dependent on gas-lighting as were spinning mills.|$|E

50|$|Cartwright added {{parts to}} his loom, namely a {{positive}} let-off <b>motion,</b> warp and <b>weft</b> <b>stop</b> <b>motions,</b> and sizing the warp while the loom was in action. He commenced to manufacture fabrics in Doncaster using these looms, and discovered {{many of their}} shortcomings. He attempted to remedy these {{in a number of}} ways: by introducing a crank and eccentric wheels to actuate its batten differentially, by improving the dicking mechanism, by means of a device for stopping the loom when a shuttle failed to enter a shuttle box, by preventing a shuttle from rebounding when in a box, and by stretching the cloth with temples that acted automatically. His mill was repossessed by creditors in 1793.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> (hyphenated stop-motion {{when used}} as an adjective) is an {{animation}} technique that physically manipulates an object so that it appears to move on its own. The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence. Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> for their ease of repositioning. <b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> animation using plasticine is called clay animation or [...] "clay-mation". Not all <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> requires figures or models; many <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> films can involve using humans, household appliances and other things for comedic effect. <b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> can also use sequential drawing {{in a similar manner}} to traditional animation, such as a flip book. <b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> using objects is sometimes referred to as pixilation or object animation.|$|R

5000|$|The more looms {{system was}} one {{management}} inspired solution {{to bring more}} looms into production using a reduced number of weavers overall. The Lancashire cotton industry had considered re-equipping with the Northrop automatic loom with automatic <b>weft</b> <b>stop</b> and shuttle replenishment. Experiments in 1932 showed that with Northrops a weaver could tenter 40 looms though 24 was more usual. This solution was rejected as the industry couldn't raise the capital needed to reinvest, and there were doubts whether the investment could be recouped.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>motion</b> {{animation}} has a {{long history}} in film. It was often used to show objects moving as if by magic. The first instance of the <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> technique can be credited to Albert E. Smith and J. Stuart Blackton for Vitagraph's The Humpty Dumpty Circus (1897), in which a toy circus of acrobats and animals comes to life. In 1902, the film Fun in a Bakery Shop used the stop trick technique in the [...] "lightning sculpting" [...] sequence. French trick film maestro Georges Méliès used <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> animation once to produce moving title-card letters in one of his short films, and a number of his special effects are based on <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> photography. In 1907, The Haunted Hotel is a new <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> film by J. Stuart Blackton, and was a resounding success when released. Segundo de Chomón (1871-1929), from Spain, released El Hotel Eléctrico later that same year, and used similar techniques as the Blackton film. In 1908, A Sculptor's Welsh Rarebit Nightmare was released, as was The Sculptor's Nightmare, a film by Billy Bitzer. Italian animator Roméo Bossetti impressed audiences with his object animation tour-de-force, The Automatic Moving Company in 1912. The great European <b>stop</b> <b>motion</b> pioneer was Wladyslaw Starewicz (1892-1965), who animated The Beautiful Lukanida (1910), The Battle of the Stag Beetles (1910), The Ant and the Grasshopper (1911).|$|R
