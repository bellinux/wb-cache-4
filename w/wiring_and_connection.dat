40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{utilization of}} electricity in electrical and electronics workshop {{as perceived by}} undergraduate students in Nigeria. Electrical and electronics are practical and activity oriented subjects that require electricity to function effectively in the workshop and laboratories. It {{is because of the}} practical oriented activities that the subject requires electricity supply in electric lamps, motors, <b>wiring</b> <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> of equipment, tools, soldering, indicating instrument and measurement of quantities and resistors and capacitor testing. The other areas in the workshop that require electricity supply are electronic components and devices, rectification circuits, network, radio, television, modulation and maintenance of equipment, gadgets, and the operation of safety equipment in the workshop. Despite the importance of electricity supply for the operation of these workshop equipment in Nigeria, it appears that electricity supply remain a mirage in our school workshop due epileptic power supply in Nigeria. Based on the discussion and implications, the following recommendations were preferred as a way forward: the power sector in Nigeria should be given urgent attention to increase and improve electricity supply by the government to improve on the use of equipment and electrical/electronic tools in Nigeria among others...|$|E

While {{increasing numbers of}} households, businesses and utility companies are installing photovoltaics to combat climate change and ever increasing power bills, network operators are {{having to deal with}} the problems this can cause such as voltage rise and other power quality issues. Monitoring of PV systems is becoming increasingly more important in addressing such issues, as is localised environmental monitoring. Utilising different sensors to measure solar radiation, ambient temperature and wind speed, network operators are better able to predict and react to environmental changes which can affect the output of PV systems. This report focuses on the installation of an environmental and PV inverter monitoring system for the Photovoltaic Training Facility on the Engineering and Energy Building at Murdoch University. This work follows on from that of Stuart Kempin who designed and managed the installation of the PV Training Facility and Mael Riou who designed much of the environmental monitoring system. The environmental monitoring system consists of two anemometers, a wind vane, an ambient temperature sensor, two pyranometers (one mounted horizontally and one mounted on the plane of the PV array) and RTD temperature sensors for PV module temperature measurement. The communication interface for these sensors incorporates I/O modules from Avantech’s ADAM 4000 series and communicates via RS 485 with a computer running the LabView programming software for monitoring and logging purposes. Design work for the environmental monitoring system is now complete, including specifications and drawings for the mounting brackets. For monitoring the PV inverters, serial communication is also utilised. Where required, each inverter is fitted with a serial communication card which is wired to the same computer used for environmental monitoring via an RS 485 to USB adapter. Again, the LabView programming software is used to monitor the inverters. All physical aspects of the inverter monitoring system have been completed. This includes the selection and acquisition of a suitable computer interface along with enclosure design and construction to suit. Installation of serial communication cards in the inverters and <b>wiring</b> <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> of the inverters has also been completed. Several smaller assignments were also undertaken {{over the course of the}} project such as the review of technical diagrams provided by the installer of the PV Training Facility and testing of the SMA Backup system to ensure correct functionality. Some background information on the functional earthing of PV arrays is given and discussed in relation to the PV Training Facility. Unfortunately, 3 final schematic diagrams of the system have not yet been obtained however sections of the actual system configuration including the functional earthing arrangement have been confirmed. The eventual goal of the system is to provide a solid, safe and informative teaching platform which can be used in the future to educate students on the role such monitoring systems may have in real-world scenarios. It is also planned to utilise the system to compare PV technologies and inverter topologies and their reactions under different environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction German {{transportation}} industry {{is one of}} the strongest industries in the world. Especially the segment of automotive production is worldwide appreciated for its engineering and production capabilities. Whilst many European OEMs are suffering on declining sales, German premium brands still increase their production capacities worldwide. The German automotive industry has been the national driver of innovation for decades and the largest industry segment. To maintain this dominate position Germany OEMs need to face many challenges: the explosion of varieties and the resulting complexity of the production process, the shift of the key sales markets, the rising demand for electro vehicles and connectivity. These challenges will lead to a huge demand on new and better materials, e. g. for more efficient and precise electronics, energy storages systems with higher energy density as well as lighter and stiffer materials for car bodies and new human machine interface technologies. Challenges of the Automotive Industry Increasing Complexity of Production Today’s in-house production depth of OEMs is relatively low. OEMs mostly concentrate on development and manufacturing of the powertrain and car body, surface coating and assembly of parts into the coated car body. Today more than 50 % of the car parts are produced by suppliers and in appreciation of Just in Time (JIT) approaches most of the parts need to be transported to the assembly. In contrast to historic production lines, todays OEMs are offering a wide range of models to their customers. Furthermore, today’s customers are able to configure these models individually before the car is produced. This leads to an enormous range of variety which finally increases the complexity of production. To face this complexity new approaches and methods need to be developed. One is the agile and connected production. Within this approach transportation systems, stocks, parts, assembling tools and workers are connected and thereby theoretically able to efficiently produce a lot size one. Shift of the Sales Markets The German automotive industry is continuously rising. However, this growth is mainly generated outside Germany and Europe. Today’s biggest markets are North America, China, South Amerika and parts of South East Asia. Within these markets a new type of car is required besides the traditional premium segments. Mega City Cars is a concept of small transportation system designed for the convenient and autonomous transportation within a big city. In contrast to premium cars with their superior comfort and safety at high speed, mega city cars will have much lower average speed. As a result, those cars can have much higher content of plastic than today’s models. Moreover, those cares will be mostly shared and therefore need to offer a high amount of connectivity services. Rising Demand for Electric Vehicles The production of electric vehicles {{is one of the}} major challenges for the entire automotive production. First, an EV motor mostly consists of a “handful” of parts which need to be assembled, whilst traditional combustion engines require thousands of high-precision parts. Second, the transmission of an EV car can be realized much simpler than of traditional engines. This leads to a tremendous cost reduction potential in the production of an EV engine and the entire powertrain. However, one key component of the EV car is the battery. Cost, weight, charging time and driving range of today’s existing batteries have not yet met customers’ expectations. Therefore batteries with a higher energy density, lighter and safer architecture as well as lighter cars need to be developed. Increasing Demand for Connectivity Modern cars and its parts are already showing a high degree of connectivity. Powertrain, suspension and frameworks, comfort systems for example are controlled by control units and able to communicate. The next important step is to connect the driver and passenger with the cars. Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) will be able to control the drive condition and adapt the car performance as well as to provide services. These new electronics can be integrated as tactile or non-tactile sensors, such as pressure sensors or gas sensors. Rising Demand for Synthetic Electronics To face the challenges the automotive segment needs to invest more into the agile production, function integration, light-weight construction and advanced electronics. Parts, production, usage and customers are supposed to show a higher degree of connectivity and might interact more. Therefore, more parts need to be connected to a service or network. This will require at least a light <b>wiring</b> <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> system. However, sophisticated concepts are mostly showing much higher degree of electronic capabilities. These concepts - often called as cyber physical systems - consist of small sensor actuator systems, an energy storage as well as a transition reception unit. In the future a higher demand for electronics in the automotive manufacturing process can be expected. The Role of Synthetic Electronics Besides challenges in corrosion and weight traditional metal based electronics are suffering on a couple of strategic disadvantages. One disadvantage is for example the total costs. Neither Japan nor Germany has the benefit of lots of natural resources such as copper, gold or silver. Therefore, these materials often need to be imported. If the car is exported and used outside the country of origin, the valuable materials are exported, too. If the recycling and reuse are not controlled by the industry, the material with rising value, leads to a slight shift of natural resources. Furthermore, the fluctuation of material prices can’t be quickly absorbed by the final customer. As a result changing raw material prices are a potential risk for every profit. By developing and using synthetic electronics based on nano carbons such as nanotubes or graphene, countries with a lack in raw materials such as Germany, can reduce its dependency on imported resources. Furthermore, the production of synthetic electronics includes many other benefits. The production of parts can be mostly made under atmospheric conditions using high-throughput printing technologies. In contrast to the existing traditional technologies this is a quite energy efficient way. Moreover, such parts are easily recyclable. Coated plastic parts might be reused many times without a significant loss in performance. Conclusion The future of the automotive industry will lead to a higher demand for integrated electronics. These electronics will be used for new, agile production methods, human machine interface systems and communication systems. Furthermore, future cars need to be lighter and mostly consist of an electric powertrain. This requires a higher usage of plastics and light-weight materials, as well as development of better batteries. To face all these challenges synthetic materials such as carbon nanotubes or graphene can be very helpful. Such materials can be used for printed electronics, new and better energy storage systems as well as light-weight constructions...|$|E

40|$|Routing FPGAs is a {{challenging}} problem {{because of the}} relative scarcity of routing resources, both <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> points. This can lead either to slow implementations caused by long wiring paths that avoid congestion or a failure to route all signals. This paper presents PathFinder, a router that balances the goals of performance and routability. PathFinder uses an iterative algorithm that con-verges to a solution in which all signals are routed while achieving close to the optimal performance allowed by the placement. Routability is achieved by forcing signals to negotiate for a resource and thereby determine which signal needs the resource most. Delay is minimized by allowing the more critical signals a greater say in this negotiation. Because PathFinder requires only a directed graph to describe the architecture of routing resources, it adapts readily {{to a wide variety}} of FPGA architectures such as Triptych, Xilinx 3000 and mesh-connected arrays of FPGAs. The results of routing ISCAS benchmarks on the Triptych FPGA architecture show an average increase of only 4. 5 % in critical path delay over the optimum delay for a placement. Routes of ISCAS benchmarks on the Xilinx 3000 architecture show a greater completion rate than commercial tools, as well as 11 % faster implementations. ...|$|R
