Coincidentally, Sean was fired for exactly the same reason that his Series 5 counterpart Rocky Andrews was; namely presiding over a crushing defeat on a task that he should have been an expert in, and bringing the wrong people back into the boardroom.|$|E

25|$|Despite costing {{more than}} a Vickers gun to {{manufacture}} (the cost of a Lewis gun in 1915 was £165, the Vickers cost about £100), Lewis machine guns were in high demand with the British military during the First World War. The Lewis also {{had the advantage of}} being about 80% faster to build than the Vickers, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> portable. Accordingly, the British government placed orders for 3,052 guns between August 1914 and June 1915. By the end of the war, over 50,000 Lewis guns had been produced in the US and UK and they were nearly ubiquitous on the Western Front, outnumbering the Vickers by a ratio of about 3:1.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} Middle Ages, Botany had {{undergone}} drastic changes {{from that of}} its antiquity predecessor (Greek practice). An early medieval treatise in the West on plants known as the Ex herbis femininis was largely based on Dioscorides Greek text: De material medica. The Ex herbis <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> popular during this time {{because it was not}} only easier to read, but contained plants and their remedies that related to the regions of southern Europe, where botany was being studied. It also provided better medical direction on how to create remedies, and how to properly use them. This book was also highly illustrated, where its former was not, making the practice of botany easier to comprehend.|$|E

The pair won their class and finished 4th overall in the 12-hour endurance race. 1986 was also the most successful year of Jenner's career, finishing second in the championship to Pruett.

John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, {{and by the time he}} showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E
500|$|Corman felt Poe's two strongest stories after Usher were Masque of the Red Death, and Pit and the Pendulum.

Arkoff said it was his and James H. Nicholson's decision to make Pit as the second Poe film [...] "because it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> graphic {{and in the second}} place, Masque of the Red Death would have needed a dancing troupe that would have been quite expensive. In all those early Poe pictures we had relatively few actors, so when we did finally make Masque of the Red Death we went to the UK where it would be less expensive to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Laucke took up snooker, {{and became}} {{competent}} enough by age thirteen {{to gain a}} job as a demonstrator for the Brunswick Corporation, a snooker table manufacturer. Laucke learned billiards from George Chenier, a fellow Montrealer and the North American snooker champion. The two faced each again four years later at the North American snooker championships in Montreal, where Laucke won the championship. Laucke recalled: [...] "Then I decided to leave snooker, I had done what I wanted to do... My love for the guitar was overwhelming. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> money in snooker, but snooker was just a passion, and music was my love."

500|$|Nevertheless, {{the second}} barrage {{of the fort}} began on 1 June; by then, Bergholtz had 13 {{additional}} cannon at his disposal. The barrage lasted until 6 June, {{as a result of}} which [...] "there was made a great breach, that two battalions were lined up on either side to take the city". During those six days, there were a total of 2,975 mortar shots and 1,539 from cannon. The Swedish fired 7,464 shots from cannon and 394 from mortars. Both the first and second barrages had a similar number of shots fired, but the second barrage <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> devastating to the Swedish. This was due to several factors; the shots fired during the second bombardment used higher-caliber ammunition and did greater damage per round, and the rate of fire was much more intense. The first bombardment took a month, whereas the second only took six days.|$|E

Contrary to most Group C cars I had driven, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> tuneable than I was accustomed to." [...] However, he did state that the car's lack of power-assisted steering was a problem. The team struggled to find a buyer for the car, as the Group C era was {{drawing to a close}} by 1992 and 1993; the IMSA GTP Championship was on its last legs, and the World Sportscar Championship was beginning to shift away from the category.|$|E

She’s on the wrestling team, speaks regularly of injuring Puck, and, in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez, proved she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> than just bark. And you did catch that part about Zizes wanting to be famous for famous' sake, right? That she was willing to give herself up to Puck purely in pursuit of a reality show and fragrance line? There’s a word for people who do things like that in the real world: It's 'asshole'." [...] He went on to add: [...] "Zizes has been hailed by feminists groups (well, by Bust Magazine) as a new kind of plus-sized heroine—an obese female role model who for once doesn't hate herself. On the contrary, she thinks she's the bee's knees. When 'Puck serenaded her with Queen's [...] "Fat-Bottomed Girls," [...] she rebuffed him, saying, 'I look like America looks, and just like America, I need more than just a song to get my juices flowing'." ...|$|E

Because of The Fame success—it was listed {{as one of the}} 100 Greatest Debut Albums of All-Time by Rolling Stone in 2013—Gaga is acknowledged {{as one of the few}} artists for propelling the rise in the popularity of synthpop in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Scott Hardy, Polaroid's CEO, has praised Gaga for inspiring her fans and for her close interactions with them on social media. According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker, [...] "Lady Gaga blazed a trail for truculent pop stars by treating her own celebrity as an evolving art project." [...] Including Born This Way as one of the 50 best female albums of all time, Rolling Stone considers it [...] "hard to remember a world where we didn't have Gaga, although we're pretty sure it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> boring." [...] In 2015, Time also noted that Gaga had [...] "practically invented the current era of pop music as spectacle."

She looks great in her myriad of outfits, {{and she can}} still move {{with the best of}} them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– {{there was no time to}} really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and show a little more of herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure.
