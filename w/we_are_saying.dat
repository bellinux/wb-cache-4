25|$|This {{series of}} {{evaluations}} is providing {{a mechanism to}} characterize in more precise terms exactly {{what is necessary to}} compute in meaning. As such, the evaluations provide an emergent mechanism to identify the problems and solutions for computations with meaning. These exercises have evolved to articulate more of the dimensions that are involved in our use of language. They began with apparently simple attempts to identify word senses computationally. They have evolved to investigate the interrelationships among the elements in a sentence (e.g., semantic role labeling), relations between sentences (e.g., coreference), and the nature of what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> (semantic relations and sentiment analysis).|$|E
500|$|Parker was {{selected}} as the man of the match by Ken Barrington. Somerset, who had started the weekend with the potential of winning both the Gillette Cup and the John Player League, returned to their home ground in Taunton needing to avoid defeat against Essex to guarantee winning the latter competition. They lost by two runs, prompting Alan Gibson of The Times to write [...] "So <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> as we have said at the end of so many seasons, 'well tried Somerset', and no more than that." [...] Somerset returned to the final in 1979, when they beat Northamptonshire to win their first trophy. Sussex did not reach the final again until 1986, though they won the 1982 John Player League in the interim.|$|E

60|$|For {{some time}} while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> talking, Mr. Petersfield ate his breakfast in silence, and was evidently not {{attending}} to what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> but <b>was</b> {{lost in his}} own contemplations.|$|R
500|$|Lewis did {{not share}} the desire of some members to keep the CCF [...] "ideologically pure", and adhered to the Bundist belief that [...] "it was better {{to go along with}} the masses in a not totally correct {{direction}} than to separate oneself from them and remain 'purist'." [...] However, the CCF was as much a movement as it was a political party, and its own members frequently undermined it with radical proclamations. [...] Lewis criticized the British Columbia CCF for such comments, saying [...] "... what we say and do must be measured by the effect which it will have on our purpose of mobilizing people for action. [...] If what we say and do will blunt or harm our purpose... then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> and doing a false thing even if, in the abstract, it is true... When, in heaven's name are we going to learn that working-class politics and the struggle for power are not a Sunday-school class where purity of godliness and the infallibility of the Bible must be held up without fear of consequences." ...|$|E
2500|$|William O'Keefe, chief {{executive}} officer of the Marshall Institute, questions the methods used by advocates of new government restrictions to combat global warming: [...] "We have never said that global warming isn't real. No self-respecting think tank would accept money to support preconceived notions. We make sure what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> is both scientifically and analytically defensible." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the November 15, 1969, Vietnam Moratorium March on Washington, DC, Seeger led 500,000 {{protesters in}} singing John Lennon's song [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] as they rallied {{across from the}} White House. Seeger's voice carried over the crowd, interspersing phrases like, [...] "Are you listening, Nixon?" [...] between the choruses of protesters singing, [...] "All <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> ... is give peace a chance".|$|E

2500|$|However, as Freud {{put it to}} the {{imagined}} auditors of his New Introductory Lectures (1932), [...] "You may perhaps shrug your shoulders and say: [...] "That isn't natural science, it's Schopenhauer's philosophy!" [...] But, ladies and gentlemen, why should not a bold thinker have guessed something that is afterwards confirmed by sober and painstaking detailed research?" [...] He then went on to add that [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> is not even genuine Schopenhauer....we are not overlooking {{the fact that there is}} life as well as death. We recognise two basic instincts and give each of them its own aim".|$|E
2500|$|There is {{not much}} choice. There is not, because we screwed up. [...] Not a little, a lot. [...] No European country has done {{something}} as boneheaded as we have. [...] Evidently, we lied throughout the last year-and-a-half, two years. [...] It was totally clear that what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> is not true. [...] You cannot quote any significant government measure we can be proud of, other than at the end we managed to bring the government back from the brink. Nothing. If {{we have to give}} account to the country about what we did for four years, then what do we say? ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, the Ontario {{branch of}} the Canadian Union of Public Employees brought forward a {{proposal}} to ban Israeli academics from teaching at Ontario Universities. CUPE-Ontario leader Sid Ryan stated, [...] "we are ready to say Israeli academics should not be on our campuses unless they explicitly condemn the university bombing and the assault on Gaza in general." [...] Ryan subsequently said, [...] "Academic freedom goes both ways. What <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> is {{if they want to}} remain silent and be complicit in these kinds of actions, why should they enjoy the freedom to come and teach in other countries like Canada?" [...] CUPE's national president, Paul Moist, issued a statement declaring his opposition to the motion and saying, [...] "I will be using my influence in any debates on such a resolution to oppose its adoption." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{rejection}} of the [...] "Force C" [...] plan had not reached many of the maquis leaders operating out in the countryside and after the news of D-Day, the maquis attempted to seize [...] "redoubts", most notably at the Vercors plateau. Eugène Chavant, the FFI chief in the Isère region ordered all maquis bands {{to concentrate on the}} Vercors plateau after hearing of D-Day. By 9 June 1944, some 3, 000 maquisards had heeded the call and 3 July 1944 the [...] "Free Republic of the Vercors" [...] was proclaimed. Through the Allies did try to fly in supplies to the [...] "redoubts" [...] and the marquis fought bravely, all these operations ended with the Resistance defeated. In the middle of June, the Wehrmacht had taken the village of Saint-Nizier-du-Moucherotte from the Maquis du Vercors, which severed the link between the Vercors plateau and Grenoble. To celebrate Bastille Day, the US Army Air Force sent in 360 B-17s to drop supplies of weapons to the maquisards on the Vercors plateau. However, the weapons the American dropped were all light weapons and Chavant sent a radio message to Algiers on night of 21 July 1944 asking for heavy weapons to air-dropped, called the leaders in Algiers criminals and cowards for not arranging more support, and ended with the line: [...] "That's what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> criminals and cowards". [...] In the Battle of the Vercors Plateau, the SS landed a glider company and the marquis suffered very heavy losses. Many of the [...] "German" [...] units fighting on the Vercors were Ostlegionen (Eastern Legions), Red Army POWs, mostly Russians and Ukrainians, who had joined the SS after being taken prisoner in 1942 or 1943. By this point the Germans had taken such heavy losses on the Eastern Front that they needed the manpower of the Ostlegionen to compensate. While the same Alpine division that taken the Glières plateau in March stormed up the Vercors plateau supported by a tank unit based in Lyon, the SS landed via glider. The maquis lost about 650 killed during the fighting on the Vercors plateau and afterwards, the Germans shot about 200 maquisards, mostly wounded who had been unable to escape together with the medical team that had stayed behind to take care of them. In the aftermath of the Battle of the Vercors, the local people were victims of massive reprisals which included numerous cases of looting, rape and extrajudicial executions.|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear friend," [...] demanded my visitor, who had risen, {{and whom}} I was {{gradually}} edging to the door, [...] "do {{you mean to}} <b>say</b> there <b>is</b> any individuality in such things now? What have <b>we</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> about character?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, no," [...] says he, quite seriously, {{without taking}} my jest, and jerking his head towards the black chiefs, who had squatted down upon their hams nigh to the table--"No, no.

6000|$|... "Feerda again," [...] he muttered. [...] "She hangs {{around all}} the time, trying {{to listen to what}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> She couldn't have heard this, though.

60|$|But the Congress of Cambrai is met, {{and much}} else is met and parted: and the Kaiser's Spectre-Hunt, {{especially}} his Duel with the She-Dragon of Spain, {{is in full}} course; and it <b>is</b> time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> something of the Double-Marriage in a directly narrative way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me remind}} you, then, of what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> {{a little time}} ago," [...] he went on. [...] "You will not take offence? You will understand, I am sure.

60|$|We {{have all}} some {{experience}} of a feeling, that comes over us occasionally, of what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> and doing having been said and done before, in a remote time--of our having been surrounded, dim ages ago, by the same faces, objects, and circumstances--of our knowing perfectly what will be said next, as if we suddenly remembered it!

6000|$|... 'I like you!' {{said the}} Princess.

By each window do you see there are {{standing}} three reporters and an old editor, and this old editor is the worst, for he doesn't understand anything!' but she only said this to tease Blockhead-Hans. And the reporters giggled, and each dropped a blot of ink on the floor.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know whether}} any of us really grasp what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> when we talk of greater {{educational}} efficiency in the future. That means--if it means anything--teaching more with much less trouble. It will mean, for instance, that most people will {{have three or four}} languages properly learnt; that they will think about things mathematical with a quickness and clearness that puzzles us; that about all sorts of things their minds will move in daylight where ours move in a haze of ignorance or in an emotional fog.|$|E
