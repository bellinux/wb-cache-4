40|$|Several {{on-going}} {{and future}} experiments use a Stokes polarimeter (i. e. a rotating wave plate {{followed by a}} steady polarizer and by an unpolarized detector) to measure the small polarized component of the Cosmic Microwave Background. The expected signal is typically evaluated using the Mueller formalism. In this work <b>we</b> <b>carry-out</b> the signal evaluation {{taking into account the}} temperatures of the different optical devices present in the instrument, their non- idealities, multiple internal reflections, and reflections between different optical components. This analysis, which exploits a new description of the radiation transmitted by a half wave plate, can be used to optimize the experimental setup as well as each of its optical components. We conclude with an example of application of our analysis, studying a cryogenic polarization modulator developed for detecting the interstellar dust polarization. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures.

40|$|In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>carry-out</b> a {{study of}} the Quality of Service (QoS) {{mechanism}} in IEEE 802. 11 e Enhanced Distribution Coordination Function (EDCF) and how it is achieved by providing traffics with different priorities. It can perform the access to the radio channel or just simply it can considerably be declined subsequently to a variation of network dynamicity. The results of the proposed analysis show that the EDCF scheduler looses the ability of the traffic differentiation and becomes insensitive to the QoS priority requirements. Consequently, it goes away from the region of stability and EDCF doesn't offer better performance than the conventional DCF scheme. Therefore, traffic specifications are weakly applied only for the channel occupation time distribution. During the handoff between the Base Stations (BS's), the response time of the data rate application within the roaming process grows to the initial throughput level. Performance metrics at the MAC layer, like throughput, End- 2 -End delay, and packet loss have been evaluated. Comment: 4 Page...|$|E

First, we take a commonly used cross-country panel dataset and evaluate the housing price equation using a consistent estimator {{in the presence of}} endogenous explanatory variables and a lagged dependent variable. Second, <b>we</b> <b>carry-out</b> a novel analysis of determinants of residential housing prices in a cross-section of countries. Our results show that the short-term interest rate, and hence monetary policy, has a sizable impact on residential housing prices.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive system for adaptive replay {{of a computer}} animation sequence featuring the locomotion of a synthetic animal. The kinematic locomotion gait, {{which is supposed to}} be mostly stationnary, is tuned before being injected on the dynamic model of the animated animal. The animator can take benefit from this new flexibility in order to fulfill some goals, like steering the animal towards a target. The reference gait kinematic trajectories are expanded on a wavelet redundant basis, and tuned through varying the wavelet parameters. Because the optimization process is time-consuming, <b>we</b> propose to <b>carry-out</b> all optimizations beforehand and send the outcomes in a training set for a neural network, whose role is to compress data and to interpolate in between the training samples. At runtime, the network emulates the behaviour of the optimization process and automatically tailors the gait parameters. This approach paves the way towards the definition of a ready-to-u [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) {{has been}} {{standard}} clinical practice for 25 years. During {{this time it}} has been extensively researched both biomechanically {{and in terms of}} its clinical performance as an implant (survival, compatibility, wear, complications etc). This research, which was often funded by the relevant commercial implant company as part of the post market surveillance, has extended the scope and longevity of TKA but has failed to distinguish those implants, surgical and rehabilitation techniques which are most successful at restoring patient function. Over the last 20 years we have conducted a series of RCT's using flexible electro-goniometry to record the dynamic performance of the knee during a range of activities of daily living and a general quality of life score (SF 36). Studies reported include outcome of mobile bearing TKA, with and without patella resurfacing, Standard versus High flexion TKA and individual effects. The most striking features of these data are that while producing a greater pain free range of passive motion the dynamic function of TKA patients remains significantly limited to up to 7 years post operation, loss of dynamic function associated with reduced activity levels and reduced quality of life and those with well preserved passive ROM preoperatively lose ROM and dynamic function post operatively. In general patients operate at about 70 % of an equivalent age matched normal subject. While TKA patients clearly gain from operation we consider it unacceptable to leave them with these associated long term health risks. To maximise the patient's functional ability post TKA we need to identify which implants, surgical techniques and rehabilitation programmes lead to the best functional outcomes and in which patients. The established gold standard for such questions is a phase III, multi centre, randomised, controlled or comparative clinical trial. Such trials are designed to be statistically powerful and generalisable but often use clinical questionnaire as the outcome measures which due to their lack of sensitivity to dynamic functional performance of the knee fail to distinguish between patient groups in TKA. Flexible electrogoniometry presents a sensitive and relatively inexpensive alternative which, with suitable training, can be implemented be a research nurse of physiotherapist in a standard out-patient clinic. Currently the surgeon, therapist and patient are faced with a vast array of surgical, operative and rehabilitation options. The challenge for us as a research community over the next decade is to provide them with suitable comparative evidence of functional outcome to help guide choice. To this end we in Glasgow have formed a Functional Outcomes in Knee Arthroplasty Clinical Trials Collaboration involving The Bioengineering Unit of University of Strathclyde, The Clinical Trials Unit and Robertson Institute of Bio-statistics of Glasgow University, The School of Health and Social Care, Glasgow Caledonian University, The HealthQWest Research Consortium, The Glasgow and Clyde NHS and the Glasgow Clinical Research Facility. <b>We</b> intend to <b>carry-out</b> our own phase II and II trials and to adopt other Phase III trials.

40|$|Modern FPGA System-on-Chips (SoCs) combine high {{performance}} application processors with reconfigurable hardware. This allows to enhance complex software systems with reconfigurable hardware accelerators. Unfortunately, even when state-of-the-art software security mechanisms are implemented, this combination creates new security threats. Attacks on the software are now possible through the reconfigurable hardware as these cores share resources with the processor and may contain unwanted functionality. In this paper, we discuss software protection mechanisms offered in conventional SoCs {{and how they}} can be circumvented by malicious hardware blocks. As a concrete example, we show how the malicious functionality within an IP core accesses and replaces critical memory sections. We refer to this type of attacks as hardware-assisted attacks against running software systems. <b>We</b> <b>carry-out</b> a proof-of-concept on the Xilinx Zynq device which runs a Linux OS and a software application that verifies system updates. The malicious IP core replaces the public key used to verify system updates, thus, allowing an attacker to maliciously update the FPGA SoC. Additionally, we propose a countermeasure that can be applied against such threats {{in the form of a}} security wrapper for hardware modules...|$|E
40|$|Context. The first {{generation}} of stars formed in the Galaxy left behind the chemical signatures of their nucleosynthesis in the interstellar medium, visible today in the atmospheres of low-mass stars formed afterwards. Sampling the chemistry of low-mass provides insight into the first stars. Aims. We aim to increase the samples of stars with extremely low metal abundances, identifying ultra metal-poor stars from spectra with modest spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Achieving this goal involves deriving reliable metallicities and carbon abundances from such spectra. Methods. <b>We</b> <b>carry-out</b> follow-up observations of faint, V> 19, metal-poor candidates selected from SDSS spectroscopy and observed with OSIRIS at GTC. The SDSS and follow-up OSIRIS spectra have been analyzed using the FERRE code to derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities and carbon abundances. In addition, a well-known extremely metal-poor star has been included in our sample to calibrate the analysis methodology. Results. We have observed and analyzed five metal-poor candidates from modest-quality SDSS spectra. All stars in our sample have been confirmed as extremely metal-poor stars, in the [Fe/H]<- 3. 3 regime. We report the recognition of J 173403 + 644632, a carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor dwarf star with [Fe/H]=- 4. 3 and [C/Fe]=+ 3. 1. Comment: Accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
