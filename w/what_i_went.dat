500|$|According to Aguilera herself, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] {{talks about}} her abusive childhood. She revealed, [...] "I think going through <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through {{at a young age}} [...] the abuse that went on in my {{household}} [...] did affect me a lot. Domestic violence is a topic that is very hush-hush in society". Aguilera recalls the domestic violence of her childhood as she sings, [...] "He took his anger out on her face, she kept all of her pain locked away". Nick Levine for Digital Spy said that [...] "Oh Mother" [...] is a [...] "retread" [...] of [...] "I'm OK", a song with the same topic from Aguilera's 2002 album Stripped.|$|E
500|$|After {{concluding}} her California Dreams Tour, Perry {{stated that}} {{she intended to}} [...] "live a little" [...] before recording any new material that was [...] "worth listening to". When ex-husband Russell Brand left her on December 30, 2011, she felt devastated and contemplated suicide. Perry revealed to Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to record a [...] "darker" [...] album than her previous records. She stated: [...] "It was inevitable, after <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through. If I had a time machine and could go back in time, I would. But I can't, so, you'll discover another part of me." [...] To Interview, she mentioned that she aspired to include a more acoustic vibe to the record.|$|E
500|$|<b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through, only I {{will ever}} know. My knee cap {{completely}} {{turned to the}} right, a ball of blood forming on my leg and the bone that broke, {{without being able to}} move my body. And the pain, a pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. The surgeon placed a big support [...] in my leg, because the bone had moved so much. Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats , there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant my leg was full of blood. I'm just grateful that the artery was untouched.|$|E

2500|$|Heston {{turned down}} the lead {{opposite}} Marilyn Monroe in Let's Make Love to appear in Benn W. Levy's play The Tumbler, directed by Laurence Olivier. Called a [...] "harrowingly pretentious verse drama" [...] by Time, the production went through a troubled out-of-town tryout period in Boston and closed after five performances on Broadway in February 1960. Heston, a great admirer of Olivier the actor, took on the play {{to work with him}} as a director. After the play flopped, Heston told columnist Joe Hyams, [...] "I feel I am the only one who came out with a profit.... I got out of it precisely <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in for – a chance to work with Olivier. I learned from him in six weeks things I never would have learned otherwise. I think I've ended up a better actor." ...|$|E

[...] Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: [...] "We were told by one of the (other Hells Angels) clubs if we showed up down there (and) sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us." [...] In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: [...] "I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't go there to police nothing, man. They told me if I could sit on the edge of the stage so nobody could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show was over. And that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> there to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Williams told MTV {{that she}} couldn't [...] "wait {{for the world}} to hear [...] new solo album", {{describing}} it as [...] "fresher", [...] "more inspirational", and [...] "more on the secular side". Furthermore, she stated [...] "whether it's gospel or not, I wrote about it", therefore expecting [...] "some of her gospel fans to be a little upset" [...] but wanted to [...] "keep it real". She also discussed one of the album's [...] "primary themes" [...] – [...] "what it's like to be in love" [...] – explaining [...] " [...] mistakes you make when you're in love and how they affect your life" [...] after saying [...] "I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them." [...] In describing the album during another interview, this time for GospelCity, Williams said [...] "these songs are just about the real me" [...] and that she [...] "just wrote from [...] heart" [...] before acknowledging that [...] "it didn't turn out to be as 'gospel-ly' as some would have liked", but [...] "the stuff" [...] that's on the album [...] "is stuff [...] went through". Williams then said [...] "this whole album is about God's love and me". After being asked [...] "Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do You Know, as they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?", Williams responded [...] "That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way. I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through, I know God is taking me to another level. I had people around me that were not going where I was going – I had to release them from my life." ...|$|E
