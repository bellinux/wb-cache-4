30|$|Research on fabric {{skewness}} is very scarce, and {{no studies}} have been found that investigate the effect of loom settings on fabric skewness. Some studies (Alamdar-Yazdi 2005; Moore et al. 1995) have shown that fabric shear properties and drape are affected by skewness. It was found (Alamdar-Yazdi and Khojasteh 2006) {{that there is a}} positive correlation between twist liveliness and fabric skewness, and the skewness is higher when the twist direction of the warp and weft yarns are opposite to each other. Only Nasan and Stylios (2014) analyzed the influence of backrest position on skewness of woven fabric where they found no significant effect of <b>whip</b> <b>roll</b> settings on fabric skewness.|$|E

"And if you can't {{stand it}} at {{boarding}} school, write, {{and we will}} send {{for you to come}} back here," [...] added his wife; and then, with a crack of the <b>whip,</b> the carriage <b>rolled</b> off, and the farm was left behind. It was to be many a day before the boys would see the place again.|$|R
60|$|A coster, however, {{taking his}} girl for a Sunday airing, {{seemed to have}} the same {{impression}} about himself. This person had flogged his donkey into a gallop alongside, and sat, upright as a waxwork, in his shallopy chariot, his chin settled pompously on a red handkerchief, like Swithin's on his full cravat; while his girl, with the ends of a fly-blown boa floating out behind, aped a woman of fashion. Her swain moved a stick with a ragged bit of string dangling from the end, reproducing with strange fidelity the circular flourish of Swithin's <b>whip,</b> and <b>rolled</b> his head at his lady with a leer that had a weird likeness to Swithin's primeval stare.|$|R
