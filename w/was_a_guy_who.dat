500|$|When {{he started}} classes with this [...] "homemade" [...] knife, his {{instructors}} and fellow students {{were impressed with}} his handiwork {{and asked him to}} make knives for them. Emerson did so and sold these early butterfly knives for just the cost of materials, but he soon raised the price to $50 each, as demand for his knives increased. Emerson went on to make fixed-blade knives on a part-time basis, but upon seeing a Michael Walker handmade folding knife at a gun show, he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided {{he was going to make}} folding pocketknives from that point on. Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the Walker Linerlock mechanism on his own knives. [...] According to a 1990 article by Paul Basch, Emerson said of Walker, [...] "Here <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> put everything I was looking for into a knife. It was then I decided to start making knives seriously and locking liners in particular".|$|E
500|$|The song is {{interpreted}} {{to be an}} ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that [...] "At the time [...] [...] [...] {{it was written in}} the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like [...] [...] [...] 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [...] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E
500|$|Shearer {{was born}} December 23, 1943 in Los Angeles, {{the son of}} Dora Warren (née Kohn) (d. 2008), a bookkeeper, and Mack Shearer. His parents were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Austria and Poland. Starting when Shearer was four years old, he had a piano teacher whose daughter worked as a child actress. The piano teacher later {{decided to make a}} career change and become a children's agent, as she knew people in the business through her daughter's work. The teacher asked Shearer's parents for permission to take him to an audition. Several months later, she called Shearer's parents and told them that she had gotten Shearer an audition for the radio show The Jack Benny Program. Shearer received the role when he was seven years old. He described Jack Benny as [...] "very warm and approachable [...] He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> dug the idea of other people on the show getting laughs, which sort of spoiled me for other people in comedy." [...] Shearer {{said in an interview that}} one person who [...] "took him under his wing" [...] and was one of his best friends during his early days in show business was voice actor Mel Blanc, who voiced many animated characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Barney Rubble. Shearer made his film debut in the 1953 film Abbott and Costello Go to Mars, in which he only had a small part. Later that year, he made his first big film performance in The Robe. Throughout his childhood and teenage years he worked in television, film, and radio. In 1957, Shearer played the precursor to the Eddie Haskell character in the pilot episode of the television series Leave It to Beaver. After the filming, Shearer's parents said they did not want him to be a regular in a series. Instead they wanted him to just do occasional work so that he could have a normal childhood. Shearer and his parents made the decision not to accept the role in the series if it was picked up by a television network.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{found it}} hard to believe that the punch could have floored a man like Liston. Hall of Fame {{announcer}} Don Dunphy said, [...] "Here <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> was in prison and the guards used to beat him over the head with clubs and couldn't knock him down." [...] But others contend that he wasn't the same Liston. Dave Anderson of the New York Times said Liston [...] "looked awful" [...] in his last workout before the fight. Liston's handlers secretly paid sparring partner Amos Lincoln an extra $100 to take it easy on him. Arthur Daley of the New York Times wrote that Liston's handlers knew he [...] "didn't have it anymore." [...] These comments don't accord with the fact that Liston easily beat Amos Lincoln three years later in 1968, knocking him out inside two rounds.|$|E
