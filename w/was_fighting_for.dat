A DNA test was conducted soon after which confirmed Jesé to be the father. Jesé's third son, Nyan was born prematurely and suffered from a number of medical conditions from birth. In November 2017, Jesé shaved the letter 'N' into his hair in support of Nyan who at the time <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> his life in a hospital in Gran Canaria.|$|E

5|$|Pulsford {{continued}} {{his support for}} the free-trade cause outside Parliament, and in May 1914 planned to establish a free-trade paper to be circulated around Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, a scheme that was abandoned following the outbreak of World War I. He revised his book Commerce and the Empire (originally published in 1903) in 1917, arguing that free trade was central to the freedoms the Empire <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for,</b> and calling for free trade with Germany after the war. On 2 March 1919 he married Blanche Elspeth Brown at Neutral Bay, but he died later that year on his seventy-fifth birthday, 29 September 1919. Survived by his second wife and the three sons of his first marriage, Pulsford was buried at Gore Hill cemetery after an Anglican service.|$|E
5|$|A children's {{edition of}} the memoir was {{published}} in 2014 under the title I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. The audio book edition, narrated by Neela Vaswani, won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. In February 2014, she was nominated for the World Children's Prize in Sweden. Even though she <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> women's rights as well as children's rights, she did not describe herself as feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. In May 2014, Yousafzai was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later in 2014, she was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi, for her struggle against the suppression of {{children and young people}} and for the right of all children to education. Aged 17 at the time, she became the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{went through}} knee surgery during the offseason, {{but there was}} still concern about whether he had a future in the NFL. That was set aside when he was {{considered}} to be progressing well in his recovery as of early July 1977. During the Buccaneers' offseason, the quarterbacks on the roster changed entirely, with Dickinson being the only holdover; Gary Huff was now the starter, and Dickinson <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> a backup role alongside Mike Boryla and Randy Hedberg. After the Buccaneers lost Boryla and Huff to injuries, the former for the season, Dickinson ended up being the starting quarterback for the team's final preseason game against the Bills. In the game, Dickinson completed 2 of 12 passes for -2yards and was sacked three times in a 176 loss. A week after the game against the Bills, Dickinson was released by the Buccaneers along with four other players. The Buccaneers re-signed him after Huff got injured in late October, but Dickinson was again released a couple weeks later.|$|E

5|$|The loss of so {{many young}} men during the Second World War made it {{difficult}} for clubs to retain their former status. This was especially true for Millwall, who appeared to suffer more than most. From being one of the country's biggest clubs before the war, Millwall were reduced to one of its smallest afterward. The Den sustained severe bomb damage on 19 April 1943, and one week later a fire, determined to have been caused by a discarded cigarette, also destroyed an entire stand. The club accepted offers from neighbours Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace and West Ham United to stage games at their grounds. On 24 February 1944, Millwall returned to The Den, to play in an all-standing stadium. This was achieved with considerable volunteer labour by Lions fans. One of the biggest Cup upsets came in the fourth round of the 1956–57 FA Cup on 26 January 1957, when Millwall beat Newcastle United 2–1 in front of a crowd of 45,646. At the time the club <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> Third Division survival.|$|E
25|$|Jandamarra The Play (2008) {{was sold}} out before its opening season premiere at the Perth International Arts Festival. As the {{director}} of Bunuba Films since 2000, Oscar {{was one of the}} driving forces in the company's marathon journey to bring Jandamarra's story to the stage. Jandamarra, a Bunuba warrior born in 1873, was famous for leading his people in an armed uprising against the British colonisation of their lands. He outsmarted the police and settlers in the Kimberley for years, before being killed in 1897 at the age of 24. Geoffrey Bolton, a distinguished Australian historian, compared Jandamarra to guerilla leaders like the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata and Sicilian rebel Salvatore Giuliano. Oscar said Jandamarra <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> his people’s freedom. “He was not an outlaw, he <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> his land, I think he was a freedom fighter”.|$|E

25|$|The next year, {{when a large}} French army under Marshal André Masséna invaded Portugal, Wellesley {{fought a}} delaying action at the Battle of Bussaco, before {{withdrawing}} behind the impregnable Lines, leaving Massena's army to starve in front of them. After Massena withdrew, there <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> most of 1811 on the frontiers of Portugal, as Wellesley attempted to recover vital fortified towns. A British and Spanish force under Beresford fought the very bloody Battle of Albuera, while Wellesley himself won the Battle of Sabugal in April, and the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro in May.|$|E
25|$|Alarmed by the {{extension}} of Russian power into the Balkans, the Great Powers later forced modifications of the treaty in the Congress of Berlin. The main change here was that Bulgaria would be split, according to earlier agreements among the Great Powers that precluded {{the creation of a}} large new Slavic state: the northern and eastern parts to become principalities as before (Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia), though with different governors; and the Macedonian region, originally part of Bulgaria under San Stefano, would return to direct Ottoman administration. At the Congress of Berlin, Bismarck said that he <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> peace in Europe.|$|E

The regents were Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, Louis I, Duke of Anjou, John, Duke of Berry, and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, Charles VI's {{maternal}} uncle. Philip took the dominant role during the regency. Louis of Anjou <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> {{his claim to}} the Kingdom of Naples after 1382, dying in 1384, John of Berry was interested mainly in the Languedoc, and not particularly interested in politics; whilst Louis of Bourbon was a largely unimportant figure, due to his personality (he showed signs of mental instability) and his status (since {{he was not the}} son of a king).|$|E

25|$|Bates {{joined his}} {{hometown}} club Newcastle United {{at the age}} of 8 in 1993. He worked his way through the ranks, setting several junior goalscoring records during that time and playing alongside good friend and fellow academy graduate Steven Taylor. With a view to progressing {{all the way to the}} first team, Bates played in the Newcastle Youth team until 2004, with his goal taking the team to the final 16 in the 2003–04 FA Youth Cup. The following season, Bates found a regular spot in the Reserves team, making 15 appearances and scoring 6 goals in the 2004–05 season. Promotion into the first team proved significantly more difficult for Bates, however, as he <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> a place behind established strikers such as Alan Shearer, Shola Ameobi and Patrick Kluivert.|$|E

25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} {{struggle for power}} was the conflict that erupted {{after the death of}} Yaroslav the Wise. The rivaling Principality of Polotsk was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while Rostislav Vladimirovich <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> the Black Sea port of Tmutarakan belonging to Chernihiv. Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River. At the same time an uprising took place in Kiev, bringing to power Vseslav of Polotsk who supported the traditional Slavic paganism. The ruling Grand Prince Iziaslav fled to Poland asking for support and in couple of years returned to establish the order. The affairs became even more complicated {{by the end of the}} 11th century driving the state into chaos and constant warfare. On the initiative of Vladimir II Monomakh in 1097 the first federal council of Kievan Rus took place near Chernihiv in the city of Liubech with the main intention to find an understanding among the fighting sides. However even though that did not really stop the fighting, it certainly cooled things off.|$|E
25|$|Ma Chao (176–222), {{courtesy}} name Mengqi, was {{a military}} general and warlord {{who lived in the}} late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. A descendant of the general Ma Yuan, Ma Chao was the eldest son of Ma Teng, a prominent warlord in Liang Province (covering parts of northwestern China). In 211, he formed a coalition with Han Sui and other northwestern warlords and revolted against the Han central government, which was led by the warlord Cao Cao. The coalition broke up after losing the Battle of Tong Pass against Cao Cao's forces. Ma Chao initially retreated, but later returned to attack and seize control of Liang Province by killing the provincial inspector Wei Kang and forcing Wei Kang's subordinates to submit to him. About a year after Ma Chao started his uprising, Emperor Xian issued an imperial decree ordering the execution of Ma Chao's family members, who were in Ye city at the time. In the meantime, Wei Kang's subordinates, led by Zhao Ang, Yang Fu and others, rebelled against Ma Chao and forced him out of Liang Province. Ma Chao retreated to Hanzhong Commandery, where he borrowed troops from the warlord Zhang Lu, and returned to attack Liang Province but was ultimately defeated and driven back. Ma Chao took shelter under Zhang Lu for a while until around 214, when he heard that the warlord Liu Bei <b>was</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>for</b> control over Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) with Yi Province's governor, Liu Zhang. He defected to Liu Bei's side and assisted Liu Bei in capturing Yi Province from Liu Zhang. Ma Chao had served as a general under Liu Bei since then and participated in the Hanzhong Campaign in 219. He died in 222.|$|E
