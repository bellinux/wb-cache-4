She wrote that despite the intended demographic, older children in {{elementary and middle school}} <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> writing humorous, while girls <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> pet characters entertaining the most. The Dove Foundation member Donna Rolfe gave the same set a full five stars.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars {{received}} generally positive reviews. Reviewers lauded the game's pre-rendered cinematics, {{attention to}} detail in replicating the Halo universe, and intuitive control scheme. Complaints against the game included {{the lack of an}} option to play as the Covenant faction in campaign mode as well as the lack of strategic options during play. Critics from GameSpot and USA Today wrote that experienced RTS players <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> strategic elements of the title shallow. The game sold one million units worldwide through March 2009, making it the best-selling console real-time strategy game to date. An enhanced version of the game—Halo Wars: Definitive Edition—was released for Windows and Xbox One. Halo Wars 2, a sequel developed by 343 Industries and Creative Assembly was released in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|In August 1805, the French Grande Armée {{invaded the}} German states {{in hopes of}} {{knocking}} Austria {{out of the war}} before Russian forces could intervene. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 160 miles (260km). Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Bavaria. Napoleon hoped to swing his forces northward and perform a wheeling movement that <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> French at the Austrian rear. The Ulm Maneuver was well executed, and on 20 October Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered at Ulm, bringing the total number of Austrian prisoners in the campaign to 60,000. The French captured Vienna in November and went on to inflict a decisive defeat on a Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz led to the expulsion of Russian troops from Central Europe and the humiliation of Austria, which signed the Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December.|$|E

5|$|The PC {{version of}} Worms Armageddon was {{critically}} successful. Whilst writing that veterans of Worms 2 <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> game to be similar, Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised {{the game for}} being easy to play and control and humorous and the game's graphics, physics, and seemingly endless customization {{as well as the}} game's WormNet. He also likened the single-player missions to the classic game of Lemmings in that the missions often required the player to precisely utilize a limited supply of weapons and tools to accomplish the objective. Among his only criticisms are that the AI-controlled worms do not utilize their full arsenals and that the player would wish that there were more weapons, more diverse graphics and sound, and more content. Matthew Pierce of PC Gamer UK commended Team17 for addressing the problems of single-player (i.e. the missions and AI) that the original Worms and Worms 2 had always been criticized for.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E
5|$|Walter and Astrid {{find the}} source of the {{electromagnetic}} pulse, and begin investigating the house the pulse was built on. At the same time, Peter and Olivia go to a rural meeting place where the sheriff said they <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> truck's owner, only to be shot at by the sheriff and his deputy, who are hell bent on keeping the town's secret. Walter manages to turn off the pulse, and all of the townsfolk revert to their deformed appearance. The daughter of one of the army scientists saves Olivia and Peter from getting shot, and explains that her father stayed in Edina to perfect the pulse. After Walter pleads to Broyles to let the townspeople keep their secret, the Fringe team decides to not report the case so that the remaining residents can live a normal life.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Hergé's English {{language}} publishers, Methuen, were planning on translating and publishing The Black Island for the British market. Methuen believed that many British readers <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> depiction of Britain in the comic inaccurate and out-of-date, and {{drew up a}} list of 131 errors that they asked Hergé to rectify before they would publish it in English. They were also aware that the work would appear particularly dated when compared {{with some of the most}} recently published Adventures like Destination Moon and The Calculus Affair, which made use of advanced technologies in their plot. At the time, Hergé was busy producing the twenty-second Tintin story, Flight 714 to Sydney, and so did not have the time to undertake research into contemporary British society and culture. Instead, he sent his assistant Bob De Moor to Britain in October 1961, where he visited such sites as Batemans and the White Cliffs of Dover, making many observations as to new developments in clothing and architecture. While in England, De Moor sought out various contemporary uniforms to use as a basis for more accurate illustrations. A police constabulary lent him a police uniform, although when he asked British Rail if he could borrow one of their uniforms, their staff were suspicious and refused.|$|E

Charleston Southern would lead at halftime, 15 to 7.|$|E

Ali used to do illegal graffiti and sprayed his first wall at the age of 14. Since the early 1980s, Ali has been an active artist, he was inspired by the Subway art movement and by New York graffiti. Ali <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> ugliest wall and resolve {{to turn it into a}} piece of art by adding colour rather than tagging his name.|$|E

He had difficulties managing his finances, often spending his money on wine, food, women, homes, cars, and especially dogs, and was often near bankruptcy.

25|$|Ridgway had revised {{his concept}} for {{advancing}} above the parallel since meeting with MacArthur on March 24. He originally {{had intended to}} direct a strong attack northwestward across the Imjin, expecting that in moving {{as far as the}} Yesong River the attack force <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> elusive North Korean I Corps. His intelligence staff later discovered that the bulk of the North Korean corps had withdrawn behind the Yesong and also warned that the attack force would be vulnerable to envelopment by a fresh Chinese unit located off the right flank of the advance. (The unit was the XIX Army Group, which intelligence had not yet fully identified.) Ridgway, as a result, elected to limit operations northwest of the Imjin to reconnaissance and combat patrols.|$|E
25|$|But it was {{the site}} where that second piece of {{information}} led us that contained dynamite. From a description provided by our source, I had easily identified the building in question, which was located in Baghdad's downtown Aadamiyah section. The ten crates of missile parts were stashed in a basement of the Baghdad headquarters of Saddam's own Ba'ath party. If we could achieve surprise and surround the site before the Iraqis could evacuate the crates, we would obtain the ultimate catch-22 situation: let us inside as promised and we <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> prohibited material; bar our entry and violate the Kofi Annan compromise, {{and in the process}} invite a devastating air strike by the United States. UNSCOM would be prepared to camp out around this site until the situation had been resolved one way or the other.|$|E
25|$|The Eagles <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> {{end zone}} {{on their first}} series of the fourth quarter on an Austin Gahafer pass to Justin Cornwall for a 19-yard {{touchdown}} {{in the corner of}} the end zone. The 49ers would cap their next possession on a Blake Brewer 41-yard field goal. On their first play of the next series the 49ers' Kendal Parker forced Brandon Reeves of Morehead St. to fumble the ball, which resulted in Charlotte's Greg Cunningham Jr. recovering the ball for the 49ers. Their resulting next drive was capped by a Blake Brewer 40-yard field goal. After a Morehead St. four-and-out the 49ers scored the final points of the game on a Damarrell Alexander 51-yard rushing touchdown, to get the 49ers over the 60-point scoring threshold for the first time in program history. The final score was Charlotte 61 and Morehead State 17.|$|E

25|$|Acknowledging {{that the}} changes in the {{national}} economy in the past two hundred years had transformed Congress' Commerce Clause power from being a marginal power that served mostly to mediate between the states by eliminating interstate tariffs and other burdens on interstate commerce into a general power that gave Congress essentially unlimited power to regulate in every area of economic life, O'Connor argued for special limitations on this power to protect the states' authority over their own employment relations. She invoked the limiting language of the most expansive interpretations of the Commerce Clause in the Court's decisions of the 1930s and 1940s to argue that the Court retained the power to decide whether a particular exercise of the Commerce Clause authority was necessary and proper to the federal purposes to be achieved. Applying that standard, she, joined by Justices Powell and Rehnquist, <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> FLSA unconstitutional as applied to employees of state and local governments.|$|E
25|$|On appeal, Kennedy {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of}} executing a person solely for child rape, and the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected the challenge {{on the grounds that}} the death penalty was not too harsh for such a heinous offense. The court distinguished the U.S. Supreme Court's plurality decision in Coker v. Georgia (1977), concluding that Cokers rejection of death as punishment for rape of an adult woman did not apply when the victim was a child. Rather, the Louisiana Supreme Court applied a balancing test set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in more recent death penalty cases, Atkins v. Virginia and Roper v. Simmons, first examining whether there is a national consensus on the punishment and then considering whether the court <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> punishment excessive. The Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that the adoption of similar laws in five other states, coupled with the unique vulnerability of children, satisfied Atkins and Roper.|$|E
25|$|When Hall {{agreed to}} the design role and was {{appointed}} in April 1966, he imagined he <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was {{an enormous amount of}} work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure. In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall. Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role. With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.|$|E
