5|$|In the <b>weeks</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Independence Bowl, {{the game}} {{received}} {{as much or}} more coverage than the incipient national championship game due to the controversial status of Tech star Bruce Smith, who was embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA about his participation in the game. Spread bettors favored Air Force to win the game by four points. Ticket sales were slow in the <b>weeks</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the bowl, and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12,000 tickets.
