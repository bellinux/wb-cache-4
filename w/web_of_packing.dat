40|$|WO 200243781 A UPAB: 20021031 NOVELTY - In {{a process}} to sterilise a web or {{deep-drawn}} material (1), the surface (2) is positioned in a discharge chamber (3) filled with a gas or gas mixture and exposed to a barrier discharge between first (4) and second (5) electrodes. The second electrode is especially a plasma- excited gas or gas mixture emitting ultra violet radiation impinging on the surface (2). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a sterilisation assembly in which the gas pressure is at least 10000 Pa. The plasma- excited second gas or gas mixture is another plasma- excited gas or gas mixture. One or more additional gases are admitted to the discharge chamber (3) which enhance the surface treatment process and/or improve the uniformity of barrier discharge. Suitable additional gases are helium, argon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, ozone, water gas, steam, hydrogen peroxide gas or vapour. USE - Process to sterilise a <b>web</b> <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> material by electrode discharge and ultra violet light. ADVANTAGE - The process and assembly combines high efficiency with high-speed treatment of a web...|$|E

40|$|Positive-strand RNA viruses, a {{large group}} {{including}} human pathogens such as SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), replicate in the cytoplasm of infected host cells. Their replication complexes are commonly associated with modified host cell membranes. Membrane structures supporting viral RNA synthesis range from distinct spherular membrane invaginations to more elaborate <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> <b>packed</b> membranes and vesicles. Generally, their ultrastructure, morphogenesis, and exact role in viral replication remain to be defined. Poorly characterized double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) were previously implicated in SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. We have now applied electron tomography of cryofixed infected cells for the three-dimensional imaging of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution. Our analysis defines a unique reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that integrates convoluted membranes, numerous interconnected DMVs (diameter 200 - 300 nm), and "vesicle packets" apparently arising from DMV merger. The convoluted membranes were most abundantly immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits. However, double-stranded RNA, presumably revealing the site of viral RNA synthesis, mainly localized to the DMV interior. Since we could not discern a connection between DMV interior and cytosol, our analysis raises several questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. Our data document the extensive virus-induced reorganization of host cell membranes into a network {{that is used to}} organize viral replication and possibly hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms. Together with biochemical studies of the viral enzyme complex, our ultrastructural description of this "replication network" will aid to further dissect {{the early stages of the}} coronavirus life cycle and its virus-host interactions...|$|R

30|$|To {{study the}} effect of channel of size (50  ×  40) with varying {{thickness}} <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> plate were selected. The cold form sections are having thin sections and fails at the bolted connection due to bearing and rupture along with buckling. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> plate at bolted connections distributes load over wide area of cold form channel webs and also avoids buckling <b>of</b> <b>web</b> element and hence increases the load carrying capacity of the joint. It is observed that as the packing plate thickness increases, the bending of channel at unconnected leg decreases. With {{the increase in the}} thickness <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> plate, a total of 5.8  % average increase in the strength of the each specimen is observed in 1.2  mm specimen sample. And 5.5  % of average increase in the strength of the each specimen is observed in 1.5  mm thick specimen. The above results are for the joints of three bolted connections. For single bolt connection, the percentage of increase in the joint is more due to length of outstanding.|$|R
40|$|By using a protein-design {{algorithm}} that quantitatively considers side-chain <b>packing,</b> {{the effect}} <b>of</b> specific steric constraints on protein design was assessed {{in the core}} of the streptococcal protein G beta 1 domain. The strength <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> constraints used in the design was varied, resulting in core sequences that reflected differing amounts <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> specificity. The structural flexibility and stability of several of the designed proteins were experimentally determined and showed a trend from well-ordered to highly mobile structures as the degree <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> specificity in the design decreased. This trend both demonstrates that the inclusion <b>of</b> specific <b>packing</b> interactions is necessary for the design of native-like proteins and defines a useful range <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> specificity for the design algorithm. In addition, an analysis of the modeled protein structures suggested that penalizing for exposed hydrophobic surface area can improve design performance...|$|R
