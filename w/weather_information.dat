5|$|On 1 August 1931, the 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF {{began its}} annual camp at Lympne.

5|$|From 1 to 31 May 1924, the Royal Air Force {{conducted}} {{a number of}} night flying experiments. Pilots were asked to keep an extra lookout whilst the experiments were taking place. On 27 and 28 September, the elimination trials for the Light Aircraft Trials were held. Only eight aircraft passed through to the trials proper. Also in October, it was notified that changes were being made expanding <b>weather</b> <b>information</b> given at Lympne. Amongst the changes were that measurements used were to be changed from imperial to metric. The addition of <b>weather</b> <b>information</b> at Haren, Brussels and Ostend, both in Belgium was notified. In 1924, Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft were operating cross-channel services for Imperial Airways. Lympne was used by aircraft of Imperial Airways as a refuelling point. The first stop in France was St Inglevert. When an aircraft departed Lympne for St Inglevert, the destination airfield was advised, and if arrival was not notified within two hours, the Coastguard was informed. Communication was by Carmichael Microway UHF transmitters at each airfield. Short Brothers used Lympne for flight testing new aircraft during 1924.|$|E

5|$|Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System – ARIES, a NASA {{platform}} for air safety and operational research, {{was created in}} 1999 using the second production 757. The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines. After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737-100 testbed, it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar flow control system, avionics systems for the proposed Northrop YF-23 jet fighter, and the 777's fly-by-wire control system. Equipped with a flight deck research station, on-board laboratories, and two experimental flight decks, ARIES was used for evaluating <b>weather</b> <b>information</b> and landing approach systems, as well as runway friction tests. ARIES went into storage in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was {{inducted}} into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000, in the first annual induction of two players since the inaugural ten members were announced in 1996. In 2009, Harvey was one of the 55 inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. Harvey vociferously called for Shane Warne and Mark Waugh to be banned from cricket after it was revealed that they accepted money from bookmakers to give pitch and <b>weather</b> <b>information</b> and the ACB privately fined them. He lamented the decline in player conduct in the modern era, also criticising the modern advent of sledging.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{rapid growth}} of mobile phones in Ghana has opened up the {{possibility}} of delivering timely and useful <b>weather</b> and market <b>information</b> to farmers at costs lower than traditional agricultural extension services. In this paper, we assess the usefulness, constraints, and factors likely to influence farmers’ decisions to patronize mobile phone-based <b>weather</b> and market <b>information.</b> Methods We rely on primary data from 310 farmers in the Upper West Region, an understudied part of Ghana. We subject the data to three types of analysis. First, we model farmers’ decision to patronize mobile phone-based <b>weather</b> and market <b>information</b> by estimating a binary logit model. Second, we use descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to analyse the level of usefulness of mobile phone-based <b>weather</b> and market <b>information.</b> We disaggregate the analysis by sex, income status, and age group. Finally, we use qualitative analysis to summarize the constraints associated with the utilization of mobile phone-based <b>weather</b> and market <b>information.</b> Results We find that contact with agricultural extension agents and farmer-to-farmer extension services significantly influences farmers’ decision to patronize mobile phone-based <b>weather</b> and market <b>information.</b> Regardless of sex, income status, and age group, farmers generally rate mobile phone-based <b>weather</b> and market <b>information</b> as very useful. We identify inexact information, complex text messages, information that are too costly to implement, and poor infrastructure as the constraints to the utilization of mobile phone-based <b>weather</b> and market <b>information.</b> Conclusion In order to improve the utilization of mobile phone-based <b>weather</b> and market <b>information,</b> disseminators of mobile phone-based information such as Esoko should constantly update and provide client-specific information. Improvements in mobile phone networks and related services will enhance the utilization of mobile phone-based <b>weather</b> and market <b>information...</b>|$|R

5|$|By 1999, {{computer}} systems and software had finally become sophisticated {{enough to allow}} for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored products that take us from the traditional weather map into an entirely new realm. <b>Weather</b> <b>information</b> can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.|$|E

40|$|Challenges in linking {{meteorological}} and climatological {{information with}} a wide range of farming decisions are addressed in this paper. In particular, while a considerable amount of <b>weather</b> and climate <b>information</b> is now available for farmers, some types of information under development or already operational, particularly climate forecasting, may be ill-suited for use by farmers for their decision-making. Case studies show it is particularly important for those key farm decisions that are amenable to <b>weather</b> and climate <b>information</b> to be identified clearly so that <b>weather</b> and climate <b>information</b> can be better tailored to suit farming decisions. A participatory approach provides farmers with ownership of the processes associated with development of <b>weather</b> and climate <b>information</b> and forecasts to farm decisions. Decision-support systems provide useful output when used with farmer discussion groups. Developing appropriate interdisciplinary systems to connect climate, <b>weather</b> and agronomic <b>information,</b> especially including forecasting systems, with farm management is needed if uptake of <b>weather</b> and climate <b>information</b> by farmers is to be successful. provision of output of climate change scenario and trend information to aid long-term strategic farm management decisions needs to be considered, especially in regions where more vulnerable farming zones exist...|$|R
