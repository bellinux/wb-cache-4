6000|$|We {{got to the}} {{bulkhead}} at last. Those were stout planks. She was a ship, well finished in every detail--the Narcissus was. They were the stoutest planks ever put into a ship's bulkhead--we thought--and then we perceived that, in our hurry, we had sent all the tools overboard. Absurd little Belfast wanted to break it down with his own weight, and with both feet leaped straight up like a springbok, cursing the Clyde shipwrights for not scamping their work. Incidentally he reviled all North Britain, {{the rest of the}} earth, the sea--and all his companions. He swore, as he alighted heavily on his heels, that he would never, never any more associate with any fool that [...] "hadn't savee enough to know his knee from his elbow." [...] He managed by his thumping to scare the last remnant of wits out of Jimmy. We could hear the object of our exasperated solicitude darting to and fro under the planks. He had cracked his voice at last, and could only squeak miserably. His back or else his head rubbed the planks, now here, now there, in a puzzling manner. He squeaked as he dodged the invisible blows. It was more heartrending even than his yells. Suddenly Archie produced a crowbar. He had kept it back; also a small hatchet. We howled with satisfaction. He struck a mighty blow and small chips flew at our eyes. The boatswain above shouted:--"Look out! Look out there. Don't kill the man. Easy does it!" [...] Wamibo, maddened with excitement, hung head down and insanely urged us:--"Hoo! Strook'im! Hoo! Hoo!" [...] We were afraid he would fall in and kill one of us and, hurriedly, we entreated the boatswain to [...] "shove the blamed Finn overboard." [...] Then, all together, we yelled down at the planks:--"Stand from under! Get forward," [...] and listened. We only heard the deep hum and moan of the wind above us, the mingled roar and hiss of the seas. The ship, as if overcome with despair, wallowed lifelessly, and our heads swam with that unnatural motion. Belfast clamoured:--"For the love of God, Jimmy, where are ye?... Knock! Jimmy darlint!... Knock! You bloody black beast! Knock!" [...] He was as quiet as a dead man inside a grave; and, like men standing above a grave, we {{were on the verge of}} tears--but with vexation, the strain, the fatigue; with the great longing to be done with it, to get away, and lie down to rest somewhere where we could see our danger and breathe. Archie shouted:--"Gi'e me room!" [...] We crouched behind him, guarding our heads, and he struck time after time in the joint of planks. They cracked. Suddenly the crowbar went halfway in through a splintered oblong hole. It must have missed Jimmy's head by less than an inch. Archie withdrew it quickly, and that infamous nigger rushed at the hole, put his lips to it, and whispered [...] "Help" [...] in an almost extinct voice; he pressed his head to it, trying madly to get out through that opening one inch wide and three inches long. In our disturbed state we were absolutely paralysed by his incredible action. It seemed impossible to drive him away. Even Archie at last lost his composure. [...] "If ye don't clear oot I'll drive the crowbar thro' your head," [...] he shouted in a determined voice. He meant what he said, and his earnestness seemed to make an impression on Jimmy. He disappeared suddenly, and we set to prising and tearing at the planks with the eagerness of men trying to get at a mortal enemy, and spurred by the desire to tear him limb from limb. The <b>wood</b> <b>split,</b> cracked, gave way. Belfast plunged in head and shoulders and groped viciously. [...] "I've got 'im! Got 'im," [...] he shouted. [...] "Oh! There!... He's gone; I've got 'im!... Pull at my legs!... Pull!" [...] Wamibo hooted unceasingly. The boatswain shouted directions:--"Catch hold of his hair, Belfast; pull straight up, you two!... Pull fair!" [...] We pulled fair. We pulled Belfast out with a jerk, and dropped him with disgust. In a sitting posture, purple-faced, he sobbed despairingly:--"How can I hold on to 'is blooming short wool?" [...] Suddenly Jimmy's head and shoulders appeared. He stuck halfway, and with rolling eyes foamed at our feet. We flew at him with brutal impatience, we tore the shirt off his back, we tugged at his ears, we panted over him; and all at once he came away in our hands as though somebody had let go his legs. With the same movement, without a pause, we swung him up. His breath whistled, he kicked our upturned faces, he grasped two pairs of arms above his head, and he squirmed up with such precipitation that he seemed positively to escape from our hands like a bladder full of gas. Streaming with perspiration, we swarmed up the rope, and, coming into the blast of cold wind, gasped like men plunged into icy water. With burning faces we shivered to the very marrow of our bones. Never before had the gale seemed to us more furious, the sea more mad, the sunshine more merciless and mocking, and the position of the ship more hopeless and appalling. Every movement of her was ominous of the end of her agony and of the beginning of ours. We staggered away from the door, and, alarmed by a sudden roll, fell down in a bunch. It appeared to us that the side of the house was more smooth than glass and more slippery than ice. There was nothing to hang on to but a long brass hook used sometimes to keep back an open door. Wamibo held on to it and we held on to Wamibo, clutching our Jimmy. He had completely collapsed now. He did not seem to have the strength to close his hand. We stuck to him blindly in our fear. We were not afraid of Wamibo letting go (we remembered that the brute was stronger than any three men in the ship), but we were afraid of the hook giving way, and we also believed that the ship had made up her mind to turn over at last. But she didn't. A sea swept over us. The boatswain spluttered:--"Up and away. There's a lull. Away aft with you, or we will all go to the devil here." [...] We stood up surrounding Jimmy. We begged him to hold up, to hold on, at least. He glared with his bulging eyes, mute as a fish, and with all the stiffening knocked out of him. He wouldn't stand; he wouldn't even as much as clutch at our necks; he was only a cold black skin loosely stuffed with soft cotton wool; his arms and legs swung jointless and pliable; his head rolled about; the lower lip hung down, enormous and heavy. We pressed round him, bothered and dismayed; sheltering him we swung here and there in a body; and on the very brink of eternity we tottered all together with concealing and absurd gestures, like a lot of drunken men embarrassed with a stolen corpse.|$|E

40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) {{was used}} to study the distribution of elements and main wood components (cellulose and lignin) within the wood and at the bark/wood interface of a living hybrid aspen stem. The hybrid aspen was grown upright in a greenhouse and then tilted at similar to 45 degrees to induce tension wood formation and upright bending of the stem. The wood between the pith and the bark on the upper side of the tilted stem was analysed. Changes in the middle lamella/S 1 layer chemical composition, which corresponded to the transition from normal wood produced during upright stem growth to tension wood produced upon stem tilting, were observed. Such changes {{were related to the}} lower lignin and higher cellulose/hemicellulose contents in the tension wood. A non-uniform radial distribution of nitrogen (amino acids, proteins) within the stem was also noted. At the bark/wood interface the presence of inorganic elements (Ca, K and P) and a significant increase in nitrogen were found. The opposite wood side of the tree was enriched in lignin and fatty acids.

40|$|Autor razmatra kiparsko djelo Slavomira Drinkovića od njegovih početaka 80 -ih godina do današnjih dana u okviru tzv. druge skulpture i kroz samostalan razvoj, koji ga u domaćoj skulpturi izdvaja po naročitom senzibilitetu za gromadnost materije, njezinu tektoničnost i taktilnost, odnos glatkog i hrapavog, punog i praznog, vanjskog i unutrašnjeg. Autor naglašava kako se može reći da kipar samo potiče sile djelatne u prirodi, a ne mijenja svojstva materijala u svrhu ilustriranja neke umjetničke ideje. Stoga zaključuje kako u ovome kiparstvu osobine pojedinih materijala određuju osobine kiparskih djela, koja kao da nastaju a posteriori, nakon što je materijal odabran. Autor izvodi i stilske analogije Drinkovićeva kiparstva s onim njegovih generacijskih srodnika iz "druge skulpture 2 ̆ 7; te Constantina Brancusija, arte povere i posebice s djelom njemačkoga kipara Ulricha Rückriema. With {{his first}} one-man {{exhibitions}} in 1980, Slavomir Drinković, a Zagreb-Hvar sculptor immediately claimed public interest. The critics placed him among outstanding personalities of "The Second Sculpture" trend, among structuralist sculptors who mainly emphasize material and structure, the elementary {{features of a}} sculptor 2 ̆ 7 s procedure, and the original physical aspects of the material. The artists of "The Second Sculpture" became an unavoidable fact in the renovation of Croatian sculpture in the eighties. Comparing Drinković with other representatives of the trend, the author analyzes the kinships in procedure, use of material and conceptual closeness (i. e., with Sokić, Bijelić, Rašić [...] .). At {{the same time he}} marks essential differences which separate Drinković form similar artists of the same generation, and their conceptual orientation. Drinković 2 ̆ 7 s specific feature, which makes him different from Rašić, Bijelić, and Sokić lies in his sense for "chunkiness" of the material, for its natural structure, and not so much for conceptualization and the reshaping of the material typical of the three artists just mentioned. Also, Drinković has an express interest in the rustic, in the expressive potential of the surface, for relationship between the smooth and the coarse, full and empty, inner and outer. In that his sculptural expression is more classical and comparable to those sculptors who have not lost interest in modeling, and the joy of conquering physical forces holding the material, be it wood, iron, or clay, together. "This is the interest in connections with the mass as it changes under the fingers of the artist," and for the role reacquired "by volume, mass, space, tectonics, shape, and tactile values" (M. Susovski). This was noted in connection with Driknović 2 ̆ 7 s first exhibits, and it has remained a constant feature of his art. Drinković 2 ̆ 7 s participation in breaking the resistance of the material is not overemphasized; it is reduced to puncturing and scratching, drilling and hollowing, so that the intervention may result in a "disturbance," that stone may break along its "natural line," <b>wood</b> <b>split</b> under the pressure of a metal wedge, and bricks cave in under its own weight. Furthermore, the author compares Drinković with the primordial elementary aspects of Brancusi 2 ̆ 7 s work, with some arte povera solutions, and especially with the work of the German sculptor Ulrich Rückriem. Drinković, simply, loves the materials (wood, stone, granite, steel) in their original form and rarely does he try to change and limit them in order to stress their "unnatural" aspects, or to satisfy a story. Some interventions in stone or steel may appear to be too aggressive bringing about breaks and cracks, but one should note that it is only a question of letting the materials play out their natural forces, and not of changing characteristics or uses of a material in order to illustrate some artistic idea. One may sooner say that characteristics of certain materials define the features of sculptures which come into being as if a posteriori, the material having been decided upon. Breaks, cracks, hollows are those moments which have always interested Drinković, as he sees in them a beginning of a new dynamic situation, of a new order of things, of new circumstances of disconnecting and reconnecting. This is all a result of a man 2 ̆ 7 s action, his need to leave his imprint on the material, to change it, to guide it toward a symbolic use, and, in the end, to make it one 2 ̆ 7 s own and a part of a human space...|$|E
