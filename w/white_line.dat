5|$|The {{start of}} a race {{is marked by a}} <b>white</b> <b>line</b> 5cm wide. In all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes start the same {{distance}} from the finish.|$|E
5|$|The only {{species that}} can {{potentially}} {{be confused with}} the Siberian accentor is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat. The Siberian accentor is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a <b>white</b> <b>line</b> below the black face mask.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids are easy to {{distinguish}} from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle. The fins extend about 83 to 97% of the mantle length and are 67 to 70% of the mantle length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish, a fact reflected by their scientific names. A narrow blue or <b>white</b> <b>line</b> is visible at the point of attachment of the fins to the mantle. A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet {{at the back of the}} squid.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the Bohemian waxwing {{overlaps}} those of both {{the other members of}} the genus. The cedar waxwing is smaller than the Bohemian; it has browner upperparts, a white undertail and a <b>white</b> <b>line</b> above the black eye patch. Adult cedar waxwings have a yellowish belly, and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than the Bohemian waxwing. The Japanese waxwing is easily distinguished from its relatives; it has a red terminal band to the tail, the black mask extends up the rear of the crest, and there is no yellow stripe or red tips on the wings.|$|E
5|$|Piquet, on a {{one-stop}} strategy {{after his}} poor qualifying performance, had fortuitously pitted {{immediately prior to}} the safety car's deployment and was also fuelled {{to the end of}} the race. Promoted to third place from 14th beforehand following the pit stops, he was set to take the lead once Hamilton and Heidfeld (who also had not pitted under the safety car conditions) pitted for their final stops. Further back, Vettel squeezed past Alonso at the pit exit, pushing him over the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> separating the pit lane exit from the track. Alonso complained over his radio but no action was taken against either driver. Meanwhile, Räikkönen dropped several places to 11th, having had to queue behind Massa at the second pit stops.|$|E
5|$|The circuit {{passed its}} final {{inspection}} in May 2016 with FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting declaring his satisfaction that the circuit {{would be ready}} {{in time for the}} race. The circuit attracted some criticism from drivers who highlighted a lack of run-off in some corners and the tight pit entry positioned at one of the fastest points on the circuit. Following problems with loose kerbs in free practice, changes were made in turns 6 and 12, where the kerbs were replaced by painted markings on the track. Further revisions were made to the pit entry ahead of qualifying, extending the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> denoting the entry lane to allow drivers more time to react to cars entering the pit.|$|E
50|$|Solid <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> {{are used}} to mark an {{intersection}} that a driver must stop at before entering whilst obeying all Right of Way laws. Dashed <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> {{are used to}} mark an intersection at which a driver must Give Way. Dashed <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> are also commonly used to indicate turns in intersections and to indicate intersections where a diamond turn is possible (intersections in which two cars traveling in opposite directions turn to the same direction-of-travel as each other without coming into contact).|$|R
50|$|Using {{the express}} lanes as a lone driver without a {{transponder}} during charged periods or crossing the double <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> {{will result in}} a large fine placed upon the driver. To enter and exit properly, vehicles must use an entry point without double <b>white</b> <b>lines.</b> The line rule is true even when the lane is free of charge.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 28 mm. Adults are dark purplish-grey, the forewings with a <b>white</b> postmedial <b>line</b> which is angled below the costa and runs {{into a large}} white apical patch. The veins {{between it and the}} cell are streaked with white and there are slender submarginal and marginal lines. The hindwings have two medial <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> and two indistinct fine <b>white</b> <b>lines</b> close to the margin.|$|R
5|$|The {{finish of}} a race {{is marked by a}} <b>white</b> <b>line</b> 5cm wide. The {{finishing}} position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line. Fully automatic timing systems (photo timing) {{are becoming more and more}} common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a (sprint) record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).|$|E
5|$|The use {{of black}} and <b>white</b> <b>line</b> art for the game's {{graphics}} {{was an attempt to}} differentiate it from other games and catch the interest of gamers. Implementing it presented some challenges for the design staff. The design of Qbby, the player character, came after the idea of creating boxes was established; he was designed from a functional perspective. At one point in development, while brainstorming BoxBoy!s visual style, the team had considered making Kirby the main character. It become difficult trying to make Kirby, a round character, look natural in the box-producing action, so they settled with a character that had a square-shaped body, the same as the boxes. Feet were added to Qbby so he could move and jump, and eyes were added so the player could recognise which direction he was facing. Since Qbby had a simple design, the team focussed on making his animations expressive to ensure the character was engaging and had a personality.|$|E
5|$|A smallish crake, the African crake has brown-streaked blackish upperparts, bluish-grey underparts and {{black-and-white}} barring on {{the flanks}} and belly. It has a stubby red bill, red eyes, and a <b>white</b> <b>line</b> from {{the bill to}} above the eye. It is smaller than its closest relative, the corn crake; that species is also lighter-plumaged, and has an eye stripe. The African crake has a range of calls, the most characteristic being a series of rapid grating krrr notes. It is active during the day, and is territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male has a threat display, and may fight at territory boundaries. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves built in a depression under a grass tussock or small bush. The 3–11 eggs start hatching after about 14 days, and the black, downy precocial chicks fledge after four to five weeks. The African crake feeds {{on a wide range}} of invertebrates, along with some small frogs and fish, and plant material, especially grass seeds. It may itself be eaten by large birds of prey; snakes; or mammals, including humans, and can host parasites. Although it may be displaced temporarily by the burning of grassland, or permanently by agriculture, wetland drainage or urbanisation, its large range and population mean that it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E

5|$|By lap 20, Max Verstappen, impeded by his tyre {{failure at}} the start, had moved up into twelfth {{while at the}} front, Hamilton {{extended}} his advantage over Bottas to 7.5 seconds on lap 24 with Vettel also moving closer to the Finn. After several drivers had opted to pit during the second safety car phase, most drivers at the front decided {{to come in for}} their regular pit stops starting on lap 25. Carlos Sainz crossed the <b>white</b> <b>line</b> when exiting pit lane, receiving a five-second penalty to be served at his second stop. Bottas {{was the first of the}} front runners to pit on lap 27, emerging into traffic. This allowed Sebastian Vettel to make up time by staying out longer, eventually emerging from his pit stop ahead of Bottas on lap 31. One lap later, Räikkönen made a pit stop as well, coming out just behind Bottas. Race leader Hamilton came in another lap later, retaining his lead without incident. On lap 37, Räikkönen used the Drag Reduction System (DRS) to move ahead of Bottas for fifth place, only for the Williams driver to retake the position in the next corner.|$|E
5|$|Kubica had {{problems}} when running the soft compound tyre managing seventh but {{was happy with}} his lap in the final part of qualifying. He was ahead of Massa in the faster of the two Ferrari cars. Petrov secured ninth in the slower Renault car. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Sutil was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session in eleventh; his best time of 1:27.525 was eight tenths of a second slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alonso recorded the twelfth fastest time and could not secure {{a position in the}} final session as his car touched a <b>white</b> <b>line</b> under braking on the circuit, causing his car to slide. Nevertheless, Alonso thought that the error did not cost him time. He was followed by Pedro de la Rosa in the other Sauber car in 13th, who in turn, was ahead of Sébastien Buemi for Torro Rosso and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello. This formation continued on the eighth row of the grid, which was occupied by Jaime Alguersuari in the second Torro Rosso and Nico Hülkenberg in the other Williams. Vitantonio Liuzzi failed to move beyond the first session; the Force India driver qualified in 18th. The Lotus cars of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli lined up in 19th and 20th respectively. Timo Glock and Bruno Senna lined up on the eleventh row of the grid, with their teammates Lucas di Grassi and Karun Chandhok qualifying {{at the rear of the}} field.|$|E
5|$|Rain hit {{the circuit}} on Saturday afternoon, ending {{three hours before}} the session started, {{resulting}} in several damp patches on the circuit though the air temperature remained hot. Different sections of the circuit dried out at different rates {{making it difficult for}} drivers to tell precisely how wet or dry certain corners were. The teams ran intermediate tyres before switching to the super-soft tyre as the session progressed. Some drivers ran deep into turn five. Vettel was the fastest driver of the session with a time of 1:48.028 set in the last twenty minutes of the one-hour period. The time was four-tenths faster than championship rival Alonso. Hamilton was third fastest, two-thousandths of a second in front of Massa. Rosberg was fifth, ahead of Webber and Nico Hülkenberg. Kubica, Sutil and Buemi completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Hispania Racing driver Bruno Senna's right-rear tyre got onto a <b>white</b> <b>line</b> at the Singapore Sling chicane and spun. Senna later brushed a wall entering the Esplanade Bridge in the final minute and stopped his car, causing the yellow-flags to be shown; drivers were unable to improve on their lap times because of the limited time available.|$|E

The comparison (side key) stimuli were either solid colors or <b>white</b> <b>lines.</b> The sample (center key) stimuli were either compounds (<b>white</b> <b>lines</b> on colored grounds) or elements (<b>white</b> <b>lines</b> on black grounds on some trials, and solid colors on other trials). Sample stimuli were presented for nine sample stimulus durations ranging between 0. 04 and 5. 00 sec.
