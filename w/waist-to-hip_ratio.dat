25|$|Males {{who are in}} a {{committed}} relationship, in other words have a restricted sociosexual orientation, will have different sexual strategies compared to males who have an unrestricted sociosexual orientation. Males with a restricted sociosexual orientation will be less willing to have sex outside of their committed relationship, and adjust their strategies according to their desire for commitment and emotional closeness with their partner. It has been found that such males are less likely to approach attractive females who have greater waist-to-hip ratios (0.68-0.72). It has been found that a greater <b>waist-to-hip</b> <b>ratio,</b> the ideal being 0.7, is associated with youthfulness, physical attractiveness and reproductive potential. Therefore, such females would be viewed as a risk to the male’s current sexual partner. Consequently, males will adjust their sexual strategies by showing less willingness to approach such females.|$|E
500|$|Obesity {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{preventable}} causes of death worldwide. A number of reviews have found that mortality risk is lowest at a BMI of 20–25kg/m2 in non-smokers and at 24–27kg/m2 in current smokers, with risk increasing along with changes in either direction. This appears to apply in at least four continents. In contrast, a 2013 review found that grade 1 obesity (BMI 30-35) was not associated with higher mortality than normal weight, and that overweight (BMI 25-30) was associated with [...] "lower" [...] mortality than was normal weight (BMI 18.5-25). Other evidence suggests that the association of BMI and waist circumference with mortality is U- or J-shaped, while the association between <b>waist-to-hip</b> <b>ratio</b> and waist-to-height ratio with mortality is more positive. In Asians the risk of negative health effects begins to increase between 22–25kg/m2. A BMI above 32kg/m2 has been associated with a doubled mortality rate among women over a 16-year period. In the United States, obesity is estimated to cause 111,909 to 365,000 deaths per year, while 1 million (7.7%) of deaths in Europe are attributed to excess weight. [...] On average, obesity reduces life expectancy by six to sevenyears, a BMI of 30–35kg/m2 reduces life expectancy by two to fouryears, while severe obesity (BMI>40kg/m2) reduces life expectancy by tenyears.|$|E

40|$|Type 2 DM in Indonesia {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of non-communicable diseases, or about 2, 1 % of all deaths. Lack of {{participation}} in disease therapy can be the reason of poor outcome in patients, so they need self-management education and support to prevent acute complications and to reduce the risk of long-term complications. The aim of the present study was to determine HbA 1 c and BMI (body mass index) and <b>waist-to-hip</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> as the impact of the health education program. The design was an experimental study. Design used was the one-group pretest-posttest design. In the design of the test was done by comparing the results of one group were given health education before (pretest) and after the time given health education and 3 month after education (postest), and using nonprobability sampling with purposive sampling method. The health education program was given to the subject for 4 weeks. The research was initiated in May 2013, which involved 31 patients. Results showed significant differences in the HbA 1 c (z[*]=[*] 2. 357. p[*]=[*] 0. 018), BMI (t[*]=[*] 5, 247 p[*]=[*] 0. 000), and <b>waist-to-hip</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> (t[*]=[*] 4, 146 p[*]=[*] 0. 000). The regression results of BMI with HbA 1 C (t[*]=[*] 0206 p[*]=[*] 0. 053) and <b>waist-to-hip</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> with HbA 1 C (t[*]=[*] 1. 692 p[*]=[*] 0305) showed no significant. Effective contribution <b>waist-to-hip</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> and BMI on HbA 1 c is very small at only 1 % for BMI predictor and 10 % for <b>waist-to-hip</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> predictor. HbA 1 c and BMI (body mass index) and <b>waist-to-hip</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> can be improved by providing health education in patients with type 2 diabetes, although further research on the length of follow-up is still needed...|$|R

50|$|Many studies {{indicate}} that WHR correlates with female fertility, leading some to speculate that its use as a sexual selection cue by men has an evolutionary basis. However it is also suggested that the evident relationships between WHR-influencing hormones and survival-relevant traits such as competitiveness and stress tolerance may give a preference for higher waist-hip-ratios its own evolutionary benefit.

40|$|The {{claim that}} men prefer women with low <b>waist-to-hip</b> <b>ratios</b> (WHR) has been vigorously disputed. We examine self-report data from 359 {{primiparous}} Polish women (with normal singleton births and healthy infants) {{and show that}} WHR correlates {{with at least one}} component of a woman's biological fitness (her first child's birth weight, a variable that significantly affects infant survival rates). However, a woman's Body Mass Index (BMI) is a better predictor of her child's neonatal weight in small-bodied women (< 54 kg). The failure to find a preference for low WHR in some traditional populations may thus be a consequence of the fact that, even in western populations, body mass is a better predictor of fitness in those cases characterized by low maternal body weight...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{proposition}} that universal standards of female beauty reflect adaptations for reproductive value assessment {{does not preclude}} cross-cultural variation that is contingent on local environmental variation. Cross-cultural tests of the hypothesis that men have adaptations generating preference for low female <b>waist-to-hip</b> <b>ratios</b> (WHR) have used stimuli that were not scaled to local conditions, and have confounded WHR with level of body fat. I present a reassessment of the WHR hypothesis, showing that when effects of WHR and body weight are less confounded, and local environmental context is taken into account, it appears that Shiwiar forager–horticulturist men of Ecuadorian Amazonia may use both WHR and body weight in assessments of female sexual attractiveness {{in a manner consistent}} with the prediction of a context-sensitive preference psychology.

For all three conditions, the S+ was an intermediate value. Under both discrimination training conditions, the generalization gradient was observed to shift away from the S– and toward extreme values on {{the opposite end of}} the dimension; under the control condition, the gradient was more closely centered on the S+.

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that men in Western {{societies}} are attracted to low female <b>waist-to-hip</b> <b>ratios</b> (WHR). Several explanations of this preference rely {{on the importance of}} visual input {{for the development of the}} preference, including explanations stressing the role of visual media. We report evidence showing that congenitally blind men, without previous visual experience, exhibit a preference for low female WHRs when assessing female body shapes through touch, as do their sighted counterparts. This finding shows that a preference for low WHR can develop in the complete absence of visual input and, hence, that such input is not necessary for the preference to develop. However, the strength of the preference was greater for the sighted than the blind men, suggesting that visual input might play a role in reinforcing the preference. These results have implications for debates concerning the evolutionary and developmental origins of human mate preferences, in particular, regarding the role of visual media in shaping such preferences...|$|R
