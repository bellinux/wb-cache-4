5000|$|Supercell thunderstorms, other {{powerful}} storms, {{and strong}} winds are seen with major <b>whirlwinds.</b> Wind storms are commonly seen with minor <b>whirlwinds.</b> Also, small, semi-powerful [...] "wind blasts" [...] {{may be seen}} before some minor <b>whirlwinds,</b> which can come from a wind storm. These wind blasts can start to rotate and form minor <b>whirlwinds.</b> Winds from other small storms (such as rain storms and local thunderstorms) can cause minor <b>whirlwinds</b> to form. Like major <b>whirlwinds,</b> these minor <b>whirlwinds</b> can also be dangerous at times.|$|R
50|$|<b>Whirlwinds</b> are {{subdivided}} into two main types, the great (or major) <b>whirlwinds</b> and the lesser (or minor) <b>whirlwinds.</b> The first category includes tornadoes, waterspouts, and landspouts. The range of atmospheric vortices constitute a continuum and {{are difficult to}} categorize definitively. Some lesser <b>whirlwinds</b> may sometimes form {{in a similar manner}} to greater <b>whirlwinds</b> with related increase in intensity. These intermediate types include the gustnado and the fire whirl. Other lesser <b>whirlwinds</b> include dust devils, as well as steam devils, snow devils, debris devils, leaf devils, and shear eddies such as the mountainado and eddy <b>whirlwinds.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived <b>whirlwind,</b> ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to {{pose a threat to}} both people and property.|$|E
5|$|Saville and Fairchild went to Congress in 1950, and {{obtained}} $114million {{for the development}} of an electronic computer-based air defense system, a project headed by George E. Valley Jr, who was a physicist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The computer, named <b>Whirlwind,</b> helped the USAF develop the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system.|$|E
5|$|The second {{significant}} HV offensive was Operation <b>Whirlwind,</b> launched {{across the}} Kupa River on 11 December. The HV was tasked with advancing towards Glina but the operation failed after a shallow bridgehead was established within two days. In Lika, battles were fought for individual villages but little {{progress was made}} by either side. The JNA captured four villages south of Osijek between 21 November and 16 December but the front lines generally became static.|$|E
2500|$|... 137 Squadron's worst losses {{occurred}} on 12 February 1942 during the Channel Dash, {{when they were}} sent to escort five British destroyers, unaware of the escaping German warships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. Four <b>Whirlwinds</b> took off at 13:10 hours and soon sighted warships through the clouds about [...] from the Belgian coast. They descended to investigate and were immediately jumped by about 20 Bf 109s of Jagdgeschwader 2. The <b>Whirlwinds</b> shot at anything in their sights, but were heavily outnumbered. While this was happening, at 13:40, two more <b>Whirlwinds</b> were sent up to relieve the first four and two more <b>Whirlwinds</b> took off at 14:25; four of the eight <b>Whirlwinds</b> failed to return.|$|R
50|$|Another, non-league team {{called the}} Boston <b>Whirlwinds</b> was extant {{in the early}} 1950s. These <b>Whirlwinds,</b> who {{featured}} Norm Baker, traveled with, and acted as a foil for, the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|R
6000|$|Such are {{the usual}} {{appearances}} {{and actions of}} waterspouts. They are not, however, properly named, being simply <b>whirlwinds</b> at sea, instead of <b>whirlwinds</b> on land. Professor Oersted suggests the name [...] "storm-pillar," [...] as being a more appropriate term.|$|R
5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} <b>whirlwind)</b> resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{returns to}} London, {{and after a}} brief {{argument}} with M at the British Secret Service headquarters, heads for Draco's birthday party in Portugal. There, Bond and Tracy begin a <b>whirlwind</b> romance, and Draco directs the agent to a law firm in Bern, Switzerland. Bond investigates the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold, and learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, attempting to claim the title 'Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp'.|$|E
5|$|Paul marries Terry Inglis after a <b>whirlwind</b> relationship. However, Terry shoots Paul when {{he finds}} out she killed her ex-boyfriend and she goes on the run. Terry is {{eventually}} arrested and later commits suicide in prison. Paul meets Gail Lewis for the second time, having worked with her previously, when she applies for {{a job at the}} Daniels Corporation. They both agree to enter into a marriage of convenience in order to secure a business agreement, but soon develop genuine feelings for each other and they renew their vows. That same year Paul learns that he has fathered a child, Amy (Nicolette Minster; Sheridan Compagnino), with Nina Williams (Leigh Morgan).|$|E
50|$|In late December, Marlo Saunders of the West Texas <b>Whirlwinds</b> surpassed 1,000 points scored and 500 {{rebounds in}} his short two-year {{career in the}} ABA, joining {{teammates}} Ray Williams and Charncy Ephriam as the only <b>Whirlwinds</b> to accomplish the feat.|$|R
50|$|The film {{takes its}} title from {{a line in}} the popular Polish revolutionary song <b>Whirlwinds</b> of Danger (Warszawianka, To The Barricades, Hostile <b>Whirlwinds</b> hover above us.../«Вихри враждебные реют над нами...») and the Russian {{translation}} of it made by Gleb Krzhizhanovsky.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Air Force Search and Rescue Force used <b>Whirlwinds</b> {{painted in}} overall yellow for rescuing people in {{distress}} around {{the coast of}} the United Kingdom.

5|$|Set in London, England, Jab Tak Hai Jaan {{tells the}} story of Akira Rai (Anushka Sharma), an ambitious, hardworking intern at the Discovery Channel. She finds the diary of Samar Anand (Shah Rukh Khan), a bomb-disposal expert. The diary recounts his time as a {{struggling}} immigrant in London, and later details his <b>whirlwind</b> romance with Meera Thapar (Katrina Kaif). The film was released during the six-day Diwali weekend beginning on 13 November 2012. Jab Tak Hai Jaan emerged as the third-highest-grossing Bollywood film overseas at that time, after 3 Idiots and My Name Is Khan (2010).|$|E
5|$|The Croatian Serb TO and JNA defences {{immediately}} west of {{the city}} of Sisak and north of Glina were positioned along the right (southern) bank of the Kupa River, largely consisting of the JNA 592nd and the 622nd Mechanised Brigades. On the opposite bank, the HV 100th Infantry Brigade held positions west of Sisak, flanked by the 145th Infantry Brigade to its right, and the 10th brigade of the Croatian TO further to the west. The planned main axis of the Operation <b>Whirlwind</b> extended across the 592nd Mechanised Brigade AOR, commanded by Colonel Boško Džombić.|$|E
5|$|The four-day <b>whirlwind</b> {{trip was}} {{launched}} on September 6, 1963, {{the same day}} as a National Security Council (NSC) meeting, and came in the wake of increasingly strained relations between the United States and South Vietnam. Civil unrest gripped South Vietnam as Buddhist demonstrations against the religious discrimination of President Ngô Đình Diệm's Catholic regime escalated. Following the raids on Buddhist pagodas on August 21 that left a death toll ranging up to a few hundred, the US authorized investigations into a possible coup through a cable to US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|$|E
2500|$|Their first {{recorded}} collaboration was in 1964, when Gouldman's band The <b>Whirlwinds</b> recorded the Lol Creme composition, [...] "Baby Not Like You", as the B-side of their only single. The <b>Whirlwinds</b> then changed members and name, becoming The Mockingbirds (including singer-guitarist Gouldman, bassist Bernard Basso and drummer Kevin Godley, formerly of The Sabres with Creme). The Mockingbirds recorded five singles in 1965–66 without any success, before dissolving. The guitarist in both The <b>Whirlwinds</b> and The Mockingbirds was Stephen Jacobson, brother of well-known writer Howard Jacobson.|$|R

5|$|A {{dedicated}} {{search and}} rescue (SAR) version, the HAR3, was developed for the RAF Search and Rescue Force. The type entered service in 1978 to replace the Westland <b>Whirlwind</b> HAR.10. A 16th helicopter was ordered shortly after, and following the Falklands War of 1982, three more examples were purchased to enable operation of a SAR flight in the islands, initially from Navy Point {{on the north side}} of Stanley harbour, and later from RAF Mount Pleasant. In 1992, six further helicopters were ordered to replace the last remaining Westland Wessex helicopters in the SAR role, entering service in 1996. The six Sea King HAR3As featured updated systems, including a digital navigation system and more modern avionics.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the month, the Serb {{rebels and}} the JNA {{controlled}} nearly all of the southern bank of the river, and the lines of control in the region largely stabilised. Before the ceasefire of 3 January 1992, which implemented the Vance plan, the Serb rebels and the JNA made two more unsuccessful attempts to push back the Croatian forces in the region. These attacks comprised the autumn campaign undertaken by the JNA—in the area of Slana and Novi Farkašić on 17–18 October and in the area of Sunja on 2 November. In the same period, the ZNG launched an unsuccessful offensive codenamed Operation <b>Whirlwind</b> to recapture Glina on 11–13 December. The 120 Croats who remained in the area of Dubica faced persecution, culminating in the Baćin massacre of more than 50 Croats on 21 October, and the rounding up and expulsion of the remainder on 20 November.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen had {{continued}} their journey to Norway while Scharnhorst was immobilized. At 14:45, the ships {{were attacked by}} five <b>Whirlwind</b> fighter-bombers—German fighters beat them back. Several more air attacks followed {{over the next two}} hours, though without success for the British. At 16:17, five British destroyers attempted to torpedo the German ships, but heavy fire from Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen mauled one and forced the others to turn away. Near Terschelling, Gneisenau struck a mine that did minor damage to the hull, though the explosive shock damaged one of her three turbines. Her captain ordered the ship to stop while temporary repairs were conducted, which lasted for about 30minutes. By 03:50 on 13February, the ship had reached Helgoland.|$|E

5|$|In August 1939, Ljotić's cousin, Milan Nedić, was {{appointed}} Yugoslav Minister of Defense. Later that year, almost all Zbor publications, including Otadžbina, Buđenje, Zbor, Naš put (Our Path) and Vihor (<b>Whirlwind),</b> were prohibited. Ljotić exploited the connections {{he had with}} Nedić {{to ensure that the}} banned Zbor-published journal Bilten (Bulletin) was distributed to members of the Royal Yugoslav Army. The journal was published illegally in a military printing house and distributed throughout the country by military couriers. Ljotić was the journal's main contributor and editor-in-chief. Fifty-eight issues of Bilten were published from March 1939 until October 1940, in which Ljotić advocated a pro-Axis Yugoslav foreign policy and criticized Belgrade's tolerance of Jews. As many as 20,000 copies each were printed of later issues of the journal. Ljotić was particularly pleased with being able to exert his ideological influence over young military academy trainees as well as older officers.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1954, 706 Squadron, a second-line unit, flew aboard {{to conduct}} {{trials of the}} anti-submarine version of the <b>Whirlwind</b> helicopter. They were {{successful}} enough that the squadron was redesignated as 845 Squadron afterwards and Perseus ferried them to Malta in April. The ship continued on to deliver relief supplies to Singapore intended for Korea and was reduced to reserve again upon her return on 12 July. The Admiralty intended to convert her to a submarine depot ship and she was towed to Belfast to begin work in 1955. The cutbacks from the 1957 Defence White Paper caused the conversion to be cancelled and the ship was towed to Gare Loch to await a decision on the ship's disposition. Perseus sold for scrap in May 1958 and towed to Port Glasgow to begin demolition.|$|E
5|$|Hodalj {{praised the}} Sisak OG command for {{managing}} {{to keep the}} operation a secret until it was launched, making sure it would surprise the JNA. The secrecy {{was reflected in the}} apparent last-minute rerouting of the 102nd Infantry Brigade to the offensive, although the Zagreb Operational Zone deployed it to Sunja, to the east of Sisak. Still, the Sisak OG failed to prepare detailed river crossing plans, or even issue maps and written brigade-level commands for the crossingsrelying on oral commands instead. Likewise, the troops were not equipped to endure the cold weather in the open, limiting their effectiveness. Hodalj concluded that the offensive exceeded needs and capabilities of the Sisak OG. Even though the 1991 HV investigation concluded that the offensive was prepared for ten days and was approved by Zagreb Operational Zone command, there are no documents pertaining to the preparations other than those issued by the Sisak OG itself. Regardless of the poor preparation of the offensive, the 102nd Infantry Brigade was subject to public criticism in Croatia for fleeing the battlefield in the aftermath of Operation <b>Whirlwind.</b>|$|E
