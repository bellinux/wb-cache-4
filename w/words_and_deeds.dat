5|$|According to the {{theology}} of Twelvers, the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret sharia and the esoteric meaning of the Quran. Muhammad and Imams' <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeds</b> are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ismah, or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through the Prophet.|$|E

25|$|For Shi'is, the <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeds</b> {{of their}} Imams, {{who are also}} progeny of Muhammad, is authoritative. These were {{originally}} oral but were written down after several generations. Some of these sayings, according to their chain of transmission, are sayings of Muhammad as transmitted through the Shi'i' Imams.|$|E
25|$|But {{with the}} {{exception}} of the Book of Arda Wiraz, the dews are not generally described as a force to be feared. With fundamental optimism, the texts describe how the dews may be kept in check, ranging from cursing them to the active participation in life through good thoughts, <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeds.</b> Many of the medieval texts develop ideas already expressed in the Vendidad ("given against the demons").|$|E
25|$|Later {{most of the}} Shia, {{including}} Twelver and Ismaili, became Imamis. Imami Shia {{believe that}} Imams are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad.

25|$|Her <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeds</b> were {{recorded}} in the Guta raJehovah Bible by her followers, who numbered at least 60,000 people and were drawn largely {{from the ranks of}} the poor and uneducated. This Bible was seen as supplanting the New Testament, and depicts Mai Chaza {{as a member of the}} Trinity. Women who were unable to conceive travelled to her church so that they could be touched by Mai Chaza, in the hope of being able to have a successful pregnancy. Individuals regarded as possessed by demons would fall to the floor and acknowledge the authority of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
25|$|Hadith are Muslim traditions {{relating}} to the Sunnah (<b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeds)</b> of Muhammad. They are drawn from the writings of scholars writing between 844 and 874 CE, more than 200 years {{after the death of}} Mohammed in 632 CE. Within Islam, different schools and sects have different opinions on the proper selection and use of Hadith. The four schools of Sunni Islam all consider Hadith second only to the Quran, although they differ on how much freedom of interpretation should be allowed to legal scholars. Shi'i scholars disagree with Sunni scholars as to which Hadith should be considered reliable. The Shi'as accept the Sunnah of Ali and the Imams as authoritative in addition to the Sunnah of Muhammad, and as a consequence they maintain their own, different, collections of Hadith.|$|E
25|$|The Twelve Imams are {{the spiritual}} and {{political}} successors to Muhammad for the Twelvers. According to the theology of Twelvers, the successor of Muhammad is an infallible human individual who not only rules over the community with justice but also is able to keep and interpret the divine law and its esoteric meaning. The <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeds</b> of Muhammad and the imams are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and Imams must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through Muhammad. Each imam {{was the son of}} the previous imam, with the exception of Hussein ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive and in occultation.|$|E

25|$|The Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian {{account of}} {{creation}} {{completed in the}} 12th century has {{much to say about}} Ahriman and his role in the cosmogony. In chapter 1.23, following the recitation of the Ahuna Vairya, Ohrmuzd takes advantage of Ahriman's incapacity to create life without intervention. When Ahriman recovers, he creates Jeh, the primal whore who afflicts women with their menstrual cycles. In Bundahishn 4.12, Ahriman perceives that Ohrmuzd is superior to himself, and so flees to fashion his many demons with which to conquer the universe in battle. The entire universe is finally divided between the Ohrmuzd and the yazads on one side and Ahriman with his devs on the other. Ahriman slays the primal bull, but the moon rescues the seed of the dying creature, and from it springs all animal creation. But the battle goes on, with mankind caught in the middle, whose duty it remains to withstand the forces of evil through good thoughts, <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeds.</b>|$|E
500|$|Catholic belief {{holds that}} the Church [...] "is the {{continuing}} presence of Jesus on earth" [...] and that it alone possesses the full means of salvation. Through the passion (suffering) of Christ leading to his crucifixion {{as described in the}} Gospels, it is said Christ made himself an oblation to God the Father in order to reconcile humanity to God; the Resurrection of Jesus makes him the firstborn from the dead, the first among many brethren. By reconciling with God and following Christ's <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeds,</b> an individual can enter the Kingdom of God. The Church sees its liturgy and sacraments as perpetuating the graces achieved through Christ's sacrifice to strengthen a person's relationship with Christ and aid in overcoming sin.|$|E
500|$|John Roebling was a {{contrasting}} {{character to}} Charles Ellet. [...] Whereas Ellet embellished his proposals with fanciful <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>deeds,</b> Roebling presented papers filled with meticulous calculations and drawings. [...] The elder engineer was stern and driven to achieve, taking a scientific approach to all interests. [...] Rarely did he show emotions in his dealings, even to his closest associates. [...] The man, however, dared to confront his detractors and make bold exaltations about his work. [...] He openly called European suspension bridges—including American suspension bridges built with European techniques—weak, and occasionally sniped at Ellet's and Stephenson's works. [...] He announced that his Brooklyn Bridge, when completed, [...] "will {{not only be}} the greatest bridge in existence, {{but it will be}} the greatest engineering work of this continent, and of the age." [...] Roebling's history with Ellet started before the bidding for the Niagara Suspension Bridge, early in their careers. [...] During the bidding for the Schuylkill Suspension Bridge project, Ellet had written a proposal that was published in the American Railroad Journal. [...] Mistakenly believing Ellet had won the contract, Roebling wrote to offer his congratulations and requested to be Ellet's assistant. [...] He received a formal reply without any reference to his request, and his subsequent letter was ignored. [...] When Roebling learned that a contractor had won the bid, he successfully applied to be the contractor's chief engineer. [...] Ellet, however, persisted with his tactics and snatched the project away from the contractor; he promoted himself to the bridge company and offered to accept land instead of cash as payment. [...] From then on, Ellet and Roebling became rivals, vying with each other for suspension bridge projects in North America. [...] Roebling learned from their rivalry. [...] His losses to Ellet showed him that he needed to promote himself and gain backers to effectively secure the contracts he desired.|$|E
