The relative SPD curves provided by many manufacturers may have been produced using 10nm increments or more on their spectroradiometer. The result is what <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> smoother ("fuller spectrum") power distribution than the lamp actually has. Owing to their spiky distribution, much finer increments are advisable for taking measurements of fluorescent lights, and this requires more expensive equipment.|$|E
25|$|Some {{persons have}} a {{disorder}} of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, {{as well as}} persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients {{who are able to}} perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to decide whether they want to live.|$|E

2500|$|The D/L {{method has}} been criticized {{on the grounds that}} wickets are a much more heavily {{weighted}} resource than overs, leading to the suggestion that if teams are chasing big targets, and there is the prospect of rain, a winning strategy could be to not lose wickets and score at what <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "losing" [...] rate (e.g. if the required rate was 6.1, it could be enough to score at 4.75 an over for the first 20–25 overs).

2500|$|The Hebrew word Halleluya as an {{expression}} of praise to God was preserved, untranslated, by the Early Christians as a superlative expression of thanksgiving, joy, and triumph. Thus it appears in the ancient Greek Liturgy of St. James, which is still used to this day by the Patriarch of Jerusalem and, in its Syriac recension is the prototype of that used by the Maronites. In the , apparently the most ancient of all, we find this rubric: [...] "Then follow Let us attend, the Apostle, and the Prologue of the Alleluia."—the [...] "Apostle" [...] is the usual ancient Eastern title for the Epistle reading, and the [...] "Prologue of the Alleluia" [...] <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> prayer or verse before Alleluia was sung by the choir.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the purest}} Coasian {{solutions}} {{today is the}} new phenomenon of Internet crowdfunding. Here rules are enforced by computer algorithms and legal contracts {{as well as social}} pressure. [...] For example, on the Kickstarter site, each funder authorizes a credit card purchase to buy a new product or receive other promised benefits, but no money changes hands until the funding goal is met. [...] Because automation and the Internet so reduce the transaction costs for pooling resources, project goals of only a few hundred dollars are frequently crowdfunded, far below the costs of soliciting traditional investors. [...] Other crowdfunded projects have raised over a million dollars, like the Arkyd-100 space satellite telescope funded on Kickstarter in June 2013. [...] It <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> clear instance of a Coase solution when a public good that always required government sponsorship in the 20th century can be efficiently organized from 18,000 individuals' self-interest (including rewards such as an orbital [...] "selfie", and five minutes of observation time donated in their name to find potential killer asteroids).|$|E
2500|$|The Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1152–1190) {{created a}} Reichsvogtei (roughly [...] "Imperial Bailiwick"), and in 1180 put Wetzlar's {{citizens}} {{on the same}} level as Frankfurt's. Wetzlar became a Free Imperial City and kept this distinction until 1803. For the town's protection, and to secure the Wetterau as an Imperial Province, he expanded high above Wetzlar the Imperial Castle (Reichsburg), which had most likely already stood {{in one form or another}} before then. The origin of the name [...] "Reichsburg Kalsmunt" [...] is not quite clear. The following explanation cannot be ruled out: Kals- = Karls and munt ≈ vassal, that is, a liege of the Frankish court. Thus it <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> case of a building work from Charlemagne's time ("Charlemagne" [...] is [...] "Karl der Große" [...] – [...] "Charles the Great" [...] (740s–814) – in German). Imperial coinage was struck at Kalsmunt. The commercial road, which crossed the Lahn at Wetzlar, the town's iron production, to which the Iron Market (forum ferri) still bears witness, the wool weaving mill and tanning seemed a good basis on which to develop the town further.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, as Jaffe himself {{notes in}} his paper, [...] "no one has shown that source theory or another S-matrix based {{approach}} can provide a complete description of QED to all orders." [...] Furthermore, Milonni has shown the necessity of the vacuum field for the formal consistency of QED. In QCD, color confinement has led physicists to abandon the source theory or S-matrix based approach for the strong interactions. The Higgs mechanism, Hawking Radiation and the Unruh effect are also theorized {{to be dependent on}} zero-point vacuum fluctuations, the field contribution being an inseparable parts of these theories. Jaffe continues [...] "Even if one could argue away zero-point contributions to the quantum vacuum energy, the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking remains: condensates [...] that carry energy appear at many energy scales in the Standard Model. So {{there is good reason to}} be skeptical of attempts to avoid the standard formulation of quantum field theory and the zero-point energies it brings with it." [...] It is difficult to judge the physical reality of infinite zero-point energies that are inherent in field theories, but modern physics does not know any better way to construct gauge-invariant, renormalizable theories than with zero-point energy and they <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> necessity for any attempt at a unified theory.|$|E

2500|$|Selection of the Australian team <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> simple {{process as}} eight {{of its members}} were highly talented cricketers who almost picked themselves; Lindsay Hassett, Arthur Morris, Neil Harvey, Don Tallon, Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Ian Johnson, and Bill Johnston. Don Tallon {{replaced}} Ron Saggers who had kept wicket on the tour of South Africa in 1949–50, which Tallon had missed. Ray Lindwall had been dropped for the last Test in South Africa, his form suffering {{from a series of}} ailments, but was recalled to the team to replace Geff Noblet. Batsmen Jack Moroney and Sam Loxton kept their places, but leg-spinner Colin McCool was replaced by the 35-year-old debutant mystery spinner Jack Iverson. The task for the England tour selectors was not quite so easy. The managers Brigadier Michael Green and John Nash, captain Freddie Brown, vice-captain Denis Compton and senior professional Len Hutton kept most of the team from the Fourth and final Test against the West Indies in 1950. This was not the best recommendation as they had lost the series 3–1 and the last Test by an innings even though Hutton carried his bat for 202 out of 344. Freddie Brown, Denis Compton, Len Hutton, Reg Simpson, John Dewes, Trevor Bailey, Arthur McIntyre, Alec Bedser, Doug Wright all stayed, but the young opener David Sheppard was replaced by veteran Cyril Washbrook and Godfrey Evans returned as wicket-keeper. Apart from Hutton, Washbrook, Compton and Simpson the batsmen were not in fine form. Dewes was chosen after he had made a gritty 117 against Queensland in the last tour match before the Test. The reserve wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre was in the team for his batting and as Brown's Cows were desperately short of good fielders and McIntyre had a good throwing arm. While the crowd was waiting for the captains to come out and toss a dapper little man came out and inspected the pitch and he passed by the spectators completely unnoticed. It was the Test selector Sir Donald Bradman, such is fame. Keith Miller had recently made a slow 201 not out against Queensland on the flat Woolloongabba pitch and predicted that the Test would be [...] "the dullest in history". Lindsay Hassett won the toss (as he would 9 times out of 10 in Ashes Tests) and although the Woolloongabba Ground had a reputation as [...] "result" [...] wicket it looked plumb and he batted without hesitation.|$|E
