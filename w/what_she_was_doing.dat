She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn on the bedroom light so she could read properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> sleeping with an older man, {{and yet there is}} something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E

5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E

Her second video, also for Max-A, was Don't Close Your Eyes and Hayasaka said that it was particularly hard for her, bringing her to tears, because she had little experience with adult toys.

25|$|Back in {{the present}} time, Jean is being helped by the nurse Marjorie on trying to recall her name. Marjorie starts {{speaking}} name after name and would not stop even though Jean asked her to. Jean became confused and not realizing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> lost control of her telekinetic powers. This caught Emma Frost's attention when it registered on Cerebro and went {{to pick her up}} with Cyclops. Meanwhile, Jean is being chased by the MRD in the hospital and, once cornered, ratted out by Marjorie, she unintentionally manifested her enormously powerful Phoenix abilities in the heat of her fear and hopelessness, which caused an intense psionic wave that affected almost the entire city. Archangel, under Mr. Sinister's command, went to capture Jean but Cyclops and Emma intervened. They soon discovered that the reason why Jean was not in mental contact with Scott was because she had no memory of Scott. Archangel pursued them as they tried to get Jean home, Cyclops desperately fought him, but in the end both he and Jean were captured so that Sinister could take samples of their DNA for his experiments. The X-Men came to rescue them and fought the Marauders, but just as Archangel is about to kill Cyclops, Jean manifests her immensely powerful Phoenix Force abilities and defeats him. Scott was able to calm her down and take her to the Institute for rest and promised her that she would regain her memories in conjunction with Emma's help. Everyone at the institute then became unconscious, except Emma, an undercover agent of the Hellfire Club who now had Jean, and therefore the Phoenix Force itself, in their hands.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} and only time in Angelou's series, she repeats the same episode in detail—her son's {{automobile}} accident—at the end of her fourth autobiography The Heart of a Woman and the beginning of this one, a technique that both centralizes each installment and connects each book in the series with each other. [...] Additionally, each volume [...] "ends with abrupt suspense". [...] It also creates a strong and emotional link between the two autobiographies.

[...] Madonna wanted Foley to give her proper direction on set, but he preferred her to be her real self, rather than the persona in her music videos. Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's probably why it wasn't so good. In Desperately Seeking Susan, when she didn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> she was being natural and at her best." ...|$|E

The video took two-three weeks of preparation and one day to film in Los Angeles on Mount Olympus. The main set of the video was a house owned by a wealthy 95-year-old man who allowed Knowles and Matsoukas to use his house and collectible cars for the video shoot. During an interview with USA Today on January 28, 2010, Knowles announced {{that she would be}} taking a break from her music career saying [...] "to live life, to be inspired by things again".
