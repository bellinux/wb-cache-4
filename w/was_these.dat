5|$|Although {{the crisis}} of the 3rd century was not the {{absolute}} beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since {{the last days of the}} Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it <b>was</b> <b>these</b> usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.|$|E

5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It <b>was</b> <b>these</b> differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready to}} commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It <b>was</b> <b>these</b> concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E

It was once {{thought that he had}} in fact founded the Waldensians, however this was disproved in the 19th century. His epistles on 1 and 2 Corinthians, however, dedicated to Theodemir, abbot of Psalmody, and a possible student of his, were sent to Aachen by the dedicatee to be condemned by the assembled bishops of the realm. The Corinthian commentaries were unpublished, though it <b>was</b> <b>these</b> commentaries that sparked the controversy concerning icons and pilgrimages.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>these</b> restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds.

5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>these</b> 1986 Giants that popularized the {{football}} tradition of dousing {{the head coach}} with a cooler of Gatorade {{near the end of}} a victorious game. This originally started in 1985 when Jim Burt, incensed by what he thought was mistreatment he received in practice the week leading up to a game, exacted revenge on Bill Parcells by dumping a cooler of Gatorade on him after the Giants won that week's game. Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later picked up on the ploy and would often sneak up on Coach Parcells near the end of games to dump the remaining Gatorade over his head. The dousing was a big hit with fans, and the Gatorade dumping would continue on throughout the season after each win, with Taylor, Carson, and several other players (Burt had since ceased doing it) concocting increasingly elaborate, sneaky and playful ruses, so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to supply}} {{problems}} during the advance from Beersheba, Allenby maintained Philip W. Chetwode's XX Corps {{in the rear}} close to lines of communication. These troops enjoyed 10 days resting in the rear, where they were easily supplied and refitted. It <b>was</b> <b>these</b> fresh troops of XX Corps which were ordered to take over responsibility for front line operations in the Judean Hills against the defending Ottoman Seventh Army. The 60th (London) Division, commanded by Major General John Shea, arrived at Latron on 23 November from Huj and on 28 November relieved the seriously weakened infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) and 75th Divisions without much of a reduction in fighting ability. On the same day, the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, commanded by Major General E. S. Girdwood, arrived at Latron from Karm. Two days later the 10th (Irish) Division, commanded by Major General J. R. Longley, also arrived at Latron from Karm. The 53rd (Welsh) Division, with the Corps Cavalry Regiment and a heavy battery attached, remained on the Hebron road north of Beersheba, coming under direct orders from General Headquarters (GHQ); they became known as Mott's Detachment.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} stated that heavy losses in {{carriers}} and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy. Parshall and Tully {{have stated that}} the heavy losses in veteran aircrew (110, just under 25% of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers) were not crippling to the Japanese naval air corps as a whole; the Japanese navy had 2,000 carrier-qualified aircrew {{at the start of}} the Pacific war. The loss of four large fleet carriers and over 40% of the carriers' highly trained aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the essential flight-deck crews and armorers, and the loss of organizational knowledge embodied in such highly trained crews, were still heavy blows to the Japanese carrier fleet. A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and it <b>was</b> <b>these</b> battles, combined with the constant attrition of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which were the catalyst for the sharp downward spiral in operational capability.|$|E

He pounded on the door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It <b>was</b> <b>these</b> animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace.

The novel opens with the same scene: a 14-year-old Rosa Burger waiting outside a prison to visit her detained mother.

She stated that it <b>was</b> <b>these</b> children who encouraged her to write the book.|$|E
5|$|William {{may have}} hoped the English would {{surrender}} following his victory, {{but they did}} not. Instead, some of the English clergy and magnates nominated Edgar the Ætheling as king, though their support for Edgar was only lukewarm. After waiting a short while, William secured Dover, parts of Kent, and Canterbury, while also sending a force to capture Winchester, where the royal treasury <b>was.</b> <b>These</b> captures secured William's rear areas and also his line of retreat to Normandy, if that was needed. William then marched to Southwark, across the Thames from London, which he reached in late November. Next he led his forces around {{the south and west}} of London, burning along the way. He finally crossed the Thames at Wallingford in early December. Archbishop Stigand submitted to William there, and when the duke moved on to Berkhamsted soon afterwards, Edgar the Ætheling, Morcar, Edwin, and Archbishop Ealdred also submitted. William then sent forces into London to construct a castle; he was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.|$|E

5|$|British and French {{submarine}} {{operations in}} the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli Campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, 11 troop transports, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels {{at a cost of}} eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara. During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region. E2 left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles. By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease {{operations in the}} area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it <b>was</b> <b>these</b> operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.|$|E
5|$|In 1161 Chesney became {{embroiled in}} a dispute with St Albans Abbey, {{resulting}} from his efforts to enforce his right, as bishop, to supervise religious houses within his diocese. Although Pope Alexander III sent a papal bull to England ordering the case to be heard {{by a panel of}} two bishops, King Henry II felt that the papal order infringed on his royal rights and had the case decided at the royal court instead. In 1155–1156 St Albans had secured papal privileges from the English Pope Adrian IV, who had previously been a monk there, that exempted the abbey from diocesan supervision, and it <b>was</b> <b>these</b> privileges that Chesney challenged. Chesney secured not only the papal bull but a royal commission to investigate the rights of the abbey {{as they were in the}} time of King Henry I. The final disposition of the case took place in 1163, at a royal council at Westminster, where the abbey produced both the papal privileges and a forged charter of Offa of Mercia in support of their case. As Chesney was unable to produce any documents in support of his own position, the king and council told the bishop that they favoured the abbey's cause. The king also ruled that the abbey was a royal proprietary church, and thus had special exemptions. In the end, a compromise was reached, whereby the abbey compensated the bishopric with some land in return for the bishop renouncing his claims.|$|E
