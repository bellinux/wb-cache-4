500|$|The 1926 World Series {{produced}} one of {{the most}} famous anecdotes in baseball history, involving Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester. Sylvester was an 11-year-old boy from Essex Fells, New Jersey who was supposedly hospitalized after falling off a horse. Sylvester asked his father to get him a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. Prior to the start of the World Series, the boy's parents sent urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis, asking for an autographed ball. Soon, the family received an airmail package with two balls, one autographed by the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying, [...] "I'll knock a homer for you on Wednesday". After Ruth hit three home runs in Game4 on October 6, newspapers reported that Sylvester's condition had miraculously improved. After the World Series had ended, Ruth made a highly publicized visit to Sylvester's home, in which the boy said to Ruth, [...] "I'm sorry the Yanks lost the series". In the spring of 1927, Sylvester's uncle visited Ruth and thanked him for saving the boy's life. Ruth asked how the boy was doing and asked the uncle to give the boy his regards. After the man left, Ruth, who was seated next to a group of baseball writers, said, [...] "Now <b>who</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> Johnny Sylvester?" ...|$|E

After landing, one of his squadron mates, Ensign Cleo Dobson, told Kleiss that he had seen the whole thing. Dobson joked, “Welcome aboard, Dusty!” For the remainder of his career in the Navy, Kleiss went by that nickname.|$|R

2500|$|The Band {{gained a}} {{nickname}} while marching at the Richmond parade, honoring Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France in 1921. The drum major attempted a mace toss {{as he passed}} the reviewing stand. The wind blew the mace and it fell to ground, bouncing once. The drum major caught the mace off the bounce and still rendered a proper salute to the reviewing officer. Field Marshal Foch supposedly said 'hoity-toity' (show-off in French) {{in response to the}} drum major's display. For many years this was believed to be the origin of the band's name. However, history states that the name came from a cheer that was invented when the band was housed in Division E, the fifth stairwell of Lane Hall. While waiting for meals, each unit would give up a cheer. The bandsmen were tired of not having a name, and made up a cheer that went: [...] "Highty Tighty, Christ Almighty, <b>who</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> we?
