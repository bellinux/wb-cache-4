5|$|If the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of uranium was poorly understood, that of plutonium <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> unknown, {{as it had}} only existed in microscopic amounts. Samples began arriving from the reactors in 1943, and although the locus of the Manhattan Project's investigations into plutonium chemistry was at the Metallurgical Laboratory, the Ames Project investigated methods of separating plutonium metal from uranium and fission products.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the {{movement}} of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback. However, vehicular access to the summit <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> impossible until {{the construction of a}} road in 1964, and it continues to be restricted. Today, multiple trails to the summit exist, in various states of use.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> {{ignored by}} the music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced {{up and down on}} the Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close to the success of its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's {{financial}} problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of the Taylor Report in January 1990, Sunderland was obliged to make plans to turn their Roker Park home into an all-seater stadium. Roker Park was a ground that mainly {{consisted}} of standing terraces, and if converted into all-seater it would have held far fewer spectators than before. Enclosed by residential streets on all sides, expansion <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> impossible. So, by 1991, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray began investigating the possibility of relocation to a new stadium.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he focuses}} on the French Revolution, the story ends in the 1880s, shortly after the Second French Empire, closely {{following}} the evolution of society and women (see also Historiography of the French Revolution). Later, he republished what was essentially is the same book but with a different title, in both French and English: La Femme et la mode. Métamorphoses de la parisienne de 1792 à 1892 or Woman and Fashion: Metamorphoses of the Parisienne 1792–1892 in the English version (1892), and Les Modes de Paris. Variations du goût et de l'esthétique de la femme, 1797–1897 (1897). According to the Westminster Review, the English edition <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> a facsimile of the French, and the translator literally wrote the sentences {{to the point of}} unintelligibility.|$|E
5|$|Another factor {{pointing}} to Deva Victrix as a provincial capital {{is the presence}} of a port. From Deva, Ireland (Hibernia) was also accessible, a land which Agricola had plans to conquer; he even launched an expedition to Ireland, though where from is unclear. Also, the Flavian dynasty was expansionist, and Deva was closer to what would then have been the front, making administration quicker and easier. Furthermore, historian Vittorio Di Martino believes that Agricola could have chosen Deva Victrix as a possible future capital of Roman Britain because it <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> placed at the centre of the British isles, being located geographically at nearly the same distance from the westernmost shores of Ireland, the easternmost lands of Britannia and the Channel.|$|E

5|$|In February 2008, Paramount {{announced}} they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008 release date to May 8, 2009, as the studio felt more people {{would see the}} film during summer than winter. The film <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> finished {{by the end of}} 2008. Paramount's decision came about after visiting the set and watching dailies, as they realized the film could appeal to a much broader audience. Even though the filmmakers liked the Christmas release date, Damon Lindelof acknowledged it would allow more time to perfect the visual effects. The months-long gap between the completion of the production and release meant Alan Dean Foster was allowed to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel would contain scenes absent from the final edit. Quinto narrated the audiobook.|$|E
5|$|The average Soviet soldier {{suffered}} from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle {{of the previous}} year ameliorated only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, wounded or captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 just from the Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and had little to no combat experience, and tactical training <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> nonexistent. Coupled with the lack of trained soldiers, the Red Army also began to suffer from the loss of Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defense was considered necessary.|$|E
5|$|Van Overstraten {{is desperately}} keen for strong British counterattack. Either {{north or south}} of Leie could help restore the situation. Belgians expect to be {{attacked}} on the Ghent front tomorrow. Germans already have a bridgehead over canal west of Eecloo. There can be no question of the Belgian withdrawal to Yser. One battalion on march NE of Ypres <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> wiped out today in attack by sixty aircraft. Withdrawal over open roads without adequate fighter support very costly. Whole of their supplies are east of Yser. They strongly represent attempt {{should be made to}} restore the situation on Leie by British counter-attack for which opportunity may last another few hours only.|$|E

5|$|An {{encounter}} battle {{developed as}} 3 RAR carried out an aggressive quick attack {{off the line}} of march from the road, with American tanks in support. With fire support from mortars and artillery unavailable due {{to the location of}} US 3/187 RCT being unknown, the Australian attack succeeded nonetheless, and the North Koreans were forced to withdraw from the high ground having suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile, 3 RAR's tactical headquarters came under attack and was forced to fight off a group of North Koreans. Having been forced off the high ground, the North Koreans were now caught between the advancing Australians and the American paratroopers to the north. Attacking the North Koreans from the rear, 3 RAR subsequently relieved the American paratroopers, with the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade linked up with them by 11:00. Following three hours of fighting the battle was largely over by midday; however, many of the North Koreans that had been unable to escape continued to refuse to surrender, hiding or feigning death until individually flushed out. The Australians then proceeded to sweep the area, kicking over stacks of straw and shooting the North Korean soldiers they found hiding in them as they attempted to flee. Caught between the American paratroopers and the British and Australians, the North Korean 239th Regiment <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> destroyed. In their first major battle in Korea the Australians had distinguished themselves, and the battalion was later praised for its performance.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> uncontested {{during his}} final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual respect for each other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was dismayed by the lack of unity among the reformers. He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Euryalus, {{named after}} the Greek hero Euryalus, was laid down on 18 July 1899 by Vickers, Sons & Maxim at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. She was {{launched}} 20 May 1901 in front of 30,000 spectators, and christened by Mrs. Douglas Vickers, wife {{of one of the}} directors of the company. On 11 June 1901, {{the south side of the}} Ramsden dock at Barrow caught fire, and <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> destroyed before the flames could be extinguished. The recently launched Euryalus was laying alongside this wharf, and the fire set ablaze the teak wood sheathing of the cruiser. Considerable damage was done to the ship before she was hauled from the pier into the middle of the dock, and her completion was severely delayed. Towed to Cammell Laird at Birkenhead for repairs, the ship slipped off the blocks supporting her in drydock and was severely damaged. While on sea trials, she collided with the auxiliary vessel Traveller on 27 June 1903 at Devonport. Euryalus was finally completed on 5 January 1904, nearly two years after her sister ships.|$|E

5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by his dress, by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had not engaged in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The reform was never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the reform had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic reform was initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The reform's goal was to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy to an even greater extent. This reform was also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that the reform was to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the reform never came to fruition. The reform is seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|Petrus Christus {{placed his}} sitter in a naturalistic setting {{rather than a}} flat and featureless background. This {{approach}} was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 , Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa {{in front of a}} landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.|$|E

5|$|This {{time the}} mere {{presence}} of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided {{that he would have to}} break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 508510 Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E
5|$|The P-40s {{were better}} armored and faster {{in level flight}} than the Japanese fighters they were up against, mostly Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes, and could outdive them. On the other hand, the Japanese fighters had greater range, could outclimb the P-40, and were far more maneuverable. For an American P-40 pilot, risking a dogfight with a Japanese fighter <b>was</b> <b>practically</b> suicidal. Wurtsmith {{attempted}} to develop tactics that would exploit {{the strengths of the}} P-40 and minimize its weaknesses. The two-plane element was fixed as the chief unit of combat, and individual dogfighting was strictly prohibited. The P-40s would attempt to dive into a Japanese formation, attack, and then continue diving at a speed the Japanese fighters could not match. Above all, Wurtsmith attempted {{to make sure that he}} had enough P-40s in commission to outnumber the Japanese. The efforts of the ground crews and service troops made this possible. By May 1942, he had lost seven P-40s and three pilots while claiming the destruction of 38 Japanese aircraft. The heaviest Japanese attack had been by nine fighters and 24 bombers, which Wurtsmith had met with 50 P-40s; the P-40 pilots claimed 11 Japanese aircraft shot down. May was the first month that passed without a raid since January but the Japanese returned on four consecutive days in June, with three of these raids consisting of 18 to 20 fighters and 27 bombers. That month nine P-40s and 13 Japanese aircraft were lost. Wurtsmith was promoted to colonel on 6 July 1942. Between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters claimed to have downed 78 enemy aircraft.|$|E
