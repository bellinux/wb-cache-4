We investigated the association of age, gender and education with 10 -year cognitive trajectory in a well-defined population of elderly {{using data from the}} Bambuí Cohort Study of Aging, in Brazil. Cognition was measured using the Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE). Cohort members underwent annual follow-ups. This analysis was based on 12, 206 MMSE measurements from 1, 461 (91 %) baseline participants. We used mixed effects models to study MMSE as outcome. The key findings from this analysis are that women and people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>schooling</b> level at baseline had high scores of MMSE, while older participants started off lower. Regarding cognitive decline, women, older people and those <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>schooling</b> level declined faster...|$|R

As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E

25|$|Mizil {{reached its}} peak of {{activity}} during the 19th century, rapidly outpacing Urlați, which had possessed the advantage of having the closest market {{to most of the}} towns in that part of Wallachia. Moreover, in 1847 the Ploiești-Buzău road began to be built along the foothills, shortening and modernising the link between the capitals of the Danubian Principalities, Bucharest and Iași. It was from the latter to the former city that Alexandru Ioan Cuza passed through Mizil in 1859, on his way to become head of the United Principalities. In this period, inhabitants worked in agriculture, viniculture, animal husbandry and various trades. The first school was built in 1857, by the boyar Ion Căciunescu, although teaching had begun around 1838.

25|$|Fondane's actual debut {{dates back}} to 1914, during {{the time when he}} became a student at the National High School Iași and {{formally}} affiliated with the provincial branch of the nationwide Symbolist movement. That year, samples of lyric poetry were also published in the magazines Valuri and Revista Noastră (whose owner, writer Constanța Hodoș, even offered Fondane a job on the editorial board, probably unaware that she was corresponding <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> student). Also in 1914, the Moldavian Symbolist venue Absolutio, edited by Isac Ludo, featured pieces he signed with the pen name I. Hașir. Among his National High School colleagues was Alexandru Al. Philippide, the future critic, who remained one of Fondane's best friends (and whose poetry Fondane proposed for publishing in Revista Noastră). Late in 1914, Fondane also began his short collaboration with the Iași Symbolist tribune Vieața Nouă. While several of his poems were published there, the review's founder Ovid Densusianu issued objections to their content, and, in their subsequent correspondence, each writer outlines his stylistic disagreements with the other.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{at the end}} of January, he {{performed}} with his Wonder Horses for several weeks on the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Circuit at the New York Hippodrome. His 15-minute presentation was far above the average horse act, but did not begin to compare with John Aggee's equines that had appeared previously in the same setting at the Hippodrome. The two acts were different. Joyce's presentation was the typical circus offering of the kind where the animals followed set routines. It opened <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> turn with various types of 1 and 2 steps to music with Joyce in the saddle. Then Jack dismounted and put his black steed through a ritual where it knelt and ran between 2 cannons in the ring. Carrying flags it jumped over the cannons and fired them. Later in the engagement, Joyce, {{for the sake of a}} smoother presentation, replaced this part of the act with a riding turn. Next, the drollery of an English comic brought forth mild laughter. Cossack trick riding with various unique feats scored well as the horse and rider raced around the ring. Following came 6 showy equines with royal plumes and glittering harness. They did a nice drill which ended with their marching on the rim of the ring curb. The horses were somewhat hesitant in their movements and notably nervous, probably as a result of experiencing the very rough ocean crossing just two weeks earlier.|$|E
