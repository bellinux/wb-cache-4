5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a time <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> aid {{for urban}} renewal was plentiful, Albany {{did not have}} growth in its economy or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have also}} argued that {{inconsistent}} application of laws in different circuits is inherently unfair. Trevor W. Morrison, for example, claims that circuit splits create potential due process conflicts if criminal defendants are unaware that their behavior constitutes criminal activity in that circuit. An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also suggested that there {{is the potential for}} the unconstitutional ex post facto application of law after circuit splits are resolved. Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues that federal agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges implementing regulatory measures <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.|$|E

Higbee's moved their Home Store to this location in 1973. The center was roofed over in the late 1960s to compete with neighboring newer Parmatown Mall 8 mi southeast and Great Northern Mall 4.5 mi southwest of Westgate Mall.|$|R

25|$|The Hough Area Development Corporation {{was formed}} in 1967 to stimulate {{investment}} in the neighborhood, but it proved ineffective and was disbanded in 1983 <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> funding ran out.

25|$|In 1998, Scientology (through {{subsidiary}} Bridge Publications) sued FACTNet for claimed copyright violations. <b>When</b> <b>federal</b> judge John Kane denied Scientology's {{request for}} summary judgment because FACTNet challenged Scientology's {{ownership of the}} copyrights of the documents, a settlement was reached in 1999. The terms were that if FACTNet is ever found guilty of violations of church copyrights, they are permanently enjoined to pay the church $1million.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the potential impacts of monetary policy on the yield of Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). A quadratic relationship is confirmed for all four types of TIPS.

25|$|The Masses was a {{graphically}} innovative {{magazine of}} socialist politics published monthly in the United States from 1911 until 1917, <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> prosecutors brought charges against its editors for conspiring to obstruct conscription. It was succeeded by The Liberator {{and then later}} The New Masses. It published reportage, fiction, poetry and art by the leading radicals of the time such as Max Eastman, John Reed, Dorothy Day, and Floyd Dell.|$|E
25|$|HPAE's {{precursor}} union, the Englewood Hospital Nurses Association, {{was formed}} in 1974 when Ann Twomey, a registered nurse, organized an independent nurses union at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, New Jersey. Shift rotation, floating, low wages and {{a general lack of}} respect from management drove Twomey and the other Englewood nurses to organize at a time <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> labor law had only just begun to recognize the union rights of registered nurses.|$|E
25|$|Legislation {{was drafted}} and passed in 1935, but the project hit a snag <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> financing, a {{provision}} of the legislation, proved unavailable. In June 1937, a bill {{was passed by the}} New Hampshire legislature and signed into law by Governor Francis P. Murphy authorizing a $250,000 bond issue to finance erection of the tramway. Later Roland E. Peabody was named Managing Director of the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>Federal</b> Councillor Adolf Deucher died in 1912, Calonder {{was one of}} the {{candidates}} for the vacant seat in the Swiss Federal Council. On July 17, 1912, he lost the election to Edmund Schulthess in the first vote, partially due to Schulthess's strong support by Catholic Conservatives, farmers' organizations, and the industrial lobby. Disappointed by the result, Grison politicians and media called for a boycott of the Swiss National Day (August 1) in 1912.|$|E
25|$|White {{frequently}} {{urged the}} Supreme Court to consider cases <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> appeals courts were in conflict {{on issues of}} federal law, believing that resolving such was a primary role of the Supreme Court. Thus, White voted to grant certiorari more often than many of his colleagues; he also wrote numerous opinions dissenting from denials of certiorari. After White (along with fellow Justice Harry Blackmun, who also often voted for liberal grants of certiorari) retired, {{the number of cases}} heard each session of the Court declined steeply.|$|E
25|$|Federal Reserve Notes {{are printed}} by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), a bureau of the Department of the Treasury. <b>When</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve Banks require {{additional}} notes for circulation, they must post collateral {{in the form}} of direct federal obligations, private bank obligations, or assets purchased through open market operations. If the notes are newly printed, they also pay the BEP for the cost of printing (about 4¢ per note). This differs from the issue of coins, which are purchased for their face value.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>Federal</b> troops left Arizona {{early in}} 1861, the {{territory}} was left open to Apache attack. Mangas Coloradas and Cochise led {{a series of}} raids on white civilians that left dozens dead and spread fear and terror across the territory. Both the Confederates and the Federal government attempted to control the Apaches. The remaining Union troops in the New Mexico Territory were concentrated in forts along and near the Rio Grande; {{the commander of the}} Union Department of New Mexico, Colonel Edward R. S. Canby, started raising regiments of New Mexico volunteers and militia to replace the regular army units which were ordered east.|$|E
25|$|By 1877, <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> {{forces were}} withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana {{and other states}} had regained control of state legislatures, often by {{paramilitary}} {{groups such as the}} White League, which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively disenfranchised blacks and people of color, by raising barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.|$|E
25|$|He {{was indicted}} in February 2003 on 17 counts under the Patriot Act. A jury acquitted him on 8 counts and deadlocked on the {{remaining}} 9 counts. He later struck a plea bargain and admitted {{to one of the}} remaining charges in exchange for being released and deported by April 2007. However, as his release date approached, a federal prosecutor in Virginia demanded he testify before a grand jury in a separate case, which he refused to do, claiming it would violate his plea deal. He was held under house arrest in Northern Virginia from 2008 until 2014 <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss charges against him.|$|E

25|$|In 1968 <b>when</b> <b>Federal</b> auto {{equipment}} and safety regulations were initiated, {{the requirement for}} two large or four small round sealed beams was codified, freezing headlamp design for many years. At the same time, the new regulations prohibited any decorative or protective element {{in front of the}} headlamps whenever the headlamps are switched on. Glass-covered headlamps, used on e.g. the Jaguar E-Type, pre-1968 VW Beetle, 1965 Chrysler and Imperial models, Porsche 356, Citroën DS and Ferrari Daytona were no longer permitted and vehicles had to be imported with uncovered headlamps for the US market. This change meant that vehicles with headlamp configurations designed for good aerodynamic performance could not achieve it for the US market.|$|E
25|$|The Suncor {{plant was}} a {{landmark}} in oil sands development. It pioneered technology for bitumen extraction and upgrading, {{and it was}} the world's first large-scale commercial plant. In the early years it was not particularly profitable, but the plant was nonetheless able to cover operating expenses from the sale of its own production. And in 1979, <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> policy permitted the company to charge world price for its oil, the plant finally became a money-making asset to Suncor. The plant found solutions to the problems of extracting a commercial grade of oil from the sands - problems that had been the concern of financiers, chemists, petroleum engineers, metallurgists, mining engineers, geologists, physicists and many other scientists and pseudo-scientists for many decades.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to control}} {{the sale of the}} drug date back to 1986, <b>when</b> <b>federal</b> {{officials}} at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) first drafted legislation, later proposed by Senator Bob Dole, R-KS, that would have placed a number of chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would have required each transaction involving pseudoephedrine to be reported to the government, and federal approval of all imports and exports. Fearing this would limit legitimate use of the drug, lobbyists from over the counter drug manufacturing associations sought to stop this legislation from moving forward, and were successful in exempting from the regulations all chemicals that had been turned into a legal final product, such as Sudafed.|$|E
