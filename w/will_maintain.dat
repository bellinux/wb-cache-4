5|$|Dependent stage – At this stage, {{symptoms}} {{build up}} gradually. Hangover symptoms from excessive drinking may {{be confused with}} withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts <b>will</b> <b>maintain</b> their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They will try to hide their drinking problem from others and will avoid gross intoxication.|$|E
5|$|In cold or inclement weather, several {{nightjar}} {{species can}} slow their metabolism {{and go into}} torpor, notably the common poorwill, which <b>will</b> <b>maintain</b> that state for weeks. The European nightjar has been observed in captivity {{to be able to}} maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} autopilot modes. The standard mode for en-route navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a {{great circle route}} between waypoints, adjusting the aircraft's heading to compensate for wind. Other modes <b>will</b> <b>maintain</b> the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (flight path {{will be affected by}} winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (flight path in a straight direction). The latter two modes are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for the autopilot. Since Flight 370 flew near waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any waypoints in the Southern Indian Ocean. Waypoints MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these waypoints did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|E
5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples <b>will</b> <b>maintain</b> some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E
