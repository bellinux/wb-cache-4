25|$|Subatomic charged particles, {{primarily}} protons from {{cosmic rays}} and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is {{visible to the}} naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 millisievert each day, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> year of natural exposure on Earth. This results in a higher risk of cancer for astronauts. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the DNA and chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system, and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.|$|E
