500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "You and I" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an A–G–A chord progression, which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–Bm during the chorus, {{and back to the}} former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics—"It's {{been a long time since}} I came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the [...] "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." [...] Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>love</b> the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E
60|$|Except at the end, {{they were}} days of supreme summer, {{and there was}} a waxing moon. We met {{recklessly}} day by day. We were so intent upon each other at first so intent upon expressing ourselves to each other, and getting at each other, that we troubled very little about the appearance of our relationship. We met almost openly.... We talked of ten thousand things, and of ourselves. We loved. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>love.</b> There is no prose of mine that can tell of hours transfigured. The facts are nothing. Everything we touched, the meanest things, became glorious. How can I render bare tenderness and delight and mutual possession? I sit here at my desk thinking of untellable things.|$|E
60|$|Always we were equals, or if {{anything}} {{she was the}} better of us two. I never made love {{to her in the}} commoner sense of the word, a sense in which the woman is conceived of as shy, unawakened, younger, more plastic, and the man as tempting, creating responses, persuading and compelling. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>love</b> to each other as youth should, we were friends lit by a passion.... I think that is the best love. If I could wish your future I would have you love someone neither older and stronger nor younger and weaker than yourself. I would have you have neither a toy nor a devotion, for the one makes the woman contemptible and the other the man. There should be something almost sisterly between you. Love neither a goddess nor a captive woman. But I would wish you a better fate in your love than chanced to me.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> have <b>made</b> {{the mistake}} of turning life inside out: of {{dragging}} the day-self into the night, and spreading the night-self over into the day. <b>We</b> have <b>made</b> <b>love</b> and sex a matter of seeing and hearing and of day-conscious manipulation. <b>We</b> have <b>made</b> men and women come together {{on the grounds of}} this superficial likeness and commonalty--their mental, and upper sympathetic consciousness. And so we have forced the blood to submission. Which means we force it into disintegration.|$|R

I suppose, poor silly little things, that if you stayed we should {{certainly}} begin making love to each other. It would be--necessary. We should fence about a little and then there it would be. No barrier--to stop us. And neither of us wants it to happen. It isn't what we want. You would become urgent, I suppose, and I should be--coquettish. In spite of ourselves that power would make us puppets. As if already <b>we</b> hadn't <b>made</b> <b>love....</b> I could find it in my heart now.... Stephen I could make you stay....|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>love</b> to one another, and plotted darkly in {{the deepest}} obscurity of the hold. Each set of conspirators had its proper {{listener}} at the hatch. These, leaning too far over would bump their heads together and fight. Occasionally there was confusion amongst them: two or more would assert a right to overhear the same plot. I remember at one time the cook, the carpenter, the second assistant-surgeon, and an able seaman contended with handspikes for the honor of betraying my confidence. Once there were three masked murderers of the second watch bending {{at the same instant}} over the sleeping form of a cabin-boy, who had been heard to mutter, a week previously, that he had [...] "Gold! gold!" [...] the accumulation of eighty--yes, eighty--years' piracy on the high seas, while sitting as M.P. for the borough of Zaccheus-cum-Down, and attending church regularly. I saw the captain of the foretop surrounded by suitors for his hand, while he was himself fingering the edge of a packing-case, and singing an amorous ditty to a lady-love shaving at a mirror.|$|E

60|$|Constantly {{during those}} {{intervening}} months I {{had been thinking}} of meeting her. None the less there was a shock, {{not so much of}} surprise as of deferred anticipation. There she stood like something amazingly forgotten that was now amazingly recalled. She struck me in that brief crowded instant of recognition as being exactly the person she had been when <b>we</b> had <b>made</b> <b>love</b> in Burnmore Park; there were her eyes, at once frank and sidelong, the old familiar sweep of her hair, the old familiar tilt of the chin, the faint humor of her lip, {{and at the same time}} she seemed to be something altogether different from the memories I had cherished, she was something graver, something inherently more splendid than they had recorded. Her face lit now with recognition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, old man, I'm sore, and you're {{about the}} only guy I can let out on," [...] {{explained}} Maynard, heavily. [...] "One thing I'm glad of--we'll face it together. Daren, we were kids together--do you remember?--playing on the commons--straddling the old water-gates over the brooks--stealing cider from the country presses--barefoot boys going to school together. We played Post-Office with the girls and Indians with the boys. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> puppy <b>love</b> to Dal and Mel and Helen and Margie--all of them.... Then, somehow the happy thoughtless years of youth passed.... It seems strange and sudden now--but the war came. We enlisted. We had the same ideal--you and I.--We went to France--and {{you know what we}} did there together.... Now we're on this ship--getting into port of the good old U.S.--good as bad as she is!--going home together. Thank God for that. I want to be buried in Woodlawn.... Home! Home?... We feel its meaning. But, Dare, we'll have no home--no place.... We are old--we are through--we have served--we are done.... What we dreamed of as glory will be cold ashes to our lips, bitter as gall.... You always were a dreamer, an idealist, a believer in God, truth, hope and womanhood. In spite of the war these somehow survive in you.... But Dare, old friend, steel yourself now against disappointment and disillusion." ...|$|R

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the Two Virgins, John stated in an {{interview}} that he believed the album [...] "can change people", as others [...] "have changed my head, just with their records." [...] He then claimed [...] "thats what Yoko and my singing is, to change it like that". Lennon talked about making the album and Onos influence on him, in an interview in 1980 with Playboys David Sheff: [...] "Well, after Yoko and I met, I didnt realize I was in love with her. I was still thinking it was an artistic collaboration, as it were - producer and artist, right? ... My ex-wife was away ... and Yoko came to visit me. ... instead of making love, we went upstairs and made tapes. I had this room full of different tapes where I would write and make strange loops and things like that for the Beatles stuff. So we made a tape all night. She was doing her funny voices and I was pushing all different buttons on my tape recorder and getting sound effects. And then as the sun rose <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>love</b> and that was Two Virgins." [...] This was Johns first recording project that did not feature any help from the other Beatles; parts of the album were reminiscent of later editions of the Beatles Christmas flexi recordings.|$|E
