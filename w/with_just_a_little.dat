500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] {{was written by}} 26 African-American {{students}} from a tenth grade English class at Jefferson High School after Montgomery and her husband William Asher, {{the director of the}} episode, had the students visit the set of Bewitched. Most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that. Sargent said that the students, [...] "who might have been stuck in the ghetto {{for the rest of their}} lives, loved Bewitched, and <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> approval and motivation, came alive on the set." [...] Montgomery considered [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] her favorite episode of the series, and said that it [...] "was created in the true spirit of Christmas ... conceived in the image of innocence and filled with truth." [...] The episode received the Governors Award at the 23rd Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony in 1971. Montgomery's biographer Herbie Pilato wrote that [...] "no episode of the series more clearly represented [...] cry against prejudice" [...] than [...] "Sisters at Heart". Critic Walter Metz praised Asher's choice of camera angles, but denounced the episode's liberalism as excessively sentimental and simplistic.|$|E
500|$|The {{students}} {{attended a}} production and rehearsal {{meeting for the}} episode. The government of California gave Jefferson High School a grant to support a program to allow the students {{to be part of}} the filming and post-production of the episode. Film production company Screen Gems joined Montgomery and Asher in making donations to the program as well. The students donated the money they received for writing the episode to a foundation to keep the program going. Two more trips were organized, bringing a total of fifty Jefferson High School students to the set of Bewitched. Asher sent copies of thirty scripts of other Bewitched episodes to the school for use in classrooms. Saunders found the program a great success, saying [...] "kids who could never write before were now writing three pages. Kids who could not read were now doubling up on scripts and fighting over who would be able to play the leads." [...] Asher also expressed pleasure with the program's success, and recommended that other white businesspeople invite minority groups into their lives. Sargent considered Saunders the main reason for the success of the program, saying, [...] "She was interested in innovative forms of teaching. These kids, who might have been stuck in the ghetto for the rest of their lives, loved Bewitched, and <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> approval and motivation, came alive on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|Other comics by Romano Scarpa {{have the}} Queen in her {{youthful}} form. In the three-part [...] "Snow White and the Green Flame" [...] (Biancaneve e verde fiamma), the Queen flies on a broom {{to the great}} gathering of witches, who declare that her inability to deal <b>with</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl and few dwarfs has disgraced them all and she should be punished for this according {{to the laws of}} Hell. The Queen begs the High Witch for mercy and is given a magic wand with the power of transformation, but if she would not succeed this time she will be turned into a magic broom for a more [...] "honorable" [...] witch to fly. The Queen uses the wand to gain trust of Snow White and turn her a figurine, than takes the princess' form to ambush the dwarfs and do the same with them, and waits for the Prince's arrival to kill him. Only Dopey escapes and eventually manages to outwit the Queen, using her want to restore his friends and transform her into a figurine, which later turns into a broom when her sentence is carried over. In [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Throne of Diamonds" [...] (I Sette Nani e il trono di diamanti), Jiminy Cricket is deeply enamored by the Queen's beauty and attempts to convince her to become good, but the Queen refuses to be redeemed and orders her soldiers to steal the throne the Dwarfs make for Snow White in a plot to turn her rival into an old woman. Eventually, the Queen is defeated by another witch Tardona and Snow White is saved. [...] "Snow White and the Chained Fairy" [...] (I Sette Nani e la fata incatenata), sees the dwarfs struggle to free the fairy Fawn who was captured by the Queen in an underground cavern for saving Snow White when Grimhilde flew to strike down the princess with a thunderbolt. She takes on many forms trying to thwart them in various ways, and one-by-one the dwarfs sacrifice their lives, until only Dopey remains but he manages to get hold of magical water that brings back all of them to life. The freed fairy's magic makes the cavern collapse down on the helpless Queen to make sure she will never hurt anyone again. In [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Birtch Ring" [...] (I Sette Nani e l'anello di betulla by Romano Scarpa), the Queen learns about the eight Dwarf named Ginger (Zenzero), who has left the his companions to go in search of fortune traveling the world, and transforms into a pixie named Fagottina to send him home and sow discord among his brothers. The Queen also transforms into a pixie, named Fogliolina, in [...] "Snow White and Easter in the Woods" [...] (Biancaneve e la Pasqua nel bosco), where, after her attempt to kill Snow White with magic is foiled by woodland creatures, she is so enraged that she calls upon the infernal powers to [...] "take her" [...] and her castle burns into flames and crumbles [...] around her. In [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Wolf's Cliff" [...] (I Sette Nani e la balza del lupo), she sends three of her bandit minions (Bragia, Sghembo and Schidione) to kidnap Snow White. [...] "Snow White and the Bewitched Dress" [...] (Biancaneve e l'abito stregato) has the Queen magically disguise herself as an old gypsy to give Snow White a cursed dress and capture her, then start her work on the spell to rid of the dwarfs and all the forest creatures. But Dopey infiltrates her castle, frees Snow White, and locks up the Queen in her laboratory set ablaze, after which the whole castle is consumed by fire and explodes after the dwarf and the princess escape.|$|E

[...] The Boston Globe described the final throw as follows:"Coe smiled at the encouraging remark of his famous rival, and then made steady for his final put. [...] The padded shot was carefully poised in his right hand, a firm grip was secured and then, with a lightning-like hop and spring, he drove the ball down the half.

2500|$|Nitrogen is less soluble than carbon dioxide, {{which allows}} the beer to be put under high {{pressure}} without making it fizzy.

5000|$|In a {{subsequent}} interview, Dr. Lohmueller did {{note that these}} findings go against the commonly-held perception that Neanderthals were mostly localized to modern-day Europe and western Asia: [...] "It’s very hard to put these findings into spatial context. The key idea is that {{there would have to}} have been some additional interbreeding events involving East Asians, but not Europeans. These interbreeding events could have been directly between Neanderthals and East Asians, maybe in some other indirect way." [...] Vernot also noted that [...] "Humans have been constantly migrating throughout their history—this makes it hard to say exactly where interactions with Neanderthals occurred. It's possible, for example, that all of the interbreeding with Neanderthals occurred in the Middle East, before the ancestors of modern non-Africans spread out across Eurasia. In the model from the paper, the ancestors of all non-Africans interbred with Neanderthals, and then split up into multiple groups that would later become Europeans, East Asians.

Like a flash that spider was upon it. It embraced the victim with its long legs to still its tremendous battlings. Next, descending below, it began to make the body fast, when something happened. From the still {{surface of the water}} beneath poked up the mouth of a very large fish which quite quietly closed upon the spider and sank again into the depths, taking with it a portion of the web and thereby setting the big moth free.

40|$|International audienceValidating user tags {{helps to}} refine them, {{making them more}} useful for finding images. In the case of interpretation-sensitive tags, however, {{automatic}} (i. e., pixel-based) approaches cannot be expected to deliver optimal results. Instead, human input is the key. This paper studies how crowdsourcing-based approaches to image tag validation can achieve parsimony {{in their use of}} human input from the crowd, in the form of votes collected from workers on a crowdsourcing platform. Experiments in the domain of social fashion images are carried out using the dataset published by the Crowdsourcing Task of the Mediaeval 2013 Multimedia Benchmark. Experimental results reveal that when a larger number of crowd-contributed votes are available, it is difficult to beat a majority vote. However, additional information sources, i. e., crowdworker history and visual image features, allow us to maintain similar validation performance while making use of less crowd-contributed input. Further, investing in expensive experts who collaborate to create definitions of interpretation-sensitive concepts does not necessarily pay off. Instead, experts can cause interpretations of concepts to drift away from conventional wisdom. In short, validation of interpretation-sensitive user tags for social images is possible, <b>with</b> " <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> help from the crowd"...|$|R
