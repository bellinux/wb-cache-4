5|$|Several leading batsmen {{opposed the}} new law, {{including}} the professional Herbert Sutcliffe, {{known as an}} exponent of pad-play, and amateurs Errol Holmes and Bob Wyatt.

Wisden judged the experiment a success and several of its opponents changed their mind by the end of the season; batsmen soon became accustomed to the alteration.

The main parameters of the band spectrum (the band filling with electrons degree and the total effective band width) have been determined. The dependencies of these from contents of substituting elements are discussed. Analyzing the results obtained simultaneously with the tendencies in oxygen content and critical temperature change we have confirmed the conclusion that the oxygen sublattice disordering has a determinant effect on band structure parameters and superconductive properties of YBa 2 Cu 3 O(y). The results obtained suggest that Ca gives rise to some peculiarities in band spectrum of this compound...|$|R
