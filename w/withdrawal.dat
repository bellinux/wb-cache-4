5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} <b>withdrawal</b> process being poorly managed. Over-rapid <b>withdrawal</b> from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual <b>withdrawal</b> customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the <b>withdrawal.</b> Opinion as to the time needed to complete <b>withdrawal</b> ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During <b>withdrawal,</b> fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> (or other CNS depressant <b>withdrawal</b> states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen <b>withdrawal</b> effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute <b>withdrawal</b> {{symptoms}} such as {{delirium tremens}} and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute <b>withdrawal</b> phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and <b>withdrawal.</b> A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome is more severe than the previous <b>withdrawal</b> episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple <b>withdrawal</b> episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during <b>withdrawal</b> from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol <b>withdrawal</b> episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol <b>withdrawal.</b> There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol <b>withdrawal.</b> For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for <b>withdrawal</b> patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E

30|$|Our model assumes early <b>withdrawals</b> {{of funds}} while the common rule of at-retirement <b>withdrawals</b> is {{explored}} by simulations (most authors, like Feldstein and Altman 1998 and Stiglitz and Yun 2002 analyze <b>withdrawals</b> at retirement, although some countries allow early <b>withdrawals).</b> The actuarially fair contribution rate {{of those two}} options appeared as basically the same. Therefore, if it happens that early <b>withdrawals</b> have a greater “low moral hazard” effect, then this policy could be a better alternative than previously thought (in our modeling, early and at-retirement configurations {{have the same effect}} on moral hazard).|$|R

5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. <b>Withdrawal</b> symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. <b>Withdrawal</b> symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise <b>withdrawal</b> and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. <b>Withdrawal</b> symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E

25|$|People in {{adolescence}} who experience multiple <b>withdrawals</b> from binge drinking show impairments of long-term nonverbal memory. Alcoholics {{who have had}} two or more alcohol <b>withdrawals</b> show more frontal lobe cognitive dysfunction than alcoholics who have experienced one or no prior <b>withdrawals.</b> Kindling of neurons is the proposed cause of withdrawal-related cognitive damage. Kindling from multiple <b>withdrawals</b> leads to accumulating neuroadaptational changes. Kindling {{may also be the}} reason for cognitive damage seen in binge drinkers.|$|R
5|$|Dependent stage – At this stage, {{symptoms}} {{build up}} gradually. Hangover symptoms from excessive drinking may {{be confused with}} <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms.

During its night march west, the 3rd Battalion column was joined several times by groups of North Korean soldiers who apparently thought {{it was one of}} their own columns moving south. They were made prisoners and taken along in the <b>withdrawal.</b> Nearing Waegwan at dawn, the battalion column was taken under North Korean mortar and T-34 tank fire after daybreak and sustained 18 casualties.|$|E
5|$|In a {{large-scale}} study of programs where bupropion {{was used for}} smoking cessation or treatment of depression, no <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms were observed.

50|$|Water <b>withdrawals</b> for {{irrigation}} of agricultural crops are {{of concern to}} some residents and there is discussion of the town regulating water <b>withdrawals</b> from surface waters. There are commercial production wells in the northwestern part of Columbia and surface water <b>withdrawals</b> also occur from Schoodic Lake, Duck Pond and Myers Pond. Surface water <b>withdrawals</b> in Cherryfield from Crane Pond are also of concern as these are {{the headwaters of the}} Harrington River tributaries that flow through Columbia. Concerns include the long-term impact of <b>withdrawals</b> of low water on Atlantic Salmon and other aquatic species such as native brook trout. The state legislature resolved in 2001, by Public Law 619 not to regulate water <b>withdrawals</b> in organized townships. Instead they chose to study the amounts and uses of existing water <b>withdrawals</b> and to develop a reporting system to gather this information. Columbia would like such studies to include the rivers within their boundaries.|$|R

40|$|The {{base flow}} {{recession}} constant, Kb, {{is used to}} characterize the interaction of groundwater and surface water systems. Estimation ofKb  is critical in many studies including rainfall-runoff modeling, estimation of low flow statistics at ungaged locations, and base flow separation methods. The performance of several estimators of Kb  are compared, including several new approaches which account {{for the impact of}} human <b>withdrawals.</b> A traditional semilog estimation approach adapted to incorporate the influence of human <b>withdrawals</b> was preferred over other derivative-based estimators. Human <b>withdrawals</b> are shown to {{have a significant impact on}} the estimation of base flow recessions, even when <b>withdrawals</b> are relatively small. Regional regression models are developed to relate seasonal estimates ofKb  to physical, climatic, and anthropogenic characteristics of stream-aquifer systems. Among the factors considered for explaining the behavior of Kb, both drainage density and human <b>withdrawals</b> have significant and similar explanatory power. We document the importance of incorporating human <b>withdrawals</b> into models of the base flow recession response of a watershed and the systemic downward bias associated with estimates of Kb  obtained without consideration of human <b>withdrawals...</b>|$|R
