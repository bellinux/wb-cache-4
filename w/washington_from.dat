5|$|B-29s {{began to}} arrive over Yawata at 00:38 local {{time and the}} attack on the city lasted almost two hours.

Two further B-29s bombed Laoyao harbor and another five struck targets of opportunity; overall 107 tons of bombs were dropped during the raid. After the first bombs were released regular updates on the operation were transmitted to the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters in <b>Washington,</b> <b>from</b> where they were relayed to Arnold who was in London at the time. The raiders were met with heavy but inaccurate anti-aircraft fire and the searchlights stationed around Yawata were not effective.

The Regiment's other aircraft struggled to make contact with the bombers and achieved few interceptions.|$|E

These reports led to regulatory probes by investigators in the aforementioned states. Both websites have since implemented measures to block proxy users.|$|E
