Most of the wastes are resulting from industrial, agricultural and energy sector. Energy and its production are one of the most important environmental issues right now.

Although biomass fuel combustion is CO 2 neutral process, it creates considerable amount of bottom ashes, which contributes to another environmental issue – wastes and their disposal. <b>Wood</b> <b>ashes</b> are useful wastes from energetic sector with wide range of usage.

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} producing century eggs {{is the development}} and improvement from the aforementioned primitive process. Instead of using just clay, a mixture of <b>wood</b> <b>ash,</b> calcium oxide, and salt {{is included in the}} plastering mixture, thereby increasing its pH and sodium content. The addition of calcium oxide and <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> to the mixture lowers the risk of spoilage and also increases the speed of the aforementioned primitive process. A recipe for creating century eggs through this process starts with the infusion of three pounds of tea in boiling water. To the tea, three pounds of calcium oxide (or seven pounds when the operation is performed in winter), nine pounds of sea salt, and seven pounds of ash from burned oak is mixed into a smooth paste. While wearing gloves to prevent the chemicals from burning the skin, each egg is individually covered by hand, then rolled in a mass of rice chaff to keep the eggs from adhering to one another before they are placed in cloth-covered jars or tightly woven baskets. The mud slowly dries and hardens into a crust over several months, and then the eggs are ready for consumption.|$|E
25|$|Although discontinued, this {{application}} {{is also one}} of the most concern to the general public. The vast majority of older pressure-treated wood was treated with CCA. CCA lumber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor building material. Although the use of CCA lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding soil (from playground equipment, for instance), a risk is also presented by the burning of older CCA timber. The direct or indirect ingestion of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> from burnt CCA lumber has caused fatalities in animals and serious poisonings in humans; the lethal human dose is approximately 20grams of ash. Scrap CCA lumber from construction and demolition sites may be inadvertently used in commercial and domestic fires. Protocols for safe disposal of CCA lumber are not consistent throughout the world. Widespread landfill disposal of such timber raises some concern, but other studies have shown no arsenic contamination in the groundwater.|$|E
25|$|Experimenting {{with the}} new technology, the forest glassmakers found it {{difficult}} to achieve the high standards of clarity and colour of the Roman methods, due mainly to the great variability of colour-controlling elements in the raw materials. European sand and soil is generally higher in iron and manganese. Iron gives a blue-green tinge to glass under usual furnace atmosphere conditions, but also may give a yellow colour. Manganese has its own purple colour which may balance out the iron colour to make colourless glass. For instance, glass made from beech wood grown on meagre lime-rich soil (e.g. Kleinlutzel, Jura) is high in manganese and thus, nearly colourless while that in a clay-rich area (e.g. Court-Chalvet, Jura) is olive green. Thus, a variety of colours may be produced and experimentation allowed the glassmakers to progress from the early muddy green-yellow-brown colours toward clear-coloured and colourless glass. Local conditions allowed some areas to produce finer glass at an earlier stage. In Bohemia {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century the decolourising powers of manganese were used to produce a clear glass suitable for engraving. The amount of carbon left in the <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> also may affect the colour of the glass by modifying the furnace atmosphere. The glass in York Minster has been shown to be 90% naturally coloured, without added colorants.|$|E

500|$|A {{study of}} black {{honeyeaters}} at seven sites in Western Australia regularly recorded breeding females eating ash from the campsite fires and often making repeated visits over {{a brief period}} of time. It was noted that the birds seemed attracted to the remote campfire with groups of around six hovering around and landing beside the fire, an activity described as similar to [...] "bees buzzing around a honeypot." [...] After pecking at the ash, some of the females foraged for insects, sallying from the foliage of nearby Wheatbelt wandoo (Eucalyptus capillosa) before returning for more ash. The activity of the females approaching the fire ranged from a single peck to sustained feeding for a minute or more. Male birds occasionally landed near the fire, but none were seen to take ash. Well developed brood patches on the birds mist netted near the fires, suggest that the females take ash around the time of laying, and throughout the incubation and feeding period. <b>Wood</b> <b>ash</b> is rich in calcium and it was hypothesised that the females were eating ash to form medullary bone before egg-laying or to repair a calcium deficit after laying. When other small birds, such as American hummingbirds, were recorded eating calcium-rich ash, bones or shell it was suggested that the bones of small species {{may not be able to}} store enough calcium for egg production.|$|E

2500|$|The main type {{of glass}} {{found in the}} Anglo-Saxon period is a soda-lime-silica glass, {{continuing}} the Roman tradition of producing glass. There is very little evidence for glass making from the raw materials in Roman Britain and even less evidence in Anglo-Saxon Britain. It would have been nearly impossible to transport the natron from the Middle East to Britain. It is therefore far more likely, that as in the Roman period, glass was being produced near the raw materials and then lumps of raw glass transported. Another source of glass was cullet, recycled broken or crushed glass. Recycling was carried out throughout the Roman period, and large deposits of broken glass at Winchester and Hamwic suggest glass was also being recycled in the Anglo-Saxon period. It is possible that by recycling glass in this way {{it was possible to}} keep up to the demand for glass products without new raw glass having to be introduced into the system. Additional cullet may also have been collected from the ruins of abandoned Romano-British sites. In the late 7-8th century with the construction of many ecclesiastical establishments and large windows, the demand for glass grew. At this time political problems in the Delta-Wadi Natrun region caused a shortage of natron in the Middle East where the raw glass was produced. This possibly led to [...] glass makers experimenting with new fluxes, which finally led to the introduction of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> glasses using potash as the main alkali flux, which was more readily available.|$|E
