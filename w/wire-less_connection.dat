They allow <b>wire-less</b> <b>connection</b> to computers and the images can be automatically trans-ferred to a PC or can be integrated into a GIS system. In this paper we pro-pose an approach for spatial information retrieval from images using the concept of ontologies and semantic maps. The term of ontology is used in our case to describe spatial domain knowledge to enhance the search capa-bility and image annotation. The objects are represented by their location in semantic maps. We describe a developed prototype system with a database design for ontologies and semantic maps. We demonstrate the automatic image annotation and the visualization of the spatial queries. The system is oriented {{to the area of}} culture and tourism and provides a user friendly in-terface...|$|E
40|$|Media content {{distribution}} {{constitutes a}} growing {{share of the}} ser-vices on the Internet. In recent years methods for cooperative media distribution has been a research area with high activity. Concurrently wireless internet connections have emerged. <b>Wire-less</b> <b>connection</b> technologies, e. g. Wimax, have properties which make them suboptimal for cooperative distribution. In particular, the asymmetric relationship between the uplink and the downlink bandwidth makes the cooperative distribution difficult. Today two distinct source coding approaches are used; Layered Coding (LC) andMultiple Description Coding (MDC). A promising con-cept, termed MDC with Conditional Compression (MDC-CC), has been proposed in [1]. MDC-CC essentially acts as an adap-tive hybrid between LC and MDC and is particularly interesting when combined with cooperative distribution. In this paper a scheme utilizing the concept of MDC-CC is proposed. The func-tionality of the scheme has been described and performance es-timates using different distributions of redundancy has revealed that the proposed scheme has great potential. 1...|$|E

In fully connected environments, connectivity is static and permanently established through wired networks. Appli-cations simply “assume ” that they are online continuously. This assumption is clearly invalid in mobile environments that use <b>wire-less</b> <b>connections.</b> While decreases in computer size and cost have made it more practical to use a portable computer as a mobile workstation, and advances in wireless technologies {{have made it possible}} to access networks outside the reach of wired connections, the development of software for use in a mobile environment has lagged behind these technologies. In general, support for mobile computing is poorly inte-grated in operating systems and network software. In this article, we discuss some of these problems. We then describe a wireless design of a communication layer for mobile computing and a prototype based on that design. Our work was part of AMIGOS (Advanced Mobile Integration in General Operating Systems), a col-Most network applications assume continuous connectivity—an assumption that does not “migrate ” to wireless environments.

40|$|The lack of {{effective}} networking technologies for embedded microcontrollers is inhibiting {{the emergence of}} smart objects and “Things That Think. ” A practical communication infrastructure for Things That Think will require <b>wire-less</b> network <b>connections</b> built directly into microcontroller chips. After showing that digital processing, application languages, and wireless links are not the bottle-neck, this thesis turns its attention to network designs. It presents architectures and algorithms that implement self-organizing networks, requiring minimal pre-plan-ning and maintenance. The result is a radically new model for networks—embedded networks—designed specifically to interconnect untethered embedded microcontrollers. The thesis cul-minates in the design, implementation and evaluation of a hardware system tha...|$|R

International connectivity is provided through VSNL and five STPI( [...] Software Technology Parks of India) earth stations in Kolkata, Durgapur, Kharagpur, Haldia and siliguri. Digha has been selected as the cable landing station for the submarine cable laying project connecting India and South East Asia.BSNL has an optical fiber network of 15000 km route in West Bengal. Reliance group's Jio Infocomm has laid 4500 km of optical fiber network in the state for its 4G network. Under National Optic Fibre Network (NOFN) mission, optical fibre cable will be laid in 341 blocks covering most of the gram panchayats in West Bengal.|$|R
