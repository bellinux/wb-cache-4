50|$|On August 5, Phelps Dodge {{announced}} that they would begin hiring permanent replacement workers for the Morenci Mine. The company took out large employment ads for new workers in the Tucson and Phoenix newspapers, advertising that the average annual wage for its employees was $26,200, plus what it calculated as $10,500 in benefits. Many people considered this an attractive wage, and that had an effect in curbing sympathy for the strikers. But the advertisements also greatly increased the anger of the strikers, who now faced permanent loss of their jobs.The company offered new workers virtually the same deal it had offered the unions, which had turned them down. Instead of an annual cost of living raise pegged to inflation, Phelps Dodge offered an annual <b>wage</b> <b>review</b> pinned {{to the price of}} copper. If copper increased, employees would receive a raise. They offered new workers $7.00 an hour instead of over $9.00. Instead of offering free doctor visits in the company hospital, they began to require a $5.00 co-pay. The union leaders turned this down, but hundreds of workers from Tucson and Phoenix accepted it. Eventually, many of the union workers went back to work as well.|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the impact Nigeria’s government <b>wage</b> <b>review</b> of 1998 had on the differential in pay for public and private sector workers of the same educational qualifications and ages. Empirical analysis based on the Mincerian human capital model was carried out for urban male employees only (as they constitute a homogeneous group) in {{the public and private}} sectors. The results obtained show that before the <b>wage</b> <b>review</b> of 1998, public sector workers suffered a pay disadvantage of 6. 78 % while about one year after the review, public sector workers enjoyed a premium of 35. 07 %. In the absence of any wage reduction in the private sector, this result suggests that the implementation of the 1998 <b>wage</b> <b>review</b> succeeded in making public sector workers better remunerated than their private sector counterparts and it can be concluded that the wage increase in the public sector achieved its disguised goal of redressing the age-long poor pay in the sector. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} based on four sources of data: (a) a survey of over 11, 500 non-public sector organisations, (b) {{quantitative}} analysis of over 25, 000 enterprise agreements, (c) qualitative analysis of 91 strategically selected agreements; and (d) 20 workplace case studies. Key findings (indicative) 	Organisations commonly used a number of pay-setting arrangements for their employees, with individual arrangements (at 65 per cent of organisations) and award based arrangements (52 per cent) the most common. 	The quantitative analysis of enterprise agreements found that {{that there may be}} a positive association between wage increases in enterprise agreements and Annual <b>Wage</b> <b>Review</b> increases. This was particularly the case for industries with higher proportions of agreements paying low wage increases and with a large number of award-reliant employees. 	The qualitative analysis of agreements identified the importance of distinguishing between agreements that are ‘award-reliant’, ‘slightly above award’ (i. e. pay modest over-awards) and ‘over-award’ (i. e. pay substantial amounts more than the award).   	External relativities (i. e. differences in pay for exemplar or reference classifications common across employers) were dispersed among all industries considered. Internal relativities within agreements were very similar to those in their related awards. 	The case studies found little direct impact of Annual <b>Wage</b> <b>Review</b> decisions on wage outcomes or pay-setting processes – they are best conceived as third order factors shaping both. Conclusion While the direct impact of Annual <b>Wage</b> <b>Review</b> decisions was perceived to be limited at the work sites studied, this is not the whole story. The analysis of agreements revealed that there may be positive significant associations between Annual <b>Wage</b> <b>Review</b> increases and agreement content. The workplace cases in general, and the relativities analysis in particular, revealed that awards profoundly shape wage outcomes and the wage determination process.   In particular, the agreement and case study findings highlighted the importance of not conceiving the different pay-setting arrangements in mutually exclusive terms. If the Annual <b>Wage</b> <b>Review</b> increases examined are conceived as being part of an ongoing evolution of the award system, then their impact is better understood as being very significant, primarily because such increases are an integral part of labour standard regime that conditions workplace behaviour and shapes wage outcomes. This appears to be especially the case in those parts of the labour market paying below median wages...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a qualitative longitudinal study examining the impact of the minimum wage increase afforded by the Annual <b>Wage</b> <b>Review</b> 2009 – 10 Decision on a sample of minimum wage-reliant enterprises and their employees. The study focused on enterprises in the Community Services, Manufacturing, Retail and Hospitality industries. The paper is divided into three Parts: Part 1 examines the operating context and industrial landscape of the case study enterprises, Part 2 outlines changes that occurred to the enterprises from March 2010 to November 2010, and Part 3 provides a synthesis of research findings over the three phases of research. The paper includes a number of findings relating to the operation of minimum wage-reliant enterprises and the impact of contextual factors—including the Annual <b>Wage</b> <b>Review</b> 2009 – 10 Decision’s minimum wages increases—on the case study enterprises and their employees. Although the array and pattern of pressures experienced by employers and employees varied across the enterprises, there was a consistent finding that the 1 July 2010 minimum wages increase had a limited effect on enterprises and their business performance within those broader operating contexts. Further, many employers regarded minimum wages increases as important for maintaining the living standards of their employees. Employee participants to the study generally believed the wage rise had prevented them from falling further behind the cost of living. It was also apparent that statutory wage increases were the only increases to earnings that some employees were likely to experience. However, findings indicated that a smaller vulnerable group of employees may not have been receiving the earnings they were entitled to, most commonly in the area of classification.

40|$|The {{centralised}} {{establishment of}} minimum wages {{and the role}} of awards in determining the wages of employees across an industry or occupation have long been central features of Australia’s wage-fixing system. One key change has been the greater prominence given to bargaining (most recently under the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (Fair Work Act)) at an enterprise level. The federal tribunal responsible for the role of national wage-fixing has undergone a number of major changes including the rationalisation and modernisation of awards to apply nationally, that is, across former federal and state jurisdictions. In the Annual <b>Wage</b> <b>Review</b> 2009 – 10, 1 the then Minimum Wage Panel noted the need for research into the composition of the award-reliant workforce. The Minimum Wage Panel recognised that an understanding of award reliance is essential to the minimum-wage setting process, stating in its decision for the Annual <b>Wage</b> <b>Review</b> 2009 – 102 that to inform future reviews it was seeking research to explore the extent and composition of the award-reliant sector. This project on award reliance was conducted to examine these issues. It was undertaken by the Workplace Research Centre, University of Sydney Business School (WRC) in collaboration with fieldwork company ORC International (ORC) on behalf of the Fair Work Commission. It was supplemented by two other projects, one of which considered incentives to enterprise bargaining among a range of industries in Australia, and the other being a qualitative study of professionals and other employees on higher award classifications. The focus of the Award Reliance Survey was to quantitatively investigate award reliance across and within Australian organisations, and to identify the mix or ‘categories’ of award-reliant employees and their location on award classification scales. The project had two main objectives. The first was to identify the incidence of award reliance across all non-public sector organisations and employees at the organisational level. The second was to identify the nature of award reliance across all non-public sector award-reliant organisations (i. e. organisations paying at least one employee exactly the award rate) in order to: identify award-reliant employees, and professional and other award-reliant employees on higher award classifications (including the characteristics of these employees); investigate explanatory variables for award reliance in professional and other higher classification award-reliant employees; and explore explanatory variables for award reliance at the organisation level...|$|E

40|$|Executive summary The Australian Fair Pay Commission {{undertakes}} ongoing {{research and}} consultation programs {{to ensure its}} wage-setting decisions take into account economic and social circumstances of low-paid Australians and their employers. The information, gathered through stakeholder consultations, submissions and economic research, has been supplemented by a program of targeted public consultations. TNS Social Research was commissioned to conduct and report on the public consultations. Cultural Partners Australia were commissioned to undertake consultations with the Indigenous community. This report presents the consolidated findings from three stages of public consultations, which included in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and online discussion forums with employers, employees and job seekers. Stage one of the consultation program was conducted over November and December 2008, stage two was conducted in February and March 2009 and stage three in April 2009. The findings from stage one provided a benchmark from which to track changes in views and experiences over time. Stages two and three engaged all of the Commission’s target groups and, where appropriate, reconvened with participants involved in previous stages. As economic and labour market conditions have evolved over the consultation period, the findings in this report examine the changes in attitudes and behaviours observed. Where appropriate, comparisons are also made with findings from public consultations conducted for the 2007 and 2008 Minimum <b>Wage</b> <b>Reviews,</b> and research conducted over May/June 2008 that explored employer responses to minimum wage adjustments...|$|R
