David Ortiz had 11 runs batted in (RBI) during the 2004 ALCS and Iván Rodríguez had 10 during the 2003 NLCS—the only two players to reach double-digit RBI in the series {{in the history of the}} award. From the pitcher's mound, Steve Avery threw 16 innings <b>without</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> a run in the 1991 NLCS, and John Smoltz amassed 19 strikeouts the {{following}} year. Liván Hernández won the 1997 NLCS MVP after winning his only start and earning a win out of the bullpen in relief; he struck out 16 in 10 innings.

He did not give up a home run until Pete Laforest hit one off of him in an 119 loss to the San Diego Padres on August 16. He {{struggled}} {{at the end of the}} year, with a 7.30 ERA in his final nineteen games. He still finished the year 43, with a 3.51 ERA in seventy-five games, and the Rockies made the playoffs as the NL Wild Card. He made his postseason debut on October 4 in the Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies and gave up one run (on a home run by Ryan Howard) in one inning in a 105 win by Colorado. The Rockies swept the series to advance to the Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In the first game, Affeldt entered with two outs and the bases loaded with the Rockies leading 51. He retired Stephen Drew to help the Rockies win 5–1. The Rockies swept the Diamondbacks to meet the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. Affeldt pitched in all four games of the World Series <b>without</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> a run, but the Rockies were swept by the Red Sox. Affeldt became a free agent after the season.|$|E

In this paper, we consider both analytic and numerical solutions of time-fractional linear Schrödinger Equations. This is done via a proposed semi-analytical method upon the modification of the classical Differential Transformation Method (DTM). Some illustrative examples are used; the results obtained converge faster to their exact forms. This shows that this modified version is very efficient, and reliable; as less computational work is involved, even <b>without</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> accuracy.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a handy {{approximation}} technique (HAT) for obtaining both closed-form and approximate solutions of time-fractional heat and heat-like equations with variable coefficients. The method is relatively recent, proposed via the {{modification of the}} classical Differential Transformation Method (DTM). It devises a simple scheme for solving the illustrative examples, and some similar PDEs. Besides being handy, the results obtained converge faster to their exact forms. This shows that this modified DTM (MDTM) is very efficient and reliable. It involves less computational work, even <b>without</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> accuracy.
