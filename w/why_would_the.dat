500|$|Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps {{compared}} the video {{with the music}} video of [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and complimented the choreography saying Spears had not danced with so much conviction since the In the Zone era. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse likened the video's choreography and dancer's wardrobe to Janet Jackson's [...] "Feedback" [...] video. Jocelyn Vena of MTV gave the video a positive review, stating that it's a [...] "sexy, fast-paced clip" [...] and that [...] "there are a few moments in the video where Britney's personality shines" [...] adding that [...] "she smiles at the song's [...] lyrics, particularly when she finishes the song's bridge." [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly complimented the video's choice of wardrobe, but said that the video was [...] "sparse", adding [...] "there's not much to the single besides trite, ridiculous advocation for a ménage à trois anyway, so <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> video go any deeper?". The Daily Mail said the video [...] "features Britney writhing around in scantily-clad outfits with male dancers {{in the best way}} she knows how".|$|E
2500|$|According to Justice Scalia, the Court's majority's [...] "analysis {{produces}} a crazy result: Whereas those {{convicted and sentenced}} to death for war crimes are without judicial remedy, all enemy combatants detained during a war, at least insofar as they are confined in an area away from the battlefield over which the United States exercises 'absolute and indefinite' control, may seek a writ of habeas corpus in federal court." [...] Justice Scalia added that the Constitution allows suspension of the writ of habeas corpus only in cases of rebellion or invasion, both domestic disturbances; he asked [...] "f the extraterritorial scope of habeas turned on flexible, 'functional' considerations, as the [...] holds, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> Constitution limit its suspension almost entirely to instances of domestic crisis?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The devil figures {{much more}} {{prominently}} in the New Testament and in Christian theology than in the Old Testament and Judaism. The New Testament records numerous accounts of the devil working against God and his plan. The Temptation of Christ features the devil, and is described in all three synoptic gospels, ( [...] , , and [...] ), although in Mark's gospel he is called Satan. In all three synoptic gospels, ( [...] , , and [...] ), Jesus' critics accuse him of gaining his power to cast out demons from Beelzebub, the chief demon (often identified with Satan in mainstream Christendom). In response, Jesus says that a house divided against itself will fall, so, logically speaking, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> devil allow one to defeat the devil's works with his own power? ...|$|E

6000|$|Why {{was it so}} {{difficult}} to remember that {{she was only a}} hated German and a spy? <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> fact that she was a woman and white always obtrude itself upon his consciousness? He hated her as he hated all her kind, and the fate that was sure to be hers was no more terrible than she in common with all her people deserved. The matter was settled and Tarzan composed himself to think of other things, yet the picture would not die--it rose in all its details and annoyed him. He began to wonder what they were doing to her and where they were taking her. He was very much ashamed of himself as he had been after the episode in Wilhelmstal when his weakness had permitted him to spare this spy's life. Was he to be thus weak again? No! ...|$|E

50|$|Questions are {{put forward}} in Valley of Dreams, which {{were most likely}} to be {{answered}} in the third part to the trilogy. For example, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> Martians (who gain all their nutrients from soil the way plants do) need canals, since they do not drink water directly? It is hinted at (among other things) in Valley of Dreams that the Martians were gathering water for a higher creature that needed it.|$|E

5000|$|... "Then, if the Qoliqoli Bill {{has such}} {{deleterious}} consequences - even ignoring {{the human rights}} issue of depriving {{a large segment of}} country's population from access to essential amenities of life - <b>why</b> <b>would</b> then <b>the</b> international community, or any one with Fiji's well-being at heart, voice support for a person or government who is-hell-bent on spearheading the passage of the Bill, while demeaning the intent of the one who is having the courage to stand-up against such an evil?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Industrial Ecology" [...] gains {{mainstream}} attention {{later the}} same year (1989) through a [...] "Scientific American" [...] article named [...] "Strategies for Manufacturing".

5000|$|Despite Satan's efforts, Luna's {{campaign}} succeeds, and {{a mortal}} {{must now be}} chosen to become the new Incarnation of Good. However, the replacement must be selected by a unanimous vote {{of all the other}} Incarnations, including Satan himself—and <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> Incarnation of Evil approve a candidate who would effectively promote the cause of Good?

5000|$|Separate cemeteries and extensions. The primary {{cemetery}} {{has all of}} {{the graves}} aligned very neatly. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> original users of the cemetery suddenly start separate cemeteries with less organization? The Bedouin wanted to bury their people in the dry terrain so they imposed on the primary cemetery. What {{they did not want}} though was for their people to be next to the tainted and impure, so they buried them off to the side and in their own traditional way.|$|E
50|$|<b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> Foundation {{need a new}} artistic {{director}} although they have managed to do without one for the last decade? - Three reasons have been found. First, long after the benchmarking research on other reputed festivals, the Foundation has realized that no reformation of planning inevitably leads any Festival to discourage itself into maintaining bargaining power in performing arts market and finally to be forgotten, lose sponsorship and disappear in the market. For an arts festival, the core competence in programming is said to work like the investment of seed money in manufacturing industry.|$|E

5000|$|Veracruz {{authorities}} {{closed the}} case 15 August and claimed {{members of a}} drug gang confessed to the murders. Some uncertainty about the finality of the case was presented. [...] "But {{as soon as the}} arrests were announced on Wednesday, questions began to surface, beginning with the most obvious one. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> seven suspects, picked up on drug and weapons charges, spontaneously admit to far more serious crimes, in this case four brutal killings?"

5000|$|The police {{arrive and}} Poirot {{and the four}} people return to Pat's flat.

50|$|His {{arguments}} regarding perpendicular rays do {{not clearly}} explain why only perpendicular rays were perceived; <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>the</b> weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly? His later argument that refracted rays would {{be perceived as}} if perpendicular does not seem persuasive. However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe: Directly or indirectly, his De Aspectibus inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries. Kepler's later theory of the retinal image (which resolved {{the problem of the}} correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.|$|E
