60|$|It {{is obvious}} that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to find the law of a {{tendency}} by an induction from {{cases in which the}} tendency is counteracted. The laws of motion could never have been brought to light from the observation of bodies kept at rest by the equilibrium of opposing forces. Even where the tendency is not, in the ordinary sense of the word, counteracted, but only modified, by having its effects compounded with the effects arising from some other tendency or tendencies, we are still in an unfavorable position for tracing, by means of such cases, the law of the tendency itself. It would have been scarcely possible to discover the law that every body in motion tends to continue moving in a straight line, by an induction from instances in which the motion is deflected into a curve, by being compounded with the effect of an accelerating force. Notwithstanding the resources afforded in this description of cases by the Method of Concomitant Variations, the principles of a judicious experimentation prescribe that the law of each of the tendencies should be studied, if possible, in cases in which that tendency operates alone, or in combination with no agencies but those of which the effect can, from previous knowledge, be calculated and allowed for.|$|E

A clear understanding of what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> {{to learn about the}} universe is particularly important in the field of particle cosmology.

In particular, I explore the idea that a variety of different inflaton potentials may contribute to worlds ``like ours''. A careful examination of the conditional probability questions <b>we</b> <b>can</b> ask might give a physical measure of what is ``natural'' for an inflation potential which is quite different from those previously used.

40|$|AbstractWe study a vertex {{operator}} algebra whose Virasoro {{element is}} a sum of pairwise orthogonal rational conformal vectors with central charge 1 / 2. The most important {{example is the}} moonshine moduleV♮. In particular, we construct a series of vertex operator algebras whose full automorphism groups are finite. Namely, we construct vertex operator algebrasMD=∑∞i= 0 (MD) ifrom even linear binary codeD⊆Zn 2 and prove that if the minimum weight ofDis greater than 2 then (MD) 1 = 0 and the full automorphism group ofMDis finite. From the viewpoint of finite group theory, {{the construction of a}} vertex operator algebra has one advantage. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> <b>not</b> only automorphisms ofD, but also another one.

40|$|The {{first attempt}} to get {{statistical}} demand functions was made by H. L. Moore. H. Schultz, taking after Moore's research, worked out his bulky volume, "The Theory and Measurement of demand, 1938 ". Since then, quite a few demand functions of various goods and of various forms have been calculated by many investigators. Though the history of statistical demand function {{can be traced back}} to comparatively old times, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> frequently <b>expect</b> good results when we make an attempt to get a demand function of producer's or intermediate goods. In this field of empirical demand function, many problems have still been left untouched. Firms demand intermediate goods because they are useful to produce other goods, while consumer's goods are demanded to keep consumer's lives alive and comfortable. Accordingly, when we try to get statistical demand functions of intermediate goods, we must take into account this fact. We will not be able to expect to get a good demand function of intermediate goods if we apply the same method adopted to get a demand function of consumer's goods. The magnitude of demand for intermediate goods depend upon that of final demand. A firm that produces consumer's goods demands enough intermediate goods to supply a certain amount of consumer's goods which will counterbalance the anticipated demand for the goods. This kind of demand for intermediate goods is apparently caused by the final demand. It will in turn cause, another demand for intermediate goods. Thus final demand will stimulate demand for intermediate goods from industry to industry. In this paper, putting an importance to the causality from the final demand to the intermediate goods, I tried to present a method of short-range forecasting, applying it topaper pulp and pulp wood industries...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to map and assess the {{organisational}} and ideological development of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform party, the ELDR. More specifically, it seeks to analyse the degree of integration between {{the members of the}} ELDR over time, to identify factors {{that may or may not}} generate integration, to relate the development of the ELDR to earlier research about European parties, and finally to contribute to the ongoing debate about whether or not the traditional national party families are about to establish parties at the European level. The thesis is based on the assumption that parties adapt to their environment, in this case, the system of multi-level governance that characterises the European Union. As the European parties are composed of national parties, they are also dependent on the member parties' opportunities and motives for cooperation. If there is integration, <b>we</b> <b>can,</b> however, <b>not</b> only <b>expect</b> the European parties to adapt to their environment. As they become independent actors, they may also influence their environment. In other words, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> anticipate interaction between the European and national levels that leads to mutual adaptation, or Europeanisation. To be able to capture the interaction between the two levels, theories from international relations and comparative politics are combined. Based on interviews, participant observation, documentary research and content analysis of European election manifestos, the analyses shows that the members of the ELDR have over time reached a rather advanced level of integration, both organisationally and ideologically. Although it is possible to identify constraining factors to this development, the ELDR has, at least from what is known from literature, reached about the same level of development as the two other European parties, the Christian democratic EPP and the Social democratic PES. The internal integration of the ELDR is the outcome of a successive transfer of power from the member parties to the ELDR. By now, the ELDR can therefore be defined as a rather independent actor and as a type of party at the European level. This type of party is, however, not comparable to national parties. It is instead adapted to the institutional structure of the European Union, with, at least partly, a different organisation and different functions from those of national parties. digitalisering@um...|$|R

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{hermitian}} three-algebra formulation of ABJM theory to include U(1) factors. With attention payed to extra U(1) factors, we refine {{the classification of}} = 6 ABJM theories. We argue that essentially the only allowed gauge groups are SU(N) × SU(N), U(N) × U(M) and Sp(N) × U(1) {{and that we have}} only one independent Chern-Simons level in all these cases. Our argument is based on integrality of the U(1) Chern-Simons levels and supersymmetry. A relation between monopole operators and Wilson lines in Chern-Simons theory suggests certain gauge representations of the monopole operators. From this we classify cases where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> enhanced = 8 supersymmetry. We also show that there are two equivalent formulations of = 5 ABJM theories, based on hermitian three-algebra and quaternionic three-algebra respectively.

High mortality of bottom invertebrates in the yearly exposed zone between MSL and MSL-O, 70 m, 'and the exposure of large masses of Sea lettuce can be prevented in the future with a fixed waterlevel on MSL. The poverty of benthic fauna in the deep gullies is a consequence of stratification, causing anaerobic conditions. Solutions for the oxygen depletion, aimed at lowering the stratification by an as large as possible exhange with salter water from the North Sea or Oosterscheldt, combined with a reduction of the polderwater discharge on the lake, are therefore beneficial. By consequence, the higher and more stable salinity willincrease species richness and the musselbeds, until now only marginal, will have better chances to develop.
