5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and <b>wall</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{dendrochronology}} report gives construction {{dates of}} 1513–35 {{for the north}} aisle, 1485–1514 for the nave, and 1487–1523 for the porch. A song to the patron saint was sung at the dedication. Built in the Perpendicular style, with possible Norman origins, it consists of a chancel, nave and north and south aisles. Several monuments were removed by Rev. Granville Leveson-Gower in 1818 and some restoration occurred in 1884; it was re-seated and repaved in 1889. The building is of ashlar slate stone on a moulded plinth and <b>wall</b> <b>plate,</b> rag slate roofs with gable ends. The arcades each have seven four-centred arches of granite, supported by monolith granite pillars with sculpted capitals of St Stephens porcelain stone.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{diagnostic}} {{feature in the}} field for Catolasmus is the accessory imbricating plates, which are numerous (up to ten whorls, and prominent, nearly covering the primary <b>wall</b> <b>plates.</b> Individual whorl plates are strongly symmetrically ribbed. There are eight primary <b>wall</b> <b>plates,</b> with the rostrolatus entering the sheath, and free from the adjacent rostrum. <b>Wall</b> <b>plates</b> are solid, with no internal ribbing, as in Balanus. The basis is calcareous, thin, and does not form interdigitations with the <b>wall</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R

2500|$|... in 1985 {{a series}} of pieces were {{produced}} under the title The Bizarre Collection, with the mark for the [...] "Royal Staffordshire Pottery by Clarice Cliff", and marketed by the Midwinter pottery. These pieces were all hand painted, unlike some of the later production Wedgwood, and faithfully respected the original designs and production methods {{with the exception of}} the crocus conical sifter. The production actually took lace on the same premises as the original production line of the Newport pottery. [...] The 3 principal designs produced were Honolulu on a 12 inch Mei Ping vase, Summerhouse on a 13 inch [...] <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> and a striking version of Umbrellas and Rain on a conical bowl. These pieces can be identified with a tiny impressed 85 for the year of manufacture. There was also a selection of 6 conical sugar sifters, again hand painted, {{with the exception of the}} aforementioned Crocus which was lithographed. Whilst the purists still scoff at these pieces some 30 years later they are actually a very accurate representation of the originals they were copied from and in themselves are now becoming sought after not least because they allow collectors to acquire excellent pieces and a more affordable price.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} wall {{construction of}} the main range is {{for the most part}} lost through subsequent phases of development that replaced the original timber frame with a brick facade to the north and west. However, within the garret closet at the junction of the main range and east wing some wall construction remains in situ. The early remains comprise part of the south <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> of the main range, part of the east <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> of the east wing and a substantial post between the two. The lack of stave holes for in-fill on the soffit of the <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> indicates that the two ranges are contemporary.|$|E

50|$|Chamaesipho brunnea is an {{intertidal}} barnacle {{common in}} New Zealand, on North Island and South Island north of Stewart Island. Juveniles have six shell <b>wall</b> <b>plates,</b> reducing to four in adults, and with age, all plates become concrescent, with {{no trace of}} sutures inside or out. Shell is brown colored. The related, and sometimes associated Chamaesipho columna is much smaller in size, by nearly half, while Elminius, which can associate with both species, also has four shell <b>wall</b> <b>plates,</b> but plates remain distinct at all stages. The shell of C. columna corrodes to a pitted surface, while that of C. brunnea has a lamellar corrosion.|$|R

2500|$|Adult S. balanoides {{grow up to}} [...] in diameter, and are sessile, living {{attached}} to rocks and other solid substrates. They have six greyish <b>wall</b> <b>plates</b> surrounding a diamond-shaped operculum. The base of the shell is membranous in Semibalanus, unlike other barnacles which have calcified bases. When the tide rises to cover the barnacles, the operculum opens, and feathery cirri (modified thoracic appendages) are extended into the water to filter food from the seawater. When the tide falls, the operculum closes again to prevent desiccation; the reduction from the primitive condition of eight <b>wall</b> <b>plates</b> to six is believed to decrease water loss even further by {{reducing the number of}} sutures through which water can escape.|$|R
