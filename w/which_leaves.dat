5|$|Angel Beats! {{received}} generally positive reviews by critics. The {{integration of}} various individual elements together, such as musical performances, humor and action, was commended in one review but panned in another, {{saying that the}} story was overloaded with too many elements. P.A.Works was praised for the animation of the action sequences and attention to detail with the weapons used. A major flaw noted by critics, however, is that the anime is too short, <b>which</b> <b>leaves</b> many of the characters with untold back-stories. The anime was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2010.|$|E

5|$|No queen consort of Menkauhor {{has been}} {{identified}} for certain. The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has proposed that Khuit I was a queen of Menkauhor. Based on the dating of the tombs surrounding Khuit's burial, Seipel argues that she lived during the mid-Fifth Dynasty. By the process of elimination, he attributes known queens to each king of the period, <b>which</b> <b>leaves</b> only Menkauhor {{as a candidate for}} her king. These arguments are criticized by the Egyptologist Michel Baud, who observes that pharaohs could have had more than one queen.|$|E
5|$|Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid {{is often}} a result of {{chromosome}} number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, <b>which</b> <b>leaves</b> them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced gametes.

5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for smell in terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, <b>which</b> <b>leaves</b> it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, <b>which</b> <b>leaves</b> a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E

Declan initially blames Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) for not fixing the Parker family's car properly. However, he discovers that Johnno Brewer (Damien Aylward) tampered with the car thinking it belonged to Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Declan develops feelings for Kate Ramsay and he accompanies her to the Deb Ball. During schoolies week, he kisses her, <b>which</b> <b>leaves</b> him feeling guilty for betraying Bridget. Rebecca tells him that it is okay {{to move on and}} Declan asks Kate on a date. They eventually begin dating. Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie) tells Declan to declare his feelings for Kate, as Kate does not know how he feels. Declan then calls Kate his girlfriend. Declan does not get on well with his step-brother, Andrew (Jordan Smith), and when Andrew steals Declan's ideas for Neighbour Day, they fight. Declan moves in with Kate for a few days, but later returns home. Kate later decides that she is ready to sleep with Declan for the first time.|$|E
5|$|East of South Ann Street, both {{directions}} of NY167 overlap with NY5, following the four-lane road {{along the southern}} edge of downtown to a junction with East Main Street on the city's east side. NY167 reconnects with NY169 here, <b>which</b> <b>leaves</b> East Main Street to briefly follow NY5 and NY167 along the riverside arterial. The resulting overlap between NY167 and NY169 is a wrong-way concurrency, with NY169 southbound overlapping NY167 northbound and vice versa. NY169 splits from the highway after just one block to proceed south across the Mohawk River while NY5 and NY167 remain concurrent to {{the eastern edge of the}} city. Here, NY167 forks from NY5, running east as a two-lane street through the undeveloped eastern fringe of Little Falls.
