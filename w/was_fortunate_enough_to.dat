5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career at Hartlepool United in February 1978, {{after failing to}} win a contract at Chesterfield. He was coached by Billy Horner to become a strong centre-forward, using his natural strength and power to retain possession in attacking positions. Financial difficulties forced the club to sell him on to Leyton Orient for £25,000 in March 1982. After failing to impress in his two years in London, he was moved on to York City for £15,000 in March 1984. He played seven games in the club's Fourth Division title winning season in 1983–84, before transferring to Scunthorpe United for £40,000 in March 1986. He did not settle at the club, but in the summer he <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> win a £60,000 move up through three tiers to First Division side Coventry City.|$|E

Carpentier decided on a voluntary exile to France and arrived in Paris in 1928; he remained there until 1939, when he returned to Havana. When he left Cuba, he <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> avoid the political conflicts which had occurred during the 1930s. During this time certain positions were unacceptable to the authorities and Cuban intellectuals were forced to define their political position and for these and other political reasons he decided to leave.|$|E

Roland of Parma informed the pope of these decisions, and he <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> gain {{an opportunity for}} speech in the synod, which had just assembled in the Lateran Basilica, to deliver his message there announcing the dethronement.

25|$|Burns {{taught at}} Erasmus High School in Brooklyn for two years. While Burns enjoyed the {{educational}} field, she generally found {{the experience to}} be frustrating and wanted to continue her own studies. In 1906, at age twenty-seven, she moved to Germany to resume her studies in language. In Germany, Burns studied at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin from 1906 to 1909. Burns later moved to the United Kingdom, where she enrolled at Oxford University to study English. Burns <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have a very extensive educational background because her father, Edwards Burns, supported her and financed her international education.|$|E

25|$|The Transcaucasian SFSR was {{dissolved}} in 1936 {{and as a}} result Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union as the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. The transition to communism was difficult for Armenia, and for most of the other republics in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities placed Armenians under strict surveillance. There was almost no freedom of speech, even less so under Joseph Stalin. Any individual who was suspected of using or introducing nationalist rhetoric or elements in their works were labelled traitors or propangandists, and were sent to Siberia during Stalinist rule. Even Zabel Yessayan, a writer who <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> escape from ethnic cleansing during the Armenian Genocide, was quickly exiled to Siberia after returning to Armenia from France.|$|E

As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were tears in his eyes as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E

After Saltzwedel, UB-10 was assigned a new commander about every two to three months {{through the end of the}} war. Saltzwedel's immediate replacement on UB-10 was Kapitänleutnant (Kptlt.) Gustav Buch, who led the boat in sinking her only warship, the British destroyer [...] on 13 August; Lassoo was torpedoed off the Maas Lightvessel and sank with the loss of six men. Later in August, UB-10 <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> avoid attack by a British submarine when departing Zeebrugge. On the morning of 21 August, the outbound UB-10 had a rendezvous with the homeward-bound UC-10 off the North Hinder Lightship and exchanged information. UC-10 parted company with UB-10 at about 13:30 and resumed her course for Zeebrugge, but was torpedoed and sunk by , which had been lurking about the Schouwen Bank off Zeebrugge.|$|E

500|$|The next day, McClellan {{began his}} attack with several {{advances}} by the Union right flank, {{far from the}} position of the 21st. For much of the day, the IX Corps could hear the fighting and awaited orders to take the bridge in their front. The 21st even <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have a mail call that morning, and the men sat down to read letters from home while fighting raged around the Dunker Church two miles (3km) away. Finally, orders came at noon and Ferrero's brigade was moved closer to the bridge. It was a difficult target. On the opposite bank, a wooded bluff rose [...] above the creek. Concealed there was a small force of 400 Confederates who would successfully hold thousands of Union troops at bay for hours. The men of the 21st watched several successive charges on the bridge by brigades of the IX Corps, all of which were repulsed. Finally, Ferrero's brigade was ordered forward. Reaching the bridge at a run, the 21st was ordered to take up a position next to the left abutment, supplying covering fire, while the 51st New York Infantry and the 51st Pennsylvania Infantry finally carried the position. As the Confederates retreated, Ferrero's brigade was soon stationed {{at the top of the}} bluff. Later in the afternoon, around sunset, a Confederate counterattack nearly drove the IX Corps back across Antietam Creek. Ferrero's brigade held the bluff, however, playing a key role in checking the counterattack, and taking severe casualties in the process. The 21st listed 10 killed and 35 wounded, casualties of 30 percent.|$|E

He also engaged in disputations with the Mutazilites, whom he attacked for their belief in atoms. But the real role of al-Kindi in the conflict between philosophers and theologians would be to prepare the ground for debate. His works, says Deborah Black, contained all the seeds of future controversy that would be fully realized in al-Ghazali's Incoherence of the Philosophers.|$|E

2500|$|Trotter {{started his}} search for Clifton in 1987. Almost 30 years later, in June 2016, {{he and his team}} logged the {{coordinates}} of an unknown wreck. He stated that they had been working on a project that involved two other wrecks. The team dived the unknown lost vessel in September 2016, and when the diver surfaced, he reported to Trotter that the unidentified vessel was [...] "a whaleback". Trotter instantly told his crew that they might well have discovered Clifton, as it was the only as-yet-undiscovered whaleback to have been lost on Lake Huron. The senior diver wanted additional confirmation of this discovery before making it public. [...] After deputizing several team members with action cameras, {{it was clear that the}} wreck was indeed a whaleback and was therefore Clifton. Trotter's divers further explored and video-documented the wreck, making nine dives in July–August 2017. Careful work was necessary, as the long-lost hull had been found approximately 100miles (160km) from where she had been last seen and was believed to have sunk. Trotter made the identification public in September 2017. The delay made it possible for the news to be formally released on September 21, 2017, the 93rd anniversary of the vessel's last surface sighting. Trotter said that the discovery was [...] "a personal milestone" [...] in a quest that he <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> complete within his lifetime.|$|E
