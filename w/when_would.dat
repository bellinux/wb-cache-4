25|$|The {{foraging}} activity of Vespula vulgaris {{is dependent on}} the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2°C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2°C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be – i. e. <b>when</b> <b>would</b> be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.|$|E

Notwithstanding the strong policy arguments in favor of establishing this privilege and the serious harm that would be caused by its absence, no such protection had ever been held to exist. Not only was the concept that the judicial system was entitled to 'every man's evidence' itself deeply rooted in the Constitution, but merely determining the scope of the privilege (<b>when</b> <b>would</b> it apply?) and identifying who would receive it (only regularly employed journalists? freelancers? anyone?) were difficult matters at best."

2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the series would feel as [...] "adult" [...] as Jessica Jones, Colter replied, [...] "if you think Jessica is adult then we’re still keeping up with that pace ... we’ll {{continue}} along those lines of PG-16+". On whether Luke Cage would address current race issues, including Black Lives Matter, given the character's past (a wrongfully imprisoned black man), Colter said, [...] "this {{is not necessarily the}} platform to hit it head on" [...] but [...] "the things that he's going through will ring true {{for a lot of people}} in law enforcement" [...] and on the street. Loeb said on the issue, [...] "Luke Cage, when he came on the scene in the early 70s was for all intents and purposes the first black superhero. Given what’s going on present day, it just resonates." [...] Coker stated that Cage is [...] "someone that the community can touch and go to", adding, [...] "There’s never been a time in history where having a bulletproof black man" [...] has been so important. Luke Cage was also the first MCU property to use the word [...] "nigger" [...] or [...] "nigga", with Marvel having complete trust in Coker's use of it: the word is used casually in the series, though some characters, including Cage, prefer not to use it. Coker said the intent was never to use it [...] "in a way where it's flippant. I used it from the standpoint of, if we were going to eavesdrop on a conversation with African American people, with nobody else around, <b>when</b> <b>would</b> this word be used and how would it get used." [...] Coker also likened the use in the series to [...] "the way music used to treat it," [...] not having it be [...] "every other word of every other chorus, because at that point, it just gets silly." ...|$|E
2500|$|The admonition of [...] {{provoked}} the Rabbis to debate whether one should perform a worldly occupation {{in addition to}} studying Torah. The Rabbis in a Baraita questioned {{what was to be}} learned from the words of [...] "And you shall gather in your corn and wine and oil." [...] Rabbi Ishmael replied that since [...] says, [...] "This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate therein day and night," [...] one might think that one must take this injunction literally (and study Torah every waking moment). Therefore, [...] directs one to [...] "gather in your corn," [...] implying that one should combine Torah study with a worldly occupation. Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai questioned that, however, asking if a person plows in plowing season, sows in sowing season, reaps in reaping season, threshes in threshing season, and winnows in the season of wind, <b>when</b> <b>would</b> one find time for Torah? Rather, Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai taught that when Israel performs God's will, others perform its worldly work, as [...] says, [...] "And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, aliens shall be your plowmen and vine-trimmers; while you shall be called ‘Priests of the Lord,' and termed ‘Servants of our God.'" [...] And when Israel does not perform God's will, it has to carry out its worldly work by itself, as [...] says, [...] "And you shall gather in your corn." [...] And not only that, but the Israelites would also do the work of others, as [...] says, [...] "And you shall serve your enemy whom the Lord will let loose against you. He will put an iron yoke upon your neck until He has wiped you out." [...] Abaye observed that many had followed Rabbi Ishmael's advice to combine secular work and Torah study and it worked well, while others have followed the advice of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai to devote themselves exclusively to Torah study and not succeeded. Rava would ask the Rabbis (his disciples) not to appear before him during Nisan (when corn ripened) and Tishrei (when people pressed grapes and olives) so that they might not be anxious about their food supply {{during the rest of the}} year.|$|E
