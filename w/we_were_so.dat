5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to examine it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As {{for me and my}} companions, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, that we could not move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E

But others, {{they are}} not buoni, {{they are not}} good-natured to us." [...] And she nodded her head. And truly, I did not feel at all good-natured towards her: which she knew. And as for the Italian good-nature, it forms a sound and unshakeable basis {{nowadays}} for their extortion and self-justification and spite.|$|R

25|$|So it {{was more}} {{efficient}} and more moral to go for selected targets. In any case, {{it was the only}} way we could operate, because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> small. For us it was not a question of the professional honor of a soldier, it was the question of an idea, an aim that had to be achieved. We were aiming at a political goal. There are many examples of what we did to be found in the Bible – Gideon and Samson, for instance. This had an influence on our thinking. And we also learned from the history of other peoples who fought for their freedom – the Russian and Irish revolutionaries, Giuseppe Garibaldi and Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
500|$|Mackie plays Sergeant J.T. Sanborn. Describing the {{experience}} of filming in Jordan in the summer, he said, [...] "It was so desperately hot, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> easily agitated. But that movie was like doing a play. We really looked out for each other, {{and it was a}} great experience. It made me believe in film." ...|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack was {{composed}} by regular Burton collaborator Danny Elfman. Burton approached Pearl Jam during post-production to request an original {{song for the}} soundtrack and closing credits. After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder wrote [...] "Man of the Hour", completing the demo by the next day. It was recorded by the band four days later. Guitarist Mike McCready stated, [...] "We were so blown away by the movie... Eddie and I were standing around talking about it afterwards and were teary-eyed. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> emotionally charged and moved by the imagination and humanity that we felt because of the movie." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{series was}} {{initially}} titled Britney and Kevin: Can You Handle Our Truth?, before its title {{was changed to}} Britney and Kevin: Chaotic, with [...] "Can you handle our truth?" [...] becoming its tagline. All of the footage shot for OnTourage was used for Britney and Kevin: Chaotic. According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and when I got the camera out, it made me feel better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> nervous being together. I'm really shy, and when I had the camera in my hand, it made me feel more outspoken." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Bowman was {{not a fan of}} the episode, saying [...] "The show proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated, and there wasn't enough time to shoot the show properly because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> close to the Christmas break. I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although there are things in it I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, I thought the show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters ever {{knew what was going on}} and I don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people. I didn't feel like I was shooting an episode of the X-Files, and I think I let Chris Carter down a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|The album did not chart {{as well in}} the United States as its predecessor, peaking {{at number}} 148 on the Billboard 200. It was, however, the band's first album to chart on the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number 45. Many of the songs on Leave Home were not {{considered}} by Mickey Leigh to be [...] "radio–friendly" [...] because [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was about Intoxicative inhalant. Joey relates: [...] "We thought we had a lotta songs that should've been hits. If you grew up in the sixties, things would just get played and be hits right off the bat. So we thought since our music was doin' something unique that everyone would pick up on that. What really happened was <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> alien that no one wanted to touch us.

500|$|While {{developing}} new characters {{for the sixth}} season of Desperate Housewives, showrunner Marc Cherry and his writing staff aimed to create a housewife who would {{be different from the}} other female characters on the series. Cherry stated that he [...] "wanted someone who didn't seem suburban, who has a tough, blue-collar exterior." [...] The staff ultimately decided upon an Italian New Yorker. Cherry stated that part of his inspiration for the character came from his childhood neighbors. He explained, [...] "When I was growing up in Huntington, Calif., two Italian families from the Bronx moved in across the street. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> WASPy, so middle American. They had their own ethnic identity. It was an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Cherry insisted that Angie was not replacing the deceased Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan) as a main housewife but would instead be the focus of the season's mystery.|$|E
500|$|Another dispute {{occurred}} between TLC and Rolston {{was over the}} choice of clothing. The director was interested in [...] "tight and sexy" [...] lingerie looks for them while they only liked baggy, tomboy clothes. Combining the two, he finally gave out {{the idea of the}} girls wearing the silk pajamas with each custom-made cost more than 1,000. Thomas also talked about their exhaustion on the set: [...] "People don't realize that for video shoots you have to wake up at like 5 in the morning for your call time. So when we did that part {{at the very end of}} the video where we're talking to the camera and looking all silly, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> tired. But sometimes that ends up being your best shots." [...] Eventually, she praised Rolston's final product for the group as [...] "excellent" [...] while Lopes said that after two failed ones, the director finally gave them a [...] "real video." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} the {{inspiration}} for the film, saying: [...] "I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1982, Gittings remembered, [...] "I {{joined the}} {{movement}} in 1958, when the subject of homosexuality was still shrouded in complete silence. There were no radio talk shows or TV documentaries. In all the United States, there were maybe a half dozen groups, two hundred people active in all." [...] The Daughters of Bilitis served as a social alternative to bars for lesbians, but took great care to deny that they were [...] "arranging for 'immoral contacts'." [...] While president of the DOB in New York, attending members numbered between ten and forty per meeting. They met twice a month and often invited doctors, psychiatrists, ministers and attorneys to address their meetings, even if the message was clearly disparaging to lesbians. Gittings recalled, [...] "At first <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> grateful just to have people— anybody— pay attention {{to us that we}} listened to and accepted everything they said, no matter how bad it was...anything that helped to break the silence, no matter how silly or foolish it may look to us today, was important." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the opening}} leg, U2 sold 528,763tickets and grossed US$13,215,414 in 32shows. They grossed US$67million overall in 73 North American shows in 1992, easily the highest amount for any touring artist that year. At the time, {{this was the}} third-highest gross for a North American tour, behind the Rolling Stones' 1989 Steel Wheels Tour and New Kids on the Block's 1990 Magic Summer Tour. For 1992, Zoo TV ticket sales in America and Europe totalled 2.9million. The [...] "Zooropa" [...] stadium leg the {{following}} year played to more than 2.1million people over 43dates between 9 May and 28 August. In total, the Zoo TV Tour played to about 5.3million people. The band incurred heavy expenses to produce the tour, leading to only a small profit. According to McGuinness, [...] "We grossed $30million in T-shirt sales. Without those we'd be fucked." [...] Bono later said, [...] "When we built Zoo TV, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> close to bankruptcy that if five percent fewer people went, U2 was bankrupt. Even in our irresponsible, youthful and fatal disregard of such material matters, it was terrifying." ...|$|E
500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All Is Said and Done More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E

500|$|The second {{adaptation}} was the 1958 British drama film A Night to Remember starring Kenneth More, {{which is}} still widely regarded as [...] "the definitive cinematic telling of the story." [...] The film came about after its eventual director, Roy Ward Baker, and its producer, Belfast-born William MacQuitty both acquired copies of the book – Baker from his favorite bookshop and MacQuitty from his wife – and decided to obtain the film rights. MacQuitty had actually seen Titanic being launched on 31 May 1911 and still remembered the occasion vividly. He met Lord and brought him on board the production as a consultant. The film diverges from both {{the book and the}} NBC TV adaptation in focusing on a central character, Second Officer Charles Lightoller, played by More. Its conclusion reflects Lord's world-historical theme of a [...] "world changed for ever" [...] with a fictional conversation between two survivors, Lightoller and Colonel Archibald Gracie, sitting on an overturned lifeboat. Lightoller declares that the disaster is [...] "different ... Because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> sure. Because even though it's happened, it's still unbelievable. I don't think I'll ever feel sure again. About anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{a hundred}} actresses had been {{considered}} for Emily before one of the casting agents taped Emily Blunt reading some of the lines elsewhere on the Fox lot as she was leaving for her flight to London following her audition for Eragon. Although she read them in her native British accent despite the character being written as American as {{she is in the}} novel, Frankel was interested; Finerman liked her for her sense of humor. After the makers of Eragon cast Sienna Guillory, Frankel called her in the bathroom of [...] "some dive club" [...] in London, where she was consoling herself with her sister. He told her that while he would have cast her just from the tape, the studio wanted to see another audition with her dressed more in character. She insisted on continuing to play the character as British; Both Hathaway and Emily Blunt lost weight for their roles, with Hathaway later recounting that [...] " [...] and I would clutch at each other and cry because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> hungry." [...] Blunt later denied rumors she did this at the filmmakers' request.|$|E
500|$|According to the project's lead {{programmer}} Ed Boon, Mortal Kombat II was [...] "intended to {{look different}} than the original MK" [...] and [...] "had everything we wanted to put into MK but {{did not have time}} for." [...] In 2012, Boon placed creating the game among his best Mortal Kombat memories, recalling: [...] "When we did Mortal Kombat II, we got new equipment and all that stuff, but it was funny because when we started working on Mortal Kombat II, the mania, the hysteria of the home versions of Mortal Kombat I was literally all around us. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> busy working on the next one, going from seven characters to 12 and two Fatalities per character and all these other things that that consumed every second." [...] Both the theme and art style of MKII were slightly darker than those of its predecessor, although a more vibrant color palette was employed and the new game had a much richer color depth than the previous game. A new feature was the use of multiple layers of parallax scrolling in the arcade version. The game was made to be less serious with the addition of humorous alternative finishing moves.
