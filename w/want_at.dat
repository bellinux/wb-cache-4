25|$|Barnes {{immersed}} {{herself in}} risky situations {{in order to}} access experiences that a previous generation of homebound women had been denied. Writing about the traditionally masculine domain of boxing from the ringside, Barnes explored boxing as a window into women's modern identities. In 1914, she first posed the question “What do women <b>want</b> <b>at</b> a fight?” in an article titled “My Sisters and I at a New York Prizefight” published in New York World magazine. According to Irene Gammel, “Barnes’ essay effectively begins to unravel an entire cultural history of repression for women”.|$|E

Newman {{proposed}} in spring 2007, and the two married on November 23, 2007, in an [...] "intimate and relaxed" [...] ceremony in Los Angeles at Greystone Mansion, where Newman had proposed. King told InStyle magazine, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>at</b> least three children." [...] On May 3, 2013, it was announced that King and her husband were expecting their first child. Their son, James Knight Newman was born October 6, 2013, weighing 7lbs. 2oz.|$|E
500|$|Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole was keen to win {{his first}} trophy in the final: [...] "We don't feel under any great pressure, but we do feel excited about the {{possibility}} of winning our first trophy, we've just been imagining {{what it would be like}} to lift the trophy, who's going where in the line if we win it, and how we'll run round Cardiff with it." [...] Teammate Frank Lampard was also keen {{to win his}} first trophy: [...] "If you haven't won anything, a runners-up medal is not what you <b>want</b> <b>at</b> all." [...] He also stated that Chelsea manager José Mourinho's desire to win had been rubbing off on the players: [...] "He actually gets angrier with each one, so every time we lose it's the worst I've seen him, he's a winner, though, that's what you expect, and that's the attitude that's needed at Chelsea these days." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{opposition}} Labour party protested at Home's appointment; its leader, Hugh Gaitskell, {{said that}} it was [...] "constitutionally objectionable" [...] for a peer {{to be in charge of}} the Foreign Office. Macmillan responded that an accident of birth should not be allowed to deny him the services of [...] "the best man for the job– the man I <b>want</b> <b>at</b> my side". Hurd comments, [...] "Like all such artificial commotions it died down after a time (and indeed was not renewed with any strength nineteen years later when Margaret Thatcher appointed another peer, Lord Carrington, to the same post)." [...] The Home–Heath partnership worked well. Despite their different backgrounds and ages– Home an Edwardian aristocrat and Heath a lower-middle class meritocrat raised in the inter-war years– the two men respected and liked one another. Home supported Macmillan's ambition to get Britain into the EEC, and was happy to leave the negotiations in Heath's hands.|$|E
500|$|On November 28, in {{response}} to this incident, a Chilean government spokesman stated that a scheduled visit to Chile by the Peruvian defense minister, Antero Flores Aráoz, might be inopportune given the circumstances. The following day, Flores Aráoz announced his decision to postpone his trip after conferring with the Foreign Affairs Minister, José García Belaúnde. Several members of the Peruvian government commented on the spokesman's remarks including president García who said the country [...] "did not accept pressure or orders from anybody outside of Peru". Donayre defended the video, declaring that Peruvian citizens have a right to say whatever they <b>want</b> <b>at</b> private gatherings and that even though he is scheduled to retire on December 5 he will not be forced to resign early under external pressure. As a consequence of these exchanges, tensions between Peru and Chile rose again; president Bachelet met with top aides on December 1 to discuss the matter and possible courses of action. Meanwhile, in Lima, Congressman Gustavo Espinoza became the center of attention as the main suspect of leaking the video to Chilean press and politicians. Donayre ended his tenure as Commanding General of the Army on December 5, 2008, as expected; president Alan García appointed General Otto Guibovich as his replacement.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{most of whom}} seemed to have judged it on different criteria from their normal {{because it was a}} holiday episode. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon may have called it [...] "sickly oversweet", but maintained [...] "that's exactly what you <b>want</b> <b>at</b> Christmas". His colleague Patrick Burns wrote, [...] "Holiday episodes tread a dangerous line between sweet and saccharine, but this episode splits the difference perfectly." [...] The title of the article they wrote with Meghan Brown, [...] "Glee Does Christmas: Cheesy but Charming", found echoes in other reviews: both Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times and Anthony Benigno of the Daily News also thought the episode was quite cheesy, but Benigno characterized it as [...] "the good kind of cheese; the kind you'll eat for antipasti before grandma and grandpa bring out the roast beef on Christmas dinner", and Reiter's bottom line was that it [...] "may not have been the most wonderful episode of the year, but it did feature moments that twinkled and shined like the lovingly trimmed family tree." [...] Time James Poniewozik was less enthusiastic when he noted that Glee delivered an episode [...] "that touched on all the requisite holiday bases but that felt perfunctory", and added that it was [...] "generally ho-ho-hum". Robert Canning of IGN gave it a [...] "great" [...] 8 out of 10, but stated that [...] "the episode as a whole was lacking just a bit to turn it into an absolute classic", and The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave the episode a [...] "B−" [...] and wrote, [...] "I guess I'd say that I thought the episode worked moment-to-moment, without working as an overall narrative", but also stated that it was [...] "positively filled with stupid moments".|$|E

2500|$|... “One {{morning as}} I {{came into the}} dining-tent I noticed that {{everybody}} but the Indians had been served with hot cakes. [...] This did not bother me much, as Indians do not eat such food. [...] At dinner-time that same day, when I sat down to our table, I saw to my surprise that there were pancakes before us. These were the ‘left-overs’ from the morning, and now the cook wanted to feed them to us. [...] Although I was very angry, I made no remark, but quietly left the table and went over where Buffalo Bill and the head officials of the show were eating dinner. Colonel Cody asked, ‘What is it, Standing Bear?’ ‘Colonel Cody,’ I replied, ‘this morning all the other races represented in the show were served with pancakes, but the Indians were not given any. [...] We do not object to that, as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on our table and expects us to eat what was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with me, Standing Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, you are trying to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal. [...] I want you to understand, sir, that I will not stand for such treatment. [...] My Indians are the principal feature of this show, and they are the one people I will not allow to be misused or neglected. [...] Hereafter, see to it that they get just exactly what they <b>want</b> <b>at</b> meal-time. Do you understand me, sir”’ [...] ‘Yes, sir, oh, yes, sir,’ exclaimed the embarrassed manager. [...] After that, we had no more trouble about our meals.” ...|$|E
