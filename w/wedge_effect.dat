The oil must survive high temperatures and harsh conditions with a high-speed sliding contact. Lubrication is particularly difficult as the rings have an oscillating motion rather than continuous rotation, as for a bearing journal. At the limits of piston movement, the ring stops and reverses direction. This disrupts the normal oil <b>wedge</b> <b>effect</b> of a hydrodynamic bearing, leading to pronounced wear and the formation of a 'step' in the cylinder bore around the height of the upper ring.

The objective of this investigation was to verify if some simplifications used in bi-dimensional FEA models are acceptable regarding the analysis of stresses caused by <b>wedge</b> <b>effect.</b> Three plane strain (PS) and two axisymmtric (Axi) models were studied. One PS model represented the apical third of the root entirely, in dentin (PS-nG). The other models included gutta-percha in the apical third, and differed regarding dentin-post relationship: bonded (PS-B and Axi-B) or nonbonded (PS-nB and Axi-nB). Mesh discretization and material properties were similar for all cases. Maximum principal stress (sigma(max)) was analyzed as a response to a 165 N longitudinal load. Stress magnitude and orientation varied widely (PS-nG: 10. 3 MPa; PS-B: 0. 8 MPa; PS-nB: 10. 4 MPa; Axi- 13 : 0. 2 MPa, Axi-nB: 10. 8 MPa). Axi-nB was the only model where all (sigma(max) vectors at the apical third were perpendicular to the model plane. Therefore, it is adequate to demonstrate the tendency to vertical root fractures caused by <b>wedge</b> <b>effect.</b> Axi- 13 showed only part of the (sigma(max) perpendicular to the model plane while PS models showed sigma(max) on the model plane. In these models, sigma(max) orientation did not represent a situation where vertical root fracture would occur due to <b>wedge</b> <b>effect.</b> Adhesion between post and dentin significantly reduced (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

40|$|The {{packing of}} solid {{particles}} {{is an important}} research topic in particle mechanics and powder technology. However, {{it is difficult to}} predict and measure the packing density of particles. Although theoretical models for prediction and test methods for measurement have been developed, the predicted values and measured results do not always agree with each other. Through in-depth review of the theoretical predictions by the existing 2 -parameter model and the respective measured results, it is postulated in this thesis that the discrepancies between the predicted values and measured results are mainly due to the <b>wedging</b> <b>effect</b> – a new interaction effect that has not been considered in previous packing models. The <b>wedging</b> <b>effect</b> occurs when some isolated fine particles are entrapped at the gaps between the coarse particles or when the gaps between the coarse particles are not wide enough for the formation of complete layers of fine particles. Such <b>wedging</b> <b>effect</b> would reduce the packing density and therefore should be considered in particle packing modeling. To provide additional measured results covering a wider range of size ratio than those published by others, a comprehensive experimental study of measuring the packing densities of binary mixes of mono-sized and rounded particles has been conducted. The <b>wedging</b> <b>effect</b> was further explained and more importantly quantified in the light of these experimental results. And, by incorporating the <b>wedging</b> <b>effect,</b> a 3 -parameter packing model has been developed. The 3 -parameter model was calibrated by fitting the theoretical predictions with the measured results of the comprehensive study conducted herein. After calibration, the theoretical predictions agree very well with the measured results, with the prediction error generally within 1. 43 %. Further, some of the particle packing models were evaluated by comparing with published test results. The particle packing models so evaluated include the 2 -parameter model (with the loosening and wall effects incorporated), the compressible model (with the loosening, wall and compaction effects incorporated) and the 3 -parameter model (with the loosening, wall and <b>wedging</b> <b>effects</b> incorporated). It was found that the accuracy of the models varies with both the size ratio and volumetric fractions of the binary mix. In general, when the size ratio is larger than 0. 65, all the packing models are sufficiently accurate. However, when the size ratio is smaller than 0. 65, the 2 -parameter model and the compressible model would either over- or under-estimate the packing density with the prediction errors generally larger at around the volumetric fractions giving maximum packing density. On the other hand, within the whole range of size ratio from 0. 02 to 0. 74 covered by the test results used for evaluation of the packing models, the packing density prediction by the 3 -parameter model are accurate to within an absolute error of 0. 020. Overall, the better performance of the 3 -parameter model may be attributed to the incorporation of the <b>wedging</b> <b>effect.</b> With the <b>wedging</b> <b>effect</b> incorporated, the 3 -parameter model is the most accurate and generally applicable to the whole range of size ratio from 0 to 1. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

For the sake of concrete mix optimization, {{it is important to have}} a particle packing model that can accurately predict the packing density of multi-component particulate systems.

In general, continuum damage methods {{have proven to be}} efficient in numerical models. However, {{as a consequence of the}} inherent homogenization, conventional continuum damage methods such as smeared crack modeling, may have difficulties in adequately capturing these inter-laminar effects due to their inability to replicate the <b>wedge</b> <b>effect.</b> Therefore, in this paper, a discrete method based on the extended finite element method, XFEM, is introduced to explicitly model an inclined crack and to approximate the material response during transverse compressive ply failure. The method is applied in 2 D with a predefined inclined crack and a cohesive zone governed by a linear softening traction-separation law. The results of the model are then compared against ¬a similar XFEM approach, with a vertical crack utilizing a transformation in the cohesive zone, and a 3 D smeared crack model. Results indicate that the smeared crack approach and the cohesive XFEM approaches successfully predict identical material responses when plies are meshed with one element per ply thickness. By further mesh refinement through the ply thickness, the XFEM approaches show a definitive mesh convergence whereas the smeared crack model is not applicable anymore and predictions become unreliable. Moreover, the proposed cohesive XFEM approach can accurately model the geometrical wedge explicitly, which provides an improved approximation of the <b>wedge</b> <b>effect</b> in comparison to the other two models.

40|$|In many {{fields of}} industries, {{it has been}} found that the {{properties}} of granular materials are intimately related to their packing densities. To find the particle size distribution for optimum packing density rendering the best performance of granular materials, it is useful to have a particle packing model which can accurately predict the packing density of granular materials. Nevertheless, the development of particle packing model is difficult and complex as there are many factors affecting packing density including particle shape, packing method and formation of agglomerates between cohesive fine particles. Even for binary mixes of particles, the existing 2 -parameter model which takes into account the loosening effect and the wall effect and assumes a linear relationship between specific volume (reciprocal of packing density) and volumetric fractions of particles, does not give satisfactory prediction. Through comprehensive experimental study, the author has found that the deviations from experimental results are caused by the <b>wedging</b> <b>effect</b> of the fine particles situating at the gaps between the coarse particles producing extra voids. The newly identified <b>wedging</b> <b>effect</b> was incorporated into the 3 -parameter model, in which the specific volume is no longer a linear function of the volumetric fractions. This thesis presents the further development of the 3 -parameter model, which is extended to ternary mixes and multi-component mixes of spherical and non-spherical particles with various factors affecting packing density taken into account. In extending the 3 -parameter model to ternary mixes and multi-component mixes of particles, an approach was adopted so that the final packing density of the mixture consisting of several size classes was taken as the minimum of those determined from a set of equations, each corresponding to one dominant size class. The extended model was verified using the experimental results of spherical particles obtained from this study and cylindrical particles obtained from the literature. The accuracy of the model was also compared to other existing models for multi-component mixes, such as the 2 -parameter model and the compressible packing model. For more general applications to angular aggregate particles, the 3 -parameter model was modified by a number of adjustments which include the re-derivation of the interaction functions of the three parameters accounting for the loosening, wall and <b>wedging</b> <b>effects</b> under both uncompacted and compacted packing conditions. However, it was demonstrated that without the consideration of the formation of agglomerates between cohesive fine particles, which would produce extra voids known as the agglomeration effect, would result in interaction functions giving unreasonable interpretation of the various interaction effects. Consequently, the 3 -parameter model was also modified to account for the agglomeration effect. Finally, for application in concrete industry, the 3 -parameter model was also modified for continuous grading of aggregate particles, which would be helpful in determining the optimum particle size distribution of aggregate particles so as to further improve the performance of concrete. Overall, the modified and extended 3 -parameter model was verified to provide accurate prediction and would be a useful tool for optimizing the particle size distribution in various fields of industries. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

30|$|The occlusal force {{does not}} load {{only on the}} screw. The {{internal}} conical connection interface also helps to transfer and distribute the loading force to the implant [13]. The axial compressive component of occlusal force during oral function causes axial displacement of the abutment to the implant connection, increasing the frictional resistance and screw joint stability of the dental implant [7, 8]. Three factors {{that may lead to}} the axial displacement of the implant-abutment connection are machining tolerance, the <b>wedge</b> <b>effect,</b> and the settling effect. Firstly, machining tolerance is a dimensional variation characteristic of machined components. The precision of every implant component varies during manufacturing due to machining tolerance [14]. Secondly, the <b>wedge</b> <b>effect</b> occurs when tightening torque or loading force is applied to the abutment [15]. The abutment acts as a wedge transferring the axial force directly to the implant. Lastly, the settling effect occurs when rough spots on the contacting surfaces of the connection are flattened under load [16]. It causes the two surfaces to come closer together and leads to axial displacement. This axial displacement causes the length of the abutment screw to shorten, diminishing the screw preload [17]. The settling effect is the main cause of screw loosening. When the abutment is fastened to the implant body with the abutment screw, a settling phenomenon occurs in which the implant body and the abutment are deformed. Even if fastened at 30 [*]N[*]cm, depending on the implant system, the loosening torque becomes smaller than the 7 to 10 % fastening torque. After 5 [*]min from this point, it is necessary to loosen it twice [18]. The degree of settling depends on the surface roughness, surface hardness, and magnitude of the tightening torque and of the occlusal loading force [16]. On the one hand, the settling effect [17] causes the axial displacement leading to the decrease of the screw preload. On the other hand, the axial displacement causes the cone connection surface adaptation providing frictional resistance and screw-joint stability [7, 8].|$|E

This situation is mirrored to the north where a large spreading asymmetry is also developed. Other back-arc basins such as the Lau Basin have undergone large rift jumps and propagation events that have transferred spreading centers from arc-distal to more arc-proximal positions [...] although recent spreading rates appear to be relatively symmetric with perhaps small rift jumps. The cause of asymmetric spreading in back-arc basins remains poorly understood. General ideas invoke asymmetries relative to the spreading axis in arc melt generation processes and heat flow, hydration gradients with distance from the slab, mantle <b>wedge</b> <b>effects,</b> and evolution from rifting to spreading.|$|R

The next step, left for future research, is to draw conclusions about the <b>wedge’s</b> behavioral <b>effects</b> and ultimate incidence. Thus, with one exception noted below, the estimates in this paper do not require any assumption about the relative incidence of labor taxes on employers and employees.|$|R
