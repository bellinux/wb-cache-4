5|$|Orectolobiformes: They are {{commonly}} referred to as the carpet sharks, including zebra sharks, nurse sharks, wobbegongs, and the <b>whale</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is robust {{morphological}} {{support for}} {{the placement of the}} zebra shark, the <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> (Rhincodon typus), and the nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum, Nebrius ferrugineus, and Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum) in a single clade. However, the interrelationships between these taxa are disputed by various authors. Dingerkus (1986) suggested that the <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> is the closest relative of the zebra shark, and proposed a single family encompassing all five species in the clade. Compagno (1988) suggested affinity between this species and either Pseudoginglymostoma or a clade containing Rhincodon, Ginglymostoma, and Nebrius. Goto (2001) placed the zebra shark as the sister group to a clade containing Rhincodon and Ginglymostoma.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E
40|$|The <b>whale</b> <b>shark’s</b> {{distinctive}} body markings {{are similar}} to those of other orectolobiform sharks. These markings likely conceal their sluggish, bottom-dwelling relatives through disruptive colouration. It is argued here that the <b>whale</b> <b>shark’s</b> body markings similarly function to camouflage them in their pelagic environment. The <b>whale</b> <b>shark’s</b> countershaded colouration eliminates the optical appearance of relief against its visual background. Disruptive patterns resembling elements common in its environmental background break up the <b>whale</b> <b>shark’s</b> outline. Other possible functions for the <b>whale</b> <b>shark’s</b> markings are considered, including: radiation shielding, intraspecific communication (species recognition, sex recognition, postural displays, schooling coordination), and interspecific communication (aggressive mimicry). However, they are either discounted or evidence substantiating these functions is found to be lacking...|$|R

5|$|Its {{large size}} {{may have been}} due to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, and it may have also been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was a close relative to them, megalodon may have also been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the <b>whale</b> <b>shark,</b> are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. That is to say, it is unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are around 100 African bush elephant left in Eritrea, the most northerly of East Africa's elephants.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the megamouth is distinctive, but little else is known about it. It has a brownish-black colour on top, is white underneath, and has an asymmetrical tail with a long upper lobe, {{similar to that of}} the thresher shark. The interior of its gill slits are lined with finger-like gill rakers that capture its food. A relatively poor swimmer, the megamouth has a soft, flabby body and lacks caudal keels. The megamouth is considerably less active than the other filter-feeding sharks, the basking shark and the <b>whale</b> <b>shark.</b> The megamouth has a stout body and a long, wide bulbous head.|$|E
40|$|<b>Whale</b> <b>sharks</b> Rhincodon typus {{are large}} filter-feeders that are {{frequently}} observed feeding in surface zooplankton patches at their tropical and subtropical coastal aggregation sites. Using signature fatty acid (FA) analyses from their subdermal connective tissue and stomach content analysis, we tested whether <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> in Mozambique and South Africa predominantly feed on these prey and/or what other prey they target. Arachidonic acid (20 : 4 ω 6; mean ± SD = 17. 8 ± 2. 0 % of total FA), 18 : 0 and 18 : 1 ω 9 c were major FA of <b>whale</b> <b>sharks,</b> while in contrast, coastal epipelagic zooplankton collected near feeding <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> had 22 : 6 ω 3 (docosahexaenoic acid), 16 : 0 and 20 : 5 ω 3 (eicosapentaenoic acid) as major FA. Stomach contents of 3 stranded sharks {{were dominated by}} mysids (61 to 92 % of prey items), another one by sergestids (56 %), and a fifth stomach was empty. The dominant mysids (82 % index of relative importance) were demersal zooplankton that migrate into the water column at night, suggesting night-time feeding by <b>whale</b> <b>sharks.</b> High levels of bacterial FA in <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> (5. 3 ± 1. 4 % TFA), indicating a detrital link, potentially via demersal zooplankton, also support night-time foraging activity. High levels of oleic acid (16. 0 ± 2. 5 %) in <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> and their similarity with FA profiles of shrimp, mysids, copepods and myctophid fishes from the meso- and bathypelagic zone suggest that <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> also forage in deep-water.

25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, longbill spearfish) and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and <b>whale</b> <b>shark).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{megamouth shark}} (Megachasma pelagios) is {{a species of}} {{deepwater}} shark. It is rarely seen by humans and is {{the smallest of the}} three extant filter-feeding sharks alongside the <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> and basking shark. Since its discovery in 1976, few megamouth sharks have been seen, with 63 specimens known to have been caught or sighted as of May 2017, including four recordings on film. Like the other two planktivorous sharks, it swims with its enormous mouth wide open, filtering water for plankton and jellyfish. It is distinctive for its large head with rubbery lips. It is so unlike any other type of shark that it is usually considered to be the sole extant species in the distinct family Megachasmidae, though suggestion has been made that it may belong in the family Cetorhinidae, of which the basking shark is currently the sole extant member. In addition to the living M.pelagios, however, two extinct megamouth species – the Priabonian M.alisonae and the Oligocene–Miocene M.applegatei – have also recently been proposed on the basis of fossilized tooth remains. However, the Cretaceous-aged M. comanchensis has been recently reclassified as an odontaspid shark in the genus Pseudomegachasma, and is in fact unrelated to the megamouth shark despite similar teeth morphology.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} a few alleged {{sightings}} of large sharks, purportedly megalodon, measuring anywhere from [...] throughout the 1900s, however they all lack supporting evidence. More likely they were misidentified whale sharks. One Polynesian myth regards a [...] shark called Lord of the Deep, but this is probably an exaggeration of a <b>whale</b> <b>shark.</b> Reports of supposedly fresh megalodon teeth, such as those made by [...] in 1873 which were erroneously dated to be around 11,000 to 24,000 years old, are probably teeth that were well-preserved by a thick mineral-crust precipitate of manganese dioxide, and so had a lower decomposition rate and retained a white color during fossilization. Fossil megalodon teeth can vary in color from off-white to dark browns and greys, and some fossil teeth may have been redeposited into a younger stratum. The claims that megalodon could remain elusive in the depths, similar to the megamouth shark which was discovered in 1976, are unlikely as the shark evolved around warm coastal waters and probably could not survive in the cold and nutrient-poor deep sea environment.|$|E
500|$|Most {{sharks are}} ovoviviparous, {{meaning that the}} eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother's body and that the egg's yolk and fluids {{secreted}} by glands in {{the walls of the}} oviduct nourishes the embryos. The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. Lamniforme sharks practice oophagy, where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs. [...] Taking this a step further, [...] sand tiger shark sharklets cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos. [...] The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth. The <b>whale</b> <b>shark</b> is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. Dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. Basking sharks and frilled sharks appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.|$|E

500|$|In New Zealand, {{sharks and}} rays appear to be {{important}} prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks and shortfin mako sharks. With sharks, orcas may herd them {{to the surface and}} strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in {{sharks and rays}} by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a [...] female killed a [...] great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down in her mouth and inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia.

40|$|Activity {{patterns}} of animals often relate to environmental {{variables such as}} food availability and predation pressure. Technological advances are providing us with new tools to monitor and better understand these activity patterns. We used animal-attached data loggers recording acceleration and depth to compare activity patterns and vertical habitat use of <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> (Rhincodon typus) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. <b>Whale</b> <b>sharks</b> showed a moderate reverse diel vertical migration but exhibited a clear crepuscular pattern in locomotory activity. Peak activity occurred at sunset, whereas vertical movement peaked prior to this. Typical ram surface filter feeding could be identified and occurred primarily during sunset and the first hours of night. At such times, direct observations indicated <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> were feeding on tropical krill swarms. Kinematic analysis of postural data and data from vertical movement suggests that <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> at Ningaloo spend ~ 8 min per day actively ram surface filter feeding. Considering the high biomass present in krill schools, {{it is estimated that}} <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> at Ningaloo have a similar energy intake as those at other aggregation sites. Diel patterns in activity and diving behaviour suggest that <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> have tuned their diving behaviour in anticipation of the formation of these high-density patches which appear to only be periodically, but predictably available at sunset. Our results confirm that diel patterns in vertical habitat selection and vertical movements do not necessarily reflect patterns in activity and foraging behaviour.

40|$|While shark-based {{tourism is}} {{a rapidly growing}} global industry, there is ongoing {{controversy}} {{about the effects of}} provisioning on the target species. This study investigated the effect of feeding on <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> (Rhincodon typus) at a provisioning site in Oslob, Cebu, in terms of arrival time, avoidance and feeding behaviour using photo-identification and focal follows. Additionally, compliance to the code of conduct in place was monitored to assess tourism pressure on the <b>whale</b> <b>sharks.</b> Newly identified sharks gradually arrived earlier to the provisioning site after their initial sighting, indicating that the animals learn to associate the site with food rewards. <b>Whale</b> <b>sharks</b> with a long resighting history showed anticipatory behaviour and were recorded at the site on average 5 min after the arrival of feeder boats. Results from a generalised linear mixed model indicated that animals with a longer resighting history were less likely to show avoidance behaviour to touches or boat contact. Similarly, sequential data on feeding behaviour was modelled using a generalised estimating equations approach, which suggested that experienced <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> were more likely to display vertical feeding behaviour. It was proposed that the continuous source of food provides a strong incentive for the modification of behaviours, i. e., learning, through conditioning. <b>Whale</b> <b>sharks</b> are large opportunistic filter feeders in a mainly oligotrophic environment, where the ability to use novel food sources by modifying their behaviour could be of great advantage. Non-compliance to the code of conduct in terms of minimum distance to the shark (2 m) increased from 79 % in 2012 to 97 % in 2014, suggesting a high tourism pressure on the <b>whale</b> <b>sharks</b> in Oslob. The long-term effects of the observed behavioural modifications along with the high tourism pressure remain unknown. However, management plans are traditionally based on the precautionary principle, which aims to take preventive actions even if data on cause and effect are still inconclusive.
