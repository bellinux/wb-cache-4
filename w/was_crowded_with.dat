5|$|After Árbenz's resignation, {{his family}} {{remained}} for 73 {{days at the}} Mexican embassy in Guatemala City, which <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> almost 300 exiles. During this period, the CIA initiated {{a new set of}} operations against Árbenz, intended to discredit the former president and damage his reputation. The CIA obtained some of Árbenz's personal papers, and released parts of them after doctoring the documents. The CIA also promoted the notion that individuals in exile, such as Árbenz, should be prosecuted in Guatemala. When they were finally allowed to leave the country, Jacobo Árbenz was publicly humiliated at the airport when the authorities made the former president strip before the cameras, claiming that he was carrying jewelry he had bought for his wife, María Cristina Villanova, at Tiffany's in New York City, using funds from the presidency; no jewelry was found but the interrogation lasted for an hour. Through this entire period, coverage of Árbenz in the Guatemalan press was very negative, influenced largely by the CIA's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after World War II new coal companies, Peabody, Bluebird, and Sahara {{starting}} mining {{within the}} city. The war created a great demand for energy, which was satisfied by expanded strip mining operations throughout the Harrisburg Coal Fields. Shortly after World War II, {{it became clear}} that coal was losing favor to other energy sources such as oil and natural gas. In contrast to other cities in the United States that prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes of Saline County began to quickly diminish. Harry Truman stopped briefly in Harrisburg during his whistlestop tour in September 30, 1948, giving some hope for economic recovery for the region. Without hesitating, the long parade of police, buses, and accompanying cars sped through town. Poplar street, at that time the main drag through town, <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> multitudes of persons for its entire length. It was reported by the Daily Register Newspaper that cars were lined along Route 13 all the way from Marion and on to Eldorado on Route 45. In 1950 Assistant State Attorney General of Illinois, George N. Leighton, Represented parents in a proceeding which desegregated the public schools of Harrisburg. On December 1, 1953, WSIL-TV 3 was founded and based out of the city. The station built the 503ft (153.4m), WSIL tower in downtown {{which was one of the}} tallest television towers in the state at the time and is still the tallest structure in the city.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, Detroit's prestigious Grand Circus Park <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> buildings. The {{automotive}} boom in {{the city}} increased the pressure for office space, and development began to spill north from Grand Circus Park up Park Avenue. In 1922, Albert Kahn designed the Park Avenue Building, located {{at the entrance to}} Park Avenue (but included in the neighboring Grand Circus Park Historic District). Other architects and artisans contributed hotels, apartment buildings, and office buildings to the structures on Park Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 5:00 PM on Saturday 13 May 1972, a {{car bomb}} {{exploded}} without warning outside Kelly's Bar, at the junction of the Springfield Road and Whiterock Road. The pub was in a mainly Irish Catholic and nationalist area {{and most of its}} customers were from the area. At the time of the blast, the pub <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> men watching an association football match between England and West Germany on colour television. Sixty-three people were injured, eight of them seriously. John Moran (19), who had been working at Kelly's as a part-time barman, died of his injuries on 23 May.|$|E

25|$|On 5 September 1975, a bomb {{exploded}} in the delicatessen, destroying it and the adjacent wine bar which <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> customers. The makers of the show made a bold move, killing several long running cast favourites, including Les, and Aldo and Roma Godolfus (Johnny Lockwood and Philippa Baker), and then revealing schemer Maggie Cameron as the bomber and sending her off to prison (she never planned for the bomb to kill anyone and merely wanted to scare residents into moving to facilitate a sale of the building). However, despite the publicity and major changes it brought, the bomb-blast storyline resulted in only a temporary boost to the program's ratings figures.|$|E
25|$|Landlords were {{responsible}} for paying the rates of every tenant whose yearly rent was £4 or less. Landlords whose land <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> poorer tenants were now faced with large bills. Many began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, and letting the land in larger plots for over £4 which then reduced their debts. In 1846, {{there had been some}} clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847. According to James S. Donnelly, Jr., it is impossible to be sure how many people were evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854.|$|E
25|$|Preston had {{now taken}} orders, and become dean and catechist of Queens'. He began {{a course of}} sermons which were to form a body of divinity. Complaints {{were made to the}} {{vice-chancellor}} that the college chapel <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> scholars from other colleges and townsmen. Order was issued excluding all but members of the college. Preston then began an afternoon lecture at St. Botolph's, of which Queens' College is patron. This brought him into conflict with Newcome, commissary to the chancellor of Ely, whose enmity Preston had earned by preventing a match between his pupil, Sir Capel Bedels, and Newcome's daughter Jane. A dispute with Newcome at St. Botolph's delayed the afternoon service; {{to make room for the}} sermon, common prayer was for once omitted. Newcome sped to the court at Newmarket to denounce Preston as a nonconformist.|$|E

25|$|After the war, {{the area}} {{west of the}} new eastern border of Germany <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> expellees, some of them living in camps, some looking for relatives, some just stranded. Between 16.5% and 19.3% of the total {{population}} were expellees in the Western occupation zones and 24.2% in the Soviet occupation zone. Expellees made up 45% of the population in Schleswig-Holstein and 40% in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern; similar percentages existed along the eastern border all the way to Bavaria, while in the westernmost German regions the numbers were significantly lower, especially in the French zone of occupation. Of the expellees initially stranded in East Germany, many migrated to West Germany, making up a disproportionally high number of post-war inner-German East-West migrants (close to one million of a three million total between 1949, when the West and East German states were created, and 1961, when the inner-German border was closed).|$|E
25|$|On 13 October 1993, the 328 {{formally}} entered commercial service. The 328 {{was launched}} onto the market {{during a period}} in which it <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> large numbers of competing turboprop aircraft, as well as facing increasing competition from newly launched regional jets, which were becoming increasingly popular during the early 1990s. The 328 had the advantages of being both quieter and faster than many of its rivals, however this did not ensure its commercial success. The latter half of the 328 program was performed during a recession, curtailing demand for new aircraft from operators. Both the 328 and the wider Dornier division of Deutsche Aerospace proved to be losing money; accordingly Deutsche Aerospace wavered in committing more resources to the regional aircraft market, repeatedly delaying a decision to proceed with a 48-seat stretched model of the 328, which had originally been unveiled in 1991.|$|E
25|$|During the revolution, {{the pike}} {{dealt with a}} busy time period, for Bethlehem <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> officers, prisoners, and {{soldiers}} from the war. There was great excitement in Bethlehem on September 13, 1777, when the Patriot Army retreated from Philadelphia. Later, a letter had arrived by express courier from David Rittenhouse, announcing that all the military stores, in 700 wagons, were sent north on the Bethlehem Pike. Even the church and state bells were sent over for safekeeping on the pike. In Bethlehem, the wagon carrying the Liberty Bell broke down. The bells had to be unloaded on September 25, 1777. Eventually the wagon was repaired and they were sent to Allentown, where it was hidden from danger on Hamilton Street. The road traverses Rockhill Township, where the New Jersey and Pennsylvania armies listened to Richard Peters in 1799, {{a member of the}} Colonial assembly. They camped at Seller's Tavern, today known as Sellersville.|$|E

25|$|On Monday 20 March 1972, at 11.45 a.m., a local carpet dealer {{received}} {{a telephone call}} with a warning that a bomb would explode in Belfast city centre's Church Street which <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> shoppers, office workers on lunch breaks, and schoolchildren. British Army troops and the RUC were alerted and immediately began to evacuate the people into nearby Lower Donegall Street. The second call to the Irish News newspaper seven minutes later also gave Church Street as the location for the device. When a final call came at 11.55 advising the Unionist News Letter newspaper that the bomb was instead placed outside its offices in Lower Donegall Street to where the crowds were being sent, the warning arrived {{too late for the}} security forces to clear the street. The staff working inside the News Letter were told by the caller that they had 15 minutes in which to leave the building, but they {{never had a chance to}} evacuate.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, news analysts, lawyers, {{current and}} former {{government}} officials of the Thai justice system, such as Seripisut Temiyavet, came out to state that the DSI was not handling {{the investigation of the}} temple with proper legal procedure. It was questioned why the DSI would not let the abbot acknowledge the charges at the temple, which many considered legitimate under criminal law. The DSI replied that {{they did not want to}} visit the abbot at the temple at this stage, because the temple <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> people, who could force the DSI to commit itself to additional conditions. A spokesperson of the temple also questioned why the DSI did not pursue lawsuits that were still running against Paiboon and Phra Suwit. Was the DSI biased because they received orders from someone not disclosed? The DSI had seen its independence questioned before, even by leading people within the department itself. In short, the temple's practitioners and spokespeople felt the charges were politically motivated, and had no confidence in the justice system under the junta. Moreover, they felt that if the former abbot would turn himself in, this would set a precedent for more baseless persecutions of other monks.|$|E
25|$|The central {{conflict}} during Florida's territorial {{period was}} with the Seminole. Earlier in the 1800s, a series of battles {{that was the first}} of three Seminole Wars sought to prevent Seminoles from harboring runaway slaves and to protect the right of white settlers to occupy land in Florida. A Second Seminole War began in 1835. It pivoted on the issue of Indian removal, a plan to move all Seminoles in Florida to land west of the Mississippi by 1835. A number of the Seminole chose to fight rather than leave their homes. In 1835, warriors led by Osceola began waging guerilla warfare. They attacked and burned plantations on the St. Johns River and elsewhere in Northeast and Central Florida. Local volunteers joined U.S. forces and state militia to fight the Seminoles. Fort Marion in St. Augustine became the center for U.S. military action, with Army officers often billeting at boarding houses and hotels in the city. Displaced settlers and families from nearby plantations sought refuge in St. Augustine. Visitors from outside Florida continued to travel to St. Augustine, though their numbers slowed during the heat of the conflict. During this tumultuous period, St. Augustine <b>was</b> <b>crowded</b> <b>with</b> people requiring room and board. In 1845, when Florida joined the Union as the 27th state, the boarding house industry was firmly established, with a reputation as a healing destination for invalids.|$|E
