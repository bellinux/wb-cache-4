The objective {{of this study was}} to study the contribution of <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> using an integrated approach (including all types of exposures) to social inequalities in three health outcomes: poor self-reported health, long sickness absence, and work injury. Respondents were 14 [punctuation space] 241 men and 10 [punctuation space] 245 women drawn from a survey of the national French working population (response rate: 96. 5 %). <b>Work</b> <b>factors</b> included job characteristics, and occupational exposures of the physical, ergonomic, biological, chemical, and psychosocial work environment. All <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> were measured through expert evaluation by occupational physicians, except psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors,</b> which were self-reported. Strong social gradients were found for all <b>work</b> <b>factors,</b> except for psychological demands, workplace bullying, and aggression from the public. Marked social gradients were also observed for the health outcomes studied, blue collar workers being more likely to report poor self-reported health, long sickness absence, and work injury. The social differences in health were reduced strongly after adjustment for <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> (psychological demands excluded) by 24 - 58 % according to sex and health outcomes. The strongest impacts were found for decision latitude, ergonomic, physical, and chemical exposures, as well as for work schedules. A detailed analysis allowed us to identify more precisely the contributing occupational factors. It suggests that concerted prevention of occupational risk factors would be useful not only to improve health at work, but also to reduce social inequalities in health.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to {{identify}} the individual <b>factors,</b> <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> and environmental factors influencing expatriate failure at Indra Ltd. The study employed a quantitative descriptive survey design. A questionnaire containing closed ended questions was either administered either via emails or interviewer administered to the expatriates currently based at headquarters. A total 28 usable questionnaires were received out of the 40 distributed to Kenyan expatriates. The data obtained was analysed using descriptive statistics and correlation with the help of statistical computer packages specifically Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS. The mean scores on intention to leave were then correlated with individual <b>factors,</b> <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> and environmental factors. The study found that Kenyan expatriates experienced failures as proxied by intention to leave and that this failure is there irrespective of age, gender and work experience. The study also finds that of the individual factors, satisfaction with quality of life abroad, children, autonomy, and spouse satisfaction were the most influential factors while age, education and spouse adjustments of the expatriates were not. Satisfaction with salary and allowances, satisfaction with opportunities for career advancement and satisfaction with the relationship with supervisor were the most influential <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> and so were participation in decision making and exercising authority on the job in their job autonomy category. Cost of living, standard of living and availability of medical facilities were ranked most influential environmental factors. Although the results also indicate no significant correlation between mean intention to leave scores and mean scores of individual <b>factors,</b> <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> â€“ whether in total or separately in job satisfaction or job autonomy, and environmental factors, the mean scores for job satisfaction was statistically significantly positively correlated with mean scores on environmental factors and so was job autonomy with environmental <b>factors</b> and <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> and environmental factors.

40|$|Abstract Background Mental health {{problems}} (MHP) {{are the leading}} cause of disability worldwide. The inverse association between socioeconomic position (SEP) and MHP has been well documented. There is prospective evidence that <b>factors</b> from the <b>work</b> environment, including adverse psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors,</b> could {{contribute to the development of}} MHP including psychological distress. However, the contribution of psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> to social inequalities in MHP remains unclear. This study evaluates the contribution of psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> from two highly supported models, the Demand-Control-Support (DCS) and the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) models to SEP inequalities of psychological distress in men and women from a population-based sample of Quebec workers. Methods Data were collected during a survey on working conditions, health and safety at work. SEP was evaluated using education, occupation and household income. Psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> and psychological distress were assessed using validated instruments. Mean differences (MD) in the score of psychological distress were estimated separately for men and women. Results Low education level and low household income were associated with psychological distress among men (MD, 0. 56 (95 % CI 0. 06; 1. 05) and 1. 26 (95 % CI 0. 79; 1. 73) respectively). In men, the contribution of psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> from the DCS and the ERI models to the association between household income and psychological distress ranged from 9 % to 24 %. No clear inequalities were observed among women. Conclusions These results suggest that psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> from the DCS and the ERI models contribute to explain a part of social inequalities in psychological distress among men. Psychosocial <b>factors</b> at <b>work</b> are frequent and modifiable. The present study supports the relevance of targeting these factors for the primary prevention of MHP and for health policies aiming to reduce social inequalities in mental health...|$|R

Also, three different thickness ratios (lap/strap) were used to determine how geometric conditions affect &eta;el. The &eta;el values were calculated in two different ways: compliance method and crack closure method. The results show that the two methods produce comparable &eta;el values and while &eta;el is affected significantly by geometric conditions, it is reasonably independent of material properties for the given geometry.

Methods : The study sample included 5, 600 workers followed up from 2006 to 2010 from the national representative SantÃ© et ItinÃ©raire Professionnel (SIP) survey. Psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> included decision latitude, psychological demands, social support, reward, overcommitment, long working hours, predictability, night- and shift work, emotional demands, role conflict, ethical conflict, tensions with the public, job insecurity and workâ€“life imbalance, and were measured using scores. Linear regressions were used to analyse the change in the scores of these factors adjusted for age and initial score. All analyses were stratified by gender. Results : Psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> worsened between 2006 and 2010 : decision latitude, social support, reward, role conflict and workâ€“life imbalance for both genders, and psychological demands, emotional demands, ethical conflict and tensions with the public for women.

40|$|Purpose Unfavourable {{exposure}} to psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> threatens older employees' mental health, and their sustained employment. This study assesses whether an improved compared to stable unfavourable and stable favourable {{exposure to}} psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> {{is associated with}} a change in mental health in older employees at 3 -year follow-up. Methods The current study used data from the Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (STREAM), in workers aged 45 - 65 years (n = 5249). Two-year (2010 - 2012) exposure was assessed for psychological demands, autonomy, support, mental load, and distributive justice. Linear regression analyses were performed to compare improved exposure to unfavourable psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> with stable unfavourable and stable favourable exposure and mental health at follow-up (2013), corrected for confounders. Analyses were stratified for age groups (45 - 54 and 55 - 65 years) and gender. Results In certain subgroups, stable unfavourable exposure to psychological demands, autonomy, support, and distributive justice was associated with a significantly lower mental health score than improved exposure. Stable favourable exposure to support was associated with a higher mental health score than improved support, whereas stable favourable exposure to autonomy was associated with a lower mental health score compared to improved exposure. Conclusions There is a longitudinal association between changes in exposure to psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> and mental health. Improvement in unfavourable exposure to psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> was associated with improved mental health.

Material and methods: Using a cross-sectional survey design, the variables were assessed in a sample of 541 seafarers from 2 large Norwegian shipping companies. <b>Work</b> <b>factors</b> included safety perceptions, leadership, job demands, harassment, and team cohesion. Results: The findings show that physical and psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> are important correlates of both intentions to leave and job satisfaction, with safety perceptions, job demands, and team cohesion as the strongest and most consistent factors. As for cross-cultural differences, the findings show that European and Filipino respondents differ with regard to safety perceptions, laissez-faire leadership, authentic leadership, exposure to harassment, team cohesion, and intentions to leave. No differences were established with regard to overall job satisfaction. Conclusions: The findings support occupational stress models which emphasise the importance of situational factors in the understanding of well-being among workers.

This study investigates the cross-sectional and prospective associations between occupational factors, including a large set of psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors,</b> and psychotropic {{drug use in the}} national French working population. The study sample comprised 7542 workers for the cross-sectional analysis and 4213 workers followed up for a 4 -year period for the prospective analysis. Psychotropic drug use was measured within the last 12 months and defined by the use of antidepressants, anxiolytics or hypnotics.

In the cross-sectional analysis, psychological demands, low social support and hiding emotions were associated with psychotropic drug use. Job insecurity for men and night work for women were associated with psychotropic drug use. In the prospective analysis, hiding emotions and physical exposure were predictive of psychotropic drug use. Dose-response associations were observed for the frequency/intensity of exposure and repeated exposure to occupational factors.

Methods A national cross-sectional study (the SUrveillance MÃ©dicale des Expositions aux Risques professionnels (SUMER) survey) assessed psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> including psychological demands, decision latitude, social support, reward and its sub-dimensions (esteem, job security and job promotion), bullying, verbal abuse, physical violence and sexual assault, long working hours, shift and night work, unsociable work days, predictability and demands for responsibility. We also measured depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. We used gender-stratified generalized linear models to adjust for age, occupation and economic activity. Results A total of 26883 men and 20079 women participated (response rate 87 %). Low decision latitude, high psychological demands, low social support, low reward, bullying and verbal abuse were associated with depression and anxiety in both genders (Î² coefficients from 0. 14 to 1. 40). In men, low predictability was associated with both depression and anxiety (Î² = 0. 12 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 01, 0. 24] and 0. 19 [95 % CI 0. 06, 0. 32]) and long working hours were associated with anxiety (Î² = 0. 48 [95 % CI 0. 27, 0. 69]).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the associations between work exposure such as psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> and <b>work</b> posture, and health in men and women with the same type of occupation in the manufacturing industry. Two follow-ups with a follow-up rate of 67 % from the WOrk, Lipids and Fibrinogen (WOLF) cohort from the Northern Sweden were used. The database included 1589 men and 286 women, which is representative of the proportions between men and women in the Swedish manufacturing industry. To be able to understand the importance of work context, the participants were categorized according to work tasks (working with things or symbols). Logistic regression was used for interaction analyses between sex and psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> (such as demand, control, social support, role conflict, and work-family conflict) as well as physical <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> (such as <b>work</b> posture), and health outcomes (work overcommitment, fatigue, and neck and back pain). The results showed contextually different patterns of sex different associations between psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> and health outcomes. For instance, women were at larger risk of ill-health (in the form of work overcommitment) when working with things, whereas men were at larger risk of both work overcommitment and fatigue when working with symbols. Women working with symbols had a larger risk of neck and back pain due to work-family conflict. The health outcome that was most sensitive to the sex different associations was work overcommitment. In conclusion, the work context matters for sex differences in the association between psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>factors</b> and health and since work overcommitment is a predictor of disease, it should be of interest for the Occupational Health Services and personnel departments to survey.
