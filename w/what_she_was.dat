5|$|After a {{video call}} with Lydia, Alice {{inadvertently}} opens the video with the suicide instructions. With some difficulty, {{she finds the}} pills {{and is about to}} swallow them, but when she is interrupted by the arrival of her caregiver she drops the pills on the floor and forgets <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing.|$|E
5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, {{but she did not}} stay to listen.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA {{could carry}} out conversations {{that were so}} {{realistic}} that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with {{a human being and}} not a program. But in fact, ELIZA had no idea <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> talking about. She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor little Miniver! <b>What</b> can <b>she</b> <b>be</b> but <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is?...</b> Because <b>she</b> states {{her case}} in a tangle, drags it through swamps of nonsense, it doesn't alter the fact that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> right." ...|$|R
50|$|Night and Day {{throws up}} themes of colonization, journalism, language, and {{alternate}} or multiple realities. The plot narrative unfolds through the silent or subconscious thoughts of Ruth Carson, {{who is a}} by-stander to the main events taking place around her. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> regularly shown to express conflicting ideas between <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> saying, and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> actually thinking.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{therefore}} I curse her the more," [...] he said. [...] "You know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> you've tasted of her charity, {{and you are}} my father's nephew. If {{you have}} been without experience, I will tell you <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> A common--" [...] I reached out and put my hand across his mouth.|$|R
5|$|Krug {{was born}} Judith Fingeret in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1940. Her {{interest}} in {{freedom of speech}} was fostered from an early age. She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing. When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn on the bedroom light so she could read properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} known it well," [...] {{returned}} the Queen, [...] "from the innocence and guilelessness of the damsel. None save such a mother as Mistress Talbot could have made her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> Credit me, madam, I have looked well into her heart, and found nought to undo there. You have bred her up better than her poor mother could have done, and I gladly entrust her once more to your care, assured that your well-tried honour will keep her in mind of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> and to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> may <b>be</b> called." ...|$|R

60|$|MRS MARCH. We know ourselves, you see. The girl's father realises {{perfectly}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R
5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing sleeping with an older man, {{and yet there is}} something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E
5|$|The film cast three Bajau teenagers, Gita Novalista, Eko and Zainal, {{in their}} feature film debuts; {{the three were}} the first Bajau {{to play in a}} feature film. More {{experienced}} actors, including Atiqah Hasiholan and Reza Rahadian (who had received two Citra Awards), were also cast. Hasiholan later stated that it had been her most challenging role yet, citing the cultural differences between the Bajau and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> familiar with as well as her unprecedented need to act as a mother. In preparing for their roles, Hasiholan exercised slicing and dicing fish, while Rahadian went to Ancol in North Jakarta to learn about dolphins.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E
5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When {{she said she was}} drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over the truth of the allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E
5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} Stella {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with Stella to check <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him to grow a mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E

Fortunately for Tommy, she hears the bombers approaching and rushes out to {{set fire to the}} hay.|$|R

All I can say <b>is,</b> that if <b>she</b> accepts you, Hermy will consent that she shall go to Clavering {{as much as she}} pleases till the marriage takes place. It couldn't be done, I suppose, till after a year; and in that case <b>she</b> shall <b>be</b> married at Clavering." ...|$|R

5|$|With the Burger's {{house now}} empty, Rosa sells it and moves in with Conrad, {{a student who}} had befriended her during her father's trial. Conrad {{questions}} her about {{her role in the}} Burger family and asks why she always did <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> told. Later Rosa leaves Conrad and moves into a flat on her own and works as a physiotherapist. In 1975 Rosa attends a party of a friend in Soweto, and it is there that she hears a black university student dismissing all whites' help as irrelevant, saying that whites cannot know what blacks want, and that blacks will liberate themselves. Despite being labelled a Communist and under surveillance by the authorities, Rosa manages to get a passport, and flies to Nice in France to spend several months with Katya, her father's first wife. There she meets Bernard Chabalier, a visiting academic from Paris. They become lovers and he persuades her to return with him to Paris.|$|E
5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E
