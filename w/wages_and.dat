5|$|Following the {{industrial}} unrest, trade unions for black workers were instituted in 1946, though they lacked power and influence. Workers at the UMHK continued to demand higher <b>wages,</b> <b>and</b> strikes were {{common in the}} colony for the next decade. Nevertheless, both <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> living conditions improved significantly {{in the years after}} the war. The war began a second wave of industrialisation that lasted right up to Congolese independence in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan District {{accepted}} that <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> salaries {{had to be}} high enough to allow contractors to hire and retain good workers.

40|$|Economists have {{attributed}} the efficiency difference between China's enterprises of different ownership to ownership itself, special relationship between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and government, and market competition. However, {{the existing literature}} has not provided a good explanation for the larger <b>and</b> larger inter-firm <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> efficiency differences. This paper argues that the inter-firm <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> efficiency differences result from the dual <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> employment determination during the economic transition. With a shrinking proportion in production and employment, SOEs are weaker and weaker in bargaining with the government. Consequently, the inter-firm <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> efficiency differences are enlarged...|$|R

5|$|After 1966, in {{a radical}} {{departure}} from past policies, the Ministry of Economy announced a programme to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition, efficiency, and foreign investment. The anti-inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> salaries. Inflation decreased sharply, decreasing from an annual rate of about 30% in 1965–67 to 7.6% in 1969. Unemployment remained low, but real wages fell.|$|E
30|$|We {{find that}} there is a {{statistically}} significant positive correlation between the minimum <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> the basic <b>wage.</b> However, we find a statistically negative correlation between the minimum <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> bonus. For most workers, the higher basic <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> lower bonus cancel each other out so that we find that higher minimum wages are not significantly correlated with total full-time wages.|$|R

5|$|Another coup in June 1966, the {{so-called}} Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Onganía to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena {{to head the}} Economy Ministry.

5|$|Exports {{grew from}} $12 billion in 1991 to $27 billion in 2001, but many {{industries}} could not compete abroad, especially after Brazil's devaluation. The strong, {{fixed exchange rate}} turned the trade balance to a cumulative US$22 billion in deficits between 1992 and 1999. Unable to devalue, Argentina could only become more competitive if prices fell. Deflation came from recession, falling <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> rising unemployment.

50|$|Another method {{attempted}} in {{the past}} have been <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> price controls ("incomes policies"). <b>Wage</b> <b>and</b> price controls have been successful in wartime environments in combination with rationing. However, their use in other contexts is far more mixed. Notable failures of their use include the 1972 imposition of <b>wage</b> <b>and</b> price controls by Richard Nixon. More successful examples include the Prices and Incomes Accord in Australia and the Wassenaar Agreement in the Netherlands.|$|R

5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because many {{do not want to}} live in the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low <b>wages</b> <b>and</b> standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that the city would not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.|$|E
