50|$|The {{parallel}} chord (but not {{the counter}} parallel chord) {{of a major}} chord {{will always be the}} minor chord whose root <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> third down from the major chord's root, inversely the parallel chord of <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> chord will <b>be</b> the major chord whose root <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> third up from the root of the minor chord. Thus, in a major key, where the dominant <b>is</b> <b>a</b> major chord, the dominant parallel will <b>be</b> the <b>minor</b> chord <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> third below the dominant. In <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> key, where the dominant may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> chord, the dominant parallel will be the major chord <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> third above the (minor) dominant.|$|R
