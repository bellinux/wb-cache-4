The lowest levels of attachment to pea roots were consistently observed for CG 50. Population curves were calculated for the strains inoculated into wound sites on <b>grape</b> and pea <b>roots.</b> A. tumefaciens bv. 3 wild-type strains developed greater populations at wound sites on <b>grape</b> <b>roots</b> after 100 h (resulting in root decay) than did CG 50 or CG 628. Population curves for strains at wound sites on pea roots were different from those on <b>grape</b> <b>roots.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} populations after 100 h, and no strains caused root decay. No differences in the chemotaxis of wild-type and mutant A. tumefaciens bv. 3 strains towards <b>grape</b> <b>roots,</b> crown pieces, or root extracts were observed, but the biovar 1 strain, CG 628, always migrated the greatest distance towards all substrates.

40|$|It {{has been}} well-demonstrated that {{the control of}} plasma {{membrane}} H+-ATPase (PM H+-ATPase) activity is important to plant salt tolerance. This study found {{a significant increase in}} PM H+-ATPase (PMA) activity in <b>grape</b> <b>root</b> exposed to NaCl. Furthermore, 7 Vitis vinifera PM H+-ATPase genes (VvPMAs) were identified within the grape genome and the expression response of these VvPMAs in <b>grape</b> <b>root</b> under salinity was analyzed. Two VvPMAs (VvPMA 1 and VvPMA 3) were expressed more strongly in roots than the other five VvPMAs. Moreover, roots exhibited diverse patterns of gene expression of VvPMA 1 and VvPMA 3 responses to salt stress. Interestingly, two transcripts of VvPMA 1, which were created through alternative splicing (AS), were discovered and isolated from salt stressed root. Comparing the two VvPMA 1 cDNA sequences (designated VvPMA 1 α and VvPMA 1 β) with the genomic sequence revealed that the second intron was retained in the VvPMA 1 β cDNA. This intron retention was predicted to generate a novel VvPMA 1 through N-terminal truncation because of a 5 ′- terminal frame shift. Yeast complementation assays of the two splice variants showed that VvPMA 1 β could enhance the ability to complement Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient in PM H+-ATPase activity. In addition, the expression profiles of VvPMA 1 α and VvPMA 1 β differed under salinity. Our data suggests that through AS, the N-terminal length of VvPMA 1 may be regulated to accurately modulate PM H+-ATPase activity of <b>grape</b> <b>root</b> in salt stress...|$|R

All of the biovar 3 strains, regardless of their tumorigenicity or presence of a Ti plasmid, caused root decay and were pectolytic, whereas none of the biovar 1 and 2 strains had these capacities.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the biology of Xylotrechus arvicola (Olivier), an {{emerging}} grape pest, were studied under laboratory conditions. Four diets were tested to rear this species in the laboratory. Among them, only one made rearing from larva to adult possible. The highest mortality, in all cases, was recorded during {{the first days of}} larval development. Larvae were kept 45 days at 8 °C to break diapause {{in order to reduce the}} normal field larval developmental time. The species' developmental time was similar between sexes, while pupal developmental time and weight were significantly greater for females than for males. As part of a complementary study, life table parameters of females obtained from the larvae reared on the artificial diet were compared to those of females emerged from field-infested <b>grape</b> <b>root</b> wood. Both laid the majority of eggs in the first two weeks after emergence, and they had a similar pre-laying period. Nevertheless, the females from the diet-reared larvae lived significantly longer, laid eggs over a longer period of time and showed higher fertility than those emerging from infested <b>grape</b> <b>root,</b> suggesting that diet fulfils larval nutritional needs. The species' laboratory-reared population exhibited a low intrinsic growth rate value (rm= 0. 01) as a result of its long egg-to-adult developmental time and its high larval mortality. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2011.

The variance in yield from year to year was reduced, equivalent to a yield increase of 0.8-4.2 bushels per acre.

40|$|Ion {{transport}} {{properties of}} <b>grape</b> <b>root</b> lipids were measured as liquid-membrane permeability.

Exchange of chloride against nitrate was rather low for the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipid fractions; monogalactose diglyceride {{was by far}} the most effective chloride transporter studied. Comparison between the lipid composition of the roots of the 5 grape rootstocks and the chloride transport capacity of the specific membranes strongly suggests that, indeed, the chloride transport capacity of the lipids present in the membranes of the root cells accounts for the observed differences in chloride transport to the leaves. Whereas monogalactose diglyceride had a high chloride transport capacity, compared with phosphatidylcholine, the reverse was true for exchange of sodium against potassium. Thus, phosphatidylcholine has more the properties of a cation exchanger, and monogalactose diglyceride those of an anion transporter...|$|R
