5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces {{over the last few}} days spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During the last few days underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E

The queen opposed the act and regarded is as an insult, especially since she assumed that a Swedish victory over Prussia {{would result in the}} deposition of Adolf Frederick in favor of Christian of Zweibrucken-Birkenfeld. However, a potential Swedish defeat was seen by her as a good opportunity for a coup d'état in favor of absolute monarchy, as a defeat would discredit the Riksdag. Therefore, she successfully asked her brother Frederick the great to ask for her as a mediator in future peace negotiations. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> arouse in 1760, she could not use it as she lacked necessary funds for bribes.

500|$|For season three, Jonathan {{also has}} to deal with his {{emerging}} heart problems. For Schneider, the [...] "treatments" [...] and [...] "cures" [...] that his character underwent were all for nothing, as the actor believes that Jonathan's heart attack at the end of [...] "Hereafter" [...] was less of a real heart attack and more of Jor-El trying to get Jonathan's attention. A heart condition is not new to the character, as it has been used in previous incarnations, like Glenn Ford's portrayal of Jonathan Kent in Richard Donner's Superman, as well as the comic books. In contrast to those versions, it was Smallville that tied his heart condition to a deal that he makes with Jor-El. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> came for his character to die, Schneider considers the event an [...] "empowering death", which he likens to John Wayne's character death as Wil Andersen in The Cowboys.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, {{the battle}} was one {{instance}} in which Moller's and Seydlitz's awareness of Frederick's operational objectives led to battlefield success. [...] For example, not content with the single attack and recall, the coup de main, Seydlitz withdrew his squadrons into a copse, where they regrouped under cover of the trees. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> was right, he led his cavalry forward again in the coup de grâce, the finishing blow. Similarly, Moller's artillery waited on the reverse angle of the hill until the French were in range, then mounted the Janus and laid down a thorough and precise pattern of artillery fire; the concussion of Moller's thorough cannonade could be felt several miles away. Rossbach proved that the column {{as a means of}} tactical deployment on battlefield was inferior to the Prussian battle line; the massed columns simply could not hold in the face of either Moller's fire or Seydlitz's cavalry charges.

500|$|The {{paintings}} were composed within {{several years of}} Alexander coming to power. His father and predecessor, King Milan, was so unpopular {{that he had to}} abdicate his throne. Alexander's reign was marked by protracted political instability, culminating in the coup d'état that resulted in his death. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson believes The Takovo Uprising was composed in response to the chaotic political climate. She writes: [...] The painting, she asserts, was to serve as [...] "a reminder of Serb achievements during and after the Second Uprising, and of the leadership that made those successes possible." [...] Jovanović's positioning Obrenović slightly left of centre ensures that he fully dominates the scene. [...] "The brown soil and gravestones of the churchyard," [...] Filipovitch-Robinson writes, [...] "stand as reminders of the transitory nature of physical life". The political scientist Anamaria Segesten suggests that the portrayal of Obrenović wearing Turkish clothing, particularly a turban, might be a reference to his collaboration with the Ottomans prior to the uprising, and his adoption of Ottoman customs while staying in Istanbul. She notes that half the people gathered around Obrenović are also wearing Turkish clothes, signifying that while they might temporarily have professed loyalty to the Ottoman sultan, they are actually patriots willing to rise up and fight for the Serbian cause <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> is right. [...] "While clearly caught up in the emotion of the moment," [...] Filipovitch-Robinson writes, [...] "they are solid and dignified, ordinary people united by shared beliefs and a common cause." ...|$|E

2500|$|Generals Taylor and Wool {{realized}} that they were badly outnumbered; therefore, they deployed their troops carefully. [...] Artillery batteries were placed at strategic points. Dismounted rifle companies were placed so as to prevent flanking movements. [...] Actual fighting did not start until about 3:30p.m. when the Mexicans began moving forces toward higher ground. [...] As the sun rose the following morning it became clear that Santa Anna had been busy during the night and planned a massive assault, relying on superior numbers to drive a wedge through the American defenses. [...] As the battle began the Mexican troops moved with precision and fought bravely. [...] Suddenly, Mexican cavalry aimed toward the American left intent upon pushing through and capturing General Wool's precious supply train camped at Hacienda Buena Vista. [...] Among those standing before the red-shirted Mexican horsemen was the 2nd Indiana volunteers and farther back Colonel Yell's Arkansas cavalry, as well as Colonel Jefferson Davis' Mississippi volunteer riflemen. [...] When the Mexican cavalry fell full force into the 2nd Indiana confusion reigned. [...] Through misunderstood orders, a retreat began which soon became a stampede.

2500|$|Within {{the first}} three minutes of the second half, the Trojans scored 26 points and had already {{accumulated}} 149 overall with 17 minutes remaining. It was not until 6:35 into the second half that Troy State scored their first points of the half that were not three-pointers or dunks. With 10 minutes remaining, Chris Greasham's three-pointer gave Troy 189, eclipsing the previous NCAA single game scoring record of 187. Then, with 7:53 to go, they surpassed the 200-point mark, becoming the first (and only) team in college basketball history to surpass the bicentennial threshold. The scoreboard was not built to display 200+ points, and so <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> occurred, it did not display the numbers correctly (their solution was to start over at zero and work their way back up from there). During the second half alone, the Trojans scored 135 points, besting their minutes-old record of 123, and the 30 three-pointers in the second stanza broke the NCAA all-time game record of 25 (set previously by Troy). Their 51 made three-point field goals more than doubled that record, and the 109 three-point attempts record has never been seriously contested. Tommy Davis remarked that the game [...] "reminded [...] of a street game you play in the summer."

2500|$|As Victory {{approached}} the enemy {{line on the}} morning of 21 October 1805, Hardy urged Nelson to transfer to another ship to avoid the inevitable melee, but Nelson refused. Victory, leading the weather column, came under heavy fire in the opening stages of the Battle of Trafalgar. At one point, a splinter took the buckle from Hardy's shoe, to which Nelson remarked, [...] "This is too warm work Hardy, to last for long". Hardy was with Nelson when he was shot and, {{towards the end of the}} battle, as Nelson lay below dying, the two had a number of conversations together. Hardy was able to tell Nelson that 14 or 15 enemy ships had struck their flags: Nelson replied that he had [...] "bargained for 20". In their last conversation, Nelson reminded Hardy to anchor the fleet. Nelson went on to say [...] "take care of my dear Lady Hamilton, Hardy, take care of poor Lady Hamilton" [...] and then <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> came for the two men to part for the last time, Nelson then very close to death, asked Hardy to kiss him.

[...] "It is Hardy" [...] Hardy replied. [...] "God bless you Hardy" [...] was Nelson's last response. Victory was towed to Gibraltar, arriving on 28 October 1805, where she underwent major repairs, before setting set sail for England on 4 November 1805 and arriving at Portsmouth on 5 December 1805.
