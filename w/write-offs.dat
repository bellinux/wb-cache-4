5|$|The 1st Light Division {{absorbed the}} 11th Panzer-Regiment and was redesignated as the 6th Panzer Division on 18 October 1939. It took 132 Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)s into the Battle of France {{where it was}} {{assigned}} to XXXXI Corps (mot.) for Panzergruppe von Kleists attack through the Ardennes. 44 of these had been lost {{by the end of}} May. 35 replacements were issued on 3 June in preparation for , the attack on the remnants of the French Army that began the following day.

5|$|Archival {{data of the}} II SS-Panzer Corps {{shows that}} the corps had 294 {{operable}} tanks and assault guns {{on the evening of}} 11 July, and 251 on the evening of 13 July. Allowing for the possibility that some repaired tanks were returned to service on 13 July, these numbers indicate that at least 43 tanks and assault guns became inoperable during this period, which includes all ten Tigers belonging to Totenkopf and one belonging to Leibstandarte. An estimated total of 60–80 tanks and assault guns of the II SS-Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July. By the end of 16 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had 292 serviceable tanks and assault guns, almost the same number it had {{at the beginning of the}} battle on 12 July. On 12 July, Schlachtgeschwader 1 of the 8th Air Corps and its attached squadron of Stukas reported 11 aircraft damaged, all by Soviet anti-aircraft artillery, of which 6 were total <b>write-offs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cancellation}} order had {{not reached}} Luftflotte 3 HQ at all. Its commander, Hugo Sperrle ordered attacks to commence. At 05:00, 20 Junkers Ju 88s of I./KG 54 took off {{to bomb the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment's airfield at 'RAF Farnborough' (RAE Farnborough). At 05:05, 18 Ju 88s from II./KG 54 took off for RAF Odiham. At 05:50, 88 Junkers Ju 87s of StG 77 began heading for Portland Harbour. The raids were escorted by about 60 Bf 110s of Zerstörergeschwader 2 (Destroyer Wing 2; ZG 2), and V./LG 1 and 173 Bf 109s from Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27), JG 53 and JG 3, which all flew ahead of the bomber stream to clear the airspace of enemy fighters. StG 77's target was obscured by cloud, but KG 54 continued to their target. RAF fighters from RAF Northolt, RAF Tangmere and RAF Middle Wallop intercepted. Four Ju 88s and one Bf 109 from JG 2 was shot down. The German fighters claimed six RAF fighters and the bombers another 14. In reality, the bombers only damaged five. The Bf 109s destroyed only one and damaged another. Of the five RAF fighters damaged by the bombers, two were <b>write-offs.</b> Of the 20 claimed, just three fighters were lost and three pilots were wounded. None were killed.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{rationality}} of {{herd behavior}} in the accounting policy decisions by using a <b>write-off</b> policy of unfunded pension benefit obligation (UPBO) as a research material. Although the accounting standard for retirement benefits in Japan in 2000 allowed the companies to choose the <b>write-off</b> period between one year and fifteen years depending on their <b>write-off</b> abilities, more than 60 % of the companies disclosed the period within 3 years, especially one year before the balance sheet date. There might have been herd behavior in policy selections with the companies that currently reported poor income and nonetheless chose {{a short period of}} <b>write-off</b> policy. We found that many of these companies did not unreasonably <b>write–off</b> UPBO and that the capital market saw through whether their <b>write-off</b> policies were concomitant with their capabilities or not. If a market is efficient and participants are aware of it, accounting regulator’s policy for giving the companies the room for choice does not cause an irrational herd behavior in accounting policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{information}} content of the periodic allocation of expense by managers. In this paper, we analyzed the direction and magnitude of stock price changes {{in response to the}} disclosure of <b>write-off</b> policies of 424 Japanese companies on two newspapers. We obtained some empirical evidence that information concerning <b>write-off</b> policies confirms or changes the expectation of investors about the target companies. This was achieved by our examination concerning market reactions to information about <b>write-off</b> policies of unfunded pension benefit obligations; good and bad performances by short and long <b>write-off</b> periods. Companies that had disclosed their <b>write-off</b> policies were assigned to one of the two categories: companies with good performance or companies with poor performance. Our observation of the effect of the length of unfunded pension benefit obligation (UPBO) <b>write-off</b> periods on stock prices {{made it clear that the}} disclosed <b>write-off</b> policies contained information that either confirmed or caused the revision of investors had formed opinions regarding the target companies. In the first section, we explain the change of accounting standards and consequent burden of <b>write-off</b> expense. In the second section, we review previous research. The hypothesis which will be verified is offered in the third while research design is in the forth section. The results of our examination and their implications are given in the fifth section. Lastly, we make concluding remarks in the sixth section...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{large sample}} of small private companies, we show {{incremental}} influence of economic incentives over prescriptions from accounting standards by financial statement preparers in a code-law setting with high alignment between financial and tax reporting and no agency problems. Contrary to predictions from standards, more profitable companies {{are more likely}} to <b>write-off</b> and the <b>write-off</b> magnitude is greater, reflecting tax minimisation.

25|$|While the B class {{locomotives}} {{were highly}} successful on the expensively-engineered 1860s mainlines {{for which they}} were designed, they were less suited for the more cheaply built extensions to the VR system. Future VR express passenger locomotives were to use a four-wheel leading bogie to steer the locomotive, and from 1884 a class of 4-4-0 locomotives (later classed 'Old A') began to supplement, and eventually supersede the B class. Despite the delivery of the Old A, and the later and increasingly larger 'New A' and AA class 4-4-0s of 1889 and 1900 respectively, the entire B class (other than a couple of accident <b>write-offs)</b> lasted into the Twentieth century, with their roles ranging from double heading on express passenger trains down to shunting duties.|$|E
25|$|With the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Reagan and Congress {{sought to}} simplify the tax system by {{eliminating}} many deductions, reducing the highest marginal rates, and {{reducing the number of}} tax brackets. In 1983, Democrats Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt had offered a proposal; in 1984 Reagan had the Treasury Department produce its own plan. The eventual bipartisan 1986 act aimed to be revenue-neutral: while it reduced the top marginal rate, it also cleaned up the tax base by removing certain tax <b>write-offs,</b> preferences, and exceptions, thus raising the effective tax on activities previously specially favored by the code. Ultimately, the combination of the decrease in deductions and decrease in rates, raised revenue equal to about 4% of existing tax revenue.|$|E

25|$|Pre-facelift vs Facelift. In {{respect of}} FTO ownership, {{there is some}} {{division}} in preference for the styling of the front bumper - either Pre-facelift, or Facelift. Interchanging these units is a relatively simple matter and, as the latter version models have become <b>write-offs</b> over the years, there are many pre-facelift models now {{on the road that}} are sporting newer facelift bumpers. Future purchasers of an FTO should be aware of this. A simple check of the VIN Plate details, or the period of manufacture to be found on the seat-belt tags, should resolve any uncertainty as to the origin of the model-build. Apart from body styling, there are other less apparent differences in the Facelift models, such as uprated ECU and also distinct variations to the drive shaft units across the range.

2500|$|If {{the values}} and prices of goods can vary {{independently}} {{in all kinds of}} ways, then the classical revolutionary orthodox Marxist principle that total production prices are equal to total product values cannot, realistically, be true; there exists no causal mechanism by which such price-value fluctuations perfectly compensate each other in aggregate, so that total product values equal total production prices. The principle can then be true only in an abstract theoretical model, but not in reality. Yet, if that classical revolutionary orthodox core principle is not true in reality, then it seems to follow there cannot be any systematic relationship in the real world between the Marxist labor-values and the actual price-levels for products – which was precisely what critics argued during the 20th century about the insolubility of the transformation problem. If the Marxian product values are really determinants of product-prices, {{is there a way to}} express that relationship, other than as an accounting consolidation, or as a simultaneous input-output equation? There is no consensus about that issue among mathematicians and computer scientists, although the main trend is now toward probabilistic analysis and vector algebra. Many mathematical Marxists have abandoned Marx's analysis of the equalization of the rate of profit and Marx's concept of production prices, arguing that an analysis of input-output data can straightforwardly prove a strong, robust positive correlation between product-prices and employee hours worked. They argue, with Marx, that a uniform profit rate does not exist in reality, but against Marx that, therefore, a tendency for differences in profit rates to be levelled out by competition does not exist either. Since (they argue) the deviation of product-prices from product-values is not very great in reality, the law of value is an empirical law with predictive power. At least for output aggregates, this is quite easy to prove, since net value-added (gross labour compensation earned and paid + gross profits earned and paid, net of <b>write-offs)</b> is by definition strongly correlated with the total amount of labour hours worked. [...] This analysis does not, however, refer to foreign trade.|$|E
