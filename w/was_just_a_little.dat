Falck {{came to the}} opinion that the Bf110 <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too big for Ostermann and had him {{transferred}} to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 equipped I./Jagdgeschwader 21 (JG21) on 7April 1940.

25|$|As expected, {{the first}} three games of the series were tight-checking, low-scoring {{contests}} featuring stellar goaltending {{at both ends of}} the ice. Niittymaki, however, who <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit better than Lehtonen, earned a surprise 1–0 shutout victory in Game 1. He was even better in Game 2, however, holding the high-scoring Wolves to just one goal in a 2–1 double overtime victory to send the series back to Philadelphia where the next three games—if necessary—would be played and where the Phantoms were already 11–0 in the playoffs. Niittymaki again held the Wolves to just one goal as the Phantoms defeated Chicago again, 2–1, in Game 3. Through almost 11 periods of hockey over three games, Niittymaki had allowed the Wolves, who had scored 245 regular season goals, just two goals while Lehtonen and had been solved for just five by the Phantoms. The differential of three goals, however, was enough to give Philadelphia a 3–0 stranglehold on the series going into Game 4 on June 10.|$|E

500|$|In the 2010/2011 season, Jackson {{played for}} Spartak where she {{averaged}} 17.3 {{points per game}} and 8.4 rebounds per game. [...] She left the team in early January 2011 because of an injury, returning to Australia in order to recover. Part of her treatment involved getting an MRI. [...] According to Jackson, she left Russia for Australia because [...] "I couldn't move, the swelling was very obvious and the pain <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit too painful. That's when I got home to all these messages and emails from people back in Australia who had seen the scans and said 'you need to come back (to Australia) and start your rehab right away'." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the start}} of the Depression in 1929 was a major setback for Brundage, he rebuilt his wealth by {{investments}} in real estate, also accepting interests in buildings he had constructed in lieu of payments the owners were unable to make. He later stated that [...] "you didn't have to be a wizard" [...] in order to [...] "buy stocks and bonds in depressed corporations for a few cents on the dollar—and then wait. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lucky." [...] According to historian and archivist Maynard Brichford, Brundage [...] "emerged from the difficult depression years with a substantial annual income, a good reputation, and excellent investments". His foresight resulted in a fortune which by 1960 was estimated at $25,000,000.|$|E
500|$|Ian McDiarmid {{required}} little make-up in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. He recalled, [...] "I'm ... slightly aged [...] In {{the last}} film, I had a fairly standard make-up on, but now, they're starting to crinkle my face." [...] Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, however, required extensive make-up. McDiarmid remarked {{in an interview}} with Star Wars Insider magazine, [...] "Yes—that was a four-hour job, initially, although we got it down to about two-and-a-half in the end. But this <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of latex here and there, a little bit of skin-scrunching." [...] He told the Homing Beacon newsletter, [...] "When my face changes in the film, my mind went back to the early silent movie of The Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney, Sr.." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that he [...] "looks uncannily like Death in The Seventh Seal" [...] (1957) and film historian Robin Wood compares him to the hag from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Crosby {{insisted upon}} the {{inclusion}} of the contentious track [...] "Mind Gardens", which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no [...] "rhythm, meter, or rhyme". [...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd never heard anything like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> story and what it said was true ... if you build walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E
500|$|After the race, Espinoza said, [...] "He's OK... Maybe it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{too much}} for him those three weeks, flying back and forth. He was running pretty {{comfortable}} there, but not like he used to." [...] Baffert was proud of the horse's fighting effort, stating [...] "It was just guts." [...] Though Zayat talked of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "We knew we were doing the impossible, shipping him back and forth." [...] The following day, Baffert said that American Pharoah was healthy and came out of the race in good shape. He said he had no regrets, stating, [...] "I'm glad I brought him. Racing needed something like this. He almost pulled it off." [...] Regarding Zayat's talk of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "Mr. Zayat is a very emotional man. We were all pretty disappointed... I know (Zayat) will be going back and forth... He's a sportsman for bringing him up here." [...] Five days later, Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, stating, [...] "I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again, and he deserves the chance to do so." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reception {{by trade}} publications. Walton of The Moving Picture News stated, [...] "The tender end, mother, is good; it's well acted. What I said about The Doctor's Carriage I repeat. This theme is far-fetched; the convict stripes unnecessary. Whoever {{was at the}} helm in this picture <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit mixed - as to the course." [...] The Moving Picture Worlds review was more neutral and stated the film was rather engaging and it will keep the audiences interest. The reviewer did not find either specific praise or fault in the actual production itself. The New York Dramatic Mirror was the most detailed in its review. The reviewer states, [...] "There are very strong situations in this picture story, based on the efforts {{of a young man}} and his sweetheart to prevent the young man's mother from knowing that he has been sent to prison. ... In a series of melodramatic scenes that are not as convincing as they might be, we see the son elude the penitentiary officers, and later he returns openly to his home with a newspaper in which is printed the confession of the criminal who had committed the offense of which the son had been convicted. Some of the scenes were handled too abruptly for the best results, but otherwise the acting appears satisfactory." [...] Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E

500|$|On race day California Chrome did {{not break}} boldly. Espinoza later {{explained}} something felt [...] "off" [...] and he held the horse back a bit {{instead of going to}} the lead. When asked to move to the front, the horse did not unleash his usual burst of speed. Immediately following the race, Espinoza said [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit empty today". [...] Tonalist won the race, and California Chrome finished fourth in a dead heat with Wicked Strong. [...] Initial post-race analysts criticized Espinoza for not taking the horse to the front early on, but noticed that California Chrome had had some blood on his right front heel. After the race, review of photos taken at the start showed that the horse next to him, Matterhorn, moved too far to the left and stepped on California Chrome's heel as both horses broke from the gate. [...] As a result, California Chrome had run the race with a [...] "chunk" [...] of tissue taken out of his right front heel and a small cut on his tendon. The tendon injury was superficial, but the heel injury may have been a factor in his loss. [...] Sherman explained that he knew that something was not right when he saw the horse throw his head up in the homestretch, and speculated later that the sand and dirt of the racetrack caused pain in the open wound. [...] The following day, Sherman assured the press that both injuries would heal.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Zap2it wrote, [...] "Sure, Blair's (Leighton Meester) {{been dreaming}} of her fairytale wedding since she <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl. But it's {{also true that}} producers of Gossip Girl have been dreaming of this moment {{for a long time}} as well. And the Upper East Side drama didn't disappoint. In fact, it was easy the best episode this season." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode a four stars rating out of five writing, [...] "In {{what has come to be}} sort of a make-or-break episode, Gossip Girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all the passion and loyalty we've invested over the years. While there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight - especially depending on your couple of choice - you can't find fault with the pure number of twists, especially during the last five minutes." [...] Marsi appreciated the references to Gossip Girls early days, [...] "The promised homages to the old days were there in spades, and incorporated in ways that actually fit the present-day story. Case in point: A memorable Gossip Girl quote ("I love you, always have, always will") which was spoken to a very different character long ago. Also, the cover of [...] "Young Folks" [...] at the onset was fun." [...] The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom also found the episode had honored Gossip Girls past, [...] "For the first time in recent memory, this week's milestone episode of Gossip Girl finally recaptured the confident plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons." [...] She also praised the fact Georgina is Gossip Girl which was totally unexpected. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments." [...] Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade.|$|E

2500|$|The Bronze Horseman symbolizes “Tsar Peter, {{the city}} of St Petersburg, and the uncanny reach of autocracy over the lives of {{ordinary}} people.” When Evgenii threatens the statue, he is threatening “everything distilled {{in the idea of}} Petersburg.” At first, Evgenii was just a lowly clerk that the Bronze Horseman could not deign to recognize because Evgenii was so far beneath him. However, when Evgenii challenges him, “Peter engages the world of Evgenii” as a response to Evgenii’s arrogance. The “statue stirs in response to his challenge” and gallops after him to crush his rebellion. [...] Before, Evgenii <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> man that the Bronze Horseman would not bother to respond to.
