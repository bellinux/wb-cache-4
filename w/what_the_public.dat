Daimler produced heavy, staid, large and small luxury cars with a stuffy, if sometimes opulent image. Jaguar produced lower quality cars at a remarkably low price, designed for enthusiasts.|$|E
25|$|The EA Falcon, {{released}} {{under the}} codename EA26 (E {{for the large}} size, A for Australia, 26 for the (usually in sequence) global project number), would retain the traditional Falcon hallmarks of width and rear-wheel drive. This {{proved to be the}} correct move as sales of the Falcon began to climb after the fuel crisis aftermath, while those of the rival Commodore slipped. It became clear that Australian buying patterns had not truly changed and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> wanted was a full-size (albeit smaller) family car.|$|E
25|$|The {{film and}} novel's storyline are {{concerned}} with the life of Howard Roark, an individualistic young architect who chooses to struggle in obscurity rather than compromise his artistic and personal vision, following his battle to practice <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> sees as modern architecture, which he believes to be superior, despite resistance from a traditionally minded architectural establishment. The complex relationships between Roark and the various kinds of individuals who assist or hinder his progress, or both, allow the film to be at once a romantic drama and a philosophical work. Roark is Rand's embodiment of the human spirit, and his struggle represents the struggle between individualism and collectivism.|$|E

25|$|After the dreadfully {{desultory}} affair at the Sydney Football Stadium {{a fortnight}} before, the ten-try bonanza {{turned on by}} the two sides at Ballymore was a timely reminder that running rugby, {{with the emphasis on}} the players and not the whistle, was <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> wanted. Welsh referee Clive Norling had given only thirteen penalties, ensuring the continuity needed by sides with the attacking flair of France and Australia. A close study of the video replay shows that Norling made at least six major mistakes, five of which led to points being scored. Nevertheless he was hailed as a hero for his willingness to let the players be the stars.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, {{the prisoners}} of war were forgotten, a fate seen in other {{countries}} too. In the United States, a Prisoner of War Medal was established, but only in 1986. Prisoners symbolised <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> {{did not wish to}} see. For the latter, they were not part of the war, did not defend their country and were living symbols of defeat. Thus, the memory of the prisoners was voluntarily buried, just as they themselves tried to forget in order to continue to live. However, they were the ones best suited to reflect on the Germans with whom they lived. The richness of their memoirs reveals analyses that are sometimes quite advanced, as is for instance the case with Jacques Rivière. For historiography, the prisoner is a hinge between two countries, who can reveal the importance of what was culturally and nationally at stake during the period.|$|E
25|$|As a writer, Halbertsma {{strongly}} sensed <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> needed, but at {{the same}} time he was a somewhat distant and cerebral author, which tended to have an averse effect on his poetry, especially compared to the poems of his brother Eeltsje, who was a much more emotional writer. Nevertheless, at least some of Halbertsma's poems, for instance Sibbel fan De Ryp ("Sibbel from De Ryp") and Nacht ("Night") have made a lasting impression. That said, Halbertsma's short stories were much more acute thanks to his limber use of language, his lively style of writing, and the fact that he refused to mince his words, leading to a rough, scoffing, and sometimes darkly grim atmosphere. His subject-matter Halbertsma collected from various sources, including German and French oral literature, which he matchlessly revised and placed in Friesland. He was a non-conformist, whose sharp judgments of the works of others made him far from universally loved. Before everything else, Halbertsma as a writer was an essayist and a satirist, who liked to include topical political and social questions in his literary works. From the anecdotes of people who knew or met him, he emerges as a sharp-witted and extremely diligent man of capacious erudition who was a droll story-teller.|$|E

500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeanine Basinger echoes similar sentiments on Turner's {{career in}} her book The Star Machine (2008), noting that Turner [...] "accepted limited roles and became a true sex symbol—an actress who played roles for which {{the meaning of the}} character came from a source other than the script, her own private life. She was cast only in roles that were symbolic of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> knew—or thought they knew—of her life from headlines she made as a person, not as a movie character... Her person became her persona." [...] Contemporarily, she has also been frequently associated with film noir and the femme fatale archetype among scholars for her role in The Postman Always Rings Twice.|$|E

The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. <b>Public</b> opinion is <b>the</b> aggregate logical thoughts that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> thinks and expresses about an issue (which {{does not have to be}} political in nature), while political climate is <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are.|$|R
