25|$|Buildings {{within the}} Anacostia Historic District are {{generally}} two-story brick and wood frame structures. The houses are primarily <b>wood</b> <b>frame</b> <b>construction,</b> {{mostly in the}} Italianate, Cottage, and Washington Row House architectural styles (although there are some homes in the Queen Anne style). Cottage-style buildings tend to have been built earlier, with Italianate structures more popular after 1870. Queen Anne-style homes tend to be clustered in Griswold's subdivision. Many of the homes feature large lawns and wrap-around porches.|$|E

50|$|Blocking is a general, American English {{term for}} the use of short pieces (blocks) of {{dimensional}} lumber in <b>wood</b> <b>framed</b> <b>construction.</b> Uses include filling, spacing, joining, or reinforcing members. Blocking is typically made from short off-cuts or defective, warped pieces of lumber. Blocking is also sometimes used by people in construction with the sense of a shim or spacer. Names for similar materials in other forms of English include dwang, nog, noggin, and nogging.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThroughout the years, {{different}} numerical HAM-simulation tools {{have been}} developed to assess and predict the heat, air and moisture response of building components. But, though commercially available and commonly applied in building practice, still, several simplifications and shortcomings exist in the common models. Probably the most important one, is the fact that most tools neglect or strongly simplify air transport, focusing only on heat and moisture transport. Especially for the analysis of <b>wood</b> <b>frame</b> <b>constructions,</b> these simplified models may cause a large discrepancy between simulation results and real performance. This study aims at a comparison of the outcomes of numerical HAM-simulations for <b>wood</b> <b>frame</b> <b>constructions</b> with experimental data of real test cases. In particular, the focus of this paper is on cavity ventilation behind brick veneer. Therefore, a simplified version of a <b>wood</b> <b>frame</b> wall with brick veneer cladding is studied in this paper. Different common modelling assumptions are compared. Furthermore, a detailed measuring campaign has been conducted at the VLIET test building of the KU Leuven to validate the different modelling approaches. By verifying the results of the numerical simulations by the data of real test cases, the reliability of the modelling assumptions can be analysed. The results of this study clearly show that simplified assumptions on cavity ventilation in HAM-models might cause large discrepancies between simulation results and in-situ measurements...|$|R
50|$|Corner {{buildings}} with curved facades are rare, but not unknown in Hawaii. However, {{most of them}} are masonry, not <b>wood</b> <b>frame</b> <b>constructions,</b> and no other such curved corner sits beneath a cantilevered, rectangular, Japanese-style (irimoya) hip and gable roof. The cantilevered, wrap-around balcony on the upper floor follows the curve of the walls beneath, serving the same function as the verandah walkways around traditional Japanese homes. The upper-story doors are also paned sliding doors, like Japanese shōji. Upper-story balconies were typical of many small family-owned shops, where the family lived above the shop.|$|R

50|$|Vinyl-sided sheds are {{typically}} built with standard <b>wood</b> <b>framing</b> <b>construction</b> and {{oriented strand board}} (OSB) on the walls covered with standard vinyl siding. The vinyl siding protects the OSB <b>wood</b> and the <b>frame</b> from moisture from rain and snow. Vinyl-sided sheds never need to be painted, and are maintenance-free. They are stronger than plastic or metal sheds, and are usually built to conform with the local building codes. They offer good value for money because they hold up in all weather, including winters with heavy snowfall, as they use a strong wooden frame and the OSB panels have stronger structural support than thin metal or PVC siding or roofs. Metal, plastic and resin sheds are cheaper, but they cannot handle the weight of snow in winter (roofs may cave in). Vinyl sheds also offer more colour options.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{proposal}} in Canada to increase the maximum allowable height of <b>wood</b> <b>framed</b> <b>construction</b> in the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) from 4 stories to 6 stories. Design of taller buildings {{will lead to a}} change in the details of the walls that have to withstand the higher axial and lateral loads. However, also requirements of other building physics disciplines, one of those being the sound insulation, still have to be met. In the study presented here various assemblies that meet the higher load requirements are compared for direct airborne sound insulation. Parameters that were modified include: sheathing membranes, stud arrangement, stud depth, and resilient channels. Some of the wall design variants that work well structurally have very poor sound insulation properties and most of them require the use of resilient channels to obtain somewhat acceptable sound insulation properties. These and more results will be presented here. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory testing {{on the performance}} of wall claddings using direct-applied (DEFS) and exterior insulation finish systems (EIFS) that incorporate water management features into their design and construc-tion. The work presented in this paper is a continuation of earlier work conducted by the Institute for Research in Construction (IRC) of the National Research Council, Canada (NRCC) and the United States Gypsum Company (USG) evaluating the water penetration and moisture performance of barrier EIFS clad walls (Brown et al., 1997). Direct-applied exterior finish systems (DEFS) are exterior wall claddings that use a water durable substrate, typically cement board, mechanically fastened to the wall framing over a sheathing membrane. A cementitious basecoat and textured acrylic synthetic stucco finish is then applied directly over the substrate. Insulation for the DEFS system is in the stud cavity. EIFS systems use a layer of foam insulation applied over the wall substrate, with basecoat and finish applied over the foam. The performance of three water managed wall cladding designs in protecting <b>wood</b> <b>framed</b> <b>construction</b> from water intrusion by wind-driven rain is described. Three different drainage systems were evaluated. Performance measures evaluated in-cluded cladding airtightness, pressure equalization potential, and water drainage under wind-driven rain conditions.

50|$|The Hamilton Woolen Company was {{established}} in the 1830s on the north bank of the Quinebaug River northwest of Southbridge's town center. The company owned much land in the area, and in the 1840s began to sell off land along High and School Streets, south of Main Street. These lots were sold with the restriction that houses with a value of at least $1000 be built on them. The result of this was a collection of Greek Revival houses, in a variety of configurations. Most are 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 stories in height, <b>wood</b> <b>frame</b> in <b>construction,</b> and have typical Greek Revival elements, including pilastered corners, entrances with sidelights and/or transoms, with gabled pediments above. Some houses have later 19th-century stylistic elements that were applied after their construction, giving them Italianate or later Victorian flavor. Two houses (26 School and 56 High) in the district are built out of brick.|$|R
