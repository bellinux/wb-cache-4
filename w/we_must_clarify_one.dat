40|$|In this paper, {{the writer}} has {{attempted}} to clarify {{the relations between the}} family, the school and punishment (prison), by studying Locke's modern social and educational theory. The parent's power over his child included the power of 'restraint and correction. This parent's power of correction was delegated to the tutor. The modern punishment was the restraint of freedom, and was executed in the House of Correction, an archetype of prison. (It was the regeneration of the House of Correction that Locke proposed as a Commissioner of Trade and Plantations in 1697.) Accordingly, the same power which took the form of 'Correction was exercised in the parent-child relation, the teacher-pupil relation and the gaoler-prisoner relation. This was a tacit premise of John Locke. Locke's "Some Thoughts concerning Education" (1693) was based on and suspended by the concept of 'Correction. Then, the writer {{has attempted to}} point out the same situation by studying Blackstone's "Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book I" (1765).

Three main issues address their molecular pathogenesis: whether the specific struc-ture of expanded polyglutamine diseases results in cellular toxicity; what type of dysfunction causes them; and how the toxic struc-ture causes dysfunction, that is, the link between structure and dysfunction. For structures, expanded polyglutamine proteins undergo transformation from monomers to oligomers and inclusions.

Although the expanded polyglutamine protein is toxic, it does not explain the selective vulner-ability of specific neurons in each polyglutamine disease. The normal function of each protein, including protein–protein interaction and modification, might also be crucial for pathogenesis. For dysfunction, various molecular mechanisms have been proposed, including dysregulation of transcription, impairment of the ubiquitin–proteasome system, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulation of intracellular Ca 21 homeostasis, impairment of axonal transport and genotoxic stress.

Water and agricultural land have traditionally had strong relationships. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>clarify</b> land tenure conditions and their relationships with water rights. This paper presents the results of studies focused on the relationships between agricultural land systems and water use in several African and Asian countries. It describes different situations related to land systems and water use, as well as the relationships between them. In study areas, in addition to historical backgrounds, land tenure may be associated with the extent to which state, customary, and individual involvements affect farmers’ de facto water rights. In general, water rights are clearly established in developed countries because formal administration of land and water resources has been functional and well-established. In developing countries, further institutional arrangements may be required to enable farmers to maintain water rights and increase efficient water use and management. However, no single solution is available. This paper describes how local contexts may vary with respect to land and water tenure. When PIM is introduced into irrigation schemes, it must be carefully integrated into agricultural land systems and the regulation of water rights in target areas. First, a land management system must be developed that secures farmers’ rights to ensure rational/optimal use of irrigation water. This offers important implications for rice irrigation and other crops that requires relatively intense and long-term investments in land development and advanced water management...|$|R
30|$|When we {{say that}} {{students}} participating in designed educational activities learn mathematical content by first learning to move in a new way, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>clarify</b> the mediating role of technology in acculturating this capacity to move in a new way. Very often, our physical actions are {{in direct contact with}} the objects we manipulate, such as when we lift a ball and throw it. Some educational designs leverage these naturally available, unmediated manipulation processes as sources of learning. For example, students may learn about physics principles of kinematics by experiencing and reflecting on the greater physical effort demanded in throwing a ball across greater spatial distance. Such design is both governed and limited by universal laws. However, our contact with the objects we manipulate can be moderated by intervening tools, such as when we use physical utensils (e.g., a fork) or electronic appliances (e.g., a remote control) to extend, augment, distribute, scale, and transform our physical actions over and through space, time, media, cultural forms, and fellow participants (Hutchins, 2014; White, 1984). As such, technology creates enactive distance between intention and effect. Learning to control the environment in instrumented situations is the process of removing this enactive distance by assimilating and mastering the instruments (Morgan & Kynigos, 2014; Pratt & Noss, 2010; Vérillon & Rabardel, 1995). For example, the blind and visually impaired learn to navigate space using a cane, where the cane becomes through practice a sensorimotor extension of the body into a thus expanded “enactive landscape” (Kirsh, 2013).|$|R

Methodological viewpoints presented by Miyazawa are such as the following : (1) The history of educational relations is a central problematic of the history of education as a meta-pedagogy or meta-science of education. (2) The educational relations are in themselves the educational subjects essentially. (3) The educational relations are educational contents learnt by both so-called subjects (teacher and pupil) that are formed by an asymmetrical relation. (4) Internalization of educational relations is discussed as a formation of habitus-ethos. This was often pointed out in early modern educational thoughts (ex. John Locke). (5) Power is exercised in the educational relations, when education occurs in it. (6) The history of the concept "education" is a central field investigated by the historical research of educational relations. "Education" did not mean school-instruction, of course. "Education" meant "san-iku (bearing and breeding up) " (Kunio Yanagida). We recollect that Jean-Jacques Rousseau referred to a Latin phrase "Educit obstetrix, educat nutrix. " in his Emile.

In this pursuit, I differentiate between the problems (i) How do persons persist? and (ii) What facts, if any, does personal identity consist in? Concerning the first question, I argue that persons persist three-dimensionally (the endurance view), and not four-dimensionally (the perdurarne view), on the ground that objects must always fall under some substance sortal concept S (the sortal dependency of individuation), and that the concept person entails that objects falling under it are three-dimensional. Concerning the second question, I differentiate between Criterianists, who maintain that it is possible to specify a non-circular and informative criterion for personal identity, and Non-Criterianists, who deny that such a specification is possible. I argue against Criterianist accounts of personal identity on the ground that they are either (i) circular, (ii) violate the intrinsicality of identity or (iii) do not adequately represent what we are essentially. I further criticise three Psychological Non-Criterianist accounts of personal identity on the ground that they wrongly assume that 'person' refers to mental entities. Instead I formulate the Revised Animal Attribute View where person is understood as a basic sortal concept which picks out a biological sort of enduring animals. In this, I claim that the real essence of a person is determined by the real essence of the kind of animal he is, without thereby denying that persons have a real essence as persons. digitalisering@um...|$|R

However, much uncertainty still remains concerning the magnitude of N deposition on grassland ecosystem in China. To study the spatial and temporal patterns of bulk N deposition, the levels of N (NH 4 +-N and NO 3 [...] N) concentration in rainfall were measured at 12 sites across a 1200 km grassland transect in Inner Mongolia, China, and the respective N deposition rates were estimated. The inorganic N deposition rates ranged from 4. 53 kg N ha- 1 to 12. 21 kg N ha- 1 with a mean value of 8. 07 kg N ha- 1 during the entire growing season, decreasing steadily from the eastern to the western regions. Inorganic N deposition occurred mainly in July and August across meadow steppe, typical steppe, and desert steppe, which corresponded to the seasonal distribution of mean annual precipitation. A positive relationship was found between inorganic N deposition and mean annual precipitation (R 2 = 0. 54 ~ 0. 72, P < 0. 0001) across the grassland transect. Annual estimation of inorganic N deposition was 0. 67 Pg yr- 1 in Inner Mongolia, China based on the correlation between N deposition rates and precipitation.

Schwartz, 1991; van der Heijden et al., 2002) and organizations (e. g. Global Business Networks (GBN]; SRI International). As outlined in Chapter 1, it relies upon the application of “intuitive logics” (Jungermann and Thuring, 1987), and is focused on the development of multiple scenarios that explore the “limits of possibility” for the future, rather than on the development of singular, “normative” scenarios of some ideal future to which to aspire. We have worked with and developed this scenario method over many years, engaging with many different organizational and country contexts, and with a variety of mixes of stakeholders. We have operated within project timescales that range from a few hours and a single set of rough scenarios, to several months and multiple iterations of scenario development, leading to highly-detailed scenario presentations. In order to enable you to develop and apply your own skills in working with scenarios in different situations, we offer approaches to creating scenarios that range from the application of “scenario thinking” by the individual in analyzing options in response to a complex problem within a constrained timeframe, to the use of “scenario method” by groups of diverse organizational members and stakeholders working together over a period of a few hours or many months.

We suggest that the prevailing perception of the degree of unequal opportunity in a large sample of respondents is only weakly correlated with its objective measure. We estimate a multilevel model considering both individual and country-level controls to explain individual perception of unequal opportunity.

The taxpayer is liable only if there exists a nexus or a connection between the State and the activities of the taxpayer. Some taxpayers have expressed concerns that current State tax policies are difficult to navigate, leading to unpredictable tax bills or incurring onerous paperwork. They contend that States utilize an overly broad tax nexus standard to impose unnecessary taxes and urge Congress to step in and define State tax nexus. State government representatives disagree. They contend the State taxes in accordance with the taxpayers’s use. The redefining of nexus would unfairly preempt States’ authority to tax and very likely lead to a substantial loss of State tax revenue. In response to the confusion, many legislative proposals have been introduced to clarify the nexus requirements.

One of the most ubiquitous measures used—the thickness of the cortex—shows abnormalities in a number of diseases and conditions, but the functional and biological correlates of such alterations are unclear. If the functional connotations of structural MRI measures are to be understood, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> strive to <b>clarify</b> the relationship between measures such as cortical thickness and their cytoarchitectural determinants. We therefore sought to determine whether patterns of cortical thickness mirror a key motif of the cortex, specifically its structural hierarchical organisation. We delineated three sensory hierarchies (visual, somatosensory and auditory) in two species—macaque and human—and explored whether cortical thickness was correlated with specific cytoarchitectural characteristics. Importantly, we controlled for cortical folding which impacts upon thickness and may obscure regional differences. Our results suggest that an easily measurable macroscopic brain parameter, namely, cortical thickness, is systematically related to cytoarchitecture and to the structural hierarchical organisation of the cortex. We argue that the measurement of cortical thickness gradients may become an important way to develop our understanding of brain structure–function relationships. The identification of alterations in such gradients may complement the observation of regionally localised cortical thickness changes in our understanding of normal development and neuropsychiatric illnesses...|$|R

A town is not only experienced or regulated through architecture, urban planning, large social and economic frames, it is also formed by individual impressions, mental maps and spatial exercises. It is in the streets that we understand, test and explore the urban space, and with the advantage of photography {{we are able to}} acknowledge and disclose features of the town. Our aim in this study is not to draw attention but to show that the objects and symbols brought to Portugal by the Brazilian returnees between the 18 th and early 20 th centuries has been, throughout this time and up until the present, maintained as the solid base of the local urban, social and economic spheres as a result of translation processes. We concentrate on the public dialogue we find within the town; what was built by “brasileiros” and why there is restraint in further development; does this collide with the aim to protect old buildings? Is there only one area considered as important in the town? We observe the parks, the squares, the streets, the extent of civic engagement in the town; do we notice a culture of entrepreneurs and the intention to innovate? We are analyzing objects and issues from a totally different era and are interpreting them in a new light, that of the present. The reason for and the origin of these objects and symbols are learned and translated against the present interpretation; this interpretation is only rendered possible while paratranslation is involved since all information surrounding each issue is important for us to understand and translate it further in time. We explore the reasons why a particular type of architecture was developed in such a desolate and solitary place, how and why it was introduced {{and the way in which}} it expanded and totally dominated the urban and social space, and we also analyse the evolution of some families since early settlement in Brazil. Thanks to a number of experiments we have carried out we can confirm the importance of this historical past and that a town relies almost entirely on its “Brazilian” echoes and background in the present day. Our field of study is the Portuguese town of Fafe situated in Minho, where we will concentrate our research on the very particular architecture brought into Portugal by the Brazilian returnee who will from now on be referred to as “brasileiro de torna viagem” or “brasileiro”. The history which is revealed as we look at the architecture, the lay-out of the town and the abundant and detailed symbolism affects the overall atmosphere and mechanism of this space. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>clarify</b> that <b>we</b> are not doing research in architecture, literature, anthropology or graphic arts but we are doing it from a (para) translational point of view as a paradigm that is used here to explain cultural exchanges and adaptations that take place through different media other than textual. In order to explain the connection between paratranslation and this project we will resort to Yuste Frías’ perspective concerning the way in which certain symbols are ‘seen’ and perceived which illustrates the concept of Paratranslation coined in Vigo in 2005...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} of historical background {{and nature of}} immigration after World War 2 have not been extensively carried out. Sixty four years have elapsed since after World War 2, history of Okinawan immigration will be readily an appropriate subject for migration studies. In this paper as a fundamental study, socio-economic background of Okinawa before reversion, population dynamics, repatriation of Okinawans from abroad, brief history of post-war immigrants from Okinawa, the nature of Okinawan immigrants were respectively analyzed from historical-geographic viewpoints. It is my perception that {{within the framework of}} migration Okinawa <b>we</b> <b>must</b> try to <b>clarify</b> the nature as well as to what immigration has implied to Okinawan people. Therefore, reexamination of historical significance of Okinawan migration after World War 2 should be instructive at the present time. While most of the young generations do not show an overt concern about role of immigration from Okinawa, it is my strong desire that this paper is to make young generation aware and recognize that Okinawa has been in the position of leading prefecture for emigration in Japan. And we are in the historical stage that the most of issei immigrants have passed away, and even nisei immigrants are already in matured and aged stage. The third and fourth generations are now in their active role. And in the age of global environment we should recognize the immigrants and their descendants being precious and great heritage for Okinawa. Therefore, Okinawa must strengthen the close relationships with Okinawan immigrants and their descendants in abroad. Finally, it is my sincere expectation that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> encourage the nisei and sansei immigrants to help seek their ethnic roots and expire theme to develop migration studies of immigrants from Okinawa...|$|R
