Two species, C. argentata and C. barbadensis, are widespread, <b>while</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others are restricted to Cuba and Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|In 504 the Gepids' {{power was}} {{significantly}} {{reduced by the}} Ostrogoths, who cut short their expansion into the Danubian plains. The Gepids restricted themselves to {{the eastern part of}} the Pannonian Basin; this was to form the core of Thurisind's dominions, just as it had under the previous Gepid kings. By the early 6th century, the Gepid nobility converted to Arian Christianity, <b>while</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gepids remained pagans.|$|E

5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, is the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, <b>while</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, {{is expected to increase}} in line with inflation. This situation is aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E

In fact, the partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to surrender to the New Zealanders at all.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{reputation}} was unsettled {{during the following}} centuries and his descendants were not notable, he gained standing during the 19th and 20th centuries.

Now generally considered {{the founder of the}} Lithuanian state, he is also now credited with stopping the advance of the Tatars towards the Baltic Sea, establishing international recognition of Lithuania, and turning it towards Western civilization. In the 1990s the historian Edvardas Gudavičius published research supporting an exact coronation date – 6 July 1253. This day is now an official national holiday, Statehood Day.|$|E

5|$|As Osijek grew as a city, the fort's {{presence}} hindered {{the potential}} for urban development.

The Yugoslav People's Army maintained a garrison and a military hospital in Tvrđa, but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned, and adapted into ateliers for local painters and sculptors.|$|E
