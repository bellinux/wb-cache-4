5|$|Having become {{versed in}} Kuba {{language}} and culture, Sheppard took {{a team of}} men {{to the edge of}} Kuba territory in 1892. His original plan <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for directions to the next village under the guise of purchasing supplies, but the chief of the village only allowed one of his men to go. Sheppard used a variety of tricks to make his way further into the kingdom, including having a scout follow a group of traders and, most famously, eating so many eggs that the townspeople could no longer supply him and his scout was able {{to gain access to the}} next village to find more eggs. Eventually, however, he encountered villagers that would allow him to go no further. While Sheppard was formulating a plan, the king's son, Prince N'toinzide, arrived and arrested Sheppard and his men for trespassing.|$|E
5|$|The French {{officers}} {{recruited by}} Pigneau {{were used to}} train Nguyễn Ánh's armed forces and introduce their technological expertise to the war effort. Olivier de Puymanel {{was responsible for the}} construction of fortifications. One of Nguyễn Ánh's first actions <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the French officers to design and oversee the construction of a modern European-style citadel in Saigon. The citadel was designed by Theodore Lebrun and de Puymanel and 30,000 people were used to construct it in 1790. The townfolk and their mandarins were heavily taxed for the work, and the labourers were worked {{to the extent that it}} provoked a revolt.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{recapture}} of Saigon, Nguyễn Ánh consolidated {{his power}} base and prepared {{the destruction of}} the Tây Sơn. His enemies had regularly raided the south and confiscated the annual rice harvests, so Nguyễn Ánh was keen to strengthen his defense. One of Nguyễn Ánh's first actions <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the French officers to design and supervise the construction of a modern European-style citadel in Saigon. The citadel was designed by Theodore Lebrun and de Puymanel, with 30,000 people mobilized for its construction in 1790. The townfolk and their mandarins were punitively taxed for the work; the laborers were worked so hard that they revolted. When finished, the stone citadel had a perimeter measuring 4,176 meters in a Vauban model. The fortress was bordered on three sides by pre-existing waterways, bolstering its natural defensive capability. Following the construction of the citadel, the Tây Sơn never again attempted to sail down the Saigon River and try to recapture the cityits presence having endowed Nguyễn Ánh with a substantial psychological advantage over his opponents. Nguyễn Ánh took a keen personal interest in fortifications, ordering his French advisers to travel home and bring back books with the latest scientific and technical studies on the subject.|$|E

25|$|The ITA's {{solution}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> ABC and Rediffusion {{to merge}} {{to form a}} new company. They specified that ABC would have a slim majority of the shares, and that the managing director would be Howard Thomas. In practice, the merger proved impossible due to outside interests held by both parent companies. Instead, the parent companies formed a joint company called Thames Television Holdings Limited (trading as Thames Television), which took over the staff of ABC in Teddington and a minority of staff from Rediffusion. Management and on-screen talent was mainly provided by ABC.|$|E

25|$|On May 1, 1880, Vizcarrondo and Rafael María de Labra {{became the}} founders of the Sociedad Nacional Democrática (National Democratic Society), a {{political}} party whose main goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for more autonomy for both Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1886, he was elected as the representative for his party of the district of Ponce, Puerto Rico. In the Spanish Parliament, Vizcarrondo recommended an autonomy modeled after the type that Canada had at that moment. In 1887, he participated in a massive campaign directed against the Spanish appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Romualdo Palacios, which resulted in the governor's replacement. Julio Vizcarrondo Coronado died in 1889, in Madrid.|$|E
25|$|Next, the {{governor}} sent {{his son to}} Constantinople (Istanbul) {{to meet with the}} Ottoman Sultan Mahmud I.

The sultan issued an official Firman in 1778 and paid Hussein Pasha al-Jalili 800 Qirsh to buy the village of Baghdida. The people of Baghdida were very upset about what had happened. They met and decided after long deliberation to abandon the village. When al-Jalili heard the story, he felt guilty and decided to return the village to its rightful owners. He issued a decree in 1778, in which he relinquished his ownership to Baghdida, but he kept his rights to receive the tenth of its produce in taxes.|$|E
25|$|His speech, {{usually called}} Pro restaurandis (or instaurandis) scholis (For the {{restoration}} of the schools), was probably delivered in 297 CE or 298 CE in the forum at Augustodunum or Lugdunum (modern day Lyon before the governor of the province. The purpose <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the governor if Eumenius may dedicate his salary (or a large part of it) to rebuild the schools at Autun. He praises the emperors (Constantius Chlorus and his colleagues of the tetrarchy) and sets forth the steps necessary to restore the schools to their former state of efficiency, stressing that he intends to assist the good work out of his own pocket. He cites the imperial letter of Constantius granting him his position and salary at length, and it is from the address of that letter that the name of the oration's author is preserved.|$|E

25|$|Haig dined with Byng on {{the evening}} of 24 March and ordered him to {{maintain}} contact at all costs with Horne’s First Army to his north. He told Byng that he was thinning his lines in the north ready to strike “when the enemy has penetrated to Amiens”. Harris argues that this seems to assume that Amiens would be lost and would need to be recovered to restore contact between Third and Fifth Armies. Travers suggests that Haig had written off both Fifth Army and the link with the French at this point, that his telephone call to Henry Wilson that evening <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him over to France to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, and that he wanted the 20 French divisions at Amiens not to maintain the link with the French but to cover the British retreat or perhaps to counterattack. Sheffield argues that orders to Third Army were not a precursor to retreat but “a means to an end”, pointing to orders for, if needs be, a counterattack onto the northern flank of the German attackers, and also argues that although GHQ had a duty to consider contingency plans, evacuation was, unlike in 1940, never actually likely.|$|E

500|$|Punishment {{for minor}} crimes {{involved}} either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, {{depending on the}} severity of the offense.

Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles {{played a major role in}} the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the god a [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] question concerning the right or wrong of an issue.

The Eugenics Record Office was renamed the Genetics Record Office, its funding was drastically cut, and it was closed completely in 1944. Senator Robert Reynolds attempted to get Laughlin reinstated, but Bush informed the trustees that an inquiry into Laughlin would [...] "show him to be physically incapable of directing an office, and an investigation of his scientific standing would be equally conclusive." ...|$|E
