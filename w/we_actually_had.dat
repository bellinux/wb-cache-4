Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded {{better than they}} originally thought. They briefly {{returned to}} Berlin in January 1991 to finish their work at Hansa. Reflecting on their time in Berlin, Clayton called the sessions a [...] "baptism of fire" [...] and said, [...] "It was something {{we had to go}} through to realize {{what we were trying to}} get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city—that there was not magic to it and that <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down." [...] Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain [...] "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{marriage}} equality at the time Rustin and partner Walter Naegle took an unconventional step to solidify their partnership and protect their unification. In 1982 Rustin adopted Naegle, 30 years old at the time, in order to legalize their union. Naegle explains, <b>We</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> to go through a process as if Bayard was adopting a small child. My biological mother had to sign a legal paper, a paper disowning me. They had to send a social worker to our home. When the social worker arrived, she had to sit us down to talk to us {{to make sure that this}} was a fit home.Davis Platt, Bayard's partner from the 1940s, said [...] "I never had any sense at all that Bayard felt any shame or guilt about his homosexuality. That was rare in those days. Rare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mothership Zeta has {{received}} mixed reactions from critics, averaging a 70 for the PC and a 65 for the Xbox 360. [...] Edge comments that [...] "Mothership Zetas greatest asset is its looks" [...] and that [...] "whoever designed such beauty should be pretty peeved {{at the game}} around it." [...] Edge also noted that they [...] "encountered a script bug so catastrophic that we couldn't finish the game – <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> to clip through a doorway and use console commands to bring everything back on track" [...] and criticize the DLC for locking off most of the ship after completion. [...] Eurogamer states that [...] "the most disappointing factor about Mothership Zeta is how little subtlety is afforded to the details" [...] and sums up the DLC as [...] "repetitive, largely uninspired corridor combat, and boring, linear and samey mission design." [...] Gamedaily praises Mothership Zeta for [...] "keep Fallouts trademark humor intact", its improved graphics, and for the new enemies and weapons introduced.|$|E

6000|$|Such is {{the present}} {{condition}} of the once famous emporium Leukè Kóme. We returned along the shore to embark; and, shortly after noon, the old corvette of Crimean date again swung round on her heel, and resumed her wanderings, this time northwards. The run of eighteen hours and fifteen minutes was semicircular, but the sea had subsided to a dead calm. The return to El-Wijh felt like being restored to civilization; <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> a salad of radish leaves--delicious! ...|$|E

I saw vessels becalmed, or with baffling winds, under this shore, while the bise was blowing stiff, a few leagues {{farther down the}} lake. When I got home I was {{surprised to hear that}} the family had been boating the previous evening, and that there had scarcely been any wind during the day. This difference was owing to the sheltered position of Vévey, of which the fact may serve to give you a better notion than a more laboured description.|$|E

6000|$|The Captain has {{a hearty}} {{contempt}} for his father, I can see, and calls him an old PUT, an old SNOB, an old CHAW-BACON, and numberless other pretty names. He has a DREADFUL REPUTATION among the ladies. He brings his hunters home with him, lives with the Squires of the county, asks whom he pleases to dinner, and Sir Pitt dares not say no, {{for fear of}} offending Miss Crawley, and missing his legacy when she dies of her apoplexy. Shall I tell you a compliment the Captain paid me? I must, it is so pretty. One evening <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> a dance; there was Sir Huddleston Fuddleston and his family, Sir Giles Wapshot and his young ladies, and I don't know how many more. Well, I heard him say--"By Jove, she's a neat little filly!" [...] meaning your humble servant; and he did me the honour to dance two country-dances with me. He gets on pretty gaily with the young Squires, with whom he drinks, bets, rides, and talks about hunting and shooting; {{but he says the}} country girls are BORES; indeed, I don't think he is far wrong. You should see the contempt with which they look down on poor me! When they dance I sit and play the piano very demurely; but the other night, coming in rather flushed from the dining-room, and seeing me employed in this way, he swore out loud that I was the best dancer in the room, and took a great oath that he would have the fiddlers from Mudbury.|$|E

He wasn't {{surprised}} by the comeback nature of the game, saying: [...] "We had been down before in matches. It wasn't {{the first time we}} were down. <b>We</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> a training game the week before when the As played the Bs {{and it was a very}} similar situation".

5000|$|Trip Shakespeare's next—and, as {{it turned}} out, last—major release was 1991's Lulu. Upon its release, Matt Wilson declared: [...] "On Lulu, we finally got it right.

So, we talked to Jay Lane, and <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> a jam with Jay Lane, and he brought this huge ball of energy back into the room from the very second he started playing, and that's the main reason we’re doing it again.

5000|$|Some {{scholars}} have challenged {{the notion that}} race is primarily a social construction by arguing that race has a biological basis. One of the researchers, Neil Risch, noted: [...] "we looked at the correlation between genetic structure on microsatellite markers versus self-description, we found 99.9% concordance between the two. <b>We</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> a higher discordance rate between self-reported sex and markers on the X chromosome!
