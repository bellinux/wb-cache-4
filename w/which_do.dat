5|$|The second {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a proper class is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets <b>which</b> <b>do</b> not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets <b>which</b> <b>do</b> not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set.|$|E

5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, <b>which</b> <b>do</b> not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E
5|$|Additionally {{there are}} often {{transient}} phenomena, events <b>which</b> <b>do</b> not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses. In the case of solar eclipses these {{can be used to}} date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E

We present two applications: (i) the θ parameter of effective lagrangians for chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, and (ii) the cosmological constant in N = 8 supergravity, <b>which</b> <b>does</b> not require a gauging of the O(8) symmetry, but is rather due to a spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry...|$|R

5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into batik pedalaman (inland batik) or batik pesisir (coastal batik). Batiks <b>which</b> <b>do</b> not fall neatly {{into one of these}} two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff <b>which</b> <b>do</b> not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E
5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors <b>which</b> <b>do</b> not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E

5|$|Even where metal {{objects such}} as bowls and dishes {{do not seem to}} have {{geometric}} decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object. Both closed designs (<b>which</b> <b>do</b> not repeat) and open or repetitive patterns are used. Patterns such as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12thcentury. Eva Baer notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.|$|E
5|$|Funerary art is {{any work}} of art forming, or placed in, a {{repository}} for {{the remains of the}} dead.

5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry.

Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, {{from the point of view}} of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.|$|E
5|$|Light gun {{shooters}} primarily {{revolve around}} shooting {{large numbers of}} enemies attacking in waves. The protagonist {{may be required to}} defend himself by taking cover, or by shooting incoming thrown weapons, such as axes or grenades. The player may also compete against the clock, however, with some games also featuring boss battles. Games may also reward the player for accurate shooting, with extra points, power-ups or secrets. Games <b>which</b> <b>do</b> not pit the player against antagonists instead feature elaborate challenges constructed mainly from inanimate objects, testing the player's speed and accuracy. More conventional games may feature these types of challenges as minigames.|$|E
5|$|Missions are tasks {{undertaken}} by a clan. There are {{four types of}} missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular missions, Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these missions are used to advance the story. In encounter missions, Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In dispatch missions, <b>which</b> <b>do</b> not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area missions are usually a dispatch mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.|$|E
