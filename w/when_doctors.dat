5|$|Gandhi's {{experiment}} with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai. Rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion. Gandhi began abstaining from cow's milk in 1912, {{and did so}} even <b>when</b> <b>doctors</b> advised him to consume milk. According to Sankar Ghose, Tagore described Gandhi as someone who did not abhor sex or women, but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals.|$|E

5|$|A {{radiation}} accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed cobalt-60 radiation source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who, {{together with a}} scrapyard worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to ionizing radiation. Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of radiation sickness and eventually sought medical attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), Thailand's nuclear regulatory agency, was notified <b>when</b> <b>doctors</b> came to suspect radiation injury, some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the radiation source, which was estimated to have an activity of , and was eventually traced to its owner. Investigations found failure to ensure secure storage of the radiation source to be {{the root cause of}} the accident, which resulted in ten people being hospitalized for radiation injury, three of whom died, as well as the potentially significant exposure of 1,872 people.|$|E

5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. <b>When</b> <b>doctors</b> examined him, they were concerned with his overall health, {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} that Pausch gave the lecture, he was a {{pancreatic}} cancer patient. In an interview, Pausch stated that he had felt bloated, and learned {{that he had a}} cancerous tumor <b>when</b> <b>doctors</b> performed a CT Scan to check for gallstones. He then underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy surgery (or the [...] "Whipple procedure") to try to stop the growth of the cancerous tumor in his body, which later proved to be unsuccessful. The doctors removed his gall bladder, parts of his small intestine, a third of his pancreas, and parts of his stomach, and proceeded to begin an experimental radiation treatment that could possibly increase his chances of survival for another 5 years to 45 percent. Pausch began the radiation treatments in November 2006 and stopped in May 2007, and felt that he was in good health after finishing. In July and August, tests conducted at Johns Hopkins University showed that Pausch was free of cancer. However, in late August of that year, Pausch informed readers of his website that his cancer had returned, saying: [...] "A recent CT scan showed that there are 10 tumors in my liver, and my spleen is also peppered with small tumors. The doctors say that {{it is one of the}} most aggressive recurrences they have ever seen." [...] The doctors estimated Pausch had three to six months of good health left to live.|$|E

[...] <b>When</b> <b>doctors</b> discovered a congenital heart problem, he was honorably discharged from service and sent home, where he began to build models of structures around Brookville, his hometown. [...] Every Christmas, in his home on Creek Street (the house has since been demolished), the buildings were assembled in a display, complete with Lionel trains running through it. [...] On Christmas Eve 1920, Charles hosted his brother's wedding and reception, and entertained the guests by running his train display.

2500|$|At the University of Chicago, {{he participated}} in field schools that exposed him to the methods and {{theories}} of James A. Ford, William Haag, Jesse D. Jennings, John Cotter, Glen Black, Tom Lewis, and Madeline Kneberg. [...] In addition, he was heavily influenced by Julian Steward’s Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Sociopolitical Groups (1938). [...] He earned his B.A. in 1940, his M.A. in 1944 and his Ph.D. in 1949. [...] That same year, while working in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, Mexico, MacNeish discovered primitive teosinte corncobs in context with human habitations dating back several thousand years. [...] This achievement spurred his lifelong interest in the origins of agriculture and society that would take him throughout Central and South America, eventually to China and, nearly, to Turkey. [...] This last trip was put on hold <b>when</b> <b>doctors</b> ordered him to rest after a mild heart attack.

2500|$|Brain {{replacement}} scenario:In this, we {{are asked}} to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue {{that there would be}} no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, [...] "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of you external behavior. You find, for example, that <b>when</b> <b>doctors</b> test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely out your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same." [...] This response, however, is impossible, as identical signals would be sent to the remaining organic regions of the brain as would be sent under normal circumstances, by the definition of the behavior of the hypothetical computers. (See Ship of Theseus for a similar thought experiment.) ...|$|E
