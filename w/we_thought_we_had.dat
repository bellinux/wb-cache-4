500|$|On 29 April 2015, Boyd {{was married}} {{for the third}} time at the Chelsea Register Office at Chelsea Old Town Hall in London. Her husband, {{property}} developer Rod Weston, was quoted as saying, [...] "It's almost our silver anniversary so <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better get on with it".|$|E
500|$|... "We {{decided to}} go in and film her doing her thing [...] so even though she wasn't at the show, she could still {{be a part of the}} show. As big as that song is getting for us right now, it was {{definitely}} a song that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to have in the show. She cut a thing for us to use, and I cut a thing for her to use in her show if she wants to do that. It's a cool way to have her be a part of the show even though she's not going to be there every night." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Mercedes apologised to Hamilton for the pit call, which {{commentators}} such as F1Fanatic's Keith Collantine, Formula One {{correspondent for}} The Guardian Paul Weaver, and former Formula One driver David Coulthard felt cost him the victory. Team boss Toto Wolff told the press: [...] "We got our numbers wrong. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the gap for Lewis to take fresh tyres {{and come back}} out in the lead behind the safety car, ahead of Nico and covering off any risk of another competitor taking fresh tyres. But the calculation was incorrect and he came out in third place." [...] Indeed, {{more than half of}} the teams made a pit stop at least one car when the safety car was deployed, just as Hamilton did. However, he as race leader caught up with the safety car quicker and lost a considerably larger amount of time on his way into the pit lane, leading to him coming out behind Rosberg and Vettel.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{there is}} another thing, Dave," [...] Zeke put in; [...] "we must <b>have</b> a watch. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> {{intended}} that, but <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> only one place to watch; now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> found this track up the hill <b>we</b> <b>have</b> two." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> enough sailing. <b>We</b> did {{not want}} to overdo the thing and get a surfeit of it. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> had a sail—a good all-round exciting, {{interesting}} sail—and now <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> a row, just for a change like.|$|R
2500|$|... "I don't think there's {{any point}} in being Irish if you don't know {{that the world is}} going to break your heart eventually. I guess that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a little more time."– Reacting to the {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy, November 1963 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, Professor Lemm is down on us, and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to do {{something}} to get square," [...] Andy endeavored to explain.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{thought of}} that at once, my dear. We've looked all through the British Museum. Once <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> succeeded. But {{it turned out to}} be Wisconsin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{used some}} powder like pepper for embalmin' in those days,' said the clerk. 'And the vicar--it was in old Bellamy's time--'e took a sniff into the grave, an' 'e sneezed an' sneezed till <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> should <b>'ave</b> to fetch a doctor. 'Ave you seen Mrs. Pepys' tomb?' ...|$|R
6000|$|At least <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> been {{at peace}} here; but one afternoon, when Jaquetta had gone {{across to the}} village to see some {{purchase}} at the shop, she came back flushed and breathless, and said as she sat down by me, [...] "Oh! Ursie, Ursie, I met Miss Prior; and she has bought Spinney Lawn." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could, but <b>had</b> been {{so intent}} that nobody noticed the {{trampling}} of horses' hoofs until a wagon was drawn up close by, and several riders reined in their beasts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Markham said {{something}} in a business letter that alarmed Amy. She wrote to inquire, and on his second letter <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better come and see after you ourselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{we first}} heard your voices, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> run {{into some of}} our enemies," [...] said Dick. [...] "We were mighty glad to learn otherwise. Now, if Sam was only here--" ...|$|E
60|$|Plunging {{into the}} groves, we thanked our stars {{that we had}} thus {{narrowly}} escaped being apprehended as runaway seamen, and marched off to the beach. This, at least, was what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> escaped.|$|E
60|$|For {{the rest}} of the afternoon, and indeed far into the night, our {{conversation}} consisted almost entirely of conjectures regarding the probable condition of things at the house. <b>We</b> both <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> done right, but we felt badly about it. It was not hospitable, to be sure; but then I should have no other holiday until next year, and our friends could come at any time to see us.|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> gave much <b>thought</b> as to whom <b>we</b> should invite as speaker. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> {{wanted to}} <b>have</b> a typical great man {{representative}} of Rugby Football, so {{we came to}} Aspatria and invited the president Mr Bob Hanvey to Corpus Christi College, and no-one could have spoken better." ...|$|R
50|$|We've been {{approached}} by the major labels {{over the past seven}} or eight years but <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were <b>having</b> an impact where we were. They were never willing to give us complete control. This time they were willing to give us complete control over what we record, the artwork, who we tour with. We won't be censored. If there was ever a time to take a chance to be heard on a mass scale then this is the time. I feel like we've been a voice in the wilderness for too long.|$|R
60|$|There {{could be}} no doubt that the whole Prussian army, which <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{destroyed}} at Ligny, was about to throw itself upon our right wing while Marshal Grouchy had been coaxed away upon some fool's errand.|$|E
60|$|The third spring came, and our boy was born. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{been happy}} before; now {{we knew that}} we had only dreamed a {{pleasant}} dream of happiness, and had awakened to this exquisite reality. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> loved each other before; now, as I looked into my wife's pale face, blanched with its baptism of pain, and met the uplifted gaze of her blue eyes, aglow with the holy passion of motherhood, I knew we had only imagined what love might be. The imagination had been sweet, as the thought of the rose is sweet before the bud is open; but as the rose to the thought, so was love to the imagination of it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{better take}} advice: it seemed rather a lark, too, don't you know? The fact is--you {{appear to have}} divined it somehow--we find {{that we are all}} engaged to the same lady. We can't fight, and we can't all marry her.' ...|$|E
50|$|Wim Wenders {{said about}} Until the End of the World:"Solveig Dommartin and I {{had written the}} story of our film together, and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> only <b>had</b> the right to enter into such a sacred area like a person's dreams, if we would bring {{something}} into the work that was sacred to ourselves".|$|R
40|$|All {{three books}} {{reviewed}} here are turning over again {{for us the}} pages of perennially irresistible thinkers whose ideas never cease to hold us transfixed; all three are inviting us to notice that the material that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> knew <b>has</b> got {{more to do with}} what Nehamas calls 'the art of living' than <b>we</b> might <b>have</b> realised; and all three are making space for attitudes, responses and areas of self-understanding that are, by traditional classifications, irrational and hence sometimes inadequately acknowledged by philosophy as we usually understand it. And, of course, all three are juxtaposing thinkers from the ancient world with major figures from recent and early modern times...|$|R
2500|$|Hell's Kitchen {{changed their}} {{name to the}} Superjesus {{on the eve of}} the Big Day Out in Adelaide on Australia Day long-weekend, January 1996. Tennent {{provided}} the new name. Berryman explained, [...] "It was basically just a piss-take on commonly used words in the '90s. Like The Jesus and Mary Chain, [...] "Jesus Built My Hotrod", the Jesus Lizard, Jesus Jones; there's just heaps of Jesus' out there in the music world so <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> that and super was kind of like a '90s catch word." [...] Their debut five-track extended play, Eight Step Rail, was released in August 1996 on Aloha Records. It spent a couple of months on top of the Australian Independent charts.|$|R
6000|$|... "--whom we met {{afterward}} at the spread," [...] she concluded. [...] "How did {{you manage}} it all? Mr. Irving in the 'Lyons Mail' was nothing to it. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> walked directly over from the Tree; and there you were, all ready to receive us, in immaculate evening dress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why be indignant?" [...] he remonstrated. [...] "It has not happened. I gave up {{pleading}} with Wang. Here we are, repulsed! Not only without power {{to resist the}} evil, but unable to make terms for ourselves with the worthy envoys, the envoys extraordinary of the world <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> done with for years and years. And that's bad, Lena, very bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|They ran us for hours. The forest seemed interminable. We kept to the glades {{as much as}} possible, {{but they}} always ended in more thick forest. Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> escaped, {{and sat down to}} rest; but always, before we could recover our breath, we would hear the hateful [...] "Whoo-whoo!" [...] cries and the terrible [...] "Goek! Goek! Goek!" [...] This latter {{sometimes}} terminated in a savage [...] "Ha ha ha ha haaaaa!!!" ...|$|E
60|$|So we {{take each}} other by the hand, full of hope and love, and from that hour Mother Nature has done with us. Let the {{wrinkles}} come; let our voices grow harsh; let the fire she lighted in our hearts die out; let the foolish selfishness <b>we</b> both <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> put behind us for ever creep back to us, bringing unkindness and indifference, angry thoughts and cruel words into our lives. What cares she? She has caught us, and chained us to her work. She is our universal mother-in-law. She has done the match-making; for the rest, she leaves it to ourselves. We can love or we can fight; it is all one to her, confound her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Scarcely was the Prince got in, {{when they}} came to tell me, for his worse luck, that Prince Heinrich," [...] the Ill Margraf, [...] "was come;--who {{accordingly}} trotted him out, {{in such a way that}} <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> should all <b>have</b> died with laughing. Incessant praises were given him, especially for his fine clothes, his fine air, and his uncommon agility in dancing. And indeed I thought the dancing would never end.|$|R
60|$|On {{an earlier}} day {{there was another}} witness before the Court of Inquiry. A mighty {{official}} of the White Star Line. The impression of his testimony which the Report gave is of an almost scornful impatience with all this fuss and pother. Boats! Of course <b>we</b> <b>have</b> crowded our decks with them in answer to this ignorant clamour. Mere lumber! How can we handle so many boats with our davits? Your people don't know {{the conditions of the}} problem. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> given these matters our best consideration, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> reasonable. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> done more than our duty. We are wise, and good, and impeccable. And whoever says otherwise is either ignorant or wicked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't we? It {{was just}} in time for the skating," [...] said Jock. [...] "Only the worst of it is, {{everybody}} will come to the lake, and so mother won't learn to skate. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> found a jolly little place in the wood, where we could have had some fun with her, but they found it out, though we halloed as loud as ever we could to keep them off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{he is the}} {{ostensible}} Stephenson too, {{and sold}} every important citizen in this town with his bogus secret. Now if he has sent cheques instead of money, we are sold too, after <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> escaped. I {{was beginning to feel}} fairly comfortable once more, after my night's rest, but the look of that envelope makes me sick. It isn't fat enough; $8,500 in even the largest bank-notes makes more bulk than that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [108] Ah, what a {{smile was}} that! How much sin {{was there in}} it, instead of humble spiritual gratitude, and joy. Now see how he that exalteth himself shall be abased, and how surely, along with spiritual pride, comes carelessness, false security, and a grievous fall-(Cheever). The very person's hand {{we need to help}} us, whom <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> exceeded-(Mason). When a {{consciousness}} of superiority to other Christians leads to vain glory, a fall will be the consequence; but while it excites compassion, it also cements Christian friendship-(Ivimey).|$|E
5000|$|As cotton prices fell, poor white farmers {{lost their}} land and turned to {{sharecropping}} and tenancy; some of those were {{willing to give up}} farming and move to mill towns. One white mill worker said, we [...] "made good money compared with the farm." [...] Another white sharecropper said, [...] "Mebbe we ain’t got much, but <b>we</b> sure <b>has</b> got more." [...] And at least one white ex-farmer remembered the move with considerable enthusiasm: [...] "Yeah! Oh <b>we</b> just <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> almost come to heaven when we got up here. <b>We</b> didn’t <b>have</b> to pick cotton, chop cotton, like that. Just go to work and come back and nothing else to do. And <b>we</b> really <b>had</b> it made when we come here." ...|$|R
5000|$|Aćimović on his team's {{role at the}} UEFA Euro 1976: [...] "Two things {{factored}} in our final result. First of all, the score {{of the first half}} of the match with Germany and then the fact that we, as hosts of the tournament, were prevented from our plans of showing what we were made of. Against the Germans, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the final in our hands. At half time, some of us players were even talking about the final. The atmosphere in Belgrade and Zagreb was good but there was pressure felt everywhere we went. Everyone expected the gold medal and we weren't able to carry that weight on our shoulders." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{concept of}} Aquaman {{stemmed from a}} fifth season episode of Smallville, [...] "Aqua". The episode {{featured}} Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) coming to Smallville to stop an underwater weapons project being developed by LuthorCorp. [...] "Aqua" [...] became the highest rated episode for Smallville that season, {{but it was never}} meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman series. However, as work progressed on [...] "Aqua", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series. Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, the creators of Smallville, also considered a series featuring Lois Lane, but felt more confident about Aquaman. Millar said," [...] was the first idea where <b>we</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a franchise where we could see 100 episodes." ...|$|R
