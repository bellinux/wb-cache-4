5|$|McClellan's {{experiences}} in the war would shape his military and political life. He learned that flanking movements (used by Scott at Cerro Gordo) are often better than frontal assaults, {{and the value of}} siege operations (Veracruz). He witnessed Scott's success in balancing political with military affairs, and his good relations with the civil population as he invaded, enforcing strict discipline on his soldiers to minimize damage to property. McClellan also developed a disdain for volunteer soldiers and officers, particularly politicians <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> nothing for discipline and training.|$|E

5|$|Pound {{was fascinated}} by the {{translations}} of Japanese poetry and Noh plays which he discovered in the papers of Ernest Fenollosa, an American professor who had taught in Japan. Fenollosa had studied Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars; in 1913 his widow, Mary McNeil Fenollosa, decided to give his unpublished notes to Pound after seeing his work; she was looking for someone <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> about poetry rather than philology. Pound edited and published Fenellosa's The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Terry Pratchett {{was pleased}} with the 1986 {{interactive}} fiction game The Colour of Magic, but criticised its poor marketing. He was reluctant to grant Discworld licences due to concern for the series, and wanted a reputable company <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> about the property. Other video game companies had previously approached Pratchett seeking a licence. One such company was AdventureSoft, and their failure to obtain a Discworld licence {{led to the creation of}} Simon the Sorcerer, which took inspiration from the Discworld series of books.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} because the designer Gregg Barnett wanted a large adventure for CD-based systems. A licence {{was difficult to}} obtain; Pratchett was reluctant to grant one as he wanted a Discworld game to be developed by a company with a reputation and <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> about the property. An original story was created due to Barnett having difficulty basing games on one book. Discworld was praised for its humour, voice-acting and graphics, though some criticised its gameplay and difficult puzzles. Discworld {{was followed by a}} sequel, , in 1996.|$|E

5|$|The {{new owners}} of Santa María de Óvila were well-to-do farmers <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> little for the {{buildings}}. For a brief time, the former monastery {{was used as}} a hostel, but mainly, the buildings were subjected to hard agricultural use as barns sheltering livestock. The chapter house served as a manure pit. Other buildings were used as storage. In the early 20th century small trees were seen to be growing in the dirt packed atop the monastery roofs—the protective roof tiles had long since been taken down and sold.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} {{military}} mandarin from central Vietnam, Định moved south {{when his father was}} posted to Gia Định as the provincial commander. Định grew up to lead {{a military}} colony, overseeing the settlement and economic development of his constituency. He gained a reputation for being an able leader and land developer <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> for his people. When France began its invasion of southern Vietnam in 1859, Định organised local militia to reinforce the imperial army. As the regular army units suffered defeats on the battlefield, its remnants joined Định's partisans, and by 1861, he had around 6,000 men under his command. Định built his own resistance base and organised guerrilla attacks against the French. His success led Tự Đức to grant Định command of the southern partisans and to order the regular commanders to coordinate their plans with him. Định's forces quickly gained the respect of the French. They focused on disrupting the French bureaucracy and military posts in addition to the transportation of rice. Their most notable attack was the sinking of L'Espérance in December 1861.|$|E
5|$|Zhu Xi {{was one of}} {{many critics}} who argued that {{government}} schools did not sufficiently encourage personal cultivation of the self and molded students into officials <b>who</b> <b>cared</b> only for profit and salary. Not all social and political philosophers in the Song period blamed the examination system as {{the root of the problem}} (but merely as a method of recruitment and selection), emphasizing instead the gentry's failure to take responsibility in society as the cultural elite. Zhu Xi also laid emphasis on the Four Books, a series of Confucian classics that would become the official introduction of education for all Confucian students, yet were initially discarded by his contemporaries. After his death, his commentary on the Four Books found appeal amongst scholar-officials and in 1241 his writings were adopted as mandatory readings for examination candidates with the support of Emperor Lizong (r. 1224–1264).|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} e¤ects of local status, where workers compare their wage to the wage of other workers {{within the same}} …rm. We assume a {{competitive}} labor mar-ket with unobservable e¤ort, where …rms condition wages on output as incentive for e¤ort. If workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about status are also more productive, such status concerns generate an equilibrium with heterogenous …rms where workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> and workers <b>who</b> do not <b>care</b> about status work together. Such …rms provide work-ers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about status with stronger incentives to exert e¤ort, compared with workers <b>who</b> do not <b>care.</b> The main result is that status concerns increase within …rm wage di¤erences and over all wage inequality.
