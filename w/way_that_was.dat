5|$|Her uncle Ásmundr {{probably}} {{died in the}} Battle of Fýrisvellir, in the 980s, and it {{was probably}} {{at the side of}} king Eric the Victorious. Özurr had entered into the service of a more powerful liege and died for the Byzantine Emperor. Halfdan may have died either on Bornholm or in a holmgang, whereas where Kári died remains uncertain. The most likely interpretation may be that he died on Od, the old name for the north-western cape of Zealand, but {{it is also possible that}} it was at Dundee in Scotland. Búi's location of death is not given, but Larsson (2002) comments that it was probably in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not considered as glorious as those of his brothers.|$|E
5|$|People {{identifying}} with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999). The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, {{and is often}} used to refer to non-autistic people. The Internet has allowed individuals with AS {{to communicate with each other}} in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like Wrong Planet have made it easier for individuals to connect.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Shrewsbury {{sequence}} {{has been}} particularly admired, and inspired later movies, including Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Film critics have compared it to the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin and the Battle on the Ice sequence in Alexander Nevsky, both directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Kenneth Branagh's Henry V used Welles's Battle of Shrewsbury sequence as an inspiration for the Battle of Agincourt, and depicted Prince Hal's rejection of Falstaff in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> more influenced by Chimes at Midnight than from more traditional interpretations of the scene. In 1988, director Patrick Garland staged a version of Chimes at Midnight starring Simon Callow as Falstaff at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Michael Anderegg said that Chimes at Midnights use of wide angle lenses, low-key lighting and costumes, and its focus {{on the relationship between}} Falstaff and Prince Hal influenced My Own Private IdahoGus Van Sant's 1991 loose adaptation of Henry IV Parts 1 and 2.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

25|$|Some modern {{scholars}} and writers have interpreted the love between David and Jonathan as more intimate than platonic friendship. This was first pioneered by Tom Horner, then adopted by John Boswell.

Jonathan and David cared deeply about each other in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> arguably stronger and more intimate than a platonic friendship.|$|E

The high fidelity of these scans allowed Lacovara et al.

25|$|Up to 1888 it was believed, {{on account}} of the {{testimony}} of one of Elizabeth's servants during the canonization process, that Elizabeth was driven from the Wartburg in the winter of 1227 by her brother-in-law, Heinrich Raspe, who acted as regent for her son, then only five years old. About 1888 various investigators (Börner, Mielke, Wenck, E. Michael, etc.) asserted that Elizabeth left the Wartburg voluntarily. She was not able at the castle to follow Konrad's command to eat only food obtained in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> certainly right and proper.|$|E

The NYWW network is currently providing coverage on the Hudson River, East River, and Upper New York Bay. With the wireless network in place, NY Waterway is able to take control of its fleet and passengers in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not previously possible.

25|$|In many {{subsequent}} paintings dancers {{were shown}} backstage or in rehearsal, emphasizing {{their status as}} professionals doing a job. From 1870 Degas increasingly painted ballet subjects, partly because they sold well and provided him with needed income after his brother's debts had left the family bankrupt. Degas began to paint café life as well, in works such as L'Absinthe and Singer with a Glove. His paintings often hinted at narrative content in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> highly ambiguous; for example, Interior (which has also been called The Rape) has presented a conundrum to art historians {{in search of a}} literary source—Thérèse Raquin has been suggested—but it may be a depiction of prostitution.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} {{recommended by the}} Federal Courts Study Committee that the U.S. Parole Commission or a successor agency conduct hearings in supervised release cases, but this proposal {{was rejected by the}} Judicial Conference of the United States, partly because the judges felt that the judicial officer who imposed the supervised release conditions would be best able to interpret those conditions in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> intended at sentencing. It was also deemed desirable that supervised release revocations be subject to the same procedural safeguards as probation revocations. The Judicial Conference also opposed mandatory drug testing and mandatory revocation of probation and supervised release, requirements imposed by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the theatre, some {{transfer}} of resources was made from the subsidy of the national theatres to the support for theatre companies which did not necessarily have an institutional home. A significant investment was made in music education {{with the creation of}} 5 new music schools in the departements and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris was considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.|$|E
