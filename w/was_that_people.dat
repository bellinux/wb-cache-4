5|$|What {{is today}} Route31 was {{defined in the}} 1927 New Jersey state highway {{renumbering}} as Route30, a highway that began in Trenton and ended in Buttzville. In the 1953 renumbering, Route30 was renumbered as Route69, as the number conflicted with US30 in southern New Jersey. The bypass of Ringoes, shared with US202, opened in the1960s. Due to the sexual meaning of the number and resulting sign theft, Route69 was changed in1967 to Route31 once all the signs were removed. The justification for the removal <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> were stealing signs as a trophy for dorm rooms because of their interest in the number69.|$|E

Notably the main reason behind the drop <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> wanted to see quick changes in state policies and that actions and judgements for the ousted former Prime Minister were not forthcoming soon enough.|$|E
25|$|One study {{looked at}} the root of the hot-hand fallacy as being from an {{inability}} to appropriately judge sequences. The study compiled research from dozens of behavioral and cognitive studies that examined the hot-hand and gambler's fallacies with random mechanisms and skill-generated streaks. In terms of judging random sequences the general conclusion <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> do not have a statistically correct concept of random. It concluded that human beings are built to see patterns in sensory and conceptual data of all types.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{alternative}} {{theories of the}} cognitive processes <b>that</b> human reasoning <b>is</b> based on.

25|$|One of {{the reasons}} that the Provisional IRA and Provisional Sinn Féin were founded, in December 1969 and January 1970, respectively, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> like Ó Brádaigh, O'Connell and McKee opposed {{participation}} in constitutional politics. The other reason was the failure of the Cathal Goulding leadership to provide for the defence of Irish nationalist areas during the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. When, at the December 1969 IRA convention and the January 1970 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis, the delegates voted to participate in the Dublin (Leinster House), Belfast (Stormont) and London (Westminster) parliaments, the organisations split. Adams, who had joined the republican movement in the early 1960s, sided with the Provisionals.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, McWilliams began {{a series}} of concerts at the school that gave {{students}} the opportunity to hear work by such contemporary musicians and performances as Korean composer Nam June Paik and his collaborator, cellist Charlotte Moorman; Japanese composer Takehisa Kosugi; German Happenings artist Wolf Vostell; the musician/composer team of La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela, and minimalist composer Terry Riley. The events were sometimes controversial. Paik and Moorman's concert was almost stopped when Moorman began a striptease as part of Paik's Pop Sonata. Riley's first-ever all-night concert, conceived by McWilliams and performed with Young and Zazeela on November 17–18, 1967, raised fears of litigation among school administrators. McWilliams's idea <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> could bring their families and sleeping bags and spend the night at the gallery, but because the school had never been open overnight before, administrators required him to personally carry liability insurance for the event.|$|E
25|$|In Steve Lenius' {{original}} 2001 {{paper he}} explored {{the acceptance of}} bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual BDSM community. The reasoning behind this is that 'coming-out' had become primarily {{the territory of the}} gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.|$|E

500|$|Mahathir later {{explained}} that [...] "The idea before <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> should become 100 per cent Malay {{in order to}} be Malaysian. We now accept that this is a multi-racial country. We should build bridges instead of trying to remove completely the barriers separating us." [...] Such a dramatic change was perceived by the non-Malay communities as a [...] "complete retraction" [...] of earlier policies emphasising assimilation of non-Malays. The government took measures to stress this change, decreasing emphasis on Malay as the one and only national language by permitting local universities to use English as the medium of instruction for certain subjects. Diplomas from the MCA-sponsored and Chinese-majority Tunku Abdul Rahman College (TARC) were officially recognised by the government for employment in the civil service. For the first time, religions other than Islam were given airtime on state radio and television, although they were not allowed to proselytise. Lion dances — a traditional Chinese performance which had been banned for decades — were not only permitted but even attended by Mahathir and other top government officials.|$|E
500|$|Jon Snow {{was killed}} in the fifth-season finale, [...] "Mother's Mercy", and in the lead up to the sixth season, actor Kit Harington, who portrays the character, stated {{that he would not be}} {{returning}} to the series except to play a corpse, and would not be resurrected despite rampant speculation. Following the airing of [...] "Home", Harington issued a public apology to fans of the show, stating that he would [...] "like to say sorry for lying to everyone. I'm glad that people were upset that he died. I think my biggest fear <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> were not going to care. Or it would just be, 'Fine, Jon Snow's dead.' But it seems like people had a, similar to the Red Wedding episode, kind of grief about it. Which means something I'm doing — or the show is doing — is right." [...] Harington was simply referred to as [...] "LC", for Lord Commander, in all scripts, call sheets, props or wardrobe materials, in order to maintain the secrecy involved with his eventual resurrection in the episode. It was also revealed that during production of the season, even verbal communication of the name 'Jon Snow' was disallowed, except in on-camera dialogue during actual taping of the series.|$|E
500|$|Wise {{says that}} his {{contract}} with MGM specified that the picture could only be shot in black-and-white, which Wise preferred for this genre of film. He attempted to make Ettington Park look more sinister through various lighting effects and camera settings, but this failed. Wise and Boulton then hit {{on the idea of}} using infrared film for establishing shots of the house. Infrared film stocks were quickly rushed to the location shoot from Belgium. The new film worked. Wise felt the infrared film brought out the [...] "striations of the stone" [...] and made the mansion look like [...] "more of a monster house". Wise very much wanted to make The Haunting a tribute to Val Lewton, the producer and writer under whom Wise had directed his first film (the supernatural horror picture Curse of the Cat People). Wise says that Lewton's theory of horror <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> were more afraid of the unknown than things they could see. The decision to show little that was supernatural was made very early in the picture's pre-production. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton also wanted to make distances in the film (such as hallways) look longer and darker than the audience would anticipate. Wise approached the Panavision company, and wanted an anamorphic, wide-angle lens. The only lens Panavision had was a 40mm. Wise learned that the company was working on a 30mm lens, but it contained distortions and was not ready. Wise kept pressing, and eventually Panavision turned over the 30mm lens on the condition that Wise signed a memorandum in which he acknowledged it was imperfect. Wise and Boulton also planned shots that kept the camera moving, utilised low-angle shots, and incorporated unusual pans and tracking shots. This led {{to some of the most}} active camera movements in Wise's film career. To accentuate the feeling that the house was alive, exterior shots were filmed so that the windows appeared to be eyes.|$|E

But because people are naive scientists, they sometimes employ systems for construing {{the world that are}} distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable to their current social situation.

2500|$|Defining {{someone as}} insane was a {{necessary}} prerequisite for being admitted to a facility. A doctor was only called after someone was labelled insane on social terms and had become socially or economically problematic. Until the 1890s, little distinction existed between the lunatic and criminal lunatic. The term was often used to police vagrancy as well as paupers and the insane. In the 1850s, lurid rumours that medical doctors were declaring normal people [...] "insane" [...] in Britain, were spread by the press causing widespread public anxiety. The fear <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who were a source of embarrassment to their families were conveniently disposed of into asylums with the willing connivance of the psychiatric profession.
