25|$|When he {{was really}} down, {{depressed}} about things. A relationship had failed. He rang me in a terrible state {{and asked me to}} go down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my <b>wife,</b> <b>said</b> you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E

He was then sent to a loose form of house arrest in Huế and the train stopped at Vinh, Nghệ An, Vietnam. On the way, his <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> “I am very happy. From now on, my only wish is that you will hold to your initial aspiration. Do whatever you like, and do not worry about your wife and children.” While Phan was living out his final years, his children and their families came to visit him, but never his wife. When she died, she instructed her children not to tell Phan so as to not distract him.|$|E

Alimohammadi's <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I heard the explosion just when I closed the door." [...] Mossad officials also reportedly concluded that the attacks were [...] "too dangerous" [...] for valuable intelligence operatives in Iran. The organisation has since reportedly instructed its Iranian spy network to concentrate on finding evidence of Iranian breaches of its nuclear-restriction agreements.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{partnership}} with Fingleton {{was regarded as}} one of the great opening pairings in Australian Test cricket history. In ten Tests as an opening combination, the pair averaged 63.75 for the first wicket, higher than any other Australian duo with more than 1000 runs. Brown was known for his self-effacing nature and was well liked among teammates and opponents alike. Of his batting, Brown joked that [...] "My <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> you could always tell when I was batting by the number of people leaving the ground". During a domestic match at the Adelaide Oval in December 1938, he deflected a ball onto his stumps without dislodging a bail. He added a further 147 runs to end unbeaten on 174, eternally apologising for his luck.|$|E

Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented that despite the heat, guest actor Leonard Nimoy [...] "was doing pages and pages of dialogue, and he handled it like a pro," [...] while co-star Joshua Jackson joked that [...] " [...] <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> he practices biofeedback, so {{he knows how to}} control his body temperature". Chappelle called the episode [...] "intriguing because it's a summation of everything that came before it, so we're resolving a lot of issues and a lot of questions. But it's also a springboard into the rest of the season". Actor John Noble, who played Walter Bishop, called it [...] "probably one of our strongest and densest episodes" [...] because it [...] "changes the whole direction of the show".|$|E

500|$|The Observer (The Guardians sister paper) {{published}} {{an image of}} Tomlinson on the ground on Sunday, 5 April. That morning Tomlinson's family attended the scene of his death, where they met Paul Lewis, a Guardian reporter who had worked on The Observer story. Tomlinson's <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> this meeting was the first the family had heard of police contact with Tomlinson before his death. The family's police liaison officer later approached the newspaper {{to say he was}} [...] "extremely unhappy" [...] that Lewis had spoken to the family, and that the newspaper had to stay away from them for 48 hours. The IPCC accused the newspaper of [...] "doorstepping the family at a time of grief." [...] On the same day, the IPCC briefed other journalists that {{there was nothing in the}} story that Tomlinson might have been assaulted by police. During this period, according to Tomlinson's family, they were prevented from seeing his body; they were first allowed to see him six days after his death.|$|E
500|$|Ann Luster, the film's producer, {{helped with}} the script from the {{earliest}} stages, and claimed she and Coyle had a deep {{understanding of how to}} handle the characters from the start. The film was set in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Coyle lived and worked as a writer and actor at the time. The fictional church in the story, St. Mary Magdalen's Downtown Catholic Church, is based in part on the St. Mary Magdalene church in Omaha, Nebraska, where Coyle was raised. However, the real-life church was also very different from the fictional church in that it lacked a shelter and drew very large congregations for weekend mass, compared to the half-empty pews in the fictional church. The fictional church is also based in part on Our Lady of Guadalupe, another Catholic church in south Omaha. The Into Temptation script won the McKnight Screenwriting Fellowship from IFP Minnesota Center for Media Arts, and investors were sought through public readings. After reading the script, Patrick Coyle's <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "If you get a good Father John, you'll have a good movie." ...|$|E
500|$|As a retailer, Marcus {{believed}} {{strongly in}} making his store {{into a place}} where everything a customer needed could be found and, if necessary, brought to the customer's front door. He {{was said to have}} helped one customer discover the shoe size of Queen Elizabeth II so as to give the gift of stockings and a pair of shoes, and he ordered that the store stock such items as a set of Steuben plates with the Mexican national crest, [...] "because sooner or later somebody will be going to call on the President of Mexico and need a proper gift." [...] He personally delivered a fur coat to a St. Louis, Missouri, customer who could not make the trip to Dallas. Another story often recounted is that of a shopper who, in searching for a present for his <b>wife,</b> <b>said</b> that he was not sure what to buy, but that he would know it when he saw it. In response, Marcus inquired about the woman's clothing sizes and asked the customer to wait briefly. Taking an oversized brandy snifter from a display, Marcus gathered cashmere sweaters of various colors, arranged them in imitation of a pousse-café, topped with a white angora sweater to simulate whipped cream, and in place of a cherry, garnished the concoction with a 10-karat ruby ring, at a total cost of $25,350, which the customer gladly paid. When one customer decided his Christmas purchases were not sufficiently impressive, Marcus helped to arrange a full duplication of the store's display window, complete with mannequins and lighting, inside the man's home.|$|E

500|$|The {{moving in}} 1783 of London's executions, from Tyburn to Newgate Prison, reduced the {{likelihood}} of public interference and strengthened the authorities' hold over felons. [...] However, society's view of dissection remained unequivocal; most preferred gibbeting to the laying open of a corpse. [...] Martin Gray, sentenced to death in 1721 for returning early from transportation, was [...] "greatly frighted, least his Body should be cut, and torn, and mangled after Death, and had sent his Wife to his Uncle to obtain some money to prevent it." [...] Vincent Davis, convicted in 1725 of murdering his <b>wife,</b> <b>said</b> he would rather be [...] "hang'd in Chains" [...] than [...] "anatomiz'd", and to that effect had [...] "sent many Letters to all his former Friends and Acquaintance to form a Company, and prevent the Surgeons in their Designs upon his Body". [...] There are cases of criminals who survived the short drop, but dissecting the body removed any hope of escape from death's embrace. [...] Anatomists were popularly thought {{to be interested in}} dissection only as enactors of the law, a relationship first established by kings James IV and Henry VIII. [...] Thomas Wakley, editor of The Lancet, wrote that this lowered [...] "the character of the profession in the public mind." [...] It was also thought that the anatomists' work made the body's owner unrecognisable in the afterlife. [...] Therefore, while less hated than the resurrectionists they employed, anatomists remained at risk of attack. [...] Relatives of a man executed in 1820 killed one anatomist and shot another in the face, while in 1831, following the discovery of buried human flesh and three dissected bodies, a mob burnt down an anatomy theatre in Aberdeen. [...] The theatre's proprietor, Andrew Moir, escaped through a window, while two of his students were chased through the streets.|$|E
