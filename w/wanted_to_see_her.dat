5|$|Rose Beuret and Rodin {{returned}} to Paris in 1877, {{moving into a}} small flat on the Left Bank. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Thérèse. Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, {{was also in the}} ever-helpful Thérèse's care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years, and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son now joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. The charges of fakery surrounding The Age of Bronze continued. Rodin increasingly sought more soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.|$|E
25|$|However, Alexandra {{soon began}} a {{relationship}} with another royalty. In 1942, the Greek princess met King Peter II of Yugoslavia in an officers gala at Grosvenor House. The 19-years-old sovereign lived in exile in London since the invasion of his country by the Axis powers in April 1941. They quickly {{fell in love with}} each other and were married on 20 March 1944, despite the opposition of the Queen Mother Marija of Yugoslavia (born Princess Maria of Romania). The ceremony was very modest because of financial difficulties related to the war, but Aspasia, who always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> daughter marry with a good party, was delighted.|$|E
25|$|Following Merkel's {{election}} as CDU Leader, she enjoyed considerable popularity among the German population and polls indicated that many Germans <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> become Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's main challenger in the 2002 election. However, she was subsequently outmaneuvered politically by CSU Leader Edmund Stoiber, {{to whom she}} eventually ceded the privilege of challenging Schröder. He went on to squander a large lead in opinion polls to lose the election by a razor-thin margin. After Stoiber's defeat in 2002, {{in addition to her}} role as CDU Leader, Merkel became Leader of the Opposition in the Bundestag; Friedrich Merz, who had held the post prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel.|$|E

Al-Sharif moved to Dubai after the separation {{and was forced to}} travel back to Saudi Arabia when she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> son because her ex-husband refused to let him travel.

500|$|Tal's {{return for}} the seventh season was {{announced}} at the 2011 Comic-Con. On the choice to bring Jo back for [...] "Defending Your Life", writer and co-executive producer Adam Glass explained, [...] "Knowing the history there, knowing the emotion that Dean would feel for her, we knew it'd be great. Jo's a favorite, too, so we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> back on the show." [...] Tal was happy {{to return to the}} show, saying, [...] "I didn't care that it took me over a season to come back. Just to be back at all was a blessing." [...] Feeling that she herself had grown as a person since her appearance in the fifth season, Tal tried to mirror that in her performance. She noted, however, [...] "Obviously, [...] died. So there’s been some issues." [...] Singer called her work in the episode [...] "terrific." ...|$|E
500|$|The article {{revealed}} that early scripts {{for the movie}} were {{going to focus on}} series heroine Samus Aran and her origin. Tiger Hill wanted to explore Samus prior to her becoming the lone bounty hunter featured in the series. According to Foxhoven, the movie version of Samus Aran was [...] "to be an exceptionally talented, but also flawed character who was looking for redemption," [...] and elaborating that, [...] "We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> struggle, to be humbled, and to be forced to rise up against crazy odds. And of course we wanted to see the cool weapons in all of their glory." [...] The major problem that the writers faced was attempting to build-out Samus's back-story, Nintendo had [...] "creative" [...] and [...] "licensing" [...] walls that the writers ran into. Foxhoven stated that these questions came up: [...] "What are they doing when they are NOT fighting? What is their daily existence and relationships? What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?" [...] and further stated that [...] "Nintendo appreciated the questions, but had never thought about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers" [...] and at the end, Nintendo [...] "felt uncomfortable with our team [...] being the ones to propose those answers" [...] which basically caused the Metroid movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007. Foxhoven however foresees Metroid becoming a movie, stating {{at the end of the}} IGN interview that [...] "for Nintendo, they walked away appreciating the process and how much further they needed to explore the franchise so that it has a chance for a feature film at some point" [...] and he {{revealed that}} [...] "there are quite a few Hollywood executives in town who grew up playing Metroid, and who would be willing to take the time needed to bring Nintendo along in the process." ...|$|E

2500|$|By all accounts, Nadezhda von Meck was {{imperious}} by nature, {{presiding over}} her household despotically. She {{expected to have}} her own way, so surrounded herself only with people who would give it to her, and she ruled her children's lives in every detail. [...] As they grew into adulthood, she arranged their marriages, bought houses for them, and even chose furniture for their houses. When she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> married children, she summoned rather than invited them. [...] Understandably, her children were not always grateful for the extreme degree of their mother's care (or meddling, depending on the viewpoint of the person concerned).|$|E
2500|$|Within {{months of}} its debut, the record found a {{following}} among many of popular music's inner circle. Extensive touring in the US and Canada and rave reviews and industry/musician buzz led to opening slots on tours with Suzanne Vega, Glen Phillips, Rufus Wainwright, Aimee Mann, and John Mayer. John Mayer later described the album in his Esquire magazine article: [...] "it {{may be one}} of the best albums to come around in the last five years...Music like this is jet fuel on the fire of a broken heart. Even if you think the flame has died, there's at least one lyric that'll hit that last hot spot, and then you'll find yourself as fucked as you were the day you lied and said you never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> again.

2500|$|In January 1995, Jesperson {{agreed to}} give a young woman, Angela Surbrize, a lift from Spokane, Washington, to Indiana. Approximately a week into the trip, Surbrize became {{impatient}} and began to nag Jesperson to hurry up, as she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> boyfriend. In response, Jesperson raped and strangled her. He then strapped her to the undercarriage of his truck and dragged her, face down, [...] "to grind off her face and prints." [...] Her body was not found for several monthsand then only after Jesperson gave details to police. Two months after murdering Surbrize, Jesperson decided that his long-time girlfriend, Julie Ann Winningham, was interested in him only for money. On 10 March 1995, in Washougal, Washington, Jesperson strangled her. She was the only victim he had a link to, which ultimately set police on his trail.|$|E
2500|$|A {{hypothesis}} {{of the play}} dating from the 2nd or 3rd century CE was translated by P.J. Parsons in 1974. [...] According to this hypothesis, Tereus, the king of Thrace, was married to Procne, daughter of the Athenian ruler. [...] Tereus and Procne had a son Itys. [...] Procne <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> sister Philomela and asked Tereus to escort her sister to Thrace. [...] During the journey, Tereus {{fell in love with}} Philomela and raped her. [...] In order to prevent her from telling Procne what he had done, he cut out Philomela's tongue. [...] But Philomela wove a tapestry showing what had happened and sent it to Procne. [...] Procne became jealous and, in revenge, killed Itys and served him as a meal to Tereus. [...] The gods turned Procne and Philomela into a nightingale and a swallow to protect them from Tereus, while Tereus was turned into a hoopoe.|$|E
2500|$|Suakin in the Sudan was besieged but {{remained}} in Anglo-Egyptian hands. Augusto Michieli acquired a large hotel there. He therefore {{decided to sell}} his entire property in Italy and to move his family to the Sudan permanently. Selling his house and lands took much longer than expected. By the end of 1888, Turina <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> husband in the Sudan even though land transactions were not finished. Since the villa in Zianigo was already sold, Bakhita and Mimmina needed a temporary place to stay while Turina went to the Sudan without them. At the advice of their business agent Illuminato Cecchini, on 29 November 1888, Signora Turina Michieli left them {{in the custody of}} the Canossian Sisters in Venice. When she returned to take them both to Suakin, though, Bakhita firmly refused to leave. For a full three days Mrs. Michieli tried to force the issue. So, the superior of the institute for baptismal candidates (Catechumenate) that Bakhita attended complained to the Italian authorities. On 29 November 1889 an Italian court ruled that, because the British had induced Sudan to outlaw slavery before Bakhita's birth and because Italian law did not recognize slavery, Bakhita had never legally been a slave. For {{the first time in her}} life Bakhita found herself in control of her own destiny. She chose to remain with the Canossians. On January 9, 1890 Bakhita was baptised with the names of Josephine Margaret and Fortunata (which is the Latin translation for [...] the Arabic Bakhita). On the same day she was also confirmed and received Holy Communion from Archbishop Giuseppe Sarto, the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice, the future Pope Pius X, himself.|$|E
