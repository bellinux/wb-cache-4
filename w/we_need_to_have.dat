2500|$|By contrast, many {{recent studies}} of the Greek word pistis have {{concluded}} that its primary and most common meaning was faithfulness, meaning firm commitment in an interpersonal relationship. As such, the word could be almost synonymous with [...] "obedience" [...] when {{the people in the}} relationship held different status levels (e.g. a slave being faithful to his master). Far from being equivalent to [...] "lack of human effort", the word seems to imply and require human effort. The interpretation of Paul's writings that we need [...] "faithfully" [...] to obey God's commands is quite different from one which sees him saying that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> [...] "faith" [...] that he will do everything for us. This is also argued to explain why James was adamant that [...] "faith without works is dead" [...] and that [...] "a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone" [...] (Js. 2:24), while also saying that merely to [...] believe places one on the same level as the demons (see James 2). The [...] "new" [...] perspective argues that James was concerned with those who were trying to reduce faith to an intellectual subscription without any intent to follow God or Jesus, and that Paul always intended [...] "faith" [...] to mean a full submission to God.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a secure source of food.
