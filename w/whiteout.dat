5|$|When Stewie and Brian crash the {{helicopter}} {{down the mountain}} and Brian visualizes Stewie as the devil, this is a reference to such a scene in Planes, Trains and Automobiles. The crash itself {{is caused by a}} sector <b>whiteout.</b>|$|E
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to {{closures}} {{at various points}} as it lies on the lee shore of Lake Huron. Lake effect snow squalls frequently subject motorists to poor visibility and slippery conditions, leading to <b>whiteout</b> conditions. Because of this, the Ontario Provincial Police claim that the road is the most often closed in the province.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to winter {{closures}} due to lake effect caused by snowsquall, which can create sudden <b>whiteout</b> conditions along the Lake Huron shoreline. Several Emergency Detour Routes {{have been established}} further inland to guide drivers around such closures. Care should be taken during the winter months, as these storms can progress rapidly and unexpectedly.|$|E
50|$|OverlayFS {{supports}} <b>whiteouts</b> and opaque directories in {{the upper}} filesystem to allow file and directory deletion.|$|R
50|$|Sun Microsystems {{introduced}} the first {{implementation of a}} stacked, layered file system with copy-on-write, <b>whiteouts</b> (hiding files in lower layers from higher layers), etc. as the Translucent File Service in SunOS 3, circa 1986.|$|R
5000|$|Blackouts and <b>Whiteouts,</b> {{in broken}} lines, circle-like shapes, {{or over the}} whole picture. They are caused by the {{electronics}} box. There {{has never been a}} firmware update, since it was judged as too sensitive changing the flight-software.|$|R
5|$|The game engine—proprietary IW engine 2.0—is a {{modified}} version of id Tech 3, which was used in the first Call of Duty game. With the new game engine, Infinity Ward expanded the scope of combat to deliver a realistic battlefield experience and improved the visuals. The developers were able to cloud visibility with smoke from smoke grenades and create weather effects like dusty sandstorms and <b>whiteout</b> blizzard.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Toriyama {{detailed}} the equipment he used for Dragon Ball. He used a G-pen nib by Zebra, usually getting three chapters {{out of one}} because he typically does not press down hard. Toriyama used black drawing ink made by Pilot, but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten-year-old fine point Tenshōdō brush. His <b>whiteout</b> was also made by Luma. He received free Kent paper, similar to Bristol board, from a seller connected to Shueisha, and used a 0.5mm 2B lead mechanical pencil and a wide ruler at least 30cm long.|$|E
5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have amber light bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue flashing lights associated with emergency service vehicles, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in <b>whiteout</b> conditions.|$|E
50|$|Situated just North of Crystal Beach and Bay Beach {{which are}} {{considered}} the best beaches {{in the area and}} draw many weekend visitors from the Toronto and Buffalo areas. While summers are enjoyable, winters can occasionally be fierce, with many snowstorms, <b>whiteouts</b> and winds whipping off Lake Erie.|$|R
500|$|Erie is 6th on The Daily Beast's list of snowiest {{places in}} the United States, {{averaging}} however, the 1981–2010 normal seasonal snowfall is [...] The adverse winter conditions caused USAir Flight 499 to overrun the runway at Erie International Airport in 1986, and caused <b>whiteouts</b> that were responsible for a 50-car pile-up on Interstate 90.|$|R
5000|$|... "Van Song" [...] {{was also}} {{available}} as a limited 7-inch vinyl single backed with a cover version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Rocks Off". This single was never released commercially but given away as a promotional item. The first 100 concert attendees at each venue on <b>Whiteout's</b> tour in autumn of 1994 received the single for free.|$|R
5|$|Since being cast as Selene in the Underworld film series (2003-present), Beckinsale {{has become}} known {{primarily}} for her work in action films, including Van Helsing (2004), <b>Whiteout</b> (2009), Contraband (2012), and Total Recall (2012). She also continues to make appearances in smaller dramatic projects such as Snow Angels (2007), Nothing but the Truth (2008), and Everybody's Fine (2009). In 2016, she appeared in the critically acclaimed Love & Friendship, for which her performance received worldwide praise.|$|E
5|$|Over 1,000 flight {{cancellations}} {{were reported}} at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, and numerous flight cancellations also occurred at Toronto's Pearson International Airport. In Milwaukee, <b>whiteout</b> conditions and 13inches (33cm) of snow briefly {{shut down the}} General Mitchell International Airport. Near Madison, Wisconsin, about 1,000 vehicles were stranded on Interstate 90 due to the snow. Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle {{declared a state of}} emergency for the area and activated the Wisconsin National Guard. On February 6, numerous schools, colleges, government buildings, churches, businesses, and shopping malls were forced to close throughout southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois due to the inclement weather. The winter storm was responsible for at least four deaths: one each in Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Quebec.|$|E
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce <b>whiteout</b> conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
50|$|Gameplay {{followed}} closely {{on the heels}} of Gunship 2000, but added unique aspects for the two new theaters {{as well as a number}} of additional functions and new player aids, including: in-flight mission changes, air and artillery support, wind and weather (including <b>whiteouts</b> and magnetic disturbances in Antarctica), maintenance and weapon system downtimes, improved autopilot, targeting, navigation, and the addition of a HUD mission clock.|$|R
25|$|Jesper is from Frederiksberg like Laust Sonne. Jesper {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the band, back in 1982. Jesper also plays drums for the band The <b>Whiteouts</b> and has also written a song for the Danish movie Bleeder. Jesper has kept his hair long since he started school, and he says he will never cut it, which is also the theme of the song I Won’t Cut My Hair.|$|R
50|$|<b>Whiteouts</b> make it {{difficult}} to retrace a route while rain may prevent taking the easiest line only determined as such under dry conditions. In a storm the mountaineer who uses a compass for guidance has a great advantage over a merely empirical observer. In large snow-fields it is, of course, easier to go wrong than on rocks, but intelligence and experience are the best guides in safely navigating objective hazards.|$|R

50|$|TriDAR {{applications}} {{are not limited}} to space. TriDAR technology is the basis of Neptec's OPAL product. OPAL provides vision to helicopter crews when their vision has been obscured by brownouts or <b>whiteouts.</b> TriDAR technology can also be applied to numerous terrestrial applications such as automated vehicles, hazard detection, radiotherapy patient positioning, assembly of large structure as well as human body tracking for motion capture or video game controls.|$|R
5000|$|The {{local variety}} of the Antarctic Peninsula weather is {{particularly}} changeable, windy, humid and sunless. Says Australian mountaineer Damien Gildea: ‘Livingston got just about the worst weather in the world’. A US seasonal field camp on Byers Peninsula was wrecked by storm and emergency evacuated in February 2009. <b>Whiteouts</b> are common, and blizzards can occur {{at any time of}} the year. Temperatures are rather constant, rarely exceeding [...] in summer or falling below [...] in winter, with wind chill temperatures up to [...] lower.|$|R
2500|$|The season premiered on May 31, 2009. The Dalton Highway (Alaska Route 11) {{serves as}} only road link between Alaska's {{populated}} areas down {{south and the}} oil rigs of the arctic north, to bring supplies nearly [...] from Fairbanks to the Prudhoe Bay Oil Fields and offshore rigs. However, the combination of avalanches, strong Arctic winds leading to <b>whiteouts,</b> and unforgiving terrain has led to hundreds of accidents in past years. Two thousand loads must be moved up the road within 12 weeks, before the ice melts on the Arctic Ocean.|$|R
25|$|After the {{election}} Noboa claimed that fraud had been committed. He accused Supreme Electoral Tribunal President Patricio Vivanco of refusing {{to conduct a}} recount as was his request. He said that some precinct acts had been corrected using <b>whiteout</b> and others showed no blank votes.|$|E
25|$|On February10, 2008, <b>whiteout</b> {{conditions}} {{caused a}} 36-car pileup near the Scottsville Road exit, {{which led to}} a 17-year-old girl's death. Firefighters had to climb over cars and cut off roofs to get to people. More than 20 people were taken to the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Collins told McMurdo Station that {{he would}} be {{dropping}} to , at which point he switched control of the aircraft to the automated computer system. Outside there was a layer of clouds that blended with the white of the snow-covered volcano, forming a sector <b>whiteout</b> – there was no contrast between the two to warn the pilots. The effect deceived everyone on the flight deck, making them believe that the white mountainside was the Ross Ice Shelf, a huge expanse of floating ice derived from the great ice sheets of Antarctica, which was in fact now behind the mountain. As it was little understood, even by experienced polar pilots, Air New Zealand had provided no training for the flight crew on the sector <b>whiteout</b> phenomenon. Consequently, the crew thought they were flying along McMurdo Sound, when they were flying over Lewis Bay in front of Mt.Erebus.|$|E
50|$|Both {{types of}} snowsqualls are very {{dangerous}} for motorists and airplanes or generally any traveler unfortunate {{enough to get}} stuck in one. The change in conditions is very sudden, and slippery conditions and abrupt loss of visibility due to <b>whiteouts</b> often cause multiple-vehicle collisions. In the case of lake effect snow, heavy amounts of snow can accumulate in short periods of time, possibly causing road closures and paralyzing cities. For instance, on January 9, 2015, a localized, heavy snow squall caused a 193-vehicle pile-up on I-94 highway near Galesburg, Michigan.|$|R
50|$|The season premiered on May 31, 2009. The Dalton Highway (Alaska Route 11) {{serves as}} only road link between Alaska's {{populated}} areas down {{south and the}} oil rigs of the arctic north, to bring supplies nearly 500 mi from Fairbanks to the Prudhoe Bay Oil Fields and offshore rigs. However, the combination of avalanches, strong Arctic winds leading to <b>whiteouts,</b> and unforgiving terrain has led to hundreds of accidents in past years. Six thousand loads must be moved up the road within 12 weeks, before the ice melts on the Arctic Ocean.|$|R
2500|$|Records of [...] of snow or {{more have}} been set in many {{communities}} in this area. The Keweenaw Peninsula averages more snowfall than any other location east of the Mississippi River. Because of the howling storms across Lake Superior, which cause dramatic amounts of precipitation, {{it has been said}} that the lake-effect snow makes the Keweenaw Peninsula the snowiest place east of the Rockies. Herman averages [...] of snow every year. Lake-effect snow can cause blinding <b>whiteouts</b> in just minutes, and some storms can last for days. Hancock is found frequently on lists of the snowiest cities in America.|$|R
25|$|Qantas {{operates}} flightseeing charters to Antarctica {{on behalf}} of Croydon Travel. It first flew Antarctic flightseeing trips in 1977. They were suspended {{for a number of}} years due to the crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 on Mount Erebus in 1979. Qantas restarted the flights in 1994. Although these flights do not touch down, they require specific polar operations and crew training due to factors like sector <b>whiteout,</b> which contributed to the 1979 Air New Zealand disaster.|$|E
25|$|Eighteen days later, when a {{blizzard}} hits, the group uses the <b>whiteout</b> {{to go to}} the general store for supplies, but are stranded after it ends. While the group heads for the station, Eben creates a diversion by having the vampires chase him to his grandmother's house, where he uses one of her ultraviolet lights to burn the face of Marlow's lover, Iris (Megan Franich), so badly that Marlow is forced to kill her. As he escapes, the town snow plow operator, Beau (Mark Boone Junior), creates another distraction with his tractor, killing many of the vampires, before trying to blow himself up; when he fails, Marlow crushes his head. Eben arrives at the station, where he is then forced to kill Carter (Nathaniel Lees), who has been bitten and is turning into a vampire.|$|E

5000|$|Highway 401 between London, Ontario and Windsor, Ontario {{was known}} as [...] "Carnage Alley" [...] due {{to a number of}} design factors: gravel {{shoulders}} that contributed to median-crossing collisions when a driver lost control of a vehicle, long, straight sections that promoted fatigue (often resulting in the driver drifting onto the gravel shoulder), and the potential of weather causing sudden severe driving conditions including <b>whiteouts</b> from sudden heavy snowfall and fog. Significant upgrades, including replacement of gravel with paved shoulders, improved signage, installation of tall-wall median barriers, and the widening of the 401 from four to six lanes between Windsor and Tilbury have been undertaken by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) since a fatal pileup on Sept. 3, 1999.|$|R
50|$|Because Southwestern Ontario is {{surrounded}} by water on three sides, many parts of Southwestern and Central Ontario get {{a large part of}} their winter snow from lake-effect snow. This region is notorious for the <b>whiteouts</b> which can suddenly reduce highway visibility on the world's busiest highway (Ontario Highway 401) from clear to zero. The region most commonly affected spans from Port Stanley in the west, Brantford and the Bruce Peninsula in the north, Niagara-on-the-Lake to the east, and Fort Erie to the south. The heaviest accumulations usually happen in the Bruce Peninsula, which is between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. So long as the Great Lakes are not frozen over, the only time the Bruce Peninsula does not get lake-effect snow is when the wind is directly from the south.|$|R
