40|$|LEDs are a {{promising}} alternative to existing illuminants {{for a wide}} range of lighting applications. Besides efficiency and high durability, the small light source dimensions compared to conventional light sources open up new possibilities in optical design. In many lighting setups, it is desired to realize a prescribed intensity distribution, for example homogeneous irradiance on a given area on a wall or floor. This can be realized using LEDs in combination with specially designed freeform lenses and/or mirrors. For high efficiency, it is necessary to collect at least 70 - 80 degrees half-angle (measured against the z axis) of the light that the LED emits into a 90 degree half-angle. This results in a lens that resembles a hemisphere. The numerical design problem thus requires a mathematical description that can handle such strongly curved surfaces with strongly varying surface slopes. Surface parametrizations with a rectangular topography, like e. g. Cartesian tensor p roduct B-splines, have severe drawbacks when handling such surfaces. We report on the use of an alternative surface approximation scheme that uses a triangular mesh. We describe an algorithm that optimizes the two surfaces of a lens for a <b>wall</b> <b>washer</b> that generates homogeneous irradiance on a wall area of 2. 8 × 2. 8 m 2 while mounted to the ceiling. The homogeneity is better than 80 % and the optical efficiency including Fresnel losses is about 85 %...|$|E
5000|$|By catalog T61, {{issued in}} 1954, the arc spots were {{represented}} by a single model, while the Klieglight line offered models ranging from 250 watt to 3000 watt spots. The company was also offering their [...] "Dynabeam" [...] lensed follow spot, and fresnels from 100 to 2000 watts. In that era of patch panels and small numbers of high wattage dimmers, Kliegl Brothersoffered its [...] "Safpatch" [...] patch panels, and [...] "Rotolector" [...] rotary power switches, both developed by Herbert Kliegl. Both products interlocked the electrical contacts with a circuit breaker, preventing arcs while switching or patching.From {{the beginning of the}} firm's operations, custom products were readily available. Indeed, the craft shop system used throughout its history made little differentiation between custom and standard products. High-end lighting designers regularly sought out Kliegl Brothers, who could design and produce the hardware that would fulfill their visions. Often, the custom product made its mark on the industry, such as the <b>wall</b> <b>washers</b> designed for the UN General Assembly room, or the fluorescent <b>wall</b> <b>washers</b> for New York's Pan American (now Met Life) building lobby, both designed by Herbert Kliegl. A custom oddity was the scoreboard designed for Madison Square Garden, across 50th Street from the factory. This remained in use until the relocation of the Garden to its current home atop Penn Station.|$|R

40|$|Throughout history metal tie-rods and {{anchor plates}} have been {{installed}} {{to deal with}} structural problems, reinforce the masonry structure, and absorb the outward pressure. In the 13 th– 16 th centuries, arches, vaults and domes were made by inserting metal or wooden reinforcement elements during the construction or the restoration phase. Many writers recommended their use in various guises to raise walls and construct vaults. The effectiveness of these elements was questioned by some authors because they felt that the tie-rods lose their effectiveness over time. Despite the discussion surrounding the efficacy and aesthetics of tie-rods, since the 15 th century, coinciding with an improvement {{in the quality of}} iron, they have been used as common engineering practice. The tie-rods were then blocked with anchor plates or <b>wall</b> <b>washers.</b> In some cases the anchor plate was also {{in the shape of a}} slab. The anchor bar or slab put the tie-rod in traction and distributed the force exerted on the masonry over a greater area. In many countries, especially during the 18 th and 19 th centuries, the preference was to confer a particular aesthetic value on anchor plates with ornamentation, using the most suitable design for their neat entry on the façade. The tie-rods were studied with a more correct, scientific method. More recently, this has become a favoured method for seismic safety improvements with the activation and development of local mechanisms, and they represent one of the most commonly used devices in restoration. The technical solutions are varied, in fact, from more traditional metal tie-rods with simple bar anchors to solutions that look for special aesthetic effects in the realization of the head plate. In a review of the solutions analyzed, the case history is particularly extensive, and it induces a reflection on their indiscriminate use in restoration, studying the most effective and most aesthetically pleasant systems...|$|R
40|$|To {{predict how}} the not yet built {{environment}} {{is going to}} appear regarding light and colour is a crucial problem for architects and designers. 3 D-visualization is an established design tool and used for representations of project proposals. In many cases, the aim with the visualizations is to make good-looking images sell the design. In order for software, such as 3 Dsmax to become a usable planning tool of light and colour in buildings, the visualization must be trusted to show the correct appearance {{in accordance with the}} physical preconditions of reality. The complex interaction between light and objects makes the problem of lighting scenes central within computer graphics. In a previous study (2006, 2005, 2004), various problems related to the rendering of light and colour in interactive models made in 3 Dsmax. Since then, the technology within colour rendering and computer graphics has moved forward. This paper discusses the problems of translating reality to its digital counterpart. New tests were performed in 3 Dsmax in order to explore the usability of various rendering techniques and to explore the trustworthiness of colour and light representations. We deal with methodological issues concerning how to compare visual results between different media, mixed adaptation and arbitrary parameter setting in the software. In the earlier studies carried out 10 years ago, a 25 m 2 real room was compared to different Virtual Reality (VR) simulations. In order to get a simulation as correct as possible of the 6 fluorescent luminaires (2 ceiling armatures and 4 <b>wall</b> <b>washers)</b> the manufacturer Fagerhult’s own IES-files were used. At that time, this photometric light could only be rendered with the default Scanline renderer in 3 Dsmax, which resulted in significant differences between the real and the virtual rooms. The VR-models had incorrect reflection effects between surfaces, too few colour variations and too achromatic shadows. Also they had incorrectly reproduced contrast effects for the lightest surfaces. The surface that was perceived as the whitest in the room appeared too grey. In our new study, the original models in 3 Dsmax Design 2014 were rendered with the Scanline renderer, Mental Ray and V-ray. The light planning software Dialux was used for comparison regarding the light level and distribution. Preliminary results show improvement regarding interreflections and colour variations. However, there are still incorrectly reproduced contrast effects and the whitest areas appear too grey. The light level also differed compared to the situation in Dialux, even if the same light fixtures and IES-files where applied. Furthermore, we will discuss issues concerning the choice of correct parameters to represent the physical prerequisites of reality, such as the problem of deciding how many times a light should bounce. One dilemma is that the architects and designers have knowledge of colour and light in reality, however do not usually know how to use all features in the software. The professional visualizers know how to manipulate 3 D-models to look good, but often do not regard physical correctness...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in generating high energy (> 50 MeV) protons from intense laser-matter interactions {{has opened up}} new areas of research, with applications in radiography, high energy density physics, and ion-proton beam fast ignition (FI). The ability to focus the proton beam has made these applications more attractive. Fast ignition (FI) is an evolved concept of conventional inertial confinement fusion (ICF). In proton FI, a collimated beam of protons is used to deliver the necessary ignition energy to the compressed Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel capsule instead of the original concept of a beam composed of relativistic electrons. In cone-guided FI, a cone is embedded {{into the side of}} the fuel capsule where the proton source foil is placed within the cone. The cone provides a clear path to the dense core and protects the proton source foil from radiation during the compression of the capsule. The proton source foil is a segment of a hemispherical shell target used to help focus the proton beam to the core to spark ignition. The viability of proton FI requires focusing of the generated proton beam to a 40 [mu]m spot at the compressed fuel and a laser to proton conversion efficiency of ̃ 15 %. Here, proton focusing and the laser to proton conversion efficiency are investigated using flat foils and hemispherical shell targets. Experiments were conducted on the 200 TW short pulse laser at Los Alamos Laboratory. The 1053 nm laser pulse delivered 70 - 80 J on target in 500 - 600 fs focused by an f/ 8 parabolic mirror. The generated proton beam from the target was examined by placing a mesh downstream of the target, which the proton beam would pass though and then imaged with a pack of radiochromic film (RCF). A 3 D ray-tracing technique was developed to determine the focal position and focal spot size of the generated proton beam by tracing the proton trajectories from the image of the mesh collected by the RCF back through the mesh to the central axis. The focal position calculated from the ray- tracing technique for the flat foils resulted in a real focus, contrasting the convention wisdom of a virtual focus. Investigation of the proton expansion from flat foils established that initially the protons are accelerated normal to the surface, due to the fact that the electrostatic sheath field generated by the escaping hot electrons is only a few microns beyond the rear surface of the foil. As time progresses and more electrons are accelerated into the target by the laser irradiation, the sheath expands away from the rear surface of the foil, developing a bell-shaped curvature. The protons are then accelerated normal to the sheath field, which is at the leading edge of the expansion. Due to the bell-shaped curvature, protons that are accelerated further away from the central axis of the laser interaction experience gradients within the expansion causing the protons to gain radial velocity, which changes the angle of divergence of the protons. The radial velocity gained by the protons affects the trajectory of the protons, resulting in a calculated real focal position when trajectories are calculated the ray-tracing technique. The trajectories of the protons are further affected by the mounting technique. When the foils are mounted to washers for stability, electrons accelerated in the foil escaped into the washer creating a field along the interior <b>wall</b> of <b>washer.</b> The field affects the proton trajectories near the wall and decreases the laser to proton conversion efficiency. With the understanding gained from the flat foil targets, proton focusing is further investigated using freestanding hemispherical shell targets. Using the 3 D ray-tracing technique, the calculated focal position is determined to be located inside the radius of curvature of the hemisphere, which is less than the distance of 1. 7 R (where R is the radius of curvature of the hemisphere, which is less than the distance of 1. 7 R (where R is the radius of curvature of the hemispherical shell) determined from proton heating experiments. With the aid of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, using the code LSP (large-scale-plasma), it was determined that proton trajectories are not straight, but actually bend near the focal region. A hot electron pressure gradient in the expansion beam sets up a radial electric field, Er ? kTehot/R, where here R is the radial scale length of the beam and kTehot is the hot electron temperature. When the radial electric field surpasses the radial acceleration force, the proton trajectories are bent away from the focal axis. The first demonstration of the generation and focusing of a proton beam from a hemispherical shell in a FI geometry is presented, where the beam is generated from a curved focusing surface, which propagates and is channeled via surface fields through an enclosed cone structure. A segment of a hemispherical shell is placed within a novel cone-shaped target. The proton focusing and conversion efficiency are calculated for the structured targets and are compared to the freestanding hemispherical shells. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are presented for further understanding. It is clearly shown that the focusing is strongly affected by the electric fields in the beam in both open and enclosed (cone) geometries, bending the trajectories near the axis. It is also reported that in the cone geometry, a sheath electric field effectively channels the proton beam through the cone tip, substantially improving the focusing properties. The sheath electric field on the wall of the cone is generated by electrons that escape the hemispherical shell and travel into the surrounding structure. Focusing of the proton beam is improved by the sheath electric field on the wall of the cone; however, the laser to proton conversion efficiency is decreased due to the hot electrons escaping the shell reducing the amount of energy available to accelerate the proton...|$|R
