5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
5|$|Trần Văn Đôn claimed communists had {{infiltrated}} {{the monks}} at Xá Lợi {{and warned that}} ARVN morale was deteriorating because of the civil unrest and consequent disruption of the war effort. He claimed {{it was possible that}} the Buddhists could assemble a crowd to march on Gia Long Palace. Hearing this, Diệm agreed to declare martial law effective on the next day, without consulting his cabinet, and troops were ordered into Saigon to occupy strategic points. Don was appointed as the acting Chief of the Armed Forces in place of General Lê Văn Tỵ, who was terminally ill with cancer and receiving medical treatment abroad. Đôn claimed Diệm was concerned for the welfare of the monks, allegedly telling the generals that he did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them hurt. The martial law orders were then signed and authorized by Đôn.|$|E
25|$|Royalties for {{nystatin}} totaled $13.4 million.

25|$|While no {{witnesses}} have claimed he shot {{any of the}} victims, several have testified that he ran around the gymnasium shouting curses and threatening to shoot various hostages with his assault rifle; Kulayev testifies {{that he was only}} given the firearm to carry because his leaders did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> their weapons left lying around where hostages could seize them.|$|E

Instead Jesse gave $1000 to each of Ulysses' children for their education, with the remainder of his estate going to his other sons and daughters.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of August 18, ten senior generals of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam met to discuss the {{situation}} and decided that martial law {{would need to be}} imposed. On August 20, Nhu summoned seven of the generals to Gia Long Palace for consultation. They presented their request to impose martial law and discussed dispersion of the monks. Nhu sent the generals to see Diệm. The president listened to the group of seven, led by General Trần Văn Đôn. Đôn claimed that Communists had infiltrated the monks at Xá Lợi Pagoda and warned that ARVN morale was deteriorating because of the civil unrest. He claimed that it was possible that the Buddhists could assemble a crowd to march on Gia Long Palace. Hearing this, Diệm agreed to declare martial law effective on the next day, without consulting his cabinet. Troops were ordered into Saigon to occupy strategic points. Đôn was appointed as the acting Chief of the Armed Forces in the place of General Lê Văn Tỵ, who was abroad having medical treatment. Don noted that Diệm was apparently concerned with the welfare of the monks, telling the generals that he did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them hurt. The martial law orders were authorized with the signature of Đôn, who had no idea that military action was to occur {{in the early hours of}} August 21 without his knowledge.|$|E

[...] The est trainer {{explains}} that the course techniques are used because [...] "Werner {{has found that the}}y work."

500|$|For the {{recording}} session, Dylan invited Mike Bloomfield from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band to play lead guitar. Invited to Dylan's Woodstock {{home for the}} weekend to learn new material, Bloomfield recalled, [...] "The first thing I heard was 'Like a Rolling Stone'. I figured he wanted blues, string bending, because that's what I do. He said, 'Hey, man, I don't <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> that B.B. King stuff'. So, OK, I really fell apart. What the heck does he want? We messed around with the song. I played {{the way that he}} dug, and he said it was groovy." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift did {{not want}} any misconceptions of Beautiful Eyes as her second album and {{therefore}} partnered with the American retail company Wal-Mart to make the EP an exclusive release. The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. The last thing I <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> you to think is that we are putting out too many releases." ...|$|E

500|$|Because Boom Box {{was not one}} of No Doubt's {{official}} studio albums, {{it lacked}} much attention from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album four stars out of five, although criticizing the mix of songs, saying that only [...] "hardcore No Doubt fans ... would <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> this material." [...] He called the set's appearance of being [...] "a generous gift to [...] fans" [...] "deceiving" [...] and the album not as [...] "carefully assembled" [...] as the standalone The Singles 1992–2003. He said that the packaging [...] "feels as if it was done on the cheap" [...] and criticized the lack of special features on the DVDs. However, he praised The Singles 1992–2003 and Everything in Time, calling them [...] "very good" [...] and that they displayed what a [...] "dynamic singles band No Doubt was", summarizing the album as [...] "something worthwhile for the fans".|$|E

[...] The singer did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the tracks, and so all the material was passed onto Timberlake for his debut album, Justified.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Bollywood Hungama, Chopra was quoted saying [...] "when people play multiple characters, they have structures, they are {{from different parts of}} the world, sometimes they are a twenty-year-old and then become a forty-year-old in the same film, some with eyes small, etc. I have no clutches [...] All the girls I play in the film are in the age group of eighteen and twenty-four." [...] Additionally, she found playing the Capricorn girl, a teenager, very tough, saying: [...] "To play a 15-year-old girl without make-up or special effects to make me look younger was the most challenging role for me. I had to look fifteen years old just through my body language. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the twelve girls to be caricatures." [...] Chopra also read Linda Goodman's Sun Signs and Love Signs to prepare for the parts. Initially, it was planned to film one character at a time, however, that did not happen.|$|E

They shot the song's music video, directed by band member Wayne Coyne and filmmaker Bradley Beesley, in Austin, Texas. Coyne said, [...] "Stephen [...] {{seems to be}} a fan of the weirder music of the late '80s and early '90s He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then." [...] Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people. I like you guys, and Wilco and Ween." [...] American band Wilco wrote and recorded [...] "Just a Kid". One of the film's producers contacted frontman Jeff Tweedy after seeing a SpongeBob air freshener hanging from Tweedy's rearview mirror in [...] Tweedy said, [...] "I fell in love with SpongeBob when I heard him describe the darkness {{at the bottom of the}} sea as 'advanced darkness' How could I not write a song for this film?

2500|$|The Band won ESPN's Battle of the Marching Bands in 1996, {{beating the}} Stanford Band, another {{scramble}} band, {{in the final}} round. [...] The other competitors in this online poll were: Rice, Wisconsin, Ohio State, Grambling, Michigan, Stanford, and Texas A [...] It is suspected, though unconfirmed, that the Band won partly due to very strong voting in their favor by bands previously eliminated who did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> their rival bands to win. [...] None of Princeton's rival bands were in the competition, therefore the PUB {{was something of a}} neutral choice.|$|E

Let us pass a general resolution and reorganize, {{and we will be}} up in the air. We have got a wise provision of State Autonomy.... In Washington it seems to me they have a fine lot of fish to fry. I do not admire much, either, the way they work it.

They're very close; they're very good friends; and they trust each other. So, I think the complexity of it all can go further and I think they're going to explore more." [...] Pauley Perrette, who portrays series regular Abby Sciuto, openly opposed it and said, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> our cast members to be in relationships on screen at all.
