50|$|The {{signal box}} has two {{automatic}} {{modes of operation}} which means {{that if there is}} a lack of staff the railway can still function. The signal box frame has 35 levers, all of which are fully interlocked. The interlocking works with the track circuits and point detection. Which levers are locked is decided by the signal box computer which receives points positions, Track circuit data and lever information to decide if it is possible to set a route that will not cause a train to be sent in the wrong direction or be sent on a route where another train is set to cross the track in front of it. The points are worked by 12 V Windscreen <b>wiper</b> <b>motors</b> which have been adjusted so that they stop in one of two positions. They are controlled by the signal box computer which is in turn controlled by the levers. The direction that the points are set to is detected by two microswitches located under the points.|$|R

40|$|December 2004. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 18) As {{part of a}} field operational test, 96 {{drivers were}} lent instrumented vehicles for approximately 26 days. During this time, a variety of measures regarding vehicle use were recorded, including windshield wiper use, wiper setting adjustments, and headway time margin to preceding vehicles. Windshield wiper activity was examined in detail {{in order to provide}} data regarding the naturalistic use of windshield wiper systems. The results have implications for the design and durability of windshield <b>wipers,</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>motors,</b> windshields, and glazing treatments (such as hydrophobic coatings). Overall, windshield wipers were used 8. 6 % of the time the vehicles were being operated. Across all conditions, the slowest intermittent setting was the most frequently used—whereas the fastest continuous setting was used the least. When ambient lighting diminished, a shift towards higher wiper speeds was observed. Average headway time margin and range increased, and speed decreased, when windshield wipers were engaged. Middle-aged drivers used wipers more often than either their younger or older counterparts. Finally, older females used their wipers the least amongst female drivers, while male drivers used wipers fairly uniformly across age groups...|$|R

5000|$|The Ladybird is {{a roughly}} {{hemispherical}} robot which is 40 cm wide, 25 cm tall and 60 cm long. It has a metal baseplate {{on which the}} electronics lie, which are enclosed by a red shell with black spots.

Here principal stresses at different point were obtained having different deflection. Graphs are plotted for principal stress verses deflection and Navigation performance of AGV uses electric motor. Thus AGV is used to pick up the object with proper gripping system. A navigation system has been developed using sensors. AGV contains software and hardware components and is primarily used for material handling in industries. Static analysis was done for stress using catiaV 5. Graphs are plotted for principal stress vs. deflection. The same analysis can be done for different material depending on loading condition. Stress analysis concept can be used to study dynamic analysis. Optimization of AGV can be possible by using different material.

40|$|This thesis {{guides the}} reader through {{the design of}} an {{inexpensive}} XY stage for abrasive water jet cutting machine starting {{with a set of}} functional requirements and ending with a product. Abrasive water jet cutting allows for mass customization of 2 D parts, such as inlaid tiles. Most water jet cutters are based on a prismatic-prismatic design (gantry type). In an effort {{to reduce the number of}} precision parts in the machine, a rotary-rotary parallel drive design is proposed. The proposed mechanism will be actuated by electric DC windshield <b>wiper</b> <b>motors</b> directly coupled to the links, this eliminates the need for gearing mechanisms that add up to the total cost and complexity of the design. Kinematics of the design is simulated for a working area of 310 mm x 310 mm. Dynamic analysis is performed and the concepts of decoupled and configuration invariant inertia are derived, simplified to a set of conditions on the kinematic structure/mass properties of the arm linkages and applied to significantly simplify the mechanism's control system. The XY stage was designed to be inexpensive and small enough to be placed in hardware stores, garages and small machine shops. A vision of water jet cutters sold in boxes stacked on shelves in Wal-Mart, available for all machinists, artists, schools, and industries might one day thus become a reality if the pumps could also be made cheaply. by Fadi Abu Ibrahim.

50|$|Air-conditioning {{was never}} an option on right-hand-drive Saxos because the blower motor was mounted in the bulk-head on the driver's side. As a result, there was {{insufficient}} space available to accommodate the evaporator, except by first ducting the air flow to the passenger's side {{and then at the}} expense of the glove-box. Although an after-market kit was available that did exactly this, the resultant pressure loss made the system noisy and ineffective. The blower motor could also not be easily relocated, since the windscreen <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> was mounted in the passenger's side space.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 Citroën {{launched}} a new model based on the 2CV chassis, with a four-door sedan body, and a reverse rake rear window: the Citroën Ami.

50|$|Other {{upgrades}} {{included the}} introduction of a larger 64 L fuel tank, shorter gear lever throw on the manual gearbox, relocation of the dipswitch from under the brake pedal to the high left of the firewall, and the windscreen <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> was relocated to the engine side of the firewall — greatly reducing wiper noise.

5000|$|These swords {{are often}} mistaken for radio antennas. The entire system may include {{upper and lower}} cutter assemblies, a non-electrically {{conductive}} abrasive strip wire scoring device along {{the center of the}} divided windscreen and windshield wiper protector frames to keep wires from hanging up on <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> shafts. The WSPS is designed to channel a wire or cable into the cable cutter to score and weaken it as it travels into the cutter assembly and [...] "cut" [...] a wire before it can entangle the rotor system. The U.S. Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, AL, claims that in a single wire strike 90% survivability is achieved by using WSPS. The more wires encountered at a given time the less likely WSPS will help the aircraft survive the encounter.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963, {{another form}} of {{intermittent}} wiper was invented by Robert Kearns, an engineering professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. Kearns's design was intended to mimic {{the function of the}} human eye, which blinks only once every few seconds. In 1963, Kearns built his first intermittent wiper system using off-the-shelf electronic components. In the Kearns design, the interval between wipes was determined by the rate of current flow into a capacitor. When the charge in the capacitor reached a certain voltage, the capacitor was discharged, activating the <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> for one cycle. Kearns showed his wiper to the Ford Motor Company, and proposed manufacturing the design. Ford executives rejected Kearns' proposal, but later offered a similar design as an option on the company's Mercury line, beginning with the 1969 models. Kearns sued Ford in a multi-year patent dispute that Kearns eventually won in court, inspiring the 2009 film, Flash of Genius.|$|E
50|$|Through those sales, Oishei raised enough {{capital to}} buy out Jepson in 1919 and when World War I ended, he {{expanded}} availability of the product to Europe and beyond. Although maintaining cash flow to service early loans made Trico's initial survival a dicey proposition, its success was assured following the immediate post-World War I automotive boom. Early on, most Trico sales were the easily refitted squeegee that fit in the slot of two-piece windshields. For one-piece glass, Trico offered a spring-loaded arcing wiper that was operated by hand and pivoted across the field of vision. Although Trico did not invent the <b>wiper</b> <b>motor,</b> it did {{come up with a}} reliable unit run by an engine's manifold vacuum that quickly became the industry standard, especially in the aftermarket. Cadillac was the first to make these powered wipers standard. In 1934, that refillable wiper was redesigned to fit the new curved windshields, complete with internal springs to ensure constant pressure across the glass. Two years later, Trico introduced a powered windshield washer. In 1937, its wipers were standard across the entire U.S. auto industry.|$|E
50|$|Prototypical {{working with}} full track circuiting and {{accurate}} signalling remains {{the key to}} the railway's operation. The two termini are controlled by semaphores while the whole of the main line is equipped with colour-lights, ten of these being automatic. The boxes at Hardwick Central and Everglades Junction are fitted with Westinghouse 'L' type frames with, respectively, twenty-three and thirty-one miniature levers. The former was once part of the 227-lever installation at Crewe South junction while the latter is the complete frame from South Croydon junction. The country terminus, Cockcrow Hill, has a 16-lever full-size 'knee' frame manufactured by the Railway Signal Company, probably around 1930. It came from the Waterloo terminus of the Waterloo & City line. Exactly as in full-size practice trains are offered and accepted between signal boxes by the use of Block instruments. Because of the complication of the area it controls, and there may be as many as six trains on the track diagram at once, Everglades Junction box is also equipped with a train describer to assist the signalmen, usually two on duty together, in keeping track of movements. The signalling system is all-electric, including the interlocking, semaphores being worked by solenoids sealed for outdoor use. All signals return to 'danger' when the train has passed into the next track-circuit section. Points have a mechanism powered by the very reliable Ford Escort windscreen <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> that moves the blades and then locks and detects them. No detection, no signal! The few sprung points are also detected to ensure closure after a train has passed through in the trailing direction.|$|E
50|$|The bumpers on the 1933 Series 355C were sectioned, with plain {{ends and}} a three bar center. The grille was made V-shaped and blended into the painted (chrome optional) {{radiator}} shell. The radiator cap disappeared {{under the hood}} {{on the right side}} (same side as the oil level gauge). The fender tie bar, after a year's absence was sectioned and the center section was hidden behind the grille. Six horizontal doors replaced the vertical hood doors. Skirts were added to the front and rear fenders. The most significant change in body detail was the introduction of no-draft Individually Controlled Ventilation (ICV) or pivoting vent windows in the front doors and the rear quarter or rear door windows. In early production the front door window had to be lowered to disengage the channel at its front edge from the vent window to allow the vent window to pivot. In later production the sealing channel was attached to the door frame rather than to the window glass so that the vent window could be operated independently of the window glass. Windshield and rear quarter windows were made stationary. Absence of a windshield operating mechanism on the closed car allowed room to conceal the <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> behind the headboard. The cowl ventilator was baffled and drained {{in such a way as}} to be rainproof. Chassis changes were few and minor in nature. Controlled free wheeling was discontinued. Vacuum assist was added to the brake system. Changes in shock absorber valves extended the range of the ride control system. During the model year the dual point four lobe distributor was replaced by a single point eight lobe unit. A radio was optional. Model year sales were 2,100.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, John Haven Emerson {{developed}} a mechanical assister for anesthesia {{with the cooperation}} of the anesthesia department at Harvard University. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of muscle relaxants during anesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyze the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon, but also paralyze the respiratory musclesIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples, the latter using an automotive <b>wiper</b> <b>motor</b> to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs. [...] Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anesthetics such as ether and cyclopropane. In 1952, Roger Manley of the Westminster Hospital, London, {{developed a}} ventilator which was entirely gas driven, and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power, and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, who manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.|$|E
