25|$|From 1892, Hearne was {{the stock}} bowler {{not only for}} Middlesex, {{but also for the}} MCC, which at the time played against the {{counties}} Middlesex did not arrange County Championship fixtures with. In 1893, Hearne surpassed his previous form by taking over 200 wickets in a dry summer and his persistence and skill on hard pitches (notably in the two games with Nottinghamshire) was <b>wonderful.</b> <b>In</b> 1894, a very wet summer, Hearne just failed to reach 200, yet his omission from the 1894/1895 tour of Australia remains puzzling given his persistence and pace from the ground might have been well-suited to the hard pitches then evolving in Australia.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} was Etty's largest work to that time, measuring 442.5cm by 297cm (14ft 6in by 9ft 9in). The work {{was completed in}} 1837 and exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts later that year, and hung in the Academy's new building at Trafalgar Square (now the National Gallery). The work, and Etty's methods in making it, divided opinion: The Gentleman's Magazine considered it [...] "by far the finest [...] that Mr. Etty has ever painted... it is a historical work of the first class, and abounds with beauties of all kinds", while The Spectator described it as [...] "a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome putridity—glowing in colour and <b>wonderful</b> <b>in</b> execution, but conceived in the worst possible taste".|$|E

The painting, with its juxtaposition of male and female nudity and decaying corpses, immediately divided opinion. Some critics considered it one of the finest artworks ever made, with The Gentleman's Magazine particularly taken with the work, describing Sirens as [...] "a historical work of the first class" [...] and [...] "by far the best that Mr. Etty ever painted". Other critics were less kind; The Spectator considered it [...] "a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome putridity—glowing in colour and <b>wonderful</b> <b>in</b> execution, but conceived in the worst possible taste".|$|E

Rolling Stone Peter Travers described Winstead's performance as [...] "unmissable and unforgettable", praising the comedy and intellect she simultaneously brought to the role. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that Winstead was striking as Kate and speculated that Smashed {{would prove to be}} [...] "the doorway to great things" [...] in her career. Joe Williams from St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and stated [...] "There will never be another Marilyn Monroe or Elizabeth Taylor, but Hollywood may have found a new Lee Remick in Mary Elizabeth Winstead." ...|$|E

During the investigation, Detective Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) leads her to Massive Dynamic, where the CEO Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) informs her that Peter is a conman and industrial spy.

Olivia finds a check signed by Walter Bishop, who in the story, is an inventor that has created [...] "everything that is <b>wonderful</b> <b>in</b> the world" [...] in order to benefit humanity (hugs, rainbows, bubblegum, singing corpses). Questioning Walter, Olivia learns that Peter worked with Walter, who treated him like a son. One day, Walter made a glass heart but Peter later stole it. Were the heart not to be found, Walter and his ideas would die. To help find Peter, Olivia calls her assistant, [...] "Esther Figglesworth" [...] (Farnsworth).|$|E
500|$|Srijit Mukherji's period drama Begum Jaan (2017) saw Vidya {{play the}} role of the titular procurer. A Hindi {{language}} remake of the Bengali film Rajkahini (2015), Begum Jaan tells the story of how the lives of prostitutes living in brothel are affected by the partition of India in 1947. In preparation, Vidya worked with Mukherji to provide a backstory to her character, and she researched on the era by reading Urvashi Butalia’s novel The Other Side of Silence. Filming in the barren landscape of rural Jharkhand proved to be a challenge for Vidya, and she said that the experience taught her that [...] "if push comes to shove, I can brave scorpions, snakes and whatever else". Anna M.M. Vetticad of Firstpost disliked the film, and wrote that [...] " [...] – who has been so <b>wonderful</b> <b>in</b> the past – is unable to dig deep and summon up a relatable human being, because {{there is nothing in the}} writing that she can dig into." ...|$|E

500|$|Madness {{collaborated with}} Elvis Costello in 1983 on {{a version of}} their song [...] "Tomorrow's (Just Another Day)". It was {{released}} as a bonus track to the 12" [...] copy of the single. In later years, Barson stated that Costello's [...] "Watching the Detectives" [...] was the main influence on the song [...] "My Girl". For <b>Wonderful</b> <b>in</b> 1999, Ian Dury laid down vocals on the track [...] "Drip Fed Fred" [...] which was released as the last single from the album. [...] It was to be Dury's last recording before his death. Ill health prevented Dury from actively promoting the single, although he did appear on the National Lottery Show, but for a later performance on TFI Friday, the song was reworked to incorporate Phill Jupitus on vocals. Live, Madness have collaborated with artists such as UB40 and Prince Buster, notably at their first Madstock concert. They have also played live frequently {{with members of the}} other 2 Tone bands, such as The Specials. In May 2008, Suggs and Carl performed live with Pet Shop Boys at London's Heaven collaborating on a new arrangement of [...] "My Girl". A few days afterwards, Pet Shop Boys posted their own version of the track on their official website.|$|E

2500|$|Under {{the tutelage}} of manager Masked Assassin, the team quickly began to work well {{together}} in a feud with Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio. In the following months, both Roma and Orndorff focused on their individual careers before reuniting around May. This time they wrestled without their manager and were officially known as [...] "Pretty Wonderful". With both men rededicated to teaming, they soon challenged for the WCW World Tag Team Championship then held by Cactus Jack and Kevin Sullivan. One incident especially stands out that established Pretty <b>Wonderful</b> <b>in</b> the title chase. The champions had one last defense against former champions the Nasty Boys that also saw Kevin's injured brother Dave. The match degraded into a brawl that saw Pretty Wonderful make an appearance using Dave's crutch to attack the champions. Before the team left the ring, they also {{took a couple of}} shots at the Nasty Boys for good measure.|$|E
2500|$|The ode praises {{children}} {{for being the}} [...] "best Philosopher" [...] ("lover of truth") because they live in truth and have prophetic abilities. This claim bothers Coleridge and he writes, in Biographia Literaria, that Wordsworth {{was trying to be}} a prophet in an area that he could have no claim to prophecy. In his analysis of the poem, Coleridge breaks down many aspects of Wordsworth's claims and asks, [...] "In what sense can the magnificent attributes, above quoted, be appropriated to a child, which would not make them equally suitable to a be, or a dog, or a field of corn: or even to a ship, or to the wind and waves that propel it? The omnipresent Spirit works equally in them, as in the child; and the child is equally unconscious of it as they." [...] The knowledge of nature that Wordsworth thinks is <b>wonderful</b> <b>in</b> children, Coleridge feels is absurd in Wordsworth since a poet couldn't know how to make sense of a child's ability to sense the divine any more than the child with a limited understanding could know of the world. I. A. Richards, in his work Coleridge on Imagination (1934), responds to Coleridge's claims by asking, [...] "Why should Wordsworth deny that, in a much less degree, these attributes are equally suitable to a bee, or a dog, or a field of corn?" ...|$|E

He is <b>wonderful</b> <b>in</b> action sequences and springs a pleasant surprise in the emotional moments by delivering the apposite expressions." [...] Ashish Magotra of Rediff gave negative reviews on Rampal, writing: [...] "Among the actors, Arjun Rampal as the hero does pretty much what he has been known to do. He models. His acting capabilities leave a lot to be desired." [...] His last release of the year was Ashok Mehta's Moksha. It was actually his first film, but was released after Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat. Rampal was paired with famous actress Manisha Koirala in a lead role in Moksha. This film marked Rampal's third consecutive flop at the box office, but Rampal earned critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal excels in a role that was difficult to portray. He takes giant strides as a performer and proves that he's an actor with an amazing range." [...] Priyanka Bhattacharya of Rediff considered the movie to be [...] "more a 70-mm portfolio for Arjun Rampal than a story." ...|$|E
