40|$|Sand filters {{have been}} used for a long time for the final {{treatment}} of drinking water. There is also an increasing need for sand filters as a final treatment stage in waste water treatment plants due to more stringent requirements {{on the quality of the}} treated water. Clogging of sand filters by impurities materials affects their performance, particularly for that used in the final treatment of drinking water applications. Vigorous aqua scrubbing of sand filters top layers can break such impurities up into suspended materials and discharges it outward sand filters. A proposal for washing sand filters top layers using aqua <b>jet</b> pump <b>scrubber</b> was the target of this research. The aqua <b>jet</b> pump <b>scrubber</b> is designed potentially with significant technical and economical advantages compared to other conventional washing techniques.

40|$|Usage of <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> in {{manufacturing}} processes, {{has been known}} for many decades. A wide range of engineering materials can be cut by <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> with satisfactory results. Enhanced reliability and efficiency of the technique, have yielded the technology greater interest for manufacturing applications. <b>Water</b> <b>jets</b> are used to cut soft materials such as wood, plastics, aluminium and copper. Abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> are used to cut very hard materials such as titanium, inconel, glass and ceramics. It is impossible to cut these materials with classical cutting technics. A <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> processing system utilises water pressure in the range of 100 Mpa- 400 Mpa, for the different applications. In abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> milling and abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> cutting processes, the pressure of the jet is about 400 Mpa. In <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> surface penning, the jet pressure is about 100 Mpa. The process of abrasives mixing with the water stream is a complex phenomena. Erosion processes involved in cutting not yet fully understood. The lack of understanding the process call for other strategies in finding appropriate ways to obtain a precision depth in cutting operation.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that a <b>water</b> <b>jet,</b> which after passing through an air layer plunges into a water pool, entrains into this an {{important}} amount of air and forms a submerged two-phase region of considerable interfacial area. Therefore, oxygen transfer occurs between bubble dispersion and the pool water. Reviewing existing studies on <b>water</b> <b>jets,</b> most of these works were carried out in circular nozzles. Earlier researchers indicated that the factors affecting the air entrainment characteristics of a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> were nozzle diameter, <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> velocity, jet length, and jet angle. However, it is insufficient to investigate or discuss the characteristics of a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> only by these four factors. An important factor that cannot be overlooked is the difference in nozzle shape. This paper investigates oxygen transfer efficiencies of vertical plunging <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> from different typed nozzles such as venturi and circular nozzles with and without air holes. A negative pressure occurred at the air holes of the venturi and the circular nozzles and this phenomenon affected the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> expansion, the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> shape, the bubble penetration depth and hence the oxygen transfer efficiency. It was demonstrated that the venturi nozzle with air holes had the higher oxygen transfer efficiencies than the other nozzles tested. Thus, using a simple venturi nozzle with air holes could lead to significantly increased oxygen transfer efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{characterisation}} of <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> {{to be used}} for washing out the filling of explosive ordnance. <b>Water</b> <b>jets</b> have advantages over conventional techniques in that they are non-polluting and can effectively disperse all compositions; pressed, cast, plastic and PBX. The <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> studied are produced by a gas gun consisting of a parallel barrel and a detachable tapered nozzle. Four nozzle designs were tested with exit-diameters ranging from 27 mm to 16 mm. A plastic piston regulates the volume of the water charge. For various combinations of water volume, breech pressure and nozzle diameter, high speed cine photography and flash radiography was used to characterise the <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> in terms of velocity and coherence. <b>Water</b> <b>jets</b> were achieved with jet-tip velocities between 100 and 600 m/s and breech pressures in the range of 30 - 100 MPa. The <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> have been fired at plastic explosive compositions and dispersed the explosive with little chance of initiating a reaction, even when heavily confined. The <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> is capable of penetrating moderate thicknesses of sheet metal so could be used where the explosive filling is directly accessible or thinly covered eg. fuse-well. Continuous <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> with similar characteristics could be used for demolition of unfused ordnance, eg. depot demolition, or following an EOD operation where the fuse(s) has been removed by some other technique. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{introducing}} an air film around a submerged <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> is examined in laboratory experiments. The {{objective is to}} reduce the friction forces between the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> and the ambient fluid, making a jet potentially more effective at a larger distance. The test are conducted at a physical scale comparable to dredging practise, contrary to earlier experiments reported in the literature, where small scale jets are tested. During the tests the development of the jet was measured in axial and radial direction. The jet pressure and air discharge are varied, leading to a number of combinations of jet pressures and air discharges. The results showed that also at this scale the development of the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> is influenced by the air film, although not as much as in the earlier experiments. Governing parameters have been established. Examples are the volume, mass and momentum ratios between the air flow and water flow. The ratios of the air flow and water flow are not in the same order if the comparison is made between the large and small scale <b>water</b> <b>jets.</b> Relatively less air was added in the test of a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> at the scale used in dredging practise. Adding air around a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> has a positive effect on the development of a <b>water</b> <b>jet,</b> if enough air is added. With increasing size of the nozzle diameter, more air has to be injected to create an effective air film. If enough air is added to create an effective air film, the effect is observed at very large axial distances. A description of this type of jets is given based on the description of Yahiro and Yoshida (1974) of <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> surrounded by an air film and the description of Rajaratnam (1976) of submerged <b>water</b> <b>jets.</b> The total amount of energy of the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> and air film {{can also be used to}} create a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> without an air film.
