40|$|Swine Industry Day, 2014 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 2014 The {{accuracy}} and precision of pig subsampling methods can determine the swine producer’s ability to sell pigs at optimal market BW and reduce economic discounts. The first objective of this experiment {{was to determine the}} time required to <b>weigh</b> <b>pigs</b> for different sampling methods used to estimate the mean and SD of a population. The second objective was to define the optimal sampling method considering the time required to <b>weigh</b> <b>pigs</b> as well as the precision and accuracy of each sampling method. A total of 68 pens of pigs (359 × 1050, PIC, Hendersonville, TN; 169. 8 lb BW) in 2 commercial finishing facilities with 20 to 35 pigs per pen were used. Pens of pigs were blocked by location within barn and randomly allotted to 1 of 4 treatments with 17 pens per treatment. The 4 treatments included (1) selecting and weighing the heaviest and lightest pig per pen; and (2), (3), and (4) weighing the first 5, 10, and 15 pigs out of the pen, respectively. The time required for 2 people to complete each treatment was recorded. To determine the total barn time required to conduct a specific sample, the time required to weigh the specific number of pigs per pen was multiplied by n pens. The accuracy and precision for estimating the mean BW and SD for each sampling method was determined by using datasets A and C reported in Paulk (20144). The precision was determined by calculating a 95 % confidence interval (CI) for the sample means and SD. The time taken to select and weigh the heaviest and lightest pigs in a pen (Treatment 1) did not differ from <b>weighing</b> 5 <b>pigs</b> per pen (Treatment 2). Increasing the number of <b>pigs</b> <b>weighed</b> per pen (Treatments 3 and 4) increased (P < 0. 05) the amount of time to weigh a single pen. Based on these results, the number of pens for each treatment that can be weighed without influencing weighing time was determined to be 15 pens (30 pigs), 15 pens (75 pigs), 9 pens (90 pigs), and 6 pens (90 pigs) from Treatments 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. For dataset A, these 4 sampling methods had a similar CI range for estimating the mean BW and SD. For dataset C, Treatments 1 (30 pigs) and 2 (75 pigs) had a reduced CI range for estimating the mean BW compared with Treatments 3 (90 pigs) and 4 (90 pigs); however, Treatments 2 (75 pigs) and 3 (90 pigs) had a reduced CI range for estimating the SD compared with Treatments 1 (30 pigs) and 4 (90 pigs). Therefore, we conclude that swine producers should <b>weigh</b> 5 <b>pigs</b> from 15 pens to estimate the mean BW and SD within a barn...|$|R

40|$|A feeder {{prototype}} {{has been}} developed by IFIP in association with an equipment manufacturer to perform precision feeding for 96 group‐housed growing pigs, each equipped with a RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) ear tag. It consists in five automatic feeders (AF), one weighing‐sorting station (WS), and three areas. The WS station is placed on force sensors and allows for <b>weighing</b> <b>pigs</b> individually, with a 0. 1 kg accuracy, and sorting them towards (1) the AF (pigs whose daily cumulated feed intake is presently below the daily allowance), (2) a pen for specific care or departure for the slaughterhouse (after selection by the farmer), (3) the original pen for the other cases. In case 1, the pig enters an AF, both back and front doors close automatically. Its ear RFID tag is recognized by an antenna, and successive doses of feed fall into the trough. Each AF can deliver (min 30 g) and mix two diets, and is connected to a computer that calculates the daily dietary allowances per pig, based on time, body weight (BW) and feeding strategy.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Acute {{exposure}} of healthy subjects to swine house dust causes increased bronchial responsiveness to methacholine but no acute bronchoconstriction. The role of cysteinyl leukotrienes and mast cells in increased bronchial responsiveness is unclear.  METHODS—Ten non-asthmatic subjects {{were exposed to}} swine dust for three hours while <b>weighing</b> <b>pigs</b> in a piggery. Urine was collected prior to and for up to 12 hours after entering the piggery {{and at the same}} times five days before and the day after exposure. As indices of whole body leukotriene production and mast cell activation, urinary levels of leukotriene E 4 (LTE 4) and 9 α, 11 β-PGF 2, the earliest appearing urinary metabolite of prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2), were measured. Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was determined five days before and the day after the exposure.  RESULTS—Methacholine PD 20 FEV 1 decreased from 1. 32 mg (95 % CI 0. 22 to 10. 25) before exposure to 0. 38 mg (95 % CI 0. 11 to 1. 3) after exposure (p< 0. 01). Associated with the increase in bronchial responsiveness there was a significant mean difference between post- and pre-challenge levels of LTE 4 (difference 38. 5 ng/mmol creatinine (95 % CI 17. 2 to 59. 8); p< 0. 01) and 9 α, 11 β-PGF 2 (difference 69 ng/mmol creatinine (95 % CI 3. 7 to 134. 3); p< 0. 05) on the day of exposure to swine dust. Swine dust exposure induced a 24 -fold increase in the total cell number and a 12 -fold increase in IL- 8 levels in the nasal lavage fluid. The levels of LTB 4 and LTE 4 in nasal lavage fluid following exposure also increased 5. 5 -fold and 2 -fold, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—The findings {{of this study indicate that}} cysteinyl leukotrienes and other mast cell mediators contribute to the development of increased bronchial responsiveness following inhalation of organic swine dust. ...|$|R

TokachThe optimum {{sampling}} method swine producers should use {{to estimate the}} mean and SD of pig BW within a barn was determined based upon both {{the time required to}} conduct and the precision and accuracy of each {{sampling method}}. <b>Weighing</b> 5 <b>pigs</b> from 15 pens was determined to be the optimal sampling method. This should require approximately 55 min to complete. <b>Weighing</b> 5 <b>pigs</b> from 15 pens had a CI range of 7. 2 to 8. 0 kg for estimating the mean BW and 5. 6 kg for estimating SD. Next, a meta-analysis was conducted using data from existing literature to generate equations to predict finishing pig back, belly, and jowl fat iodine value. While numerous factors were evaluated, dietary essential fatty acids, dietary net energy content, and backfat thickness had the greatest influence on predicting iodine value of the 3 distinct fat depots. Lastly, 6 experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} added Zn on growth performance, pork quality, plasma Zn, and ileal mucosal inflammation mRNA expression of finishing pigs fed diets containing ractopamine-HCl (RAC; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN). Additional Zn increased plasma Zn and reduced relative expression of IL- 1 β, but did not improve growth performance of pigs fed diets containing RAC in 5 of the experiments. However, in 1 of the experiments, adding Zn to diets containing RAC resulted in a trend for improved growth performance of pigs. Supplementing the RAC diets with dietary Zn decreased the percentage of type IIA fibers and tended to increase the percentage of type IIX fibers compared to pigs fed the RAC diet without added Zn.
