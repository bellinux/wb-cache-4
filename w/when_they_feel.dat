25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> they have not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when {{the consequences of their}} statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the most}} {{traditional}} version of cricket, with rules most closely replicating the original rules of cricket from the 16th and 17th century. It is a single innings game with a set time limit for the entire game to be completed in. To win the game, a side must both score the highest aggregate number of runs and take all ten of the opposition wickets. It {{is up to the}} side batting first to declare <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> they have enough runs to be able to win the match. In this format of cricket, if the side batting second do not lose all ten of their wickets, the match is said to have ended in a draw.|$|E

Differed from taiheki type 1, people with taiheki 2 are passive. <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> difficulty in taking action under their own responsibility and decision, while <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> ease <b>when</b> taking action according to opinions of, or under responsibility of, others. <b>When</b> tired, <b>they</b> often <b>feel</b> pain in Sternocleidomastoid muscle.|$|R
25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories {{are more likely to}} engage in counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are {{more likely to engage in}} CWB <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E
25|$|Echidnas {{are very}} timid animals. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> {{endangered}} {{they attempt to}} bury themselves or if exposed they will curl into a ball, both methods using their spines to shield them. Strong front arms allow echidnas to continue to dig themselves in whilst holding fast against a predator attempting to remove them from the hole. Although they {{have a way to}} protect themselves, the echidnas still face many dangers. Some predators include wild cats, foxes, domestic dogs and goannas. Snakes pose as a large threat to the echidna species because they slither into their burrows and prey on the young spineless puggles. Some precautions that can be taken include keeping the environment clean by picking up litter and causing less pollution, planting vegetation for echidnas to use as shelter, supervising pets, reporting hurt echidnas or just leaving them undisturbed. Merely grabbing them may cause stress, and picking them up improperly may even result in injury.|$|E
25|$|Mutable: The mutable {{signs are}} Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. A native with mainly mutable signs are adaptable, {{co-operative}} and friendly. They can fit into almost any situation, {{put up with}} anything and turn any situation to their advantage. Mutable people can steer projects through periods of transition {{and bring them to}} a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, mutable subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> threatened. These subjects may devote their lives to helping others, but they can often paradoxically be surprisingly selfish at the same time. Subjects lacking mutable signs may be unable to adapt to any kind of change and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need lots of notice before they will commit themselves to anything, and lack flexibility and adaptability. They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart will make up for the lack of intuition.|$|E

25|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{different}} causes of pica related to assessment, the clinician will try to develop a treatment. First, there is pica {{as a result of}} social attention. A strategy might be used of ignoring the person’s behavior or giving them the least possible attention. If their pica is a result of obtaining a favorite item, a strategy may be used where the person is able to receive the item or activity without eating inedible items. The individual’s communication skills should increase so that they can relate what they want to another person without engaging in this behavior. If pica is a way for a person to escape an activity or situation, the reason why the person wants to escape the activity should be examined and the person should be moved to a new situation. If pica is motivated by sensory feedback, an alternative method of feeling that sensation should be provided. Other non-medication techniques might include other ways for oral stimulation such as gum. Foods such as popcorn have also been found helpful. These things can be placed in a “Pica Box” that should be easily accessible to the individual <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> like engaging in pica.|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} people who, in the past, would have been institutionalized, are {{currently}} housed in residential neighbourhoods. The basic idea underlying this change is that psychiatric patients or people with intellectual disabilities wish to live independently among ‘normal’ people.

50|$|Another {{important}} traditional {{dance in}} Madhyapur Thimi is the Layaku Bhaila Naach {{which is also}} performed by people of Thimi {{in the month of}} August in Thimi after four days of Gaijatra. Altogether five men dance in this traditional dance with four youth and one child. The men wear masks of Bhairab and Daagi (Kumari). There are two Bhairabs and Daagis and one Jyapuga (the child artist). They dance with traditional spiritual music and after dancing they start shivering (except the child artist) because of the divine powers of gods. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> are shivering they lose their sense and know nothing about what happened. The adult dancers who are dancing, get hypnotised <b>when</b> <b>they</b> hear the sound of Daaga baja, Bhusya baja and Ponga baja (Different Newari musical instruments). According to the recent dancers, <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> like a divine power embaracing them to encourage dancing more and more. According to them <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are dancing they loose half of their consciousness, heavy clothing starts becoming lighter and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> shiver <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> like in the state of unconsciousness or like <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are asleep. This shows that the community has strong devotion toward their tradition and culture. They must not stop dancing even if it is raining. The people of Thimi also used to pierce tongue the night after Indra Jatra but it is a difficult task to pierce the tongue, it is not being continued.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{substantive}} grounded theory describing the relationship among housing, social support, and the mental health of people with schizophrenia.
