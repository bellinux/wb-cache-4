2500|$|The word [...] (synthronos) is [...] used as [...] "co-occupant of {{the divine}} throne"; however, like the above etymology, it is not found in any source materials. It is {{supported}} by Saul Lieberman and Peter Schäfer, who give further reasons why {{this might be a}} viable etymology. The Latin word Metator (messenger, guide, leader, measurer) had been suggested by Eleazar ben Judah of Worms (c. 1165 – c. 1230), Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, and brought to light again by Hugo Odeberg. When transliterated into the Hebrew language, we get מטיטור or מיטטור. Gershom Scholem argues that there is no data to justify the conversion of metator to metatron. Philip Alexander also suggests this as a possible origin of Metatron, stating that the word Metator also occurs in Greek as mitator–a word for an officer in the Roman army who acted as a forerunner. Using this etymology, Alexander suggests the name may have come about as a description of [...] "the angel of the Lord who led the Israelites through the wilderness: acting like a Roman army metator guiding the Israelites on their way". Another possible interpretation is that of Enoch as a metator showing them [...] "how they could escape from the wilderness of this world into the promised land of heaven". Because <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> as a word in Hebrew, Jewish Aramaic, and Greek, Alexander believes this gives even more strength to this etymology.|$|E

2500|$|In tandem, {{echoes of}} Sămănătorist {{ideology}} were fueling {{some of the}} new movements aiming to reconfigure Romania's political scene. One such current was the version of agrarianism represented, in a post-land reforms age, by the Peasants' Party and the National Peasants' Party (both of which represented mutations of Poporanism). In tandem, the magazine was also a reference point for the far right or fascist movements which emerged during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The first among such groups was one formed around the poet-philosopher Nichifor Crainic, a sporadic contributor to Iorga's magazines, after he took over leadership of Gândirea journal. Crainic's main innovation was in linking ethnic nationalism and ethnocracy with the notion that the Romanian Orthodox Church was the guarantee of Romanian identity, therefore discarding the implicit secularism of Sămănătorist thought. Crainic's [...] "Orthodoxist" [...] views, Veiga notes, were closely related to the ideas of Russian émigré authors, from the Christian existentialism of Nikolai Berdyaev to the political radicalism of the Eurasianist theorists. Defining his group's exact relation to Sămănătorism in one of his Gândirea articles, Crainic stated: [...] "Over the land that we have learned to love from Sămănătorul we see arching itself the azure tarpaulin of the Orthodox Church. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> substance of this Church blending in with the ethnic substance." [...] His own literary style was seen as a more robust form of neo-Sămănătorism by Lovinescu, and deemed [...] "Orthodoxism with Semănătorist modulations" [...] by literary historian Mircea A. Diaconu. In tandem, Crainic's rival on the far right, Trăirist philosopher Nae Ionescu, paid homages to Sămănătorul and Iorga's thought.|$|E

6000|$|Under a {{transport}} of Joy or of vivid Pleasure, {{there is a}} strong tendency to various purposeless movements, and to the utterance of various sounds. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> in our young children, in their loud laughter, clapping of hands, and jumping for joy; in the bounding and barking of a dog when going out to walk with his master; and in the frisking of a horse when turned out into an open field. Joy quickens the circulation, and this stimulates the brain, which again reacts on the whole body. The above purposeless movements and increased heart-action may be attributed in chief part to the excited state of the sensorium,[10] and to the consequent undirected overflow, as Mr. Herbert Spencer insists, of nerve-force. It deserves notice, that it is chiefly the anticipation of a pleasure, and not its actual enjoyment, which leads to purposeless and extravagant movements of the body, and to the utterance of various sounds. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> in our children when they expect any great pleasure or treat; and dogs, which have been bounding about at ...|$|E
