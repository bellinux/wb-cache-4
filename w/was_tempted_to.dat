He pursued the commission, interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme. The mayor of Calais <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio, and soon the memorial was approved, with Rodin as its architect. It would commemorate the six townspeople of Calais who offered their lives to save their fellow citizens.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{remained}} in retirement for 20 years, conjuring {{up images of}} Jack L. Warner every time he <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady, he {{found it easier to}} rebuff others, including a part in The Godfather Part II. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.|$|E
5|$|Development of Invisible War {{began at}} series creator Ion Storm {{following}} {{the success of}} the original Deus Ex. Most of the original game's development team returned to develop Invisible War, eager to both tell a new story and refine the original gameplay. There were also relative newcomers who had worked on the original game's PlayStation 2 (PS2) port. Harvey Smith, who worked as lead designer for the original game, was chosen by the original director and series creator Warren Spector to direct the game; Spector instead took on a supervisory role for both Invisible War and other projects within the company. While Smith <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> act as both director and designer, he saw that it would be too much work, so brought on Ricardo Bare as lead designer. Bare had been involved in the later development of Deus Ex, and despite his lack of experience as a designer was given the role when more qualified staff members were unavailable.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the film}} is of course fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done {{advertising}} work, he received many offers to do television commercials after Billy's Balloon drew international attention. In appearances Hertzfeldt has often told the humorous story of how he <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> produce the worst possible cartoons he {{could come up with}} for the companies, make off with their money, and see if they would actually make it to air. Eventually this became the germ for Rejecteds theme of a collection of cartoons so bad they were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator's breakdown and ultimately the cartoons' metaphysical crisis.|$|E
25|$|She {{faced the}} issue of succession. At the time she took the throne, she created Li Dan, the former Emperor Ruizong, crown prince, and {{bestowed}} the name of Wu on him. The official Zhang Jiafu, however, convinced the commoner Wang Qingzhi (王慶之) to start a petition drive to make her nephew Wu Chengsi crown prince, arguing that an emperor named Wu should pass the throne {{to a member of}} the Wu clan. Wu Zetian <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> do so, and when the chancellors Cen Changqian and Ge Fuyuan opposed sternly, they, along with fellow chancellor Ouyang Tong, were executed. Nevertheless, she declined Wang's request to make Wu Chengsi crown prince, but for a time allowed Wang to freely enter the palace to see her. On one occasion, however, when Wang angered her by coming to the palace too much, she asked the official Li Zhaode to batter Wang—and Li Zhaode took the opportunity to batter Wang to death, and his group of petitioners scattered. Li Zhaode then persuaded Wu Zetian to keep Li Dan as crown prince—pointing out that a son was closer in relations than a nephew, and also that if Wu Chengsi became emperor, Emperor Gaozong would never again be worshiped. Wu Zetian agreed, and for some time did not reconsider the matter. Further, at Li Zhaode's warning that Wu Chengsi was becoming too powerful, Wu Zetian stripped Wu Chengsi of his chancellor authority and bestowed on him largely honorific titles without authority.|$|E
25|$|Friction {{intensified}} {{between the}} barons and the king. Henry repudiated the Provisions of Oxford and obtained a papal bull in 1261 exempting {{him from his}} oath. Both sides began to raise armies. Prince Edward, Henry's eldest son, <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> side with his godfather Simon de Montfort, and supported holding a Parliament in his father's absence, before he decided to support his father. The barons, under Montfort, captured most of south-eastern England. At the Battle of Lewes in 1264, Henry and Edward were defeated and taken prisoner. Montfort summoned the Great Parliament, regarded as the first English Parliament {{worthy of the name}} {{because it was the first}} time cities and burghs sent representatives. Edward escaped and raised an army. He defeated and killed Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Savage retribution was exacted on the rebels and authority was restored to Henry. Edward, having pacified the realm, left England to join Louis IX on the Ninth Crusade, funded by an unprecedented levy of one-twentieth of every citizen's movable goods and possessions. He was one of the last crusaders in the tradition aiming to recover the Holy Lands. Louis died before Edward's arrival and the result was anticlimactic; Edward's small force limited him to the relief of Acre and a handful of raids. Surviving a murder attempt by an assassin, Edward left for Sicily later in the year, never to return on crusade. The stability of England's political structure was demonstrated when Henry III died and his son succeeded as Edward I; the barons swore allegiance to Edward even though he did not return for two years.|$|E

25|$|England {{were forced}} to face an awkward period before lunch, and duly obliged the {{tourists}} by succumbing to the pressure. Martyn Moxon fell to a third ball duck in the first over, caught by Waugh at point slashing at an out-swinger from Terry Alderman. Debutant Mike Atherton went two balls later, fooled by Alderman's now trademark in-swinging yorker which trapped him in front to be out LBW. England ended the first over 2 for 1. Tim Curtis fared little better, out a few overs later for 2, also out LBW to Alderman. Robin Smith and David Gower went someway to stabilising the England innings, but when captain Gower <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> play at an off-cutter outside the off stump by Geoff Lawson he got an outside edge and was caught behind for 11. Once again keeper Jack Russell was called upon to try to provide some lower order resistance for a failing England line-up. He did so, {{this time in the}} form of providing support for Smith, who started to look comfortable where the others had failed. Smith's stroke-play became audacious, even elegant at times. He soon moved past 50, but lost Russell soon after. The keeper-batsman caught behind by Healy off Lawson for 20. Hemmings likewise provided good support for Smith, chiming in with a useful 38, and helping Smith take the England total past 200 before he was spectacularly clean-bowled by Alderman. Smith soon crept over the line to make a well made century, but he was out 1 run later for 101, caught behind by Healy off Alderman, giving the West Australian yet another 5 wicket haul, his fifth of the series so far. Alderman finished the English first innings with 5 for 69.|$|E

It was not until 29September 1899 that Puccini was able to mark the final page of the score as completed. Despite the notation, there was additional work to be done, such as the shepherd boy's song {{at the start of}} act 3. Puccini, who always sought to put local colour in his works, wanted that song to be in Roman dialect. The composer asked a friend to have a [...] "good romanesco poet" [...] write some words; eventually the poet and folklorist [...] wrote the verse which, after slight modification, was placed in the opera.|$|E

500|$|MacGregor's {{interest}} was aroused by the colonial revolts against Spanish rule in Latin America, particularly Venezuela, where {{seven of the}} ten provinces had declared themselves an independent republic in July 1811, starting the Venezuelan War of Independence. The Venezuelan revolutionary General Francisco de Miranda had been feted in London society during his recent visit, and may have met MacGregor. Noting the treatment London's highest circles gave to Miranda, MacGregor formed the idea that exotic adventures in the New World might earn him similar celebrity on his homecoming. He sold the small Scottish estate he had inherited from {{his father and grandfather}} and sailed for South America in early 1812. On the way he stopped in Jamaica, where according to Rafter he <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> settle among the planters and traders, but [...] "having no introductory letters to that place, he was not received into society". After a comfortable sojourn in Kingston, he sailed for Venezuela and disembarked there in April 1812.|$|E
500|$|Although Hergé <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> abandon Tintin at Riklin's suggestion, devoting himself {{instead to}} his hobby of {{abstract}} art, {{he felt that}} doing so would be an acceptance of failure. In the end, he left his wife {{so that he could}} marry Fanny Vlaminck, and continued work on Tintin in Tibet, trusting that completing the book would exorcise the demons he felt possessed him. [...] "It was a brave decision, and a good one", said reporter and British Tintin expert Michael Farr. [...] "Few problems, psychological included, are solved by abandoning them." [...] Thompson noted, [...] "It was ironic, but not perhaps unpredictable, that faced with the moral dilemma posed by Riklin, Hergé chose to keep his Scout's word of honour to Tintin, but not to Germaine." [...] Belgian Tintin expert Philippe Goddin summarised: [...] " [...] sought to regain a lost equilibrium, that he imposes on his hero a desire to seek purity... considering it necessary for Tintin to go through the intimate experience of distress and loneliness... and discover himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Bonnet {{set sail}} for Nassau, Bahamas, to the haven for pirates {{known as the}} [...] "pirates' republic", but he was seriously wounded en route during an {{encounter}} with a Spanish warship. After arriving in Nassau, Bonnet met Edward Teach, the infamous pirate Blackbeard. Incapable of leading his crew, Bonnet temporarily ceded his ship's command to Blackbeard. Before separating in December 1717, Blackbeard and Bonnet plundered and captured merchant ships along the East Coast. After Bonnet failed to capture the Protestant Caesar, his crew abandoned him to join Blackbeard aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge. Bonnet stayed on Blackbeard's ship as a guest, and did not command a crew again until summer 1718, when he was pardoned by North Carolina governor Charles Eden and received clearance to go privateering against Spanish shipping. Bonnet <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> resume his piracy, but {{did not want to}} lose his pardon, so he adopted the alias [...] "Captain Thomas" [...] and changed his ship's name to Royal James. He had returned to piracy by July 1718.|$|E

500|$|The former British {{video game}} {{publication}} Super Play, which had three editors review the game, also enjoyed it. The magazine's Zy Nicholson {{noted that the}} game was better than his favorite game, Mega Man X, describing Super Metroid as [...] "more of an experience than a game". Comparing the game to the 1986 film Aliens, Nicholson felt that the game was best experienced when played in the dark with the volume turned up. He found the game so compulsive that he <b>was</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> play [...] "without eating or sleeping". The publication's Tony Mott named the game's atmosphere its best aspect, calling the game a mix of Turrican (1990), Aliens, Exile (1989), and Nodes of Yesod (1985). Appreciating the game's controls, Mott applauded Nintendo's ability to create a refined gameplay. He concluded his review by calling Super Metroid [...] "undoubtedly the best game I've played this year so far", predicting that anyone who plays the game would be [...] "playing a game destined for classic status". The third reviewer, James Leach, agreed with Nicholson and Mott that Super Metroid was what Mega Man X should have been. Concluding his review, Leach wrote that Super Metroid contained everything he looked for in a video game: [...] "playability, hidden tricks, powerful weapons and steamingly evil baddies". After summarizing the reviews, the magazine's verdict was, [...] "We all love this game. Super Metroid is absolutely marvelous and you should own it." ...|$|E
