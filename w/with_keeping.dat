5|$|In {{the early}} years, British {{officials}} depended on native officials for advice {{and to act}} as interpreters. However, {{they had to be}} careful about ethnic rivalries. Thus Fadl el-Mula, a Dinka who had been a police quartermaster, greatly impressed the Governor of Mongalla and was appointed assistant superintendent of the Twic Dinka in 1909. He was credited <b>with</b> <b>keeping</b> the peace between the Dinka and the Nuer people, two groups with a history of fighting and cattle raiding. However, Fadl el-Mula was so strongly biased towards the Dinka that his police were attacked by angry Nuer and he had to be removed from his post.|$|E

Despite acting as gaoler to the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and Star Chamber {{as part of his}} duties the Warden was {{considered}} an officer of the Court of Common Pleas. All court officers were appointed for life, and could only be removed for misbehaviour. Despite this, the sheer number of positions meant that several came up for reappointment in each Chief Justice's tenure, and selling them could be very profitable.|$|E
5|$|The agency's {{leadership}} was later reorganized. Soemanang became Antara's managing editor, and while Malik became his deputy.

After Soemanang left Antara in 1938 to become the director of the Pergoeroean Rakjat network of schools, Sipahoetar was promoted to editor-in-chief, and Pandoe Kartawigoena became the agency's deputy editor-in-chief. Sipahoetar was later elevated to managing editor, but left the agency in 1939 because of an illness. Alwi Soetan Osman, an employee of the Indies' Ministry of Justice, briefly succeeded him as managing editor before being replaced by Pandoe Kartawigoena.|$|E

The play is also credited <b>with</b> <b>keeping</b> a Major League Baseball team in the city of Seattle, as it helped garner support for a new taxpayer-funded stadium for the Mariners. That stadium, known today as Safeco Field, opened in 1999, with the Double depicted in a mural as part of the stadium's art collection.|$|E
5|$|While Kline was {{concerned}} with lighting, print quality, and color, Bonnie Prendergast, the script supervisor, took notes that would be written up after the company had finished for the day. Prendergast's role was to ensure continuity in wardrobe, actor position, and prop placement. Any changes in dialogue or ad-libbed lines were similarly written down. Assistant director Danny McCauley was responsible for collaborating with unit production manager Phil Rawlins to finalize shooting orders and assigning extras. Rawlins, McCauley, production manager Lindsley Parsons Jr., and Katzenberg were all tasked <b>with</b> <b>keeping</b> things moving {{as fast as possible}} and keeping the budget under control; every hour on stage cost the production $4000.|$|E
5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to Genealogy of the Holy War. Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff {{felt the need to}} keep going and create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties <b>with</b> <b>keeping</b> the game within the world of Genealogy of the Holy War, with Kaga commenting {{that it would have been}} simpler to create a completely original title if they had known how big the project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of Genealogy of the Holy War had suffered due to the goal of creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by giving each map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 870s, {{a major change}} {{took place in the}} Abbasid government, as the Abbasid prince al-Muwaffaq emerged as the de facto regent of the empire, sidelining his brother, Caliph al-Mu'tamid (r. 870–892). Officially, al-Muwaffaq {{controlled}} the eastern half of the Caliphate, while al-Mu'tamid's son and first heir al-Mufawwad controlled the western, with the aid of the Turkish general Musa ibn Bugha. In reality al-Muwaffaq held the actual reins of power. Al-Muwaffaq however was preoccupied with the more immediate threats to the Abbasid government presented by the rise of the Saffarids in the east and by the Zanj Rebellion in Iraq itself, as well as <b>with</b> <b>keeping</b> in check the Turkish troops and managing the internal tensions of the caliphal government. This gave Ibn Tulun the necessary space to consolidate his own position in Egypt. Ibn Tulun kept himself out of the Zanj conflict, and even refused to recognize al-Mufawwad as his suzerain, who in turn did not confirm him in his position.|$|E
5|$|In the series, Clark Kent {{attempts}} {{to live the}} life of a normal human being, and struggles <b>with</b> <b>keeping</b> the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an on-again, off-again relationship with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In Smallville, Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all of them {{at the start of the}} show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until season two and six, respectively.|$|E

His tenure was marked by controversy regarding his defense of the administration against allegations from over two dozen Nobel Laureates, amongst others, that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, including those relating to stem cell research and global warming. However, he has also been credited <b>with</b> <b>keeping</b> the political effects of the September 11 attacks from harming science research—by ensuring that tighter visa controls did not hinder the movement of those engaged in scientific research—and with increasing awareness of the relationship between science and government. He also served as the President of Stony Brook University from 1980 until 1994, and director of Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1998 until 2001.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{there was}} still a need to {{maintain}} the pressure upon the Japanese in the north, and so the 23rd Brigade—which had been previously operating in the central sector after being transferred from garrison duty in the Outer Islands—was also given responsibility for the northern sector as well, relieving the 11th Brigade on 20 June. The brigade's commander—Brigadier Arnold Potts—was charged <b>with</b> <b>keeping</b> the Japanese force bottled up on the Bonis Peninsula and to send out patrols towards the Buka Passage. Initially, Potts was only allowed to allocate one of his three battalions—the 27th, under Lieutenant Colonel Alex Pope—for the task, as the other two—Lieutenant Colonel Harry Dunkley's 7th Infantry Battalion and Lieutenant Colonel Lew Loughran's 8th Infantry Battalion—were to remain in the central sector; however, after intelligence reports indicated that the Japanese forces in the northern sector were stronger than the Australians initially thought, he requested permission to transfer the 8th Infantry Battalion, along with a battery of artillery from the 4th Field Regiment that was {{to be based on the}} Soraken Peninsula. Due to the requirements of the advance to the south, however, no engineer or armoured support was initially available.|$|E
5|$|Once a kit {{has reached}} six moons old, they become ‘{{apprentice}}s’. As {{a mark of}} this, each kit is now given the suffix ‘paw’. For example, ‘Graykit’ would become ‘Graypaw’. An apprentice is then assigned to a ‘mentor’. Mentors are often carefully chosen {{in order to fulfill}} an apprentice’s full potential; for example, a rather highly-strung apprentice would be given to a calmer mentor, whilst a more timid apprentice would be given to a mentor known for their bravery. It is the job of a mentor to train their apprentice for any given situation, teaching them to hunt, fight, and patrol borders. Apprentices move out of the nursery and sleep in their own separate den. In addition to training, apprentices are also tasked <b>with</b> <b>keeping</b> the camp clean.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{returned}} to management on 8 October 2001 with Wrexham on a two-year contract, replacing Brian Flynn who had resigned after 12 years in charge, {{with the club}} 23rd in the Second Division. He was tasked <b>with</b> <b>keeping</b> the club steady whilst it struggled with financial problems. He decided {{to cut back on}} the club's youth coaching spending, and as a result Wrexham's youth structure was downgraded from an Academy to a Centre of Excellence. He signed goalkeeper Marius Røvde, midfielder Jim Whitley, and gave striker Hector Sam his debut, but failed to keep Wrexham away from the relegation zone. With relegation confirmed, new signing Lee Jones scored all five goals in a 5–0 win over Cambridge United, leaving cause for optimism at the Racecourse Ground.|$|E
