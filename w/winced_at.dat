2500|$|In {{his early}} years, at least, Biederwolf was not above using parades, {{athletic}} feats, and magic tricks {{to win over}} audiences. Also like his colleagues, Biederwolf gave sermons on [...] "booze," [...] motherhood, and purity (though, as {{was typical of the}} period, the latter was given to men only). Later Biederwolf <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> evangelists who had promotional photographs taken of themselves in ridiculous poses, admitting that although he himself had [...] "been foolishly guilty with his brethren," [...] he had [...] "put away the things of a fool." [...] While Biederwolf stressed the significance of the Holy Spirit in producing conversions, he also did not shy away from noting the importance of the evangelistâ€™s [...] "personal magnetism." ...|$|E
2500|$|The eyewitnesses, {{students}} named Jacques Price and Sam Smilovitz (sometimes called Jack Price and Sam Smiley), proffered {{accounts of}} the incident that generally corroborated one another. Price describes Whitehead asking Houdini [...] "if he believed in the miracles of the Bible" [...] and [...] "whether {{it was true that}} punches in the stomach did not hurt him". He then delivered [...] "some very hammer-like blows below the belt". Houdini was reclining on a couch at the time, having broken his ankle while performing several days earlier. Price states that Houdini <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> each blow and stopped Whitehead suddenly {{in the midst of a}} punch, gesturing that he had enough, and adding that he had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not expect Whitehead to strike him so suddenly and forcefully. Had his ankle not been broken, he would have risen from the couch into a better position to brace himself.|$|E

6000|$|... "Uncle," [...] said she, <b>wincing</b> {{a little}} <b>at</b> the name, {{as a horse}} with a sore back <b>winces</b> <b>at</b> the touch of the saddle, [...] "it wasn't about the sheep that I was going to speak to you. I {{want you to do}} me a favour." ...|$|R
2500|$|... {{while the}} 1995 {{incident}} mentioned briefly above, when Illingworth told Hick he had [...] "a soft centre" [...] {{because of his}} [...] "mollycoddled upbringing", made even Atherton <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> his bluntness.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Deronda, {{with some}} {{softening}} of voice. [...] "But experience differs for different people. We don't all <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> the same things. I have {{had plenty of}} proof {{that you are not}} dense." [...] He smiled at her.|$|R

50|$|I'd {{spent a month}} {{preparing}} for that by starving myself. I was 8st 5lbs. When I look <b>at</b> pictures I <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> {{the sight of the}} jutting collarbone. I can see I looked too thin, but at the time I was delighted by my protruding bones and concave stomach.|$|R
5|$|Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie) {{describes}} her vision of Killer Bob (Frank Silva) to Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz), while he sketches the man's face.

6000|$|Maisie {{knew all}} about bolting, but, decidedly, she WAS older, and there was {{something}} in her that could <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> the way her father made the ugly word--ugly enough at best--sound flat and low. It prompted her to amend his allusion, which she did by saying: [...] "I don't know what she'll do. But she'll be happy." ...|$|R

60|$|It {{was hard}} for Barbara {{to realize that she}} had {{associated}} with a thief--just for a moment it was hard, until recollection forced upon her the unwelcome fact of the status of another whom she had known--to whom she had given her love.

6000|$|Fleda faltered again, <b>wincing</b> <b>at</b> {{the term}} of endearment, at what the words took for granted, charged with the {{confidence}} she had now committed herself to betray. [...] "I told him I would tell you!" [...] She smiled, but she felt that her smile was rather hollow and even that Mrs. Gereth had begun {{to look at her}} with some fixedness.|$|R
60|$|The {{remark that}} Gwendolen wound her neck {{about more than}} usual this evening was true. But {{it was not that}} she might carry out the serpent idea more completely: it was that she watched for any chance of seeing Deronda, so that she might inquire about this stranger, under whose {{measuring}} gaze she was still <b>wincing.</b> <b>At</b> last her opportunity came.|$|R
60|$|She <b>winced</b> <b>at</b> the insult, and {{the tears}} which she fain would have hidden from him, rose involuntarily to her eyes.|$|E

5000|$|Commemorating the book's fiftieth {{anniversary in}} 2010, Frank Keating of The Guardian wrote that [...] "This Sporting Life has {{stood the test}} of 'classic' {{category}} ... The novel's uneasy love story of insecure anti-hero tough, Machin, and his world-weary landlady, Mrs Howard, earthily provides harrowing off-field narrative, but it is in the raw sporting passages where the reader can <b>wince</b> <b>at</b> the resonance of uncomfortable truths." ...|$|R

Her finger felt round the last pocket, and she looked up.|$|R
