If Holocaust survivors were allowed to keep their reparation money, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> mean for the principle of equality? Eventually, many kibbutzim made this one concession to inequality by letting Holocaust survivors keep all or a percentage of their reparations. Reparations that were turned over to the collective were used for building expansion and even recreational activities.|$|E
500|$|In Inception, Nolan {{wanted to}} explore [...] "the idea of people sharing a dream space...That gives you the ability to access somebody's {{unconscious}} mind. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> be used and abused for?" [...] The majority of the film's plot takes place in these interconnected dream worlds. This structure creates a framework where actions in the real or dream worlds ripple across others. The dream is always {{in a state of}} production, and shifts across the levels as the characters navigate it. By contrast, the world of The Matrix (1999) is an authoritarian, computer-controlled one, alluding to theories of social control developed by Michel Foucault and Jean Baudrillard. Nolan's world has more in common with the works of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.|$|E

The film follows a twelve-year-old crippled girl, Angela, who, {{due to her}} parents' lack of affection, arranges an encounter between them with their respective lovers at the family country estate. The film climaxes with a truth guessing game. The players divide into two teams, which take it in turn to pick out {{one member of the}} other side and ask them question about people and objects.

[...] Lamborghini and Bugatti make their first home-console appearance in the franchise, following their introduction in Gran Turismo PSP, {{and it has been}} confirmed the new [...] "gullwing" [...] Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG will appear, along with the Ferrari 458 Italia and the Lexus LFA supercar. McLaren will also make their first appearance as a native manufacturer with the inclusion of the McLaren F1 road car, the F1 GTR race edition, and the MP4-12C road car. (The F1 GTR was present in Gran Turismo 4, but was included in BMW's dealership). Le Mans spec cars will make a return appearance. Hybrids were previously included in Gran Turismo 4 with the Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight. At the 2009 Tokyo Game Show, Yamauchi mentioned that the latest hybrid and electric cars will be included, including the Tesla Roadster and Mitsubishi i-MiEV. At Gamescom 2010, it was also revealed that GT5 will include the Jaguar XJ13 race car prototype, as well as the Ferrari 330 P4 and the Ford Mark IV race cars, and as the developers put it, [...] "will allow players to create the race that never came to be", since the XJ13 program was canceled before the car was ready for competition. Additionally, in association with Red Bull Racing, the development team worked on a new prototype car called the [...] "X2010 Prototype" [...] which was designed with the idea of, [...] "If you built the fastest racing car on land, one that throws aside all rules and regulations, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>that</b> car look like, how would it perform, and how would it feel to drive?" [...] This car was worked on by Polyphony Digital and Red Bull's aerodynamics expert, Adrian Newey, {{and is one of the}} cars in the game. Up to 16 cars or 32 karts will be able to race on track at once whereas previous installments allowed only six cars per race max. Polyphony Digital released the official vehicle list which also shows which vehicles will be standard or premium.|$|E
