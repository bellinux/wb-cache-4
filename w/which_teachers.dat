25|$|While it is {{difficult}} to determine <b>which</b> <b>teachers</b> had most influence on Rabbi Dessler, it is apparent that he is a child of the yeshiva world of the early 20th century, which was then influenced heavily by the ethical Mussar movement, but has similarly gained proficiency in Kabbalah and works of Hasidic Judaism and Jewish philosophy. His method in interpreting tenets of Jewish philosophy reveals an adherence to the principles of the Maharal (Rabbi Loeb of Prague, 16th century). Another major influence appears to have been the 19th century Hasidic work, Tanya. Rabbi Dessler did, however, maintain that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship.|$|E

The decisions of fully qualified teachers to continue in their teaching assignments (retention), to transfer to another assignment (transfer), or to leave the profession for some other activity (exit attrition) are the major determinants of the degree to <b>which</b> <b>teacher</b> shortages occur. This paper describes the "Comprehensive Retention and Attrition Model " (CRAM), a conceptual framework for organizing the numerous forms <b>which</b> <b>teacher</b> retention, transfer, attrition, and reentry can take. The model also incorporates teacher characteristics such as qualifications, age, and marital status, and an analytic approach to identifying teacher incentive variables having an impact on career decisions.

Between 1957 and 1965, the Carnegie Corporation of New York gave him {{over a million dollars}} to write studies of education. [...] In 1959 he published The American High School Today. This became a best seller, resulting in Conant's appearance on the cover of Time magazine on September 14, 1959. In it, Conant called for a number of reforms, including the consolidation of high schools into larger bodies that could offer a broader range of curriculum choices. Although it was slammed by critics of the American system, who hoped for a system of education based on the European model, it did lead to a wave of reforms across the country. His subsequent Slums and Suburbs in 1961 was far more controversial in its treatment of racial issues. Regarding busing as impractical, Conant urged Americans [...] "to accept de facto segregated schools". This did not go over well with civil rights groups, and by 1964 Conant was forced to admit that he had been wrong. In The Education of American Teachers in 1963, Conant found much to criticize about the training of teachers. Most controversial was his defense of the arrangement by <b>which</b> <b>teachers</b> were certified by independent bodies rather than the teacher training colleges.|$|E

2500|$|Philosophy of {{education}}: in {{his book}} Empathic education – a critique of neo-capitalism [...] (published in Hebrew 2008), Lampert extends his social criticism. He analyses the post-modern education system and argues that social exclusion, alienation and failure is an inherent part of a social reproduction ideology. The critical analysis reveals {{the gap between the}} smug self-image of those engaged in education, and the harsh and violent face of the system, of <b>which</b> <b>teachers</b> are victims as much as students. As an alternative, Lampert offers a return to the roots of educational practice; i.e. the human-encounter based on our natural empathy, especially in its radical form. This type of resistance, means a radical change in school, that like other cultural institutions, is built to keep us all away from authentic human encounter.|$|E

The target population was 111 teachers randomly selected by 20 teacher trainees teaching English in 20 schools within 6 school districts in Kuwait. A mixed method of questionnaire and observation by the teacher trainees was used for data collection. The results showed a discrepancy between the questionnaire responses and personal observation. The questionnaire responses indicated that the teachers had significant confidence, high competency, and excellent performance. However, classroom observation revealed that EFL teachers had to plan their classes with constraints of limited teaching hours and resources and mixed levels of proficiency and learning environment. Thus, Kuwaiti EFL teachers have the ability, proficiency, and confidence to teach EFL, but lack the required freedom from the educational authorities to implement their methods. </p...|$|R

We have given these cases not that exactly such ones will be very likely to occur, or that when they do, the teacher is to manage them in exactly the way here described, but to exhibit more clearly to the reader than could be done by any general description, the spirit and tone which a teacher ought to assume towards his pupils.

60|$|Now {{there is}} a very reasonable, and almost universally {{established}} rule, <b>which</b> <b>teachers</b> are very frequently prone to forget, viz., the employed ought always to be responsible to the employers, and to be under their direction. So obviously reasonable is this rule, and in fact, so absolutely indispensable in the transaction of all the business of life, that it would be idle to attempt to establish and illustrate it here. It has, however, limitations, and it is applicable to a much greater extent, in some departments of human labor, than in others. It is applicable to the business of teaching, and though, I confess, that it is somewhat less absolute and imperious here, still, it is obligatory, I believe, to far greater extent, than teachers have been generally willing to admit.|$|E

I refer to the rights of the Committee, or the Trustees, or Patrons, in the control of the school. The right to such control, when claimed at all, is usually claimed in reference to the teacher's new plans, which renders it proper to allude to the subject here; and it ought not to be omitted, for a great many cases occur, in <b>which</b> <b>teachers</b> have difficulties with the trustees or committee of their school. Sometimes these difficulties have amounted to an open rupture; at other times, only to a slight and temporary misunderstanding, arising from what the teacher calls an unwise and unwarrantable interference {{on the part of the}} committee, or the trustees, in the arrangements of the school. Difficulties of some sort very often arise. In fact, a right understanding of this subject, is, in most cases, absolutely essential to the harmony and co-operation of the teacher, and the representatives of his patrons.|$|E
