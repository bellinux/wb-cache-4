40|$|Understanding the {{physiologic}} and endocrinologic {{basis of}} fetal {{development is a}} major goal of perinatal biology. During the past decade a number of technological developments have allowed more precise evaluation of the fetus in utero and diagnosis of abnormalities. Despite these methodological achievements, however, there are no specific biological markers currently available to indicate that exposure to a given xenobiotic {{is associated with a}} cellular, subcellular, or pharmacodynamic event. This paper evaluates the following issues: <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unique physiologic and endocrinologic features of the fetal milieu interieur? What problems are peculiar to fetal assessment? Of what value are techniques such as ultrasonography, amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, fetoscopy, and fetal blood and tissue sampling for obtaining appropriate biomarkers? What are some examples of validated biomarkers and their applicability? What promising biomarkers are on the horizon? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> promising techniques such as the evaluation of fetal body movements, breathing activity, electronic heart rate monitoring, and nuclear magnetic resonance? How may molecular probes be of value as biological markers of fetal compromise? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major research gaps and needs, and how should research priorities be set? Some of these topics are addressed. Moreover, the more general role(s) that various diagnostic methods and biological markers can have in an understanding of the regulation of fetal growth and differentiation and the role of xenobiotics in affecting the normal course of events are discussed...|$|E
