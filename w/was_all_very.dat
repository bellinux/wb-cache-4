5|$|Architectural styles evolve {{and change}} {{to suit the}} {{requirements}} of each individual client. When in 1746 the Duke of Bedford decided to rebuild Woburn Abbey, he chose the Palladian style for the design, as this was now the most fashionable of the era. He selected architect Henry Flitcroft, a protege of Burlington. Flitcroft's designs, while Palladian in nature, would not be recognised by Palladio himself. The central block is small, only three bays, the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and it is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of state rooms replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block, and given Palladian windows, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was to be repeated in countless houses, and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, it was revived by Sir Aston Webb for his refacing of Buckingham Palace in 1913. Often the terminating blocks would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> {{far removed from the}} designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier.|$|E

500|$|The press {{were given}} {{advanced}} {{copies of the}} episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and {{it was nice to}} get that kind of space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> disappointing to me.|$|E
500|$|The Great Dining Room is {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire. [...] Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were [...] "silent, apart from the noises of my grandfather eating with great gusto, a napkin tucked in around his neck, hanging down over his popping-out tummy, and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> sad and tense".|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed [...] "Argus", {{noting that}} it was [...] "entertaining, funny and had some killer one-liners" [...] and that it {{featured}} [...] "all kinds of silly but in a very winning way." [...] Rabin enjoyed all the plots featured here, and praised Will Forte's role as Jenna's boyfriend and impersonator. Emily Exton from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the peacock storyline [...] "felt too silly", and that Forte [...] "was too underused as Paul", nonetheless said that despite not being the greatest 30 Rock episode of all time [...] "there were still some hilarious lines." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning liked Grizz's dilemma plot, commenting that Grizz not trying to hurt Tracy's feelings while Tracy tried to keep Dot Com away from Grizz's bride-to-be [...] "offered up some inspired lunacy." [...] His only complaint about [...] "Argus" [...] was Jack's plot as he deemed it disappointing. A review in TV Guide by Adam Mersel said [...] "...Fey and the gang {{live up to the}} challenge, and produce [...] a hilarious, quite snotty episode that holds up to any comedy around." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive towards the episode, reasoning that the writing [...] "is just so deliciously absurd that I can't help but giggle the whole way through", and that the plots featured here were [...] "sublimely inconsequential. Not a whole lot happened, but it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> funny." [...] Nick Catucci from New York magazine, who did not enjoy the two other stories, appreciated Jenna's, explaining that by having the character date one of her own impersonator was [...] "outrageous and funny without relying on any cheap insults to trannies." [...] Sean Gandert from Paste magazine reported that [...] "Argus" [...] was an episode that [...] " [...] us back to the show's roots", explaining that recapturing the [...] "old tone" [...] also worked to [...] "recapture the old joke-writing expertise. It wasn't 100% consistent, but there were so many good one-liners to counterbalance the misfires that it didn't even matter. This is 30 Rock the way it should be." [...] The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that Grizz's wedding story was [...] "pure filler, but everything on the show's kind of filler for the wackiness, so it mostly worked." [...] Carlson wrote that the best part from [...] "Argus" [...] came with Forte's Paul as Jenna's boyfriend and impersonator.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the band}} {{at this time}} was still firmly rooted in the loud, fast punk rock style, the trio were {{beginning}} to experiment with songs featuring a more melodic, though no less aggressive, sound.

2500|$|In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt named Madden {{the first}} Chair {{of the newly}} formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). His name had {{appeared}} on a list developed by Senator Robert F. Wagner and Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. Madden supported the expanded powers of the NLRB; he had observed {{the operations of the}} labor clauses of the previously existing National Industrial Relations Act, which were often stymied by employer refusal to negotiate with union representatives who didn't work for them.

The film was screened at the 8th Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival and was well received by critics, with Santos' performance earning positive reviews. Mark Ching of The Philippine Entertainment Portal wrote, [...] "There is an effort not to drown in sentimentality, unlike mainstream dramas [...] it is rather truthful and the other strength lies within the acting [...] Santos facial expressions and delivery <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> natural [...] very realistic portrayal of friendship that is relatable to everyone.".|$|E
2500|$|Entry to Neath <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well, {{having been}} chosen {{because of the}} {{convenience}} of simply building down from Onllwyn to Neath in the Dulais Valley. Swansea, however, was a much more attractive destination, and the N set about thinking how that place might be reached. The Swansea Vale Railway had been opened in stages down to 1861; it ran from Swansea to Ystalyfera, and was not far {{to the west of}} the N line. The decision was taken to build a connecting line, and this became the Swansea Vale & Neath & Brecon Junction Railway. It was incorporated by Act of 29 July 1864 to run from Colbren, a little north of Onllwyn, to a junction with the Swansea Vale Railway at Ynysygeinon. This railway became known as [...] "the Junction line".|$|E
2500|$|The British {{army had}} been sent into Spain to aid in {{expelling}} the French, but they had been forced into a humiliating retreat in terrible winter conditions that wrought havoc with health and morale and resulted in the army degenerating into a rabble. [...] In his authoritative account of the battle, the English historian Christopher Hibbert states: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well {{to talk of the}} courage and endurance of the troops but of what use were these virtues alone when pitted against the genius of Napoleon? [...] 35,000 men had crossed the Spanish frontier against him; 8000 had not returned. [...] We were unworthy of our great past". [...] The British of the day similarly viewed Corunna as a defeat: according to The Times, [...] "The fact must not be disguised ... that we have suffered a shameful disaster".|$|E

2500|$|Until the 1990s, Steeleye often toured as part {{of double}} bill, {{supporting}} Status Quo, or featuring support from artists such as Rock Salt & Nails and The Rankin Family. When Steeleye Span supported Status Quo on tour in 1996, the latter had just issued their version of [...] "All Around My Hat" [...] as a single. [...] "The video was filmed at Christmas," [...] Prior recalled. [...] "We'd supported them, and I found myself down in the mosh pit. Francis saw me and told the audience, 'Oh look, there's a Maddy lookalike down there… Fuck me, it is Maddy!' I was hoyed over the barrier , to join them for the encore. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> jolly." [...] Status Quo's single is credited to [...] "Status Quo with Maddy Prior from Steeleye Span" [...] and reached number 47 in the charts.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, Orange Man soon sparked large {{controversy}} {{in the media and}} in public after it was discovered children had copied the events of the advertisement in playgrounds and injured themselves; Rupert Howell, a Tango advertisement executive, stated in 2000 that Orange Man [...] "sparked a playground craze" [...] where [...] "people used to go round sort of slapping each other and saying 'You've Been Tango'd', and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> entertaining and great fun. There were no problems until we got a phone call once from a surgeon who said 'look, I'm not the complaining type but I thought you'd like to know that I did an operation on a child this morning with a damaged ear drum, and I was wheeling him in to the operating table, and said to him 'what happened to you then?' and replied 'I got Tango'd.'" [...] As a result, Howell pulled the advertisement from television that afternoon, although other reports erroneously state that the advertisement was banned.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to set the}} game four thousand years before [...] {{was one of the}} first details about the game made known. LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game.

[...] "Or LucasArts said we could go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before." [...] BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom. They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor. Concept work had to be sent to [...] "the ranch" [...] to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: [...] "It was more like, 'Can you just make his head like this rather than like that.' So it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so we were happy to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with." [...] Zeschuk said that [...] "Overall, we were really happy with the results. We felt like we had enough freedom to truly create something wonderful." ...|$|E
