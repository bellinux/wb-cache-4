5|$|As a <b>workaround</b> many {{policy makers}} try to restore {{competitiveness}} through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more to the level of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen to the level of 1950.|$|E
5|$|One such {{solution}} is by bidding: Players take turns bidding {{on how many}} moves it will take them to win the game. The lowest bidder gets the king. Thus, one player may open with a bid of 15turns, the other player may counter with a bid of 14turns, and the first player, more confident {{in his ability to}} escape in 13rounds than in his ability to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king's side. If that player does not escape within 13turns, the other player wins. Another <b>workaround</b> is to play a two-round match, in which players switch sides after the first round. If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report an ethnographic study of workarounds—informal {{temporary}} practices for handling exceptions to normal workflow—in a hospital environment. <b>Workarounds</b> {{are a common}} technique {{for dealing with the}} inherent uncertainty of dynamic work environments. <b>Workarounds</b> can help coordinate work, especially under conditions of high time pressure, but they may result in information or work protocols that are unstable, unavailable, or unreliable. We investigated <b>workarounds</b> and their effects through observation and interviews in a major teaching medical center. Our results suggest 4 key features of <b>workarounds</b> that technologies might help address: (a) <b>workarounds</b> differ as a function of people’s role; (b) <b>workarounds</b> draw on tacit knowledge of others’ abilities and willingness to help; (c) <b>workarounds</b> can have a cascading effect, causing other <b>workarounds</b> down the line; (d) <b>workarounds</b> often rely on principles of fairness and who owes whom a favor.

5|$|The Bill of Middlesex {{exploited}} the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex. Prior {{to the introduction}} of bills, a writ would have to be issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, the court would have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the defendant was assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was unnecessary. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, he would have a writ issued for trespass. B would be arrested as a result, and the detinue and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and detinue, a trespass writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a writ of trespass from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter <b>workaround</b> was used; as the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the trespass (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred in that county, allowing the King's Bench to issue its own bill of arrest. This became known as the Bill of Middlesex, and undermined the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, which normally dealt with such civil cases.|$|E

40|$|Background: Electronic {{medication}} {{management systems}} (EMMS) aim to reduce medication errors. Rather than {{use them as}} prescribed by policy, nurses commonly employ <b>workarounds.</b> EMMS-related <b>workarounds</b> {{have been attributed to}} a mismatch between introduced technology and nurses’ workflow. Comparatively little attention has been focused on examining nurses’ enactment, explanations and experiences of using <b>workarounds.</b> This is a significant lacuna because nurses’ contextual rationalisation is integral, I will argue, to understanding their use of <b>workarounds.</b> Aims: To improve our knowledge and understanding of nurses’ use of <b>workarounds</b> with EMMS in order to inform policy and technology development. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in four phases: scoping and process mapping; data collection and analysis; explanatory framework generation and member checking; and interpretation of emergent findings using existing sociological theory. The study sampled EMMS implementation stakeholders and nurses across all shifts and days of the week, from six wards in two Australian hospitals, representing two EMMS types and two models of nursing care. Data collection methods included observations, interviews and focus groups. Data analysis used a general inductive approach in which data were coded for emerging themes, framed by the research questions. Results: While sometimes EMMS related problems offered the best explanation for <b>workarounds,</b> nurses used <b>workarounds</b> largely to circumvent perceived barriers to being, or being perceived to be, a ‘good nurse’ in the sense of being time-efficient, safe, patient-centred and/or a team player. Whether nurses used <b>workarounds,</b> and how they felt about doing so, was moderated by a number of contextual factors. The use of <b>workarounds</b> provoked a range of emotions, in particular, feelings of tension. Interpretation: Nurses were motivated to use <b>workarounds,</b> even when doing so made them professionally vulnerable, primarily by the desire to be, or be perceived to be, a ‘good nurse'. Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus, field and capital offered useful constructs to interpret the intensity and complexity of the drivers of <b>workarounds.</b> Conclusion: Technology and policy designers need to be cognisant of creating potential barriers to being a ‘good nurse'. Unless they do so, problematic <b>workarounds</b> will continue unabated, and potentially useful <b>workarounds</b> will remain ‘underground’...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Information technology-based {{methods such as}} bar code-assisted {{medication}} administration (BCMA) {{systems have}} the potential to reduce medication administration errors (MAEs) in hospitalized patients. In practice, however, systems are often not used as intended, leading to <b>workarounds.</b> <b>Workarounds</b> may result in MAEs that may harm patients. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim is to study the association of <b>workarounds</b> with MAEs in the BCMA process. Second, we will determine the frequency and type of <b>workarounds</b> and MAEs and explore the potential risk factors (determinants) for <b>workarounds.</b> METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective study on internal medicine and surgical wards of 4 Dutch hospitals using BCMA systems to administer medication. We will include a total of 6000 individual drug administrations using direct observation to collect data. RESULTS: The project was funded in 2014 and enrollment was completed at the end of 2016. Data analysis is under way and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication at the end of 2017. CONCLUSIONS: If an association between <b>workarounds</b> and MAEs is established, this information can be used to reduce the frequency of MAEs. Information on determinants of <b>workarounds</b> can aid in a focused approach to reduce <b>workarounds</b> and thus increase patient safety.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{sought to}} explore the {{relationship}} of <b>workarounds</b> related {{to the implementation of}} an electronic medication administration record and medication safety practices in five Midwestern nursing homes. DESIGN: As a part of a larger study, this qualitative evaluation was conducted to identify <b>workarounds</b> associated with the implementation of an electronic medication administration record. Data were collected using multimethods including direct observation, process mapping, key informant interviews, and review of field notes from medication safety team meetings. MEASUREMENTS: Open and axial coding techniques were used to identify and categorize types of <b>workarounds</b> in relation to work flow blocks. RESULTS: <b>Workarounds</b> presented in two distinct patterns, those related to work flow blocks introduced by technology and those related to organizational processes not reengineered to effectively integrate with the technology. <b>Workarounds</b> such as safety alert overrides and shortcuts to documentation resulted from first-order problem solving of immediate blocks. Nursing home staff as individuals frequently used first-order problem solving instead of the more sophisticated second-order problem solving approach used by the medication safety team. CONCLUSION: This study provides important practical examples of how nursing home staff work around work flow blocks encountered during the implementation of technology. Understanding these <b>workarounds</b> as a means of first-order problem solving is an important consideration to understanding risk to medication safety...|$|R
