5|$|In the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, {{the airport}} {{served as a}} base to the Israeli Air Force. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> base, home to 21 {{aircraft}} at the time. The first military flight was made in December, 1947, when Pinchas Ben Porat flew an RWD-13 to Beit Eshel to rescue an injured soldier.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006 congressional primaries, Emanuel, {{then head}} of the Democratic congressional {{campaign}} committee, helped organize a run by Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran with no political experience, against grassroots candidate Christine Cegelis in Illinois' 6th district. Expedited withdrawal from Iraq <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> point of Cegelis' campaign and Duckworth opposed a withdrawal timetable.|$|E

5|$|Charing Cross <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> {{staging post}} for coaches, but the {{congested}} narrow road {{was a frequent}} scene of accidents; here, a bonfire has caused the Salisbury Flying Coach to overturn. Festive bonfires were usual but risky: a house fire lights the sky in the distance. A link-boy blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins are playing with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{there being}} 20 named systems, five above the average, only four storms {{directly}} affected land. Hurricane Eugene {{was the first}} Pacific hurricane to make landfall in Mexico in July since the 1954 season and caused all of the season's three deaths and $142.12 million damage. Tropical Storm Pilar and Hurricane Norma also came close to land, with the former producing record rain in Baja California Sur. The remnants of Hurricanes Ramon and Norma caused rain in the Continental United States. Elsewhere, Peke <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> north Pacific hurricane that crossed the International Dateline and became a typhoon of the 1987 Pacific typhoon season.|$|E
5|$|In 2006–2010, artist Park Kun-woong and Chung Eun-yong {{published}} Nogunri Story, a two-volume graphic {{narrative that}} {{told the story}} of the massacre, and the half-century struggle for the truth, through thousands of drawings, based on Chung's 1994 book. The Korean-language work was also published in translation in Europe. In the United States and Britain, No Gun Ri <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> or secondary theme in five English-language novels, including the U.S. National Book Award finalist Lark & Termite of 2009, by Jayne Anne Phillips, and the James Bond thriller Trigger Mortis of 2015, by British author Anthony Horowitz.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{production}} of munitions <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> {{feature of the}} war, and with {{a third of the}} men in the labour force moved into the military, demand was very high for industrial labour. Large numbers of women were employed temporarily. Trade unions gave strong support to the war effort, cutting back on strikes and restrictive practices. Membership increased by 692% from 4.1 million in 1914, to 28.3 million by 1920. 65% of union members had been associated with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) In 1914, rising to 77% in 1920. Labour's prestige had never been higher, and it systematically placed its leaders into Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Navies {{experimented with}} the {{positioning}} of guns, in turrets (like the USS Monitor), central-batteries or barbettes, {{or with the}} ram as the principal weapon. As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s steel {{was used as a}} construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy's , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> battery and barbette warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.|$|E
5|$|Overlordship <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> {{feature of}} Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings {{were described as}} overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; Ælle of Sussex may have been such a leader. Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E

5|$|Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875) {{was also}} from Angus and his Principles of Geology built on Hutton's ideas. Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism and his {{interpretation}} of geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> theme in the Principles, and a powerful influence on the young Charles Darwin. (Robert FitzRoy, captain of HMS Beagle, loaned Darwin a copy of Volume 1 of the first edition just before they {{set out on the}} 'Voyage of the Beagle'.) Lyell is buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Though most provinces {{were capable}} of {{producing}} wine, regional varietals were desirable and wine <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> item of trade. Shortages of vin ordinaire were rare. The major suppliers {{for the city of}} Rome were the west coast of Italy, southern Gaul, the Tarraconensis region of Hispania, and Crete. Alexandria, the second-largest city, imported wine from Laodicea in Syria and the Aegean. At the retail level, taverns or speciality wine shops (vinaria) sold wine by the jug for carryout and by the drink on premises, with price ranges reflecting quality.|$|E

5|$|With her {{formidable}} physique and outspoken manner, Braddock was a pugnacious {{presence in}} parliament, and a keen {{supporter of the}} 1945–51 Attlee ministry's reform agenda, particularly {{the establishment of the}} National Health Service in 1948. She served on Labour's National Executive Committee between 1947 and 1969. Her combative style led to a brief suspension from parliament in 1952. For most of her parliamentary career she remained a member of Liverpool's council, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> figure in the controversy that arose in the 1950s over the city's decision to acquire and flood the Tryweryn Valley in Wales {{for the construction of a}} reservoir.|$|E
5|$|A 5 hours, 9 {{minutes long}} biographical {{documentary}} film, , made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures {{the history of}} those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values {{as a metaphor for}} the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.|$|E
5|$|Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (c. 1275 – 23 June 1324) was a Franco-English nobleman. Though {{primarily}} {{active in}} England, {{he also had}} strong connections with the French royal house. One of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his age, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> player in the conflicts between Edward II of England and his nobility, particularly Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. Pembroke {{was one of the}} Lords Ordainers appointed to restrict the power of Edward II and his favourite Piers Gaveston. His position changed with the great insult he suffered when Gaveston, as a prisoner in his custody whom he had sworn to protect, was removed and beheaded on the instigation of Lancaster. This led Pembroke into close and lifelong cooperation with the King. Later in life, however, political circumstances combined with financial difficulties would cause him problems, driving him away from the centre of power.|$|E

5|$|Carol Vernallis, {{author of}} Experiencing Music Video, found homoerotic connotations between Madonna and the mermen. The mermen {{in the video}} exist in a {{self-contained}} world of their own, where they procreate with their own kind, both biologically and socially. The fact that the mermen {{did not seem to}} possess genitalia led Vernallis to believe that the video associated them with other works by Ritts – namely homoerotic sculptural images without penises. Their tails drew different meanings, including sexual ones and Christian symbolism. Since in contemporary art, images of mermen are rare while mermaids are common, they are sometimes called fairies partly because it is not known how they came to be. Vernallis believed that the mysteriousness and the elusiveness of the mermen in the video played a crucial role. They never address the camera directly and are often shown disappearing from view. Vernallis believed that since invisibility <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> theme in the homosexual community, this actually portrayed oppression and the desire to watch but never be seen.|$|E
5|$|Forster <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> {{figure of}} the Enlightenment in Germany, and corresponded with most of its adherents, {{including}} his close friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. His ideas and personality influenced Alexander von Humboldt, {{one of the great}} scientists of the 19th century. When the French took control of Mainz in 1792, Forster became {{one of the founders of}} the city's Jacobin Club and went on to play a leading role in the Mainz Republic, the earliest republican state in Germany. During July 1793 and while he was in Paris as a delegate of the young Mainz Republic, Prussian and Austrian coalition forces regained control of the city and Forster was declared an outlaw. Unable to return to Germany and separated from his friends and family, he died in Paris of illness in early 1794.|$|E
5|$|Hamidiye was {{a unique}} ironclad warship built for the Ottoman Navy in the 1870s, the last vessel of the type {{completed}} for the Ottomans. She <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> battery ship, mounting most of her armament in a central casemate. The ship, built by the Ottoman Imperial Arsenal took nearly twenty years to complete; she was laid down in December 1874, launched in 1885, and completed in 1894. Due to her lengthy construction period, she was already obsolete {{by the time she}} was launched. Her poor handling and low quality armor contributed to a short career, spent almost entirely as a stationary training ship. She was briefly activated in 1897 during the Greco-Turkish War, but she was already in bad condition just three years after she entered service, as was the rest of the ancient Ottoman fleet. The Ottomans embarked on a reconstruction program after the incident humiliated the government, but Hamidiye was in too poor a state by 1903 to warrant rebuilding, and she was accordingly decommissioned that year, placed for sale in 1909, and sold to ship breakers in 1913.|$|E
