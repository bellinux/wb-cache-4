5|$|Even where a {{concurrent}} use registration is issued, the parties may eventually {{come to an}} agreement under which one party will surrender its registration. In some instances, a party <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> happen to cease using the mark in favor of a new brand name, and the registration will lapse. In other cases, the larger company will eventually acquire the smaller.|$|E
5|$|Feral zerg are zerg {{not under}} the control of any higher entity. These zerg <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> devolve into predatory behavior: acting on the lowest {{intellectual}} level, consuming other animals for nourishment, attack everything around them. Control can be re-asserted over feral zerg by a Broodmother or other command strains however.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Manheim recovers {{long enough}} to explain {{that he was doing}} {{experiments}} involving time, gravity, and funnels to other universes, and suspects his last experiment is running out of control. Manheim explains that he is trapped between two dimensions and Data determines that the experiment must be shut down during a time fluctuation or else it <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> grow larger. Manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields. Picard admits to Jenice that he worried about losing her again after he left her in Paris, and vows to correct Dr. Manheim's experiment.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while soda-lime glass has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part the player battles through the single-player game alone, but is {{occasionally}} assisted by friendly non-player characters. Security guards and scientists will occasionally help the player in reaching new areas and convey relevant plot information. However, Opposing Force also features fellow U.S. Marines who will assist the player in combat to a far greater degree than security guards. Three types of Marines are featured in the game: the soldier <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> provide fire support for the player with a submachine gun, shotgun or machine gun, the combat medic is capable of healing the player and other non-player characters, while the engineer can cut through doors and remove obstacles, allowing the player and their squad to proceed unhindered. A selection of enemies from Half-Life populate the game, including alien creatures such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts.|$|E
5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E

25|$|Outdoor-grown {{carnivorous}} plants generally catch {{more than}} enough insects to keep themselves properly fed. Insects may be fed to the plants by hand to supplement their diet; however, carnivorous plants are generally unable to digest large non-insect food items; bits of hamburger, for example, <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> rot, and {{this may cause the}} trap, or even the whole plant, to die.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they have}} {{effective}} stingers, these wasps {{and other members}} of Stenogastrinae are typically passive aggressive. Their stings are less painful for humans than those of many other social wasps, and often when faced with a large threat, these wasps <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> fall passively out of their nests. This behavior actually makes it harder for the potential predator to determine the location of the nest.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the design}} of the Windows kernel, Kernel Patch Protection cannot {{completely}} prevent kernel patching. This led the computer security providers McAfee and Symantec to say that since KPP is an imperfect defense, the problems caused to security providers outweigh the benefits, because malicious software <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> find ways around KPP's defenses and third-party security software will have less freedom of action to defend the system.|$|E

25|$|Integer {{division}} by zero {{is usually}} handled differently from floating point {{since there is}} no integer representation for the result. Some processors generate an exception when an attempt is made to divide an integer by zero, although others <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> continue and generate an incorrect result for the division. The result depends on how division is implemented, and can either be zero, or sometimes the largest possible integer.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{because of}} {{the design of the}} Windows kernel, Kernel Patch Protection cannot {{completely}} prevent kernel patching.

25|$|As an example: an {{inertial}} body {{moving along}} a geodesic through space can be trapped into an orbit {{around a large}} gravitational mass without ever experiencing acceleration. This is possible because spacetime is radically curved in close vicinity to a large gravitational mass. In such a situation the geodesic lines bend inward around {{the center of the}} mass and a free-floating (weightless) inertial body <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> follow those curved geodesics into an elliptical orbit. An accelerometer on-board would never record any acceleration.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama {{continues}} resisting Chinese domination over Tibetan {{culture and}} religion despite China's attempts {{to ensure that}} after leaving this lifetime Avalokiteshvara reincarnates only with China's approval.

The Dalai Lama has refused to be reborn in China and has suggested that perhaps the bodhisattva of compassion <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> choose not to return to earth after this lifetime.|$|E
25|$|To {{shorten the}} horse's stride, the rider sits taller and lengthens the spine.

The rider should not hold the aids or hang onto the horse's mouth when shortening.

25|$|The upper {{panel in}} the image at right shows a ball in {{circular}} motion on a banked curve. The curve is banked at an angle Î¸ from the horizontal, and {{the surface of the}} road is considered to be slippery. The objective is to find what angle the bank must have so the ball does not slide off the road. Intuition tells us that, on a flat curve with no banking at all, the ball <b>will</b> <b>simply</b> slide off the road; while with a very steep banking, the ball will slide to the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.|$|E
