Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows <b>wrinkle</b> when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E
5|$|However, a new <b>wrinkle</b> {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused {{to transfer the}} parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor a {{membrane}} structure, <b>wrinkles</b> have {{an important}} effect on its mechanical behaviors. <b>Wrinkling</b> level characterizes the development of <b>wrinkles</b> and reflects {{the performance of a}} membrane in its service, and it plays a very significant role in the <b>wrinkling</b> analysis. The shell elements combined with the stability theory would be an ideal solution to the <b>wrinkling</b> problem. However, this approach requires a dense mesh and the computation is very time consuming. Also the <b>wrinkling</b> parameters are very sensitive to the size of shell elements. Existing <b>wrinkling</b> models based on membrane elements are derived from the Tension Field Theory which are incapable of describing fully the <b>wrinkling</b> behaviors. A new <b>wrinkling</b> model adopting the <b>wrinkling</b> strain as a measure of the <b>wrinkling</b> level is proposed in this paper to address these issues. According to the analogy between the <b>wrinkling</b> strain and the elasto-plastic strain, a <b>wrinkling</b> potential surface is assumed to exist and its normal direction defines the direction of the <b>wrinkling</b> strain tensor by virtue of the flow rule. Based on the consistent condition of the <b>wrinkling</b> potential surface, a modified constitutive tensor is obtained. To avoid the switching of the <b>wrinkling</b> state in the numerical solution, a new <b>wrinkling</b> criterion is proposed, in which the predominant influence of the previous state is included. Besides, a new approach to determine the <b>wrinkling</b> orientation is given to improve the efficiency of convergence in the slack region. The objectivity of the <b>wrinkling</b> coordinate frame is also demonstrated as an accompanying set of results. Finally, two benchmark problems are analyzed with the proposed <b>wrinkling</b> model, and their results are compared with those in the literatures. Results indicate that the proposed <b>wrinkling</b> model is valid and accurate to characterize the <b>wrinkling</b> level of a membrane and it exhibits efficient convergence even in the slack region...|$|R

In order to {{study the effects of}} geometrical parameters on <b>wrinkling</b> of rectangular wave-guide tubes, a 3 D-FE model for rotary-draw bending processes of thin-walled rectangular aluminum alloy wave-guide tubes was built based on the platform of ABAQUS/Explicit, and its reliability was validated by experiments. Simulation and analysis of the influence laws of geometrical parameters on the wave heights of inner flange and side <b>wrinkling</b> were then carried out. The results show that inner flange <b>wrinkling</b> is the main <b>wrinkling</b> way to rectangular wave-guide tubes in rotary-draw bending processes, but side <b>wrinkling</b> cannot be neglected because side <b>wrinkling</b> is 2 / 3 of inner flange <b>wrinkling</b> when b and h are smaller. Inner flange and side <b>wrinkling</b> increase with increasing b and h; the influence of b on side <b>wrinkling</b> is larger than that of h, while both b and h affect inner flange <b>wrinkling</b> greatly. Inner flange and side <b>wrinkling</b> decrease with increasing R/h; the influence of h on inner flange and side <b>wrinkling</b> is larger than that of R...|$|R

40|$|Thin-film {{membranes}} {{are basic}} elements {{of a variety of}} space inflatable/deployable structures. <b>Wrinkling</b> degrades the performance and reliability of these membrane structures, and hence has been a topic of continued interest. <b>Wrinkling</b> analysis of membranes for general geometry and arbitrary boundary conditions is quite challenging. The objective of this presentation is two-fold. Firstly, the existing models of <b>wrinkled</b> membranes and related numerical solution methods are reviewed. The important issues to be discussed are the capability of a membrane model to characterize taut, <b>wrinkled</b> and slack states of membranes in a consistent and physically reasonable manner; the ability of a <b>wrinkling</b> analysis method to predict the formation and growth of <b>wrinkled</b> regions, and to determine out-of-plane deformation and <b>wrinkled</b> waves; the convergence of a numerical solution method for <b>wrinkling</b> analysis; and the compatibility of a <b>wrinkling</b> analysis with general-purpose finite element codes. According to this review, several opening issues in modeling and analysis of <b>wrinkled</b> membranes that are to be addressed in future research are summarized, The second objective of this presentation is to discuss a newly developed membrane model of two viable parameters (2 -VP model) and associated parametric finite element method (PFEM) for <b>wrinkling</b> analysis are introduced. The innovations and advantages of the proposed membrane model and PFEM-based <b>wrinkling</b> analysis are: (1) Via a unified stress-strain relation; the 2 -VP model treat the taut, <b>wrinkled,</b> and slack states of membranes consistently; (2) The PFEM-based <b>wrinkling</b> analysis has guaranteed convergence; (3) The 2 -VP model along with PFEM is capable of predicting membrane out-of-plane deformations; and (4) The PFEM can be integrated into any existing finite element code.

40|$|AbstractA new Modified Displacement Component (MDC) {{method is}} {{proposed}} to accurately predict <b>wrinkling</b> characteristics in the membrane {{by eliminating the}} singularity of the displacement solution. In MDC method, a singular displacement component is primarily obtained at the <b>wrinkling</b> point by introducing the first-order characteristic vector multiplied by a positive intermediate parameter in the singular stiffness matrix. The non-singularity displacement solution is then obtained by modifying the singular displacement component based on three equality relationships at the <b>wrinkling</b> point. Where, the accurate introduction and the timely removal of the critical <b>wrinkling</b> mode are two key steps. In our simulation, we use a direct perturbed method to accurately consider these two key steps. In the direct perturbed method, some small, quantitative, out-of-plane forces are applied onto the membrane surface directly based on the first <b>wrinkling</b> mode, and then removed immediately after <b>wrinkling</b> starts. Several effective strategies are then used to advance the convergence. A <b>wrinkling</b> test using photogrammetry is used to verify the validity of our method. In addition, we also studied the secondary <b>wrinkling</b> characteristics occurred in the post-wrinkling phase in the end. The secondary <b>wrinkling</b> characteristics are the basic explanations of the <b>wrinkling</b> expansion and evolution in the post-wrinkling phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{initiation}} {{and growth}} of <b>wrinkles</b> are influenced by many factors such as stress ratios, the mechanical properties of the sheet material, the geometry of the workpiece, and contact condition. It is difficult to analyse <b>wrinkling</b> initiation and growth while considering all the factors because {{the effects of the}} factors are very complex and studies of <b>wrinkling</b> behaviour may show a wide scattering of data even for small deviations in factors. In the present study, the bifurcation theory is introduced for the finite element analysis of <b>wrinkling</b> initiation and growth. All the above mentioned factors are conveniently considered by the finite element method. <b>Wrinkling</b> initiation is found by checking the determinant of the stiffness matrix and <b>wrinkling</b> behaviour is analysed by successive iteration with the perturbed guess along the eigenvector. <b>Wrinkling</b> initiation and growth in the cylindrical cup deep drawing process are analysed by using the proposed bifurcation algorithm. The mechanism of <b>wrinkling</b> initiation and growth in the cylindrical cup deep drawing process is investigated in detail.
