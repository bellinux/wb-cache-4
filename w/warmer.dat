5|$|For {{much of the}} Middle Ages, England's climate {{differed}} from that in the 21st century. Between the 9th and 13th centuries England went through the Medieval Warm Period, a prolonged period of <b>warmer</b> temperatures; in the early 13th century, for example, summers were around 1°C <b>warmer</b> than today and the climate was slightly drier. These <b>warmer</b> temperatures allowed poorer land to be brought into cultivation and for grapevines to be cultivated relatively far north. The Warm Period was followed by several centuries of much cooler temperatures, termed the Little Ice Age; by the 14th century spring temperatures had dropped considerably, reaching their coldest in the 1340s and 1350s. This cold end to the Middle Ages significantly affected English agriculture and living conditions.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the Tibetan Plateau has {{experienced}} pronounced <b>warming,</b> yet {{the extent to}} which <b>warming</b> will affect alpine ecosystems depends on how <b>warming</b> interacts with other influential global change factors, such as nitrogen (N) deposition. A long-term <b>warming</b> and N manipulation experiment was established to investigate the interactive effects of <b>warming</b> and N deposition on alpine meadow. Open-top chambers were used to simulate <b>warming.</b> N addition, <b>warming,</b> N addition × <b>warming,</b> and a control were set up. In OTCs, daytime air and soil temperature were <b>warmed</b> by 2. 0 °C and 1. 6 °C above ambient conditions, but soil moisture was decreased by 4. 95 [*]m 3 [*]m− 3. N addition enhanced ecosystem respiration (Reco); nevertheless, <b>warming</b> significantly decreased Reco. The decline of Reco resulting from <b>warming</b> was cancelled out by N addition in late growing season. Our results suggested that N addition enhanced Reco by increasing soil N availability and plant production, whereas <b>warming</b> decreased Reco through lowering soil moisture, soil N supply potential, and suppression of plant activity. Furthermore, season-specific responses of Reco indicated that <b>warming</b> and N deposition caused by future global change may have complicated influence on carbon cycles in alpine ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Are the Arctic and Antarctic really <b>warming</b> now? This {{review was}} {{performed}} in order to answer this question.

5|$|The North Atlantic {{oscillation}} is an atmospheric phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are <b>warmer.</b> This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The <b>warmer</b> spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{variability}} {{is expected}} to increase in future but there exist very few experimental studies that apply different <b>warming</b> regimes on plant communities over several years. We studied an alpine meadow community under three <b>warming</b> regimes over three years. Treatments consisted of (a) a constant level of <b>warming</b> with open-top chambers (ca. 1. 9 [*]°C above ambient), (b) yearly stepwise increases in <b>warming</b> (increases of ca. 1. 0, 1. 9 and 3. 5 [*]°C), and (c) pulse <b>warming,</b> a single first-year pulse event of <b>warming</b> (increase of ca. 3. 5 [*]°C). Pulse <b>warming</b> and stepwise <b>warming</b> was hypothesised to cause distinct first-year and third-year effects, respectively. We found support for both hypotheses; however, the responses varied among measurement levels (whole community, canopy, bottom layer, and plant functional groups), treatments, and time. Our study revealed complex responses of the alpine plant community to the different experimentally imposed climate <b>warming</b> regimes. Plant cover, height and biomass frequently responded distinctly to the constant level of <b>warming,</b> the stepwise increase in <b>warming</b> and the extreme pulse-warming event. Notably, we found that stepwise <b>warming</b> had an accumulating effect on biomass, the responses to the different <b>warming</b> regimes varied among functional groups, and the short-term perturbations had negative effect on species richness and diversityNFR grant (B-AA/BU 08424) to UM...|$|R

40|$|Global <b>warming</b> and its {{importance}} are controversial. While {{a variety of}} estimates exists about the likelihood of global <b>warming</b> and the economic cost, financial market information can provide an objective assessment of expected losses due to global <b>warming.</b> We consider a Merton-type asset pricing model in which asset prices {{are affected by the}} changes in investment opportunities caused by global <b>warming.</b> In this setting, in theory global <b>warming</b> has a negative risk premium and most assets have negative loadings on the global <b>warming</b> factor. Financial assets in sectors that are more sensitive to global <b>warming</b> have more strongly negative loadings. Empirically, utilizing a variant of Campbell and Diebold‟s (2005) weather forecasting model in conjunction with Vassalou‟s (2003) approach for extracting financial market “news”, we obtain the global <b>warming</b> factor. We find that indeed the risk premium is significantly negative, that loadings for most assets are negative, and that industry portfolios considered to be more vulnerable to global <b>warming</b> (see IPCC (2007) and Quiggin and Horowitz (2003)) have significantly stronger negative loadings on the global <b>warming</b> factor.
