The quickest and least costly <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> was to adapt an existing work. At that time, highly regarded was the German–Russian bidirectional dictionary composed by Jacob Rodde in Riga and printed in 1784 in Leipzig. Kurzbeck entrusted his proofreader Teodor Avramović with the job of adapting Rodde's work into Slavonic-Serbian. Avramović was helped by Atanasije Demetrović (or Dimitrijević) Sekereš, the censor of the Cyrillic books installed by the Habsburg court in 1772. Sekereš began composing his Slavonic-Serbian dictionary in 1775, using five Russian dictionaries as sources, but he later abandoned that work.|$|E

In 1911 Procter & Gamble became the first company to advertise one of their products, Crisco, as kosher. Over the next two decades, companies such as Lender's Bagels, Maxwell House, Manischewitz, and Empire evolved and gave the kosher market more shelf-space. In the 1960s, Hebrew National hotdogs launched a [...] "we answer to a higher authority" [...] campaign to appeal to Jews and non-Jews alike.

[...] Although the remake stays true to the original game in both gameplay and basic storyline, Maverick Hunter X features a total graphical overhaul with 3D character models and backgrounds, a remixed soundtrack, voice acting, and anime cutscenes. According to Yoshikawa, the character illustrations were updated to resemble both toys and the designs of Mega Man X8.|$|E

He described synesthesia as the outcome when [...] "one sense gets more information than what's intended", stimulated by sensory deprivation. Haley further elaborated, saying that it is a mixture of senses that causes a person to experience colorful hearing and auditory smell. When the band created the album, it was the music they envisioned and decided the appropriate title for the album, Seeing Sounds. Williams pointed out that the lyrics were also inspired by synesthesia. He said that his fans want to [...] "rock out" [...] and be taken on an [...] "emotional roller coaster", and the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> is to give the fans some records they could blast out on their speakers.

Scenes that were removed to receive a PG-13 rating from the MPAA included a scene of statutory rape, two of three uses of the word [...] "fuck" [...] (the MPAA only permitted one use for the PG-13 rating), and intense shots of needles going into arms. The MPAA allowed scenes of Hancock shoving a prisoner's head up another's behind and of Hancock having explosive ejaculation during sexual intercourse, though Berg chose to save the latter scene for the DVD, explaining, [...] "It just wasn't that funny. Never was. You'd put it {{in front of}} an audience and there'd be two, maybe three people laughing. There was no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> and then regain even a modicum of emotional integrity." [...] The director kept the scene with the prisoners since a Las Vegas test screening was overwhelmingly successful: [...] "At the end of the day, I couldn't ignore an audience when they're laughing that hard." [...] With such elements, studio executives only became comfortable with Hancock when the marketing approach focused on action and humor. Berg noted, [...] "The ad campaign for this movie is much friendlier than the film."

[...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically".

In this work, we will focus on a linear embedding into a (pseudo-) Euclidean space. This is usually well defined for training data. Some inadequacy, how-ever, appears when projecting new or test objects due to the resulting projection errors. In this paper we propose an augmented embedding algorithm that enlarges the dimensionality of the space such that the resulting projection error vanishes. Our preliminary results show that it may lead to a better classification accuracy, especially for data with high intrinsic dimensionality. ...|$|R
