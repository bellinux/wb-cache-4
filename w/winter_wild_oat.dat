The general structure of this model is derived from LINTUL 1 model which modified to <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition against <b>winter</b> wheat. LINTUL 1 model was developed for simulation of spring wheat potential production level. In this study, first, we added development stage (DVS) and vernalization to LINTUL 1 for simulation of winter wheat {{growth and development}} and then the model calibrated for potential production level. Finally, we incorporate harmful effects of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> to <b>winter</b> wheat growth and yield.

40|$|The {{inherent}} genetic {{similarity between}} oat (Avena sativa L.) and <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena fatua L.) precludes selective herbicide use to control <b>wild</b> <b>oat.</b> Consequently, large reductions in oat yield and quality due to <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> consistently constrain oat production in western Canada. Traditionally, delayed seeding followed by tillage prior to planting {{was used to}} control <b>wild</b> <b>oat,</b> but new {{studies have shown that}} this practice also results in substantial reductions to oat yield and quality. Thus, new methods are needed to ameliorate the adverse effects of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition on oat. Planting more competitive varieties with earlier emergence and larger seeds may minimize losses associated with <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition. Therefore, the objectives of this research were i) to determine the influence of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> emerging at different times and varying densities on oat yield and quality and ii) to determine the relative importance of seed size and genotype in affecting <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> – oat competition. High densities of early emerging <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> greatly reduced oat yield and increased <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> contamination. Observed oat yield losses were as great as 70 % and resulted in a 15 % <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> contamination level. <b>Wild</b> <b>oat</b> that emerged before oat also had higher biomass and reproductive output than <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> that emerged after oat. Furthermore, early emerging <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> reduced percentage plump oat kernels and increased percentage thin kernels. Oat plants established from large caryopses produced 18 % more biomass and 15 % more panicles m- 2 than plants established from small caryopses.

The effects of full and root interference on wheat and <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> traits was greater than shoot interference.

The objectives of this research were to i) determine if western Canadian oat genotypes differ in competitive ability, ii) determine the effect of increased plant populations on <b>oat</b> – <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition, iii) determine the effect of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition on oat quality, and iv) establish whether or not oat genotype and seed size affect germination characteristics under low temperature and moisture stress.

Although low yielding under weed-free conditions, when subject to <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> competition CDC Bell was able to maintain yield, reduce <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> seed production and was the most competitive of the genotypes examined.

Alvand (the most recent cultivar) had higher dry matter accumulation, crop growth rate (CGR), leaf area index (LAI) and relative leaf area growth rate (RLGR) compared to Bezostaya. Alvand had {{a higher proportion of}} its leaf area in higher canopy layer. <b>Wild</b> <b>oat</b> was also shorter in height when it was competing with Alvand compared to Bezostaya. It was found that following characteristics were the most important criteria in competitive ability of <b>winter</b> wheat against <b>wild</b> oats: 1) leaf area at the end of tillering stage. 2) final leaf area index. 3) relative leaf area index, and 4) the canopy layer where the higher leaf area was measure...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the distribution of}} clodinafop-propargyl resistant <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> to in south western Iran (Khuzestan province), 50 fields which were sprayed with aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides were sampled. Those fields at which <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> had been controlled efficiently by these herbicides were selected for the experiment. Populations (50 suspicious to resistance and 1 susceptible) were studied in a randomized complete block design with four replications in 2005. Populations of <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> were sprayed during two- to four- leaves stage using the recommended dose of herbicide. Shoot biomass, survived plant and EWRC visual rating, were recorded four weeks after herbicide...|$|R
