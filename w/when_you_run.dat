500|$|... "What's Your Name" [...] is an midtempo electro song, and bases its melody on {{thrusting}} new wave-influenced synths. It {{contains a}} [...] "whimsical" [...] beat that utilizes sirens and wind instruments. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune compared the song's synth riff {{to the music}} that was popular during the 1980s MTV generation, while John Soeder from The Plain Dealer noted its similarity to British duo the Eurythmics. Usher monotonously repeats the pick-up line hook, [...] "What's your name?", and thereby pays homage to his bachelor history. The song's lyrics describe [...] "the feeling you get <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> into a woman that makes you speak gibberish".|$|E
500|$|Some regard Youngblood, who was {{considered}} to be an excellent pass rusher, as the best defensive lineman in Gators history as well {{as one of the top}} five players in the University of Florida's football program. When Time magazine chose him for their 1970 All-America Team, it said of Youngblood: [...] "Deceptively fast for his size, he reads screens and swing passes so adroitly that he intimidates quarterbacks by his mere presence." [...] His coach Doug Dickey told The Sporting News, [...] "He is difficult to move <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> at him, has the speed and agility to pursue down the line of scrimmage, and the strength and quickness to rush the passer." [...] In one of a series of articles written for The Gainesville Sun in 2006, Youngblood was ranked as the No. 5 all-time greatest player for the Florida Gators.|$|E
2500|$|... "Anytime I'm onstage or {{watching}} the music video, {{the first thing}} that comes into my mind is the person I wrote the song about. It's like {{the first thing that}} you think of is the moment that inspired the song, which is that excruciating, awful moment <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> into an ex for the first time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> {{away from}} our camp that first time," [...] said the doctor's son. [...] "How can you expect us to believe you? It {{is a waste of}} breath on your part." ...|$|R
2500|$|Drunk #1 {{is slowly}} walking, bracing himself against a fence and stumbling. He comes across Drunk #2, who is {{lying next to}} the fence. [...] "What a disgrace!

[...] We'll see what you're gonna do <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> out of fence!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will change}} {{myself into a}} ship, and will bear you across the seas to Erin, to the land where dwells the king. And you shall offer {{yourself}} to serve in his stable, and to tend his horses, till at length so well content is he, that he gives you the bay colt to wash and brush. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> away with her see that nought except the soles of her hoofs touch anything within the palace gates, or it will go ill with you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. You're a greedier thing than I am, you Black Leopard you--standing {{there in}} the dusk. You're a {{stronger}} thing. Don't you know you're stronger? When I am with you, you carry your point, because you are more concentrated, more definite, less scrupulous. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> beside me you push {{me out of my}} path.... You've made me afraid of you.... And so I won't go with you, Leopard. I go alone. It isn't because I don't love you. I love you too well. It isn't because you aren't beautiful and wonderful...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like that," [...] said Nan, presently, and {{her face}} looked less elfish, with its sharp eyes, {{inquisitive}} nose, and mischievous mouth. [...] "What did your mother do to <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> away that time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Being sorry wouldn't do {{away with}} the {{consequences}} of being bad, Davy. Don't you remember the Sunday last summer <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> away from Sunday School? You told me then that being bad wasn't worth while. What were you and Milty doing today?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} do not," [...] said Mrs. Byron, whimsically--"although {{you have a}} certain odious professional air, too. What did <b>you</b> do <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> away so scandalously from that stupid school in the north? How do you earn your living? Or DO you earn it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But what madness must {{it be to}} run in {{debt for}} these superfluities? We are offered {{by the terms of}} this sale six months' credit; and that, perhaps, has induced some of us to attend it, because we cannot spare the ready money, and hope now to be fine without it. But ah! think what you do <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> in debt; you give to another power over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be ashamed to see your creditor; you will be in fear when you speak to him; you will make poor, pitiful, sneaking excuses, and by degrees come to lose your veracity, and sink into base, downright lying; for, The second vice is lying, the first is running in debt, as Poor Richard says; and again to the same purpose, Lying rides upon debt's back; whereas a freeborn Englishman ought not to be ashamed nor afraid to see or speak to any man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue. It is hard for an empty bag to stand upright.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Oswald, what a {{fool you}} are! Love you! of course I love you. If you can {{understand}} anything, {{you ought to know}} that I have never loved any one else;--that after what has passed between us, I never shall love any one else. I do love you. There. Whether you throw me away from you, as you did the other day,--with great scorn, mind you,--or come to me with sweet, beautiful promises, as you do now, I shall love you all the same. I cannot be your wife, if you will not have me; can I? <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> away in your tantrums because I quote something out of the copy-book, I can't run after you. It would not be pretty. But as for loving you, if you doubt that, I tell you, you are a--fool." [...] As she spoke the last words she pouted out her lips at him, and when he looked into her face he saw that her eyes were full of tears. He was standing now with his arm round her waist, so that it was not easy for him to look into her face.|$|E
60|$|I did not {{understand}} till long afterwards, when I had watched the fawns many times, how important is this latter suggestion. One who follows a frightened deer and sees or hears him go bounding off at breakneck pace over loose rocks and broken trees and tangled underbrush; rising swift {{on one side of}} a windfall without knowing what lies on the other side till he is already falling; driving like an arrow over ground where you must follow like a snail, lest you wrench a foot or break an ankle,--finds himself asking with unanswered wonder how any deer can live half a season in the wilderness without breaking all his legs. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> upon a deer at night and hear him go smashing off in the darkness at the same reckless speed, over a tangled blow-down, perhaps, through which you can barely force your way by daylight, then you realize suddenly that the most wonderful part of a deer's education shows itself, not in keen eyes or trumpet ears, or in his finely trained nose, more sensitive a hundred times than any barometer, but in his forgotten feet, which seem to have eyes and nerves and brains packed into their hard shells instead of the senseless matter you see there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I like that," [...] the lad said indignantly. [...] "What have I {{to say for}} myself! I think it's {{what have}} you to say for yourselves? We were quietly fishing <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> over us and sank the boat and drowned my friend Joe, and haven't even {{stopped for a moment}} to see if you could pick him up. I call it shameful and inhuman!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wasn't the boys' {{dialogue}} fine?" [...] said Diana. [...] "Gilbert Blythe {{was just}} splendid. Anne, I do think it's awful mean {{the way you}} treat Gil. Wait till I tell <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> off the platform after the fairy dialogue one of your roses fell out of your hair. I saw Gil {{pick it up and}} put it in his breast pocket. There now. You're so romantic that I'm sure you ought to be pleased at that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] {{he would}} say, [...] "don't {{you see that}} if you had really killed her, the thing would have been {{published}} far and wide all over the kingdom, with a minute description, and perhaps a portrait of yourself on the bicycle, in all the illustrated papers? Even if you had only injured her severely, they would have made a sensation of it, with an offer, perhaps, of a hundred pounds for your capture, and a careful indication of the streets through which <b>you</b> passed <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> away--" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{said that}} you ought to thank God that your trade was a {{dangerous}} one, and I said that the sea should always keep you in fear and watchfulness, and looking to God to preserve you. Now, do you not see how these two sayings go together, and make each other plain. You seamen and fishermen are in continual danger; your lives are in your hands every moment--the belaying of a sheet, the strength of a bit of canvas, the toughness of a deal board, may settle your fate in a moment, and make all {{the difference between life and}} death. If they are sound, you may go back to a happy home, and see wife and children coming to meet you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> on shore at morning from your honest labour; and if they fail--if that weak cordage, and these planks, and thinner canvas, on which your lives depend, do but give way, what is left for you the next moment? what but a grave in the deep, deep sea, and your wives widows and your children orphans, and your bodies devoured by ugly creeping things, and your souls gone--gone where? My good men--you who sit around me now so strong and full of life and skill and happiness--where would your souls be if you were drowned at sea to-morrow? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} think of that prince, or of that government, who should issue an edict forbidding you to dress like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of {{imprisonment}} or servitude? Would you not say that you are free, have a right to dress as you please, and that such an edict would be a breach of your privileges and such a government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put yourself under such tyranny, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>run</b> in debt for such dress. Your creditor has authority, at his pleasure, to deprive you of your liberty by confining you in jail till you shall be able to pay him. When you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment; but, as Poor Richard says, Creditors have better memories than debtors; creditors are a superstitious sect, great observers of set days and times. The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared to satisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term, which at first seemed so long, will, as it lessens, appear extremely short. Time will seem to have added wings to his heels as well as his shoulders. Those have a short Lent who owe money to be paid at Easter. At present, perhaps, you may think yourselves in thriving circumstances, and that you can bear a little extravagance without injury; but ...|$|E

6000|$|... [Here the lightning-rod man sent {{up another}} call for me. I {{went down in}} a state of mind {{bordering}} on impatience. He said he would rather have died than interrupt me, but when he was employed to do a job, and that job was expected to be done in a clean, workmanlike manner, and when it was finished and fatigue urged him to seek the rest and recreation he stood so much in need of, and he was about to do it, but looked up and saw at a glance that all the calculations had been a little out, and if a thunder-storm were to come up, and that house, which he felt a personal interest in, stood there with nothing on earth to protect it but sixteen lightning-rods--"Let us have peace!" [...] I shrieked. [...] "Put up a hundred and fifty! Put some on the kitchen! Put a dozen on the barn! Put a couple on the cow!

[...] Wholly unmoved--further than to smile sweetly--this iron being simply turned back his wrist-bands daintily, and said he would now proceed to hump himself. Well, all that was nearly three hours ago. It is questionable whether I am calm enough yet to write on the noble theme of political economy, but I cannot resist the desire to try, for it is the one subject that is nearest to my heart and dearest to my brain of all this world's philosophy.] ...|$|E

40|$|Description This package takes dating {{information}} to produce joint chronological reconstructions for age-depth data. The package allows for: radiocarbon and non-radiocarbon depths, thickness errors, outlying dates, multiple calibration curves, and event prediction.
