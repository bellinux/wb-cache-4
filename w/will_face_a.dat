5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation of units to energy-intensive and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that firms <b>will</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a restriction {{on the sale of}} units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.|$|E
5|$|The James Webb Space Telescope {{will have}} 18 {{hexagonal}} beryllium sections for its mirrors.

25|$|PAL {{consoles}} face another incompatibility {{when playing}} out-of-region cartridges: the NTSC video standard specifies video at 60Hz while PAL operates at 50Hz, resulting in approximately 16.7% slower framerate. Additionally, PAL's higher resolution results in letterboxing of the output image. Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and, therefore, {{can be played}} in NTSC systems without issue while others <b>will</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> 20% speedup if played in an NTSC console. To mostly correct this issue, a switch {{can be added to}} place the SNES PPU into a 60Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions.

25|$|On November 25, 2008, a {{new federal}} rule was passed that allows states to charge {{premiums}} and higher co-payments to Medicaid participants. This rule will enable states to take in greater revenues, limiting financial losses associated with the program. Estimates figure that states will save $1.1 billion while {{the federal government will}} save nearly $1.4 billion. However, this means that the burden of financial responsibility will be placed on 13 million Medicaid recipients who <b>will</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> $1.3 billion increase in co-payments over 5 years. The major concern is that this rule will create a disincentive for low-income people to seek healthcare. It is possible that this will force only the sickest participants to pay the increased premiums and it is unclear what long-term effect this will have on the program.|$|E
25|$|One of the Conservatives' key {{policy areas}} of 2010 was {{to reduce the}} number of people in the UK {{claiming}} state benefits, and increase the number of people in the workforce.

Until 1999, Conservatives opposed the creation of a national minimum wage, citing that they believed it would cost jobs, and businesses would be reluctant to start business in the UK from fear of high labour costs. However the party have since pledged support and in the July 2015 budget, Chancellor George Osborne announced a national living wage of £9/hour, to be introduced by 2020, for those aged 25 and over.

25|$|Another factor which {{continues}} to {{play a significant role}} in the sales of Proton cars is the National Automotive Policy (NAP), enforced by the Malaysian government in the interests of Proton, Perodua, Naza and foreign brands with manufacturing plants in Malaysia. Under the NAP, imported vehicles are subjected to varying degrees of import and excise duties depending on the vehicle's origin of manufacture and engine displacement, with excise duty imposed at 60 to 105 percent being the highest component in the duty structure. Vehicles imported from members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, such as Thailand and Indonesia, are subject to the least import duties, whereas those from Europe suffer the worst. However, imported hybrid vehicles and cars purchased in duty-free Langkawi are exempted from the import and excise duties. The NAP ensures the survival of Proton and other Malaysian-made vehicles under a biased playing field in the Malaysian market. Nonetheless, the import duties of the NAP have been progressively revised and reduced in line with the eventual liberation of the market, but excise duties, the larger component of tariffs, continues to be high and opaquely applied, with non-tariff barriers effectively reducing the rate for Malaysian made vehicles. In March 2013, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia) announced that vehicles manufactured in Australia and Japan <b>will</b> <b>face</b> <b>a</b> gradual reduction of import duties in stages to zero by 2016. Proton however responded positively to the announcement, citing their recent positive developments such as the 5-star ANCAP safety recognition of the Proton Prevé as part of its commitment to progress.|$|E
