Zaslow said at the time that CBS had [...] "been very gracious and apologetic, and <b>we</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Journal {{appreciate}} it." [...] In a case of double plagiarism, the producer who wrote the piece copied from someone else for Couric, and the anchor claimed the words were hers when they were not. The producer responsible for Couric's piece, Melissa McNamara, was fired hours after the Journal contacted CBS News to complain. The network promised changes in its procedures.|$|E

For us, freedom of expression {{is at the core of}} our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so. ... So we would urge all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding, the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue. And we would urge dialogue, not violence. And that also those that might take offense at these images that have been published, when they see similar views or images that could be perceived as anti-Semitic or anti-Catholic, that they speak out with equal vigor against those images." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 8, {{during his}} Grammy Awards red carpet interview, West {{explained}} how the collaboration came to fruition: [...] "I'm {{executive producer of}} Rihanna's album, and I said I'd done a few songs with Paul McCartney and she couldn't get past this record. She had to have it on her album... So now <b>we</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Grammys doing it". West further compared Rihanna's vocals on the song to that of Scottish singer Annie Lennox: [...] "I feel like she has this type of energy in her vocals. And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry". In an interview with V magazine, Rihanna revealed, [...] "The thing that made me {{fall in love with}} [...] is the juxtaposition of the music and the lyrics. When you read the lyrics it's a completely different song than what you are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face." [...] Although it is a first collaboration by the trio, they have collaborated separately. West and McCartney collaborated on the 2014 single [...] "Only One", a track dedicated to West's daughter North. Rihanna and West previously collaborated on Jay-Z's 2009 single [...] "Run This Town" [...] — which became a commercial success and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — and West's 2011 single [...] "All of the Lights", a track featuring backup vocals by John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John among others.|$|E

Once in the twilight I caught sight of a figure that reminded me of Billy's, accompanied by a figure that might have been that of the eldest Miss Lovell; but as the spot was Battersea Park, which is not a fashionable evening promenade, and the two figures were holding each other's hands, the whole picture being suggestive of the closing chapter of a London Journal romance, I concluded I had made an error.|$|E

It was Umslopogaas who cut his way with Groan-Maker through a wing of one of Dingaan's regiments till he came to the Boer captain Ungalunkulu, and shouted to him to turn the flank of Dingaan. That {{finished}} it, my father, for they feared to stand against us both, the white and the black together. They fled, and we followed and slew, and Dingaan ceased to be a king.|$|E
