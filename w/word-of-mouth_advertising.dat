40|$|This work {{develops}} a diffusion model which incorporates <b>word-of-mouth</b> and <b>advertising</b> effects for two firms introducing competing brands {{of a new}} durable product. The competition between the two firms is formulated as a two-player, nonzero sum Markovian game. The firms are assumed to behave noncooperatively in choosing their advertising strategies and the solution concept is a Nash noncooperative equilibrium. Optimal advertising policies for this stochastic closed-loop control problem are obtained via dynamic programming. Our results indicate that both firms will start with high advertising outlays which will get reduced {{as the number of}} adopters increases. This is similar to the result obtained previously for a monopolist. Further, we find that there is a significant value in being the first brand to the market, and the greater the intensity of word-of-mouth effects, the greater the value in being first. The first entrant advantage is due to the goodwill generated by its stock of previous adopters. This first entrant advantage can only be overcome if the second entrant enters with a superior brand which is more enthusiastically endorsed by its adopters. advertising, diffusion, competition...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to understand the process of technology diffusion among end users for effectively implementing adoption and coping with frequent changes in the environment. Previous studies indicate that information and communication technology (ICT) adoption is affected by innovation influence such as usefulness, ease of use and self-efficacy. However, most of these studies bypassed imitation influence such as subjective norms, <b>word-of-mouth,</b> and <b>advertising,</b> specifically, interactive innovation having critical mass in technology acceptance research. Thus, this study investigates imitation influence in individual adoption of mobile communication technology, more specifically mobile phones, using Mahajan 2 ̆ 7 s diffusion model. The purpose of this study includes: (1) to investigate imitation influence using Mahajan 2 ̆ 7 s diffusion model in individual ICT (e. g., mobile phone, personal digital assistant) adoption; and (2) to empirically examine the causal relationships between initial acceptance and the intention to use, and between satisfaction and the intention to continuance using a holistic approach. ^ The results of this study show that there is an imitation influence including word-of-mouth and subjective norms, from the prior adopters to potential adopters, and mass advertising through TV or newspaper commercials in the ICT diffusion process. In addition, this imitation influence also stimulates innovation influence. Finally, this study provides a set of guidelines to mobile communication equipment manufacturers and ICT vendors in developing effective strategies for technology diffusion. ...|$|R

40|$|Chat rooms, {{recommendation}} sites, {{and customer}} review sections allow consumers to overcome geographic boundaries and to communicate based on mutual interests. However, marketers also have incentives to supply promotional chat or reviews {{in order to}} influence the consumers' evaluation of their products. Moreover, firms can disguise their promotion as consumer recommendations due to the anonymity afforded by online communities. We explore this new setting where advertising and word of mouth become perfect substitutes because they appear indistinguishable to the consumer. Specifically, we investigate here whether word of mouth remains credible and whether firms choose to devote more resources promoting their inferior or superior products. We develop a game theoretic model in which two products are differentiated in their value to the consumer. Unlike the firms, the consumers are uncertain about the products' quality. The consumers read messages online that help them decide on {{the identity of the}} superior product. We find a unique equilibrium where online word of mouth is persuasive despite the promotional chat activity by competing firms. In this equilibrium, firms spend more resources promoting inferior products, in striking contrast to existing advertising literature. In addition, we discuss consumer welfare implications and how other marketing strategies might interact with promotional chat. <b>advertising,</b> <b>word-of-mouth,</b> source credibility, Internet marketing...|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of online consumer communities to provide product reviews and advice has been touted as an important, albeit somewhat expensive component of Internet retail strategies. In this paper, we characterize reviewer behavior at two popular Internet sites {{and examine the}} effect of consumer reviews on firms' sales. We use publicly available data from the two leading online booksellers, Amazon. com and BarnesandNoble. com, to construct measures of each firm's sales of individual books. We also gather extensive consumer review data at the two sites. First, we characterize the reviewer behavior on the two sites such as the distribution of the number of ratings and the valence and length of ratings, as well as ratings across different subject categories. Second, we measure the effect of individual reviews on the relative shares of books across the two sites. We argue that our methodology of comparing the sales and reviews of a given book across Internet retailers allows us to improve on the existing literature by better capturing a causal relationship between word of mouth (reviews) and sales since we are able to difference out factors that affect the sales and word of mouth of both retailers, such as the book's quality. We examine the incremental sales effects of having reviews for a particular book versus not having reviews and also the differential sales effects of positive and negative reviews. Our large database of books also allows us to control for other important confounding factors such as differences across the sites in prices and shipping times. <b>Advertising,</b> <b>word-of-mouth,</b> source credibility, internet marketing...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} grant in 1971 funded {{a staff of}} five {{to work closely with}} the Hamilton-Wenham staff. The staff of PA in 1981 was six full-time staff and an additional ten Certified Trainers. Certified Trainers were encouraged by the NON as teachers who could teach training workshops nationally with the same fidelity as original staff but with more cost effectiveness. The staff of PA in early 1989 was thirty-seven full-time persons, with a National Certified Trainer staff of fifty which includes facilitators with expertise and practical experience in all workshop areas. The growth since separation has been continuous with an increase in revenue each year averaging over 30%. The sources of revenue are in the same categories as they were in 1981 (now they are called revenue centers): workshops and training, catalog sales, ropes course construction, and grants and contracts for research purposes. The organization continues to serve schools who want to expand an existing program or start a new one. The momentum of <b>word-of-mouth</b> <b>advertising</b> of the existing installed base of PA school programs remains strong.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo better {{understand}} and overcome difficulties with recruitment of adolescents with {{type 2 diabetes}} into clinical trials at three United States institutions, we reviewed recruitment and retention strategies in clinical trials of youth with various chronic conditions. We explored whether similar strategies might be applicable to pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes. MethodsWe compiled data on recruitment and retention of adolescents with type 2 diabetes at three centers (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas; and Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC) from January 2009 to December 2011. We also conducted a thorough literature review on recruitment and retention in adolescents with chronic health conditions. ResultsThe number of recruited patients was inadequate for timely completion of ongoing trials. Our review of recruitment strategies in adolescents included monetary and material incentives, technology-based <b>advertising,</b> <b>word-of-mouth</b> referral, and continuous patient–research team contact. Cellular or Internet technology appeared promising in improving participation among youths in studies of various chronic conditions and social behaviors. ConclusionsAdolescents with type 2 diabetes are particularly difficult to engage in clinical trials. Monetary incentives and use of technology do not represent “magic bullets,” but may presently {{be the most effective}} tools. Future studies should be conducted to explore motivation in this population. We speculate that (1) recruitment into interventional trials that address the main concerns of the affected youth (e. g., weight loss, body image, and stress management) combined with less tangible outcomes (e. g., blood glucose control) may be more successful; and (2) study participation and retention may be improved by accommodating patients' and caregivers' schedules, by scheduling study visits before and after working hours, and in more convenient locations than in medical facilities...|$|R
40|$|In a {{comprehensive}} survey of Indian Health Service (IHS) nurses, this study takes an {{in-depth look at}} those factors influencing recruitment and retention of registered nurses. Areas examined via questionnaire are: background of the respondents, circumstances surrounding entrance into IHS, current intentions with regard to employment with IHS, nurse's professional experience, community health nurse's professional environment, management, administration, supervision, comments regarding current IHS Nursing Recruitment Program, Indian preference policies of IHS, economic issues, security/safety issue, and living environment. The {{primary purpose of the}} study is to determine what factors influence nurses to either remain with or leave IHS, and what factors associated with both the living and work environments were perceived as satisfying or dissatisfying. It is anticipated that positive factors can be enhanced and that negative factors can be corrected insofar as possible. A questionnaire consisting of fifty-six items was administered to 1, 339 IHS nurses across all areas. This number represents a 79 % rate of return that is unusually high for a survey method. The survey was designed to profile registered nurses currently employed by IHS: who joins, who remains, who leaves, and the factors influencing those decisions. The questions were close-ended with space made available for more narrative responses. Effort was made to minimize time spent on response while maximizing analytical data available. The summary of findings is presented in nine sections. It should be noted, however, that the fifty-six questions covered a large range of professional issues. Additional qualification is presented in the main text of the study. IHS registered nurses are predominately female, married, 42 years of age and Caucasian. Twenty-nine percent are Native American, however, only 12 % of the Commissioned Officers are Native American. Fifty-three percent of the total had been employed in the public sector prior to joining IHS. The majority found their IHS positions through <b>word-of-mouth</b> rather than <b>advertising.</b> Thirty-two percent of the respondents graduated from a bachelors program and 25 % from an associate degree program. The top five positive factors influencing registered nurses to select employment with the IHS were: 1) type of work; 2) location of first assignment; 3) job security, 4) fringe benefits; 5) opportunity to learn about serving another ethnic, cultural or socioeconomic groups. Respondents were satisfied with many aspects of their professional work experience. Of the factors presented as potentially influencing a decision to remain with or leave IHS, the five factors associated with professional aspects of the nurse's job that are influencing the most nurses to remain with the IHS are: geographic location of present assignment; quality of nursing staff; learning about and serving another ethnic, cultural or socioeconomic group; ability to provide quality care with available staff; and ability to provide quality care with available equipment and supplies. The five factors associated with professional aspects of the nurse's job that are influencing them to leave the IHS are: equality of opportunity for advancement; training and career development opportunities; professional recognition and status; available support for in-service/continuing education; and requirement to perform nursing tasks under-utilizing skills and knowledge. The IHS management should make an effort to improve the following areas if improvement in the retention of registered nurses is to be achieved: improve work place security; service unit management that values the input of the nursing staff; recognition and rewards for deserving nursing employees; improvement in the accessibility of continuing education to improve and maintain nursing skills; more attention to the equality of opportunity for career advancement; improve the quality of supervision; provide staffing levels that eliminate the need for nurses to maintain heavy workloads and perform non-nursing functions; and attention to nurse's preferred work shift/work hours. Some of the solutions to the problems should be developed on a national level, some at the Area or Service Unit level and some should be developed and geared toward specialties such as Inpatient Nurses, Outpatient Nurses, Community Health Nurses, Nurse Specialists, etc...|$|R
