40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} impact {{of different types of}} critical thinking instruction and dispositions on bias in economics students' (N= 141) reasoning performance. The following conditions were compared: (A) implicit instruction; (B) implicit <b>instruction</b> <b>with</b> practice; (C) implicit <b>instruction</b> <b>with</b> explicit <b>instruction</b> and practice; (D) implicit <b>instruction</b> <b>with</b> explicit <b>instruction,</b> practice, and self-explanation prompts; and (E) implicit <b>instruction</b> <b>with</b> explicit <b>instruction,</b> practice, and activation prompts. Results showed that explicit <b>instruction</b> combined <b>with</b> practice is required to improve critical thinking (i. e., conditions A/B<C/D/E). Prompting during practice had no added performance benefits. Participants' dispositions toward actively open-minded thinking predicted their pre-test and post-test scores but did not interact <b>with</b> <b>instruction</b> condition, suggesting that receiving explicit <b>instruction</b> combined <b>with</b> practice was equally effective for all students. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze {{the use of}} {{perspective}} expressions in Japanese written narratives by three groups (JSL students <b>with</b> <b>instruction</b> {{on the use of}} Japanese perspective expressions, JSL students without this instruction, and native speakers), and the effect of instruction on perspective expressions on students? narratives. The subject chains in narratives by students <b>with</b> <b>instruction</b> were more coherent than those by students without instruction. This suggests that instruction is effective. However, students <b>with</b> <b>instruction</b> seemed to overapply what they learned, sometimes using an excessive number of passive clauses as compared to native speakers. There was little difference in the use of giving and receiving expressions between the students <b>with</b> and without <b>instruction.</b> Results showed the necessity for teaching students the proper use of passive forms and receiving expressions such as V-te morau in context...|$|R

5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time <b>with</b> <b>instructions</b> that he {{should not be allowed to}} live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E

The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets <b>with</b> <b>instructions</b> intended for children aged 10–14. His father taught him to play chess {{at the age of}} 5, although he initially showed little interest in the game.

5|$|During this period, Albin was {{involved}} in a political controversy regarding succession to an earldom. An alleged papal bull, dated 13 December 1255, had named Bishop Albin as a papal mandatory, along with Robert de Stuteville, <b>with</b> <b>instructions</b> to investigate Alan Durward's claim to the earldom of Mar; however, the bull was denounced as a forgery on 28 March 1257, after Durward's rivals had seized power.

5|$|Even {{before the}} French {{garrison}} on Île Bonaparte had surrendered, Rowley {{had turned his}} attention eastwards to Isle de France. The British commander had decided {{that the best way}} to eliminate the threat of Hamelin's squadron was to blockade the island's principal ports by seizing the coral islands that marked the entrances to the harbours through the complicated coral reefs that surrounded Isle de France. These islands were fortified, and once in British hands could prevent French ships leaving or entering the harbours, effectively containing Hamelin's ships until Rowley was ready to launch an invasion. Detailed to lead this campaign was Captain Samuel Pym in Sirius and Willoughby in Nereide, <b>with</b> <b>instructions</b> to begin by seizing Île de la Passe at the entrance to the harbour of Grand Port on the south-eastern coast of Isle de France.|$|E
5|$|For his String Quartet, Lutosławski had {{produced}} only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind {{them in a}} full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, {{as is the case}} with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called mobiles), <b>with</b> <b>instructions</b> on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.|$|E
