500|$|After Mother 3, Shigesato Itoi {{declared}} that he {{was done with the}} series. In response to Nintendo's seeming indifference to another Mother sequel, fans began to develop their own entry, Mother 4, in October 2010. As of September 2016, the Mother 4 development team had not received a cease and desist letter from Nintendo. In a preview of the game, Jason Schreier of Kotaku said Mother 4 looked [...] "stunning", as [...] "everything you could possibly <b>want</b> <b>out</b> of a new Mother game", from the music to the environment design. The fan-made game was planned for release in 2014 but has been delayed twice. No future release date has been set. Mother 4 will be playable as a standalone game, without need for an emulator. In March 2017, however, the team announced that as a preventative measure from getting taken down, the game would be rebranded, with 'Mother 4' no longer being the title of the game, and all direct references to the Mother series, like Mr. Saturn, removed. The decision came after many recent fan games received a DMCA notice.|$|E

LucasArts spent six months developing the story. Lucas spent hours discussing with the developers the relationship between Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine and provided feedback on what Vader would <b>want</b> <b>out</b> of and how he would motivate an apprentice. Lucas Licensing reviewed many game details to ensure they fit into canon. Focus group feedback indicated that, while hunting down Jedi at Vader's order would be fun, the character should be redeemed, in keeping with a major Star Wars motif. Although the game introduces new characters, developers felt the presence of characters already part of Star Wars would help anchor the game within the official continuity. Before the game's release, Lucasfilm claimed it would [...] "unveil new revelations about the Star Wars galaxy" [...] with a [...] "redemption" [...] motif. The story progresses {{through a combination of}} scripted events, in-game cinematics, cutscenes, and dialogue.|$|E

He also went on to call Jonze [...] "a visionary". Richard Corliss of Time applauded Phoenix's performance, comparing his role to Sandra Bullock's in Gravity and Robert Redford's in All Is Lost: [...] "Phoenix must communicate his movie's meaning and feelings virtually on his own. That he does, with subtle grace and depth. [...] Phoenix shows us what it's like when a mourning heart comes alive—because he loves Her." [...] Corliss cited HAL 9000 and S1m0ne as cinematic predecessors to Her and praised Johansson, calling her performance [...] "seductive and winning". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "a probing, inquisitive work of a very high order", although he expressed disappointment that the ending is more conventional {{than the rest of the}} film. McCarthy examined the premise of the story and suggested that the film's central virtual relationship was better than Ryan Gosling's character's relationship with a sex doll in Lars and the Real Girl. McCarthy compares the [...] "tender" [...] and [...] "vulnerable" [...] performance of Phoenix to his [...] "fearsome" [...] performance in The Master. He also praised Jonze's writing for its insights into what people <b>want</b> <b>out</b> of love and relationships, as well as the acting performances that [...] " [...] it all feel spontaneous and urgent".|$|E

By the end of August 2010, the number of players on the global leaderboard grew to 371,000, exceeding the number of players of other Summer of Arcade games released in 2009, and approaching the number of lifetime players of Braid, released two years earlier. Langley, who had expected Limbo sales to fall [...] "due {{to the lack of}} repeatable content and being a strictly single player experience", considered that these figures had [...] "beaten everyone’s expectations". Phil Spencer, the Vice-President of Microsoft Game Studios, stated in September 2010 that Limbo was [...] "our number one Summer of Arcade game by a long stretch", and further posed that Limbo represents a shift in the type of game that gamers <b>want</b> <b>out</b> of online on-demand game services; [...] "it's becoming less about iconic [...] that people know and it's becoming more diverse". Limbo was the third-highest selling Xbox Live Arcade title in 2010, selling 527,000 and generating about $7.5 million in revenue. In March 2011, Microsoft listed Limbo as the 11th-highest selling game to date on Xbox Live. Playdead stated that more than two million users on the Xbox 360 service played through the demo within the year of the game's release.|$|E
