The development of Magnetic Induction Tomography (MIT) in recent years made MIT a potential method for Non Destructive Test (NDT) to be applied in industries. We performed an MIT inspection technique to detect flaw using 2 -coils MIT planar sensor that consist of transmitter and receiver coils which is able to detect flaw based on different electrical conductivity and measured as phase shift. This study involved experiment method with measurement of welded steel in two areas, there are normal and defective <b>welded</b> <b>areas</b> which amounts to 72 measurement points conducted with superposition principle. Then simulation of 2 -coils planar sensor was done using Finite Element Method (FEM) software to obtain magnetic field sensitivity using parameter as in the experiment. Results from this measurement showed that phase value in normal <b>welded</b> <b>area</b> is higher than defective <b>welded</b> <b>area,</b> then those data are processed further on reconstruction step by using specific algorithm to obtain reconstructed image.

The development is based on CNC milling machine using FSW tool that been machined. Aluminium Alloy 5083 was used as workpiece sample while mild steel was selected as the material for the tool. The experiments are based on selected welding conditions such as feed speed, tool rotation speed, plunge depth and tool design. Some of the parameter was set to a certain value, thus leaving 3 parameters with different value. For analyzation, feed speed and tool rotation was concentrated to study which parameter is the best based on analysis, either the combination of 10, 15 and 20 mm/min feed speed and tool rotation of 1000, 1500 and 2000 rpm.
