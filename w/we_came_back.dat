500|$|The graphic emblem most {{associated}} with the straight edge movement is a black [...] "X", typically drawn on the wearer's hands with a marker. According to MacKaye, [...] "We were in San Francisco, and we played a place called Mabuhay Gardens. They figured out we were underage, and they wouldn't let us play. We worked out a deal with their management that {{we just wanted to}} play and we weren't going to drink, so they got a marker and put a big 'X' on our hand, So <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to Washington D.C. and went to this nightclub, the 9:30, and said 'Hey look, we're not going to drink and we will put this 'X' on our hand. If you see us drinking you can throw us out forever. We are not going to drink, we just came to see the music'". The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol [...] "wasn't supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth".|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E

He replied cheerfully that, if <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> safely, no one would say anything, and if we didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing our arrival, and set off on our own.|$|E

[...] "Guys have trouble committing and women want us to commit," [...] he explained to authors Adam White and Fred Bronson. [...] "Women want us to admit that we don't want to commit." [...] Troutman took the idea and began working on a track similar in style to [...] "Computer Love," [...] a 1986 hit for his band Zapp. [...] "I was playing in Dallas and [...] flew out.

2500|$|The band {{themselves}} {{were far from}} happy with the album and upon its release, were vocal in press interviews about their dissatisfaction. [...] Even two years later, Clarence White complained to journalist Pete Frame that [...] "Terry Melcher put strings on while {{we were on the}} road, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> and we didn't even recognize it as our own album." [...] Gene Parsons disowned the album completely, describing it as [...] "Melcher's folly" [...] and commenting in interviews that the band were all appalled by what they heard when they returned from touring. [...] McGuinn actually defended Melcher somewhat by indicating {{in an interview with the}} English journalist Keith Altham that the album had been taken away from the producer at the last minute and given to an engineer in San Francisco to remix. [...] However, the production credits on the original LP sleeve do not support McGuinn's claim and Melcher later stated that he had no recollection of the album being mixed by anyone other than himself. [...] In more recent years, McGuinn has conceded to journalist David Fricke that the album's shortcomings were not down to Melcher's over-production alone: [...] "We were just idling artistically, the album sounds like we really weren't concentrating on doing good work, good art." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band began 1983 {{by playing}} the MTV New Year's Eve Rock 'n' Roll Ball with [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] still {{climbing}} the charts in the US, and the American reissue of the [...] "Rio" [...] single {{to follow in}} March. To satisfy America's appetite for their music, the band re-released their eponymous first album in the US {{in the middle of}} the year with the addition of the new single [...] "Is There Something I Should Know?". Upon its release, this song entered the chart at number 1 in the UK (a rarity then and their first chart-topper in their home country) and reached number 4 on the American charts. During the promotion of this album, Rhodes and Le Bon were MTV guest VJs for a show, during which artist and admirer Andy Warhol dropped by to greet them. [...] "Our first gigs in the United States were crazy and culty", Rhodes said later, [...] "But when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> after 'Hungry' was a hit, it was mayhem. It was Beatlemania. We were doing a signing of the 'Girls on Film' video at a store in Times Square. We couldn't get out of the store. The cops sealed off the streets." [...] Also in 1983, keyboardist Nick Rhodes produced the UK number 1 and US number 5 hit [...] "Too Shy" [...] for the English band Kajagoogoo and Andy Taylor became the first member of Duran Duran to get married.|$|E
2500|$|Firing and {{fighting}} began April 14 between Moslems and Armenians, {{which resulted in}} a number of casualties on both sides... the next morning April 15, a fresh outburst of smoke near the girls' school showed that we were threatened by fire...Mr. Maurer and I took a crowbar and an axe to the destroy the wooden porches, shutters and stairways of the houses between the fires and the girls' school...When I first climbed to the roofs near the flames armed Moslems appeared...When they understood that I was not firing on them, but had come to work against the flames, they lowered their rifles and assured me with many pledges that I might go unmolested...we repeatedly begged some Armenian young men who were lurking around the street corners shielded from the Moslem fire to put away their arms and come and save the school building... <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to the school and asked for volunteers, Mr. Rogers came at once... We had thus worked a considerable time without being harmed by the Moslems when the Armenians {{on the other end of}} the street commenced firing on the houses where the looters were at work. Suddenly two shots rang out not more than eight yards from where we were working. Mr. Rogers...was mortally wounded...The other bullet hit Mr. Maurer...Immediately after these two shots several other bullets from the Moslems, who had fired them, whizzed past me...Both men passed peacefully away.

2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the album shifted when Maida traveled to Sudan and Darfur to shoot a documentary with War Child {{in the middle of}} recording. [...] "We were there for a couple of weeks, and <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from that and went right back into the studio, and it was like: 'God, this song sucks. I’m not saying that anymore.' You start reflecting on lyrics and any message you’re trying to get out there, and it really altered everything again." [...] The band recorded in six-week spurts, traveling between studios in Toronto, Los Angeles and Maui, recording more songs. With no deadline from the record company, they kept recording and gaining more perspective. [...] "We'd get together, write, record, take two weeks off, go back in and we ended up doing that on and off for the last two-and-a-half or three years," [...] By this time, over forty songs were recorded including [...] "Picture", [...] "Don't Ask Why" [...] (Where Are You), [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] (Angels/Losing/Sleep) and [...] "Vampires", which was briefly considered for the album's title. The sessions became strained at times as the band couldn't figure out where the album was going. [...] "We had so many songs," [...] said Taggart, [...] "and we just started to go crazy." [...] Many songs went through multiple incarnations such as [...] "Boy", which caused the band a lot of stress and took over three weeks to break down and re-record. They were also butting heads with their producer. [...] "There were some fucking horrible sessions," [...] Maida admitted.|$|E
2500|$|Irons {{performed}} {{with other members}} of Pearl Jam on Neil Young's 1995 album, Mirror Ball, and subsequently toured Europe as part of Young's backing band. With Irons, the band recorded its fourth studio album, No Code, released in 1996, for which Irons also toured. The band subsequently released Yield in 1998. [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] (from Yield) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. As a member of Pearl Jam, Irons brought a unique drumming style to the band, particularly in the way he played his fills and with his use of a trash can lid as a cymbal. Irons co-wrote the music for the No Code songs [...] "Who You Are", [...] "In My Tree", [...] "Red Mosquito", and [...] "I'm Open". He also wrote and sang on the Pearl Jam songs [...] "Happy When I'm Crying" [...] (from the 1997 fan club Christmas single), [...] "●" [...] (from Yield), and [...] "Whale Song" [...] (from the 1999 Music for Our Mother Ocean Vol. 3 compilation). He played with Pearl Jam through March 20, 1998. In 1998, prior to Pearl Jam's U.S. Yield Tour, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> Jack wasn't in a position to carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] Vedder said, [...] "I think that him deciding that he wasn't {{going to be in the}} band really hurt." [...] Coincidentally, Matt Cameron, from Soundgarden, replaced him again as he did four years prior on Eleven's Thunk.|$|E

Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old man {{said he did not know}} if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the old man, said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I made a noise it would not be well for me. I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E

2500|$|For The Veronicas, Jessica and Lisa {{wanted to}} create a [...] "progressive pop" [...] album drawing on {{inspiration}} from genres such as blues, trip hop, rock and roll, grunge, classical music, classical rock, pop and rap. Wanting to make an album which differed from their more familiar pop rock sound, Lisa said that this album would be [...] "eclectic" [...] and not [...] "predictable in any way." [...] Lisa said [...] "We go from something like “Sanctified,” which, to be honest, wasn’t written with the idea of being a Veronicas track. That was very much written when I was in Nashville and I was immersing myself in the blues and roots-y, swampy soul singing. Then we were working with Billy Corgan we did a “fuck you” kind of track “Did You Miss Me,” which we rap on, which is a completely different thing. We get poppy with “Cold,” and bring it back to an acoustic song like “You and Me” which could be considered a little bit folk-y, country" [...] " [...] Lisa said [...] "I remember we really got into trip hop and decided we were going to make a trip hop album. I then got on a bluesy-rock-swampy-soul kick after we'd spent some time in Nashville. Eventually <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> around to songs like Cruel – the stuff people identify with The Veronicas." [...] In an interview with Stephanie Anderson of BuzzFeed, the duo elaborated on the change from their first two albums, with Jessica saying: [...] "If things were one dimensional on the first and second record, like, we would say exactly how we felt, and it was all just, total passion, we really didn’t overthink it, we just put down what we were feeling, [...] is more, 3D-4D...
