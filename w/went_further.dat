5|$|May 28–30– Tropical Storm Beryl made {{landfall}} in Jacksonville Beach, Florida with {{winds of}} 70mph (110km/h). However, as it <b>went</b> <b>further</b> inland, the storm weakened into a tropical depression, but still bringing heavy rain to Florida, the Alabama border, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The storm killed one person indirectly, {{due to a}} car accident.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{preserve}} Episcopalian control of the Kirk, the Scottish Bishops backed a proposal for Union between England and Scotland but this was dropped due to opposition by the English Parliament. On 11th April, with only five dissenting votes, the Convention declared James' reign in Scotland ended and adopted the Claim of Right Act and the Articles of Grievances. The result {{was consistent with the}} English Bill of Rights in making Parliament the primary legislative power in Scotland but then <b>went</b> <b>further</b> by reinstating Presbyterian control of the Kirk.|$|E

5|$|Richard now had {{no choice}} but to comply with the appellants' demands; Brembre and Tresilian were {{condemned}} and executed, while de Vere and de la Polewho had by now also left the countrywere sentenced to death in absentia at the Merciless Parliament in February 1388. The proceedings <b>went</b> <b>further,</b> and a number of Richard's chamber knights were also executed, among these Burley. The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the king.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{interest}} in pantheism was whetted by the folkloristic studies of Alexander Afanasyev. That author's standard work, The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs, became Rimsky-Korsakov's pantheistic bible. The composer first applied Afanasyev's ideas in May Night, {{in which he}} helped fill out Gogol's story by using folk dances and calendar songs. He <b>went</b> <b>further</b> down this path in The Snow Maiden, where he made extensive use of seasonal calendar songs and khorovodi (ceremonial dances) in the folk tradition.|$|E
5|$|The French {{zoologist}} Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire {{showed in}} 1818 in his theorie d'analogue ("theory of homologues") that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. When Geoffroy <b>went</b> <b>further</b> and sought homologies between Georges Cuvier's embranchements, such as vertebrates and molluscs, his claims triggered the 1830 Cuvier-Geoffroy debate. Geoffroy stated {{the principle of}} connections, namely that {{what is important is}} the relative position of different structures and their connections to each other.|$|E

5|$|The Second World War devastated {{much of the}} East End, {{with its}} docks, {{railways}} and industry forming a continual target for bombing, especially during the Blitz, leading to dispersal of the population to new suburbs and new housing being built in the 1950s. Many East Enders <b>went</b> <b>further</b> than the eastern suburbs, leaving London altogether, notably to the Essex new towns of Basildon and Harlow {{and a number of}} expanded towns in south Essex and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Judenrats {{has been}} controversial. Both Raul Hilberg and Hannah Arendt, early historians of the Holocaust, argued that {{without the help of}} the Judenrats, the Germans would have been {{hampered}} in their extermination efforts. Arendt <b>went</b> <b>further</b> and condemned those Jews who served as leaders in the ghettos for helping destroy their own people. More recent historians have recognized that the situation facing the Jewish leaders was more complex – they faced conflicting sets of goals and had essentially no power to change the demands the Germans made of them.|$|E
5|$|Two of the judges, Justice Deane and Justice Gaudron, <b>went</b> <b>further</b> and {{suggested}} {{that the right to}} representation in some circumstances is founded in the Constitution. They said that Chapter Three of the Constitution, which represents the Judicature with the notion of separation of powers, and vests judicial power exclusively in the courts, requires that judicial process and fairness be observed.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to bribe his way free of his guards, Rupert was imprisoned in Linz. Lord Craven, also taken in the battle, {{attempted}} to persuade his captors {{to allow him to}} remain with Rupert, but was refused. Rupert's imprisonment was surrounded by religious overtones. His mother was deeply concerned that he might be converted from Calvinism to Catholicism; his captors, encouraged by Emperor Ferdinand III, deployed Jesuit priests in an attempt to convert him. The Emperor <b>went</b> <b>further,</b> proffering the option of freedom, a position as an Imperial general and a small principality if Rupert would convert. Rupert refused.|$|E
5|$|An early road {{following}} the current path {{was established in}} the late 19th century for miners and loggers. As floods ravaged the road along Bear Creek through the early 20th century, measures were taken to prevent further damage. Other sites along Bear Creek, such as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in Red Rocks Park and the Bear Creek Canyon Scenic Mountain Drive, as the section between Idledale and Morrison is called, have given the route a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. An early designation of the route number <b>went</b> <b>further</b> west than its current-day designation; that section was truncated by the late 1930s. Another eastern segment was added from Morrison east toward Denver in the 1940s, but that section too was removed. Newer improvements to the road include widening the Evergreen Parkway segment to four lanes and constructing an interchange with I-70.|$|E
5|$|Antigonus, who {{had brought}} with him a large force of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through Euboea towards the Peloponnese. The hostile Aetolian League occupying parts of Thessaly had threatened to oppose him if he <b>went</b> <b>further</b> south than Thermopylae, despite their neutrality {{at that point in}} the war. Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus. He chose this location to avoid facing the Macedonian phalanx head-on.|$|E

5|$|Caused {{in part by}} a drought, the Russian famine of 1921 was {{the most}} severe that the country had {{experienced}} since that of 1891, resulting in around five million deaths. The famine was exacerbated by government requisitioning, as well as the export of large quantities of Russian grain. To aid the famine victims, the US government established an American Relief Administration to distribute food; Lenin was suspicious of this aid and had it closely monitored. During the famine, Patriarch Tikhon called on Orthodox churches to sell unnecessary items to help feed the starving, an action endorsed by the government. In February 1922 Sovnarkom <b>went</b> <b>further</b> by calling on all valuables belonging to religious institutions to be forcibly appropriated and sold. Tikhon opposed the sale of items used within the Eucharist and many clergy resisted the appropriations, resulting in violence.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{defeated}} Feliciano López {{before losing}} to eventual semifinalist Mardy Fish {{in the second}} round of the indoor Regions Morgan Keegan Championships. In his next ATP Masters event, he reached the second round of the Pacific Life Open, beating Gustavo Kuerten in the first round, but then losing to Richard Gasquet. Del Potro <b>went</b> <b>further</b> in the Sony Ericsson Open, reaching the fourth round, after he defeated three top-50 players: Jonas Björkman, Marcos Baghdatis, and Mikhail Youzhny, before falling to Rafael Nadal in two sets. In May, he lost in the first round of the French Open to eventual champion Nadal.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the question again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals of the mystery cults. Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, <b>went</b> <b>further</b> by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.|$|E

5|$|In 1886 {{a colonel}} renowned {{for lack of}} {{discipline}} published newspaper articles criticizing the Minister of War, an act of insubordination forbidden by law. Instead of being punished, the colonel was supported by his commander, Field Marshal (nowadays Divisional General) Deodoro da Fonseca. The minister, {{as well as the}} conservative cabinet headed by João Maurício Wanderley, decided not to penalize the colonel in an attempt to quiet dissention. However, the cabinet <b>went</b> <b>further</b> and removed any constraint on military officers broadcasting their views. In consequence of this policy, subordinates were thenceforth able to publicly criticize their superiors, thus undermining both military and political authority, including that of the cabinet itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} Keynesian models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on empirical relationships between variables are unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique <b>went</b> <b>further</b> {{and argued that}} a policy's impact is determined by how the policy alters the expectations of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate to policy. New classical economists argued that abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships.|$|E
5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court <b>went</b> <b>further</b> than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
