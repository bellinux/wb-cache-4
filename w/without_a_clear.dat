5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly {{seen as a}} threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of the architects of the modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> resolution.|$|E
5|$|Gravity Bone is a first-person {{adventure}} {{video game}} that lasts around 20 minutes, and {{is set in}} the fictional city of Nuevos Aires. The player controls an unnamed spy, and is tasked with accomplishing several missions across the game's two stages. At the end of the game, the player-controlled spy is killed by an unknown woman after chasing her through {{the last half of the}} second level. The game was designed to leave the player <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> idea of how the game's story evolves.|$|E
5|$|The tribe {{sued the}} United States for {{compensation}} in the US Court of Claims, which ruled that tribal members still had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and that Congress had not abrogated the rights. The opposite rulings {{by the state and}} federal courts brought the issue to the Supreme Court. In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> and unequivocal statement by Congress removing the rights.|$|E

50|$|Navone, {{who is an}} American, {{said the}} {{findings}} (of the Pew survey) were meaningless <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> definition of religion, and he strongly contested the suggestion that Italian people were not spiritual. Going to Mass every Sunday might be an indication of religious faith, but was not a proof of it, he said. “All the problems that Jesus had were with religious people,” Navone added. According to the time, the Scribes and Pharisees had religion, and Jesus didn’t at all.|$|R
40|$|As {{riparian}} governments advoate freer {{trade and}} develop physical infrastructure, trade networks, including for aquatic living animals, trade will likely {{become more efficient}} through largers investment by fewer traders. Whether this trade efficiency and economic growth are accompanied with a progressive distributional change, among farmers and fishers, is currently under debate. <b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> policy agenda that reflects the diversity and social nature of fish trade relations at the local levels, the ability of fishers, farmers, and traders to secure their food and income may be compromised...|$|R
5|$|The wing was {{established}} to provide fighter protection for an Allied offensive from Darwin in northern Australia into the eastern Netherlands East Indies (NEI). This operation was effectively cancelled in June 1944, however, leaving No.80 Wing <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> mission. The unit remained at Darwin until it moved to Morotai in the NEI between December 1944 and March 1945. Due to {{the small number of}} Japanese aircraft remaining in this area the Wing's aircraft were mainly used in the ground attack role. From May 1945 {{to the end of the}} war two of No.80 Wing's squadrons participated in the Borneo Campaign.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1911, a year before he was due to leave the school, Heseltine had tired of life at Eton. <b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> plan for his future, he asked his mother if he could live abroad for a while. His mother wanted {{him to go to}} university, and then either into the City or the Civil Service, but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his {{education}} later. In October 1911 he proceeded to Cologne to learn German and to study piano at the conservatory. In Cologne Heseltine produced his first few songs which, like all his earliest works, were highly imitative of Delius. The piano studies went poorly, although Heseltine expanded his musical experiences by attending concerts and operas. He also experimented with general journalism, publishing an article in Railway and Travel Monthly on the subject of a disused Welsh branch line.|$|E
5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> mission, and its pilots were left {{with nothing to do}} other than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop if it was not either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E

5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe and the Liberals were {{deflated}} by {{the outcome}} of the October 1974 election. Wilson's majority, albeit slim, denied Thorpe the role of kingmaker, leaving the Liberals <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> role; as Dutton observes, apart from being neither Conservative or Labour, the Liberals lacked a distinctive identity and their policies were largely unknown to the public. A further problem for the party was the divergence between its activists, who were radicals well {{to the left of the}} official party, and a large section of its recent supporters who were disgruntled Conservatives. Thorpe, whose personal majority in North Devon had fallen to under 7,000 in October, confided to an associate that, unless the party were soon to make a significant impact, his days as leader might be numbered.|$|E
5|$|Wells {{had survived}} {{the death of his}} first wife and all four of his brothers; he also had no children, leaving him <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> heir. His estate was further {{complicated}} by his lack of a will. Accordingly, under New York law at the time, his holdings were divided among his widow, fifteen nephews and one grand nephew. They decided to subdivide and sell the property, and within a few years more buildings had gone up, {{just in time for the}} construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1848, which laid its track on a causeway right across the river's mouth. Over the next several decades, as Yonkers' population grew rapidly, leading it to incorporate as a village and then, in 1872, a city, the rest of the estuary was filled in and narrowed and the bluffs on its south side graded out of existence.|$|E
40|$|<b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> {{understanding}} {{of the range of}} suburban typologies which presently exists and of the relationship between typology and travel behaviour {{it will be difficult to}} progress towards the development of appropriate strategies to reduce unnecessary travel by car. With this in mind it is valuable to develop a framework for a better representation of different suburban typologies and to examine the way in which personal mobility varies across these typologies. Five cities in the United Kingdom - Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leicester, Oxford and Sheffield - are examined in order to identify and characterize suburban typologies, and data from different surveys are used to analyse differences in travel to work journeys...|$|R

5|$|Archaeopteryx was {{the first}} fossil found that {{revealed}} a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds. It is considered a transitional fossil, in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal The Origin of Species, its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for Compsognathus. Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the lagerstätte of the Yixian Formation, Liaoning, northeastern China, {{which was part of}} an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E
5|$|One {{significant}} factor in the decline was the rise of grunge music from Seattle, with bands including Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. This was particularly obvious after the success of Nirvana's Nevermind (1991), which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a dirty sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback, along with darker lyrical themes, a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style and performance. Many major labels felt they had been caught off-guard by the surprise success of grunge and began turning over their personnel in favor of younger staffers more versed in the new scene. As MTV shifted its attention to the new style, glam metal bands found themselves relegated increasingly to late night airplay, and Headbanger's Ball was cancelled {{at the end of}} 1994, while KNAC went over to Spanish programming. Given glam metal's lack of a major format presence on radio, bands were left <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> way to reach their audience. Other (earlier Hollywood) alternative rock bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jane's Addiction also helped supplant the popularity of the genre.|$|E

5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E
