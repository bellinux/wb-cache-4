5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 {{people were killed in}} an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|Charles X of Sweden had {{concluded}} the earlier war with Denmark with a stunning victory by succeeding in the bold March across the Belts. Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} into a humiliating peace in the Treaty of Roskilde in which Denmark had to cede Scania, Halland and Blekinge on the Scandinavian Peninsula and the island of Bornholm, and Norway lost the provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag. Europe <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> quick victory, and Charles proudly publicized his accomplishments. However, peace meant new problems. In the peace treaty of Roskilde, Denmark was obliged to supply the Swedish army with provisions until May 1658, but soon thereafter the army {{would need to be}} moved. The Swedish king knew that the army {{would not be able to}} be supplied in Sweden for long, and disbanding it was not desirable with the Poles eager to revenge the 1655 invasion of Poland. Sweden was not in want of enemies to attack: campaigns in Livonia and Estonia were considered, but were rejected due to supply problems. The Swedish King maintained that his main goal was to invade Royal Prussia, but he also wanted to punish Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia. The many enemies in continental Europe, among them Poland and a hostile Dutch would make this a difficult endeavor however. A new attack on Prussia would also see little international support, France was already urging peace. The surprising Swedish solution to this dilemma would be to return to Denmark in an attempt to finish the job.|$|E

25|$|The Redskins {{opened up}} the scoring with an 8-play, 78-yard drive that culminated in Rypien's 31-yard {{touchdown}} completion to receiver Art Monk. San Francisco struck back by driving 74 yards in eight plays {{to tie the game}} on a 1-yard touchdown run by fullback Tom Rathman. A key play of the drive was an unnecessary roughness call against Redskins defensive back Darrell Green for throwing Jerry Rice to the ground during a tackle, turning Rice's reception into a 25-yard gain. Green <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> penalty, stating he didn't realize the call was against him until {{he made his way to}} the sidelines. Near the end of the quarter, Redskins kicker Chip Lohmiller made a 44-yard field goal that put Washington back in front at 10-7.|$|E
25|$|As {{the eighth}} seed at the Taiwan Open, Janković <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> always-dangerous Kurumi Nara {{in the first}} round, despite having taken the first set. Jelena found herself needing {{to qualify for the}} main draw at the Qatar Total Open, and she did so, albeit in not the most {{straight}} forward of manners. She defeated Tsvetana Pironkova in the final round to advance, where she lost to an in-form Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. She and doubles partner, Chuang Chia-jung were defeated in a match tiebreak by 4th seeds and eventual champions Abigail Spears and Katarina Srebotnik. In Dubai the next week, Janković was handed a lop-sided defeat in the first round by resurgent German wildcard and recent Australian Open fourth-rounder Mona Barthel, against whom Janković had struggled in the past. Jelena and doubles partner Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova exited the first round by way of defeat at the hands of Andreja Klepač and María José Martínez Sánchez.|$|E

25|$|With {{the help}} of Motown sales {{executive}} Barney Ales, Harry Balk got the song released to record stores, sending 100,000 copies of the song without Gordy's knowledge, on January 17, 1971, with another 100,000 copies sent after that success. Upon its release, the song became a hit and was Motown's fastest-selling single at the time, peaking at number 1 on the Hot Soul Singles Chart, and peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Gordy <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news and drove to Gaye's home to discuss him making a complete album, stating Gaye could {{do what he wanted}} with his music if he finished the record within 30 days before the end of March and thus effectively giving him the right to produce his own albums. Gaye returned to Hitsville to record the rest of What's Going On, which took a mere ten business days between March 1 and March 10. The album's rhythm tracks and sound overdubs were recorded at Hitsville, or Studio A, while the strings, horns, lead and background vocals were recorded at Golden World, or Studio B.|$|E

They fought about the issue constantly; he complained that she was becoming a [...] "loose" [...] woman, and she insisted that she would marry for love alone. At the corset shop, she was forced to fend off unwelcome advances from Russian officers and other men. One persistent suitor took her into a hotel room and committed what Goldman called [...] "violent contact"; two biographers call it rape. She <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> experience, overcome by [...] "shock at the discovery that the contact between man and woman could be so brutal and painful."

500|$|At {{the end of}} the night, {{the four}} Beatles and some of their guests overdubbed an {{extended}} humming sound to close the song – an idea that they later discarded. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, the tapes from this 10 February orchestral session reveal the guests breaking into loud applause following the second orchestral passage. Among the EMI staff attending the event, one recalled how Ron Richards, the Hollies' producer, <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> music he had heard; in Lewisohn's description, Richards [...] " [...] with his head in his hands, saying 'I just can't believe it … I give up.'" [...] Martin later offered his own opinion of the orchestral session: [...] "part of me said 'We're being a bit self-indulgent here.' The other part of me said 'It's bloody marvellous!'" ...|$|E

500|$|Frank Kameny soon {{realized}} the pivotal change {{brought by the}} Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, {{he was used to}} persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government. Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, [...] "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred." ...|$|E

2500|$|Truman <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> decision, {{which he}} {{continued}} to attack years later in his Memoirs.

2500|$|Collins {{says she}} drew {{inspiration}} for the series from both classical and contemporary sources. Her main classical source of inspiration is the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, in which, as a punishment for past crimes, Minos forces Athens to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to the Minotaur, which kills them in a vast labyrinth. Collins says that even as a child, she <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> idea since [...] "it was just so cruel" [...] to force Athens to sacrifice its own children.|$|E

Ava had to send an army in 1387−88 to restore order. The situation remained tense until 1389/90 when Ava and Maw agreed to a truce. King Tho Ngan Bwa of Maw sent his daughter Shin Mi-Nauk to Ava in a marriage of state to Swa's second eldest son Minkhaung.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996 {{the city}} <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> murder-robbery of a popular, young white {{musician}} {{in a parking}} lot after his performance.
