5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the side of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, but many of the peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann patiently {{waited for}} the right moment to escape, then, using the {{distraction}} of the Stukas attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann jumped {{out of the back of}} the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E

5|$|Ohio's {{governor}} had {{relatively little}} power—for example, he could recommend legislation, but not veto it—but with Ohio a key swing state, its governor {{was a major}} figure in national politics. Although McKinley believed that {{the health of the}} nation depended on that of business, he was evenhanded in dealing with labor. He procured legislation that set up an arbitration board to settle work disputes and obtained passage of a law that fined employers <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> workers for belonging to a union.|$|E
5|$|The Indians rehired Peckinpaugh {{as their}} manager in 1941, signing {{him to a}} two-year contract; team {{president}} Alva Bradley, <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> Peckinpaugh in 1933, promised Peckinpaugh full cooperation and minimal interference. After the 1941 season, {{he was promoted to}} vice president, later serving as Cleveland's general manager (GM) and president.

5|$|Three {{mainstream}} narratives emerged {{after the}} shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire {{had killed the}} boy developed into the position that, because of the trajectory of the shots, Palestinian gunfire {{was more likely to}} have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and , a former France2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by Arlette Chabot, France 2's news editor, is that no one can know <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> the shots.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus {{at the center of the}} atom. Rutherford compared his findings to one firing a 15-inch shell at a sheet of tissue paper and it coming back to hit the person <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> it.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Lazcano Lazcano sent Treviño Morales to kill rival {{drug traffickers}} and {{take control of}} the drug {{trafficking}} routes in Guatemala. Reportedly, he carried out a military-like ambush that resulted in the death of the Guatemalan drug lord Juan José León Ardón (alias Juancho) in March. An unnamed U.S. official said that Treviño Morales may have been the man <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> the bullet that killed the drug kingpin. Having succeeded outside of Mexico, Treviño Morales was appointed by Lazcano Lazcano as the national commander of Los Zetas, a position traditionally reserved to Zetas members with military background. In this position, Treviño Morales had a say in nearly all the decisions Los Zetas made at a national level, creating some resentment among the old-generation commanders of Los Zetas who, unlike him, had been in the Mexican Armed Forces before turning to the drug trade.|$|E
5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> upon him hit him {{on the right side of}} the head. Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the months}} and years that followed, {{commentators}} questioned the accuracy of France2's report. The Israel Defense Forces accepted responsibility for the shooting at first but later retracted. French journalists who saw the raw footage confirmed that France2 had cut a final few seconds in which Muhammad appeared to lift his hand from his face; they acknowledged that he had died, but said the footage alone did not show it. France2's news editor said in 2005 {{that no one could}} be sure <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> the shots. Other commentators, particularly Philippe Karsenty, a French media commentator, went further, alleging that the scene had been staged by Palestinian protesters; France 2 sued him for libel and in 2013 he was fined €7,000 by the Court of Appeal of Paris. In May that year an Israeli government report supported Karsenty's view. Jamal al-Durrah and Charles Enderlin rejected its conclusion and called for an independent international investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} {{began with a}} speedy Cardiff attack. Corinthian countered, {{resulting}} in shots from both Claude and Gilbert Ashton within 15 seconds of each other. Another Cardiff attack resulted in Ferguson missing the goal from a few feet out once again. After four minutes in the second half, Corinthians attacked once more. Fred Ewer played it down the left wing to Kenneth Hegan, who passed it into the centre towards Gilbert Ashton, <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> it past Farquharson. Shortly after the restart, Billy Thirlaway appeared to be about to score a certain goal for Cardiff, but was charged down by Russell. Further chances came in rapid succession; for Cardiff, Ferguson struck the crossbar with one shot; then for Corinthian, Claude Ashton passed forward to Jenkins, who struck it wide of an open goal mouth. Hegan sent the ball over the bar, and then a further shot by Claude Ashton was charged down.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Clay Shaw {{takes place in}} 1969. Garrison {{presents}} the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory, and proposes a Dealey Plaza shots scenario involving three assassins <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> six total shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and officer J. D. Tippit but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw {{died of lung cancer}} in 1974, but in 1979 Richard Helms testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the American War of Independence in 1783 Walker {{visited the}} continent, touring through France, Germany and Italy. While in Vienna in 1787, news reached him of {{political}} troubles with the Dutch, and he began to journey back to England in hope of a commission. While travelling through the forest near Aschaffenburg, the diligence he was in was attacked by ten armed men, <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> into the coach and demanded the passengers' money. Walker attempted to resist them, but was left unsupported by his fellow passengers, and was knocked down, robbed, and thrown into a ditch. The robbers took 800l of money and rode off, believing Walker to be dead. He came to, suffering from a sabre cut to the head, and was carried into Aschaffenburg. There his wounds were treated free of charge by the local surgeons and authorities, and on recovering sufficiently he was brought to Frankfurt. There the local lodge of freemasons offered him financial assistance, and on his arrival at Mainz he was presented to the Prince-Bishop, Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal. The Archbishop gave him a letter detailing his adventure in the forest near Aschaffenburg, and commending his bravery. Despite this assistance Walker was unable to reach England until after the Dutch crisis had abated, and so returned to his travels in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham won the toss and Manchester City kicked off. The Birmingham goal {{came under}} {{pressure}} almost immediately. Within a minute a far post cross from Roy Clarke narrowly eluded Hayes. Two corners followed, the second {{resulting in a}} shot by Roy Paul. The next attack, in the third minute, resulted in the opening goal. Revie began the move, exchanging passes with Clarke, and back-heeling for the unmarked Hayes to sweep the ball past Gil Merrick to put Manchester City ahead. Birmingham's confidence was shaken, resulting {{in a series of}} Manchester City corners and a chance for Hayes, but they fought back to equalise in the 15thminute. Astall slipped the ball to Brown, who helped it forward. It rebounded off a Manchester City defender into the path of Welsh international inside‑forward Noel Kinsey, <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> home via Trautmann's far post. For the remainder of the first half Birmingham had most of the play, exerting pressure on Manchester City full-back Leivers, but were unable to make a breakthrough. Though Birmingham put the ball in the net twice, Brown was adjudged to be offside on both occasions. With Warhurst missing and Boyd out of position and not fully fit, Birmingham's strength and balance was disrupted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to Manchester City's unconventional style.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, {{a massive}} crowd of {{thousands}} of Chinese soldiers and civilians from {{the south side of}} Nanking, who were fleeing in panic and disarray from the advance of Japan's 10th Army on the same night, were prevented from reaching the harbor at Xiaguan by Chinese barrier troops <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> on the crowd for retreating without permission and managed to hold it back. At 9:00 pm a fleeing Chinese tank unit, which had also not received Tang's parting message, charged the barrier troops and burst through their blockade, only for the crowd to then find that there were hardly any boats remaining in the harbor. The crowd fought to clamber aboard what few craft were available, but these soon became so overloaded that they sank midway. The rest of the Chinese soldiers took to the Yangtze's rough and frigid waters en masse while clinging to logs and pieces of scrap lumber, though most were quickly swallowed up by the river. Furthermore, by this point the Japanese encirclement of Nanking was virtually complete and many who were attempting to brave the Yangtze soon found themselves being fired upon {{from both sides of the}} river. Others who saw this turned back to the city in despair.|$|E

5|$|Here Pattle was {{to enjoy}} {{significant}} success. On 19 November 1940, Pattle with eight other pilots from 80 Squadron, attacked Fiat CR.42s and Fiat G.50bis near the Italian airfield at Korçë. In this combat, the RAF claimed nine and two probably destroyed while 160o Gruppo Autonomo (Independent Group) lost three Fiat CR.42s and one damaged while 355a Squadriglia, 24o Gruppo Autonomo, lost one G.50. Four Italian pilots were killed, while the RAF lost a Gladiator. Pattle claimed two CR.42s {{in the battle}} — his wingman Heimar Stucky (himself wounded in action later on) witnessed both catch fire and crash {{in the vicinity of}} Korçë with the pilots killed. Pattle's guns jammed during the battle and he was forced to break off combat. Pattle also noted the inferior speed of the Gladiator against the Fiat G.50. The Italian pilots could easily outrun the Gladiators if outnumbered. His combat reports also noted the ineffective fire of the Italians <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> and broke away from too far away. Having regained pressure in his guns, he encountered a lone G.50. Though respectful of its advantages, he was convinced of his own flying ability. He placed the Gladiator below and in front of the Italian fighter to tempt the enemy pilot, but could not persuade it to accept battle. Between 27–29 November, Pattle made four claims. Flying as escort for Bristol Blenheims, Pattle engaged three SM.79s and shared two destroyed with 11 other pilots. On 29 November, he shared with William Vale with both claiming two shared damaged.|$|E
5|$|The day's battle {{began on}} 18 June 1815 at about 11a.m. with a French attack on Hougoumont from the south-west, led by Napoleon's brother Jerome. The French {{gained control of}} much of the chateau's park, but the Allies {{retained}} possession of the farmhouse and courtyard surrounds. Jerome continued his attempts to take the farmhouse throughout the day, making four or five assaults, most of which were repulsed by the defenders, <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> through loopholes, windows, and doorways. One assault at about 12.30p.m. breached the north gate, which had been left open to allow allied troop and supply movements. Sous-Lieutenant Legro, of the French 1st Light Infantry, broke through the wooden doors with an axe, allowing French soldiers to flood the courtyard. Graham's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel James Macdonnell, led his men through the melee in the courtyard to the gates, in an attempt to shut them against the pressing French. This was done with the help of three officers (Captain Wyndham, Ensign Hervey, and Ensign Gooch), Corporal Graham, and a few other soldiers including Graham's brother Joseph. James Graham was the one to slot the bar in place. Flagstones, carts, and debris were then piled against the gates to hold them secure. The Frenchmen trapped within the courtyard were all killed, apart from a young drummer-boy.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner <b>who</b> <b>fired</b> the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E
