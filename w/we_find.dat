5|$|I’d {{like them}} to walk away {{thinking}} it’s a film that can be interpreted {{in more than one}} way. I’m happy when I hear from people who’ve seen the short that it makes them think about the kind of strangeness where <b>we</b> <b>find</b> inspiration for art and where <b>we</b> <b>find</b> love, and the kind of miraculousness of just being alive and having a life. I’m pleased when people get that out of it.|$|E
25|$|Step 1: <b>We</b> <b>find</b> {{the worst}} play ever written.|$|E
60|$|Beam. Let you and I go {{together}} then, and if <b>we</b> cannot <b>find</b> them, <b>we</b> shall do as good, for <b>we</b> shall <b>find</b> one another.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "there {{is nothing}} {{for it but}} to hunt the sphere. Nothing. <b>We</b> may <b>find</b> it--certainly <b>we</b> may <b>find</b> it. And if not--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then, that's {{something}} to start from, Tom," [...] said his friend. [...] "If <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> that, then maybe <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> whither they went from there." ...|$|R
25|$|Substituting x = 2.5, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> that f(2.5) = 0.5965.|$|E
25|$|Thus, on {{both sides}} of the coin, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> Buddha rolling the dhammacakka.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>find</b> {{that the}} length is given at 136' 7", which rounds off to 137 feet.|$|E
30|$|From Eq. (12), <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> that K 2 is a constant. Moreover, <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> {{that the}} minimum window is in inverse {{proportion}} to the velocity for a group.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got an idea," [...] {{came from}} the doctor's son. [...] "Let us take him with us and do what <b>we</b> can to <b>find</b> his sister. If <b>we</b> can't <b>find</b> her, let us see if <b>we</b> can't <b>find</b> a home for him and put him to school. He ought to get an education." ...|$|R
50|$|In the Leaderboard <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> {{one main}} ranking {{with the overall}} scores and another three rankings for {{each one of the}} {{evaluated}} areas where <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> the top companies contributing in each.|$|R
25|$|Using similar interpretations, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> that Ext(k, M) is {{a module}} over Ext(k, k), again for {{sufficiently}} nice situations.|$|E
25|$|To {{compute the}} minor M2,3 and the {{cofactor}} C2,3, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> the determinant {{of the above}} matrix with row 2 and column 3 removed.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>find</b> the era also in {{the dating}} of the {{so-called}} Letter of three Patriarchs to the emperor Theophilos (April, indiction 14, 6344 = 836 AD).|$|E
50|$|This {{gives us}} an abelian hidden {{subgroup}} problem, as f corresponds to a group homomorphism. The kernel corresponds to modular multiples of (r,1). So, if <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> the kernel, <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> r.|$|R
60|$|And all the time, {{as we came}} nearer and nearer, {{our hearts}} sank more and more, as we {{wondered}} in what state <b>we</b> should <b>find</b> our dear brother, and whether <b>we</b> should <b>find</b> him at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are right, {{it might}} account {{for much of the}} {{deviation}} of the compass during the past two days," [...] I suggested. [...] "Caprona has been luring us upon her deadly rocks. Well, we'll accept her challenge. We'll land upon Caprona. Along that long front there must be a vulnerable spot. <b>We</b> will <b>find</b> it, Bradley, for <b>we</b> must <b>find</b> it. <b>We</b> must <b>find</b> water on Caprona, or we must die." ...|$|R
25|$|During the Enlightenment <b>we</b> <b>find</b> {{names such}} as Leandro Fernández de Moratín, Benito Jerónimo Feijóo, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos or Leandro Fernández de Moratín.|$|E
25|$|Here {{at the end}} <b>we</b> <b>find</b> that a blank on {{the left}} has “come into play” so we leave {{it as part of}} the total configuration.|$|E
25|$|In 1734, Vernet {{left for}} Rome to study {{landscape}} designers and maritime painters, like Claude Gellee, where <b>we</b> <b>find</b> the styles and subjects of Vernet's paintings.|$|E
30|$|In {{the proof}} of Proposition 1, we show that <b>we</b> can always <b>find</b> a shift of a shifted cage so that <b>we</b> may <b>find</b> the {{similarity}} f.|$|R
5000|$|... {{which shows}} that [...] for [...] will give the {{response}} of the system to the point charge [...] Therefore, from the discussion above, if <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> the Green's function of this operator, <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> [...] to be ...|$|R
60|$|What Christ's {{character}} was <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> in the Holy Gospels; and <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> it too, scattered and in parts, {{in all the}} good, the holy, the noble, who have aught of Christ's spirit and likeness in them.|$|R
25|$|His {{authority}} is cited by Strabo (XI.530) {{in a manner}} that would lead us to conclude he had left some historical work, but <b>we</b> <b>find</b> no further mention of him as a writer.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the memristor is static if {{no current}} is applied. If I(t) = 0, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> V(t) = 0 and M(t) is constant. This {{is the essence}} of the memory effect.|$|E
25|$|High {{pressure}} {{region where}} <b>we</b> <b>find</b> a more diffusion-like {{expansion of the}} ablated material. Naturally this scattering is also dependent on {{the mass of the}} background gas and can influence the stoichiometry of the deposited film.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{we had to}} {{make our}} way up, lad, it would be much better to go by one of the lateral canons like the one we came down by. I can see {{at least half a dozen}} of them going up there. <b>We</b> should {{certainly}} <b>find</b> water, and <b>we</b> might <b>find</b> game, but up on the plateau <b>we</b> should <b>find</b> neither one nor the other." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> {{tried to}} <b>find</b> a larger set of users, but, unfortunately, <b>we</b> could not <b>find</b> more volunteers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Association Rule mining {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} functionality in data mining, by using which <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> out the frequent patterns. By the association rule mining either <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> out the frequent patterns of item sets or <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> out the customers who visits our shopping mall frequently. In this paper who propose a vertical data set which consists of two rows where we have the Customer-ID’s and the items which they purchased. Here we use Boolean matrix technique to represent the data and by using it <b>we</b> can easily <b>find</b> out frequent items purchased by the customers, so that we can improve our sales by this frequent pattern mining as well as <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> out which customers purchased our frequent item sets, so we can give some exclusive offers to those customers, so that we can improve our sales...|$|R
25|$|It {{was also}} {{during this period}} that <b>we</b> <b>find</b> {{one of the very}} first Christian {{communities}} in Sicily. Amongst the very earliest Christian martyrs were the Sicilians Saint Agatha of Catania and Saint Lucy of Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|During the Golden Age <b>we</b> <b>find</b> {{painters}} such as El Greco, José de Ribera, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo and Francisco Zurbarán. Also inside Baroque period Diego Velázquez {{created some}} of the most famous Spanish portraits, like Las Meninas or Las Hilanderas.|$|E
25|$|The {{states are}} at liberty, upon obtaining {{the consent of}} Congress, to make {{agreements}} with one another. … <b>We</b> <b>find</b> no room for doubt that they may do the like with Congress if the essence of their statehood is maintained without impairment.|$|E
