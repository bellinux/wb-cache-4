5|$|Urban responded favourably, perhaps {{hoping to}} heal the Great Schism of forty years earlier, and to reunite the Church under papal primacy by helping the Eastern churches in their time of need. Alexios and Urban had {{previously}} been in close contact in 1089 and after, and had discussed openly {{the prospect of the}} (re)union of the Christian church. There <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> of considerable co-operation between Rome and Constantinople in the years immediately before the crusade.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this feud, Germanicus became ill and despite the fact Piso had removed himself to the port of Seleucia, he was {{convinced}} that Piso was somehow poisoning him. Tacitus reports that there <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> of black magic in Piso's house with hidden body parts and Germanicus' name inscribed on lead tablets. Germanicus sent Piso a letter formally renouncing their friendship (amicitia). Germanicus died soon after on 10 October of that year. His death aroused much speculation, with several sources blaming Piso, acting under orders from Emperor Tiberius. This was never proven, and Piso later died while facing trial. Tiberius feared the people of Rome knew of the conspiracy against Germanicus, but Tiberius' jealousy and fear of his nephew's popularity and increasing power was the true motive as understood by Tacitus.|$|E
50|$|Several signings {{took place}} during {{pre-season}} period. Ivorian defender Adama Traoré <b>was</b> <b>signed</b> from the defunct Gold Coast United, Sam Gallagher <b>was</b> <b>signed</b> from Central Coast Mariners, Brazilian attacking midfielder Guilherme Finkler <b>was</b> <b>signed</b> from Criciúma Esporte Clube, Mauritian defensive midfield Jonathan Bru <b>was</b> <b>signed</b> from Moreirense F.C., Spase Dilevski <b>was</b> <b>signed</b> from Adelaide United, Theo Markelis <b>was</b> <b>signed</b> from Vicenza Calcio, former Johnny Warren Medal winner Marco Flores <b>was</b> <b>signed</b> from Henan Jianye and Mark Milligan <b>was</b> <b>signed</b> from JEF United Ichihara Chiba after an impressive loan spell with Melbourne Victory under former coach Jim Magilton.|$|R

5|$|Even as the XF-108 {{program was}} {{progressing}} well, there <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> that would {{ultimately lead to}} its eventual cancellation. Unconfirmed Soviet bomber threats, the overwhelming trend toward offensive and defensive nuclear missiles in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as rising costs, contributed to the termination of the XF-108. The cancellation was announced on 23September 1959. North American continued refining the design through 1960 in hopes that the program might be revived. Despite the extra money and time spent on the Rapier, it was not wholly in vain; the North American A-5 Vigilante supersonic carrier-based nuclear strike bomber developed for the U.S. Navy, which was later modified into a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft, retained the fuselage/weapon package and systems design of the Rapier. In many ways the Vigilante {{could be seen as}} the successful application of the Rapier design principles in a Mach 2 supersonic design.|$|E
5|$|In the 1992–93 season, {{despite a}} 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, Jordan's streak of {{consecutive}} MVP seasons ended as {{he lost the}} award to his friend Charles Barkley. Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, {{and became the first}} player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards. He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in 4 consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the British Industrial Revolution, {{which saw}} a rapid {{economic}} expansion between 1750 and 1850, there <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> of small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. These ranged from industries connected to agriculture, such as milling and {{the manufacture of}} woollen textiles, through to mining and quarrying. Until the Industrial Revolution, Wales had always been reliant on its agricultural output for its wealth and employment and the earliest industrial businesses were small scale and localised in manner. The emerging industrial period commenced around the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that {{could take advantage of}} Cornwall's copper mines and the copper deposits being extracted from the then-largest copper mine in the world at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both {{the north and the south}} of the country. In the north of Wales, John Wilkinson's Ironworks at Bersham was a significant industry, while in the south, a second world centre of metallurgy was founded in Merthyr Tydfil, where the four ironworks of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. In the 1820s, south Wales alone accounted for 40% of all pig iron manufactured in Britain.|$|E

25|$|The {{belief that}} such vials <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> {{of the grave}} of a martyr was still held in 1863, when a December 10 decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites {{confirmed}} a decree of April 10, 1668. But this view has been rejected in practice since the investigations of Giovanni Battista De Rossi (1822–1894).|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the early}} 1960s, there <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> of Tachisme and Art Informel in his work. His {{paintings}} on dark ground were almost monochrome, while those {{on a light}} ground showed a rhythmical movement of a dark mass across it. This distinctive theme became his trademark style, with increasingly dynamic strokes with intense, energetic colour.|$|E
25|$|In January 1775, there <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> {{that she}} was pregnant. It was hoped that the {{question}} of succession was solved, and prayers were held in the churches.
