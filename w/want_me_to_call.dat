60|$|Now {{of these}} races, the British (I avoid the word Celtic, {{because you would}} expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say Keltic; and I don't mean to, lest you should be <b>wanting</b> <b>me</b> next <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the patroness of music St. Kekilia), the British, {{including}} Breton, Cornish, Welsh, Irish, Scot, and Pict, are, I believe, of all the northern races, the one which has deepest love of external nature;--and the richest inherent gift of pure music and song, as such; separated from the intellectual gift which raises song into poetry. They are naturally also religious, and for some centuries after their own conversion {{are one of the}} chief evangelizing powers in Christendom. But they are neither apprehensive nor receptive;--they cannot understand the classic races, and learn scarcely anything from them; perhaps better so, if the classic races had been more careful to understand them.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>calling</b> is {{integral}} <b>to</b> {{who we are}} as human beings. From a Christian perspective, a sense of <b>calling</b> connects us <b>to</b> God and provides a center around which our lives can begin to make sense and have meaning. In this guide to understanding and responding <b>to</b> a <b>calling,</b> author Dr. Joe Collins provides both a clear picture of calling and various tools to help laypeople and clergy to pursue it in ways that are both biblical and practical. What Does God <b>Want</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Do? recognizes <b>calling</b> as a process that involves a growing perception of both God and self. It proposes a model that is both biblically sound and grounded in the actual experiences of people; it also demonstrates an appreciation of evolving understandings of calling {{in the history of the}} Church. Drawing wisdom from writers both modern and ancient who have struggled with calling and its meaning, it seeks to answer the hard questions about the nature of calling directly and honestly. Providing more than just a theoretical exploration of how calling works, this guide offers practical suggestions on how to prepare for a <b>call</b> and how <b>to</b> respond to it. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|According to Railton: x is good forme iff my Fully Informed Self (FIS) while contemplating my {{situation}} would <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> x. I offer four interpretations of this view. The first three are inadequate. Their inadequacy {{rests on the}} following two facts: (a) my FIS cannot <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> what would be irrational for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>want,</b> (b) when contemplating what is rational for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> we must specify a particular way in which I could rationally acquire the recommended desire. As a result, what my FIS could reasonably <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> is limited by what information my FIS could reliably convey <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> And therefore what my FIS could reasonably <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> cannot be grounded in changes in desires that my FIS cannot publicly justify.
