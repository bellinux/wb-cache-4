25|$|At Jekyll's {{first meeting}} with Lutyens in 1889 she invited him to Munstead Wood, and their {{collaboration}} began. They explored the local vernacular architecture, gathering ideas {{for the construction of}} Jekyll's house. His first building for her was The Hut, a cottage built in the grounds of Munstead Wood in 1895. Jekyll used this as a workshop, and lived in it until Lutyens completed the main house in 1897. While the house was still being built, Lutyens obtained another, larger commission in Surrey, Orchards, {{as a result of his}} future clients being impressed with Munstead Wood when they happened to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> construction site. Jekyll lived at Munstead Wood until her death in 1932.|$|E
25|$|Banded tunnelweb spiders {{are known}} to eat most types of small insects, waiting in the tunnel that they have {{constructed}} for prey to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> opening. At the entrance to their tunnel, they construct a swathe of silk, which serves as an indicator to when prey is moving past. Once an insect is captured it is dragged into the tunnel. From inspecting the remains found in their dwellings {{it has been observed}} that their diet consists mainly of beetles, millipedes and slaters, although they will attack and eat most arthropods. They have also been known to eat snails. Despite the armored defenses of a snail the banded tunnelweb spider are able to bite and drag them into their tunnels.|$|E
500|$|The episode's cold open {{was filmed}} {{in a water}} tank, using a replica P-51 Mustang plane which had been {{designed}} by the art director. Bowman also needed to direct {{a scene in which}} Gillian Anderson would react to a memory of playing with her sister as a child; the scene involved digitally compositing the children playing into Anderson's footage. Bowman asked Anderson to act towards a tree as though it were her sister, later telling her [...] "I'm going to tell everybody I can that you just did that great reaction to a tree". Bowman also reshot the episode's ending, as originally Duchovny and Lea were to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> camera and continue off-screen. Feeling this was not effective, he replaced this with a walking shot which continued straight towards and into the camera, noting that [...] "Nick will jump in front of a truck if he think it will make a scene better".|$|E

500|$|Pistons coach Larry Brown {{was not yet}} very concerned, because {{fights in}} the NBA rarely lasted {{for more than a}} few seconds. During the altercation, Artest lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio {{broadcaster}} Mark Boyle. The microphone was not live. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest's personality and [...] "there was no way we were going to put an open mic in front of [...] in that situation". Pacers president Donnie Walsh later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to calm down and avoid trouble in a volatile situation. After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to eject various players before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Stephen Jackson should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if ejected, Wallace would have to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> Pacers bench, which could trigger another incident.|$|E
500|$|Reviews were universally {{less than}} {{positive}} on other systems. While critics praised {{the idea of}} the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying [...] "Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again." [...] and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly complaining of [...] "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also {{got in the way of}} allowing the player to tell what was going on in the game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of PC Gamer praised the voiceover, calling it [...] "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery". Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly was less kind, stating that [...] "your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the best of the voice actors you come across". GamesRadar strikes a more neutral tone, stating that [...] "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world." [...] Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's [...] "biggest asset", stating that [...] "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".|$|E

2500|$|Hattie Wells owned {{a brothel}} on the 1000 block of Clay Street in San Francisco, a {{district}} known for prostitution, {{and only one}} block from Josephine's school on Powell Street. Wells also owned a brothel in Prescott, Arizona. Josephine had to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> brothel everyday {{on her way to}} school. To her the women appeared not as [...] "soiled doves" [...] but nicely dressed women living a life of leisure. In 1879, five prostitutes lived there.|$|E
2500|$|Today Hodge {{is remembered}} by a bronze statue, {{unveiled}} by the Lord Mayor of the City of London in 1997, {{outside the house}} in Gough Square he shared with Johnson and Barber, Johnson's black manservant and heir. The statue shows Hodge sitting next {{to a pair of}} empty oyster shells atop a copy of Johnson's famous dictionary, with the inscription [...] "a very fine cat indeed". It has become customary for visitors that <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> statue to place coins in the oyster shells as tokens of good luck. [...] To mark special occasions and anniversaries a pink piece of counsel's ribbon may be seen tied to one of the oyster shells or around Hodge's neck.|$|E

60|$|The {{arrangements}} were judicious; the whole populace was marshalled into ranks; classes of twelve persons were allowed consecutively to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> victim of tyranny, corruption, and ignorance; and each person had the honour {{to touch his}} finger. During this proceeding, which lasted a few hours, an influential personage generously offered to receive the eager subscriptions of the assembled thousands.
