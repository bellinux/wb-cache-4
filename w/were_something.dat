Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated.

500|$|The writing {{staff had}} never done a spring break episode before so they thought, [...] "What would Lisa and Bart do on spring break?" [...] {{and came up with}} the road trip plot. Bill Oakley, the show runner of The Simpsons at the time, said that road trips <b>were</b> <b>something</b> that the writers liked to write stories about. The idea of four {{children}} going on a road trip was [...] "so exciting" [...] that they immediately knew they wanted to write it. There was a debate over where the children would go, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was first suggested, but the writers eventually decided to have them go to a [...] "funny unlikely place". Oakley's show runner partner, Josh Weinstein, said that the writers were always looking for combinations of characters that had not been done many times on the show. Homer and Lisa had not been done [...] "too often" [...] and they wanted the two characters to bond and get closer to each other.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Jefferson, Calhoun {{rejected}} {{attempts at}} economic, social, or political leveling, claiming that true equality {{could not be}} achieved if all classes were given equal rights and responsibilities. Rather, to ensure true prosperity, {{it was necessary for}} a stronger group to provide protection and care for the weaker one. This meant that the two groups should not be equal before the law. For Calhoun, [...] "protection" [...] (order) was more important than freedom. Individual rights <b>were</b> <b>something</b> to be earned, not something bestowed by nature or God. Calhoun was concerned with protecting the interests of the Southern States (which he identified with the interests of their slaveholding elites) as a distinct and beleaguered minority among the members of the federal Union; his idea of a concurrent majority as a protection for minority rights has gained some acceptance in American political thought. Political scientist Malcolm Jewell argues, [...] "The decision-making process in this country resembles John Calhoun's 'concurrent majority': [...] A large number of groups both within and outside the government must, in practice, [...] approve any major policy." ...|$|E

500|$|Creangă's {{contribution}} to literature also covers {{a series of}} didactic fables written as lively dialogues, among them [...] "The Needle and the Sledge Hammer", in which the objects of traditional metalworking scold the byproducts of their work for having forgotten their lowly origin. The inspiration behind this theme was identified by Călinescu as [...] "The Story of a Gold Coin", written earlier by Creangă's Junimist colleague Vasile Alecsandri. A similar piece, [...] "The Flax and the Shirt", reveals the circuit of fibers from weed-like plants into recycled cloth, leading {{to the conclusion that}} [...] "all things are not what they seem; they <b>were</b> <b>something</b> else once, they are something else now;—and shall become something else." [...] The technique employed by Creangă has the flax plant teaching the less knowledgeable textile, a dialogue which Călinescu likened to that between old women in a traditional society. Included alongside the two stories were: Pâcală, a writing which, Mircea Braga argued, is not as much didactic as it is a study in dialogue; [...] "The Bear Tricked by the Fox", which uses legendary and humorous elements in an attempt to explain why bears are the tail-less species among mammals; and Cinci pâini ("Five Loafs of Bread"), which serves as a condemnation of greed.|$|E
500|$|Disney {{had been}} {{interested}} in producing abstract animation since he saw A Color Box by Len Lye from 1935. He explained the work done in the Toccata and Fugue was [...] "no sudden idea... they <b>were</b> <b>something</b> we had nursed along several years but we {{never had a chance}} to try". Preliminary designs included those from effects animator Cy Young, who produced drawings influenced by the patterns on the edge of a piece of sound film. In late 1938 Disney hired Oskar Fischinger, a German artist who had produced numerous abstract animated films, including some with classical music, to work with Young. Upon review of three leica reels produced by the two, Disney rejected all three. According to Huemer all Fishinger [...] "did was little triangles and designs... it didn't come off at all. Too dinky, Walt said." [...] Fischinger, like Disney, was used to having full control over his work and was not used to working in a group. Feeling his designs were too abstract for a mass audience, Fishinger left the studio in apparent despair, before the segment was completed, in October 1939. Disney had plans to make the Toccata and Fugue an experimental three-dimensional film, with audiences being given cardboard stereoscopic frames with their souvenir programs, but this idea was abandoned.|$|E

In the semifinals the following day, he placed fifth out of eight runners, with a time of 49.87 seconds. Medwood finished in front of Ukraine's Stanislav Melnykov (50.19 seconds) but behind Emir Bekrić from Serbia (49.62 seconds) in a heat led by eventual bronze medallist Javier Culson of Puerto Rico (47.93 seconds). Overall he finished 17th out of 46 runners, and did not advance to the final after finishing 1.92 seconds slower than the slowest participant who made the last stage.

500|$|On 7 September 1998, Powderfinger {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Internationalist, which peaked at No.1 and spent 101 {{weeks in the}} Top50 of the ARIA Albums Chart; it was produced by Nick DiDia (Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam). AllMusic's Jonathan Lewis had mixed feelings about the album. He was enchanted by its lead single, [...] "The Day You Come", however [...] "the rest of the album didn't measure up" [...] except for [...] "some fine tracks" [...] in [...] "Don't Wanna Be Left Out" [...] and [...] "Already Gone". Nevertheless, by 2007 the album had shipped over 350,000 copies and was certified five times platinum domestically, and had reached European audiences. Internationalist was the first Powderfinger album to win any ARIA Music Awards. At the 1999 ceremony it won [...] "Album of the Year", [...] "Best Rock Album" [...] and [...] "Best Cover Art" [...] (by Kevin Wilkins), and [...] "The Day You Come" [...] won [...] "Single of the Year".

500|$|During the off-season, the Capitals {{made several}} player changes. One {{of the players}} that was not {{retained}} by the team, Matt Bradley, started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa. In the interview, Bradley said his former team was [...] "a little bit too nonchalant and guys weren’t disciplined the way they should have been," [...] which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team {{was not able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} Stanley Cup playoffs. He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well, but went with his star players. He further noted that Boudreau was a [...] "great coach" [...] who had been put in a tough position. When asked to point out examples, Bradley stated that Alexander Semin [...] "could easily be the best player in the league," [...] but he [...] "just doesn’t care," [...] further noting, [...] "When you've got a guy like that, you need him to be your best player, or one of your best players, and when he doesn't show up, you almost get the sense that he wants to be back in Russia." [...] Semin's agent came to his client's defense, stating he [...] "always cares." [...] Teammate Mike Knuble noted that because Semin speaks limited English, the language barrier affects the way that he is perceived, further noting that the interview comments <b>were</b> <b>something</b> Bradley regretted.

500|$|Webb felt a {{responsibility}} to reinvent Spider-Man. One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics. In February 2011, with {{the launch of the}} official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed. Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it was too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and [...] noted [...] "the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands {{as one of the great}} comic-book costumes ever." [...] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was not crazy about the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy. He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine. Webb explained that he felt that [...] "the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect". Webb paid attention to the question of [...] "How would a kid make it?" [...] and then took some license with it. About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew [...] "wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider [...] <b>were</b> <b>something</b> we used to emphasize that." [...] He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions. They made the webbing on the costume a little darker. Webb stated that [...] "With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made". Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body.|$|E
