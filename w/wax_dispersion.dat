50|$|A wax {{emulsion}} is a stable mixture {{of one or}} more waxes in water. Waxes and water are normally immiscible but can be brought together stably by the use of surfactants and a clever preparation process. Strictly speaking a {{wax emulsion}} should be called a <b>wax</b> <b>dispersion</b> since the wax is solid at room temperature. However, because the preparation takes place above the melting point of the wax, the actual process is called emulsification, hence the name wax emulsion. In praxis, <b>wax</b> <b>dispersion</b> is used for solvent based systems.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, {{hydrogenated}} cottonseed oil (HCSO) was evaluated as a sustained release matrix for a freely soluble drug, tramadol. Hydrophobic matrix tablets of tramadol, was evaluated by compression of physical mixture of drug and <b>wax,</b> <b>dispersion</b> of drug in HCSO by hot fusion or solubilisation techniques. The {{method of preparation}} of tablet {{had a significant effect}} on drug release with higher release observed from direct compression matrices and slower release from matrix prepared by dispersion (hot-fused matrices). Influence of addition of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol 4000 and surfactants like sodium lauryl sulphate and polysorbate 20 to HCSO matrix on drug release was investigated. The added excipients exhibited a propensity to enhance drug release from the HCSO matrix. NaCMC was effective at a lower ratio (< 10 % w/w) and when incorporated at higher level made HCSO matrix to erode and disintegrate in a short period...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of adding waste wax, produced as {{a by-product of}} the low density polyethylene manufacturing process, on the thermal and mechanical properties of three types of polyethylene (PE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE), with 10, 20, 30 and 40 wt. % was investigated. Polymer–wax mixing was effective with no apparent leakage of the wax during sample preparation, which was evident from the agreement between the theoretical and experimental values of enthalpy {{for all types of}} PE. The <b>wax</b> <b>dispersion</b> in the matrix strongly depends on the percentage of wax added to the polymer and the molecular structure of the polymer. It was found that increasing the wax content enhances the phase separation. LDPE undergoes less phase separation due to its highly branched structure composed of a network of short and long chain branches. The wax has no pronounced plasticising effect on the polymer. This is clearly manifested in LDPE as no change in the melting temperature occurred. LLDPE and HDPE were slightly affected by a high concentration of wax (30 % and 40 %). This is due to the non-uniform distribution of short chain branching along the LLDPE and HDPE main chains, which can interact with the wax structure...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the morphology, dynamic mechanical, impact, and tensile {{properties}} of {{ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer}} (EVA) /expanded graphite (EG) and EVA/wax/EG composites is presented. The composites were prepared by melt blending. The EVA/EG composites showed ductile behavior, while brittle behavior was observed in the presence of <b>wax.</b> A finer <b>dispersion</b> of EG was observed in the matrix when wax was present. The storage modulus of the EVA/wax/EG composite was higher than that of the EVA/EG composite, which is ascribed to a better interaction between the EVA and the wax-covered EG that significantly reduced the EVA chain mobility. The composites showed a decrease in impact strength with increasing EG and wax contents. There was {{a significant difference in the}} elongation at break between the EVA/EG and EVA/wax/EG composites, and little change in Young's modulus of EVA in the presence of EG and with increasing EG content. However, Young's modulus of the EVA/wax blends increased in the presence of and with increasing EG content. In all the investigated samples containing EVA and wax, irrespective of the EG content, the stress at break decreased with an increase in wax content. POLYM.

40|$|This {{study was}} an {{investigation}} of the complex industrial PTFE polymerisation. Ex- periments were devised within the operating conditions to investigate the solubility of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) in the hydrocarbon wax added to the polymerisation. Over the polyrnerisatlon pressures, the solubility of TFE in the wax varied from 5. 6 x 10 - 2 mol dm- 3 (1000 kPa) to 11. 2 x 10 - 2 mol dm- 3 (1310 kPa). The solubility was decreased by the pres- ence of ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO), a trend also observed for nitrogen. Four polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE} polymerisations were performed to ascertain the effect of varying quantities of <b>wax</b> on the <b>dispersion</b> and polymer particles produced. No significant difference in molecular weight, particle size or particle crystallinity was observed. It has been proposed that the role of the wax is to aid solubilisation of TFE in the aqueous phase and it does play a pivotal role in the nucleation or growth mechanism of PTFE. It is theorised that PTFE particles change from rods to cobble-stone particles via a roll-up mechanism. Statistical analysis of the particle shapes and size was performed from electron microscopy images. No evidence for a roll-up mechanism was observed. The rate of polymerisation was investigated through a novel experimental procedure and the 1 st-order rate constant with respect to TFE was found to be of the order of 1 x 10 - 3 s- 1. The addition of nitrogen to the autoclave reduced the rate of polymerisation substantially. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorostyrene (PFS) was chosen to develop a polymerisation recipe with the aim to mimic the PTFE polymerisation. A reproducible aqueous synthesis was developed and used to test fluorinated surfactants with and without the presence of wax. A method of determining the kinetics of polymerisation using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was created. The addition of wax reduced the rate of all polymerisations as PFS was preferentially soluble in the wax over the aqueous phase. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Development of a {{profitable}} titanium industry for New Zealand {{will not come}} about without innovative technologies. Plastic injection moulding has long held a place in NZ manufacturing to produce large quantities of complex parts and holds the key to such innovation. Titanium metal parts were fabricated by injection moulding titanium based metal powder feedstock followed by a debinding process and subsequent sintering. The fabrication process in its entirety was investigated in four distinct steps. Feedstock formulation involved combining the metal powders with various carrier components. Injection moulding enabled the shaping of the feedstock into geometries approximating the final part. Debinding being the process whereby the carrier/binder system {{is removed from the}} part to create a powder compact retaining the required geometry. Sintering being the final step where the metal powders are consolidated into a fully dense metal part of net shape. The feedstock binder consisted of water soluble polyethylene glycol that reduced feedstock viscosity, improved particle wetting, aided greenpart shape retention and eliminated toxic solvents in debinding. Carnauba wax and bees <b>wax</b> aided <b>dispersion,</b> lubricated particles, were safe to handle and better for the environment (than petroleum waxes). Their low melt temperatures aided removal during thermal debinding and supported residue elimination. By optimising the ratio of water soluble, wax and polyolefin binder components (3 : 2 : 1 respectively) for melt flow and pellet formation, greenparts defect free with uniform particle distribution were made. The optimal binder system proved suitable for titanium alloy and irregular shape pure titanium powders (hydride-de-hydride). Increasing powder loading (wP = (0. 60 to 0. 65)) had no appreciable effect on viscosity while enabling feedstock with good uniformity and pellet formation. Dimensional change was not affected by uniformity of the feedstock however molecular weight, volume and dispersion of binder components affected interparticular distances. Low processing temperatures reduced disruption to part geometry, benefitted particle bonding and helped retain handling strength. The use of low temperatures for thermal debinding (t = 250 °C) enabled removal of the binder below the temperatures that facilitate interstitial diffusion and oxide/carbide formation, although part thickness, mass and overall volume effected the processing time. A strong correlation was seen between handling strength of the greenparts and defects, such as non-uniform density distribution and cracking after sintering. Sintering was essential to produce the final part and showed that a binder free brownpart was not the only criteria for eliminating impurities. The furnace atmosphere must remain free from contamination to eliminate transfer back to the parts. This was addressed using an argon sweep gas, however, the design and efficacy of the system was considered inadequate. Decomposition products need to be removed quickly from the furnace as they evolve before impurities from the sweep gas diffuse back into the parts during the extended duration at sinter temperatures (t = 1300 °C). The combination of an optimised titanium feedstock and the use of a low temperature thermal debinding technique produced a consolidated MIM part of relatively large dimensions. The parts were seen to have uniform microstructure throughout the cross-section with density comparable to that of MIM standards. In difference to the literature, a high powder loading (φp = 0. 65) of HDH powders was used and shown to be readily mouldable. The higher powder loading also eliminate separation defects and shape distortions evident using lower amounts of powder...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focused on}} {{developing}} surface treatments for various cellulosic materials, including wood, cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), and natural textiles (cotton and linen). For this purpose, several approaches were developed, aiming at various improvements {{depending on the}} type of substrate. Some components were created specifically for this work, including amphiphilic galactoglucomannan (GGM) derivatives and an aqueous carnauba <b>wax</b> <b>dispersion.</b> On wood, non-continuous coatings were assembled, made of natural wax particles alone or combined with UV-absorbing additives. When wax particles were used alone, the performance of the coated wood was compared to a continuous wax film and commercially available coatings (lacquer, linseed oil). The treatment with particles enhanced the hydrophobicity of the wooden surface and its moisture buffering performance. Additionally, it is known that protection from the degrading effect of UV light is as important as protection against water. Therefore, zinc oxide nanoparticles were incorporated together with wax particles into multilayer coatings through layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition. The multilayers increased the roughness of the wooden surface and provided UV-absorbing properties. Moreover, the coated wood was superhydrophobic, yet the moisture buffering was preserved and even enhanced. On CNF, galactoglucomannan derivatives with different hydrophobic tails were adsorbed. The derivatives were synthesised using naturally occurring fatty acids or polydimethylsiloxane as hydrophobic blocks. The hydrophobic moieties did not hinder the adsorption on cellulose, and all GGM-derived materials were found to adsorb irreversibly. However, the use of hydrophobic blocks with high molar mass was required in order to overcome the inherent hydrophilicity of the GGM molecule, and increase the hydrophobicity of the surface. Moreover, inspired by the promising results achieved on wood, wax-containing multilayers were assembled on CNF and textiles. Here poly-L-lysine (PLL) was utilised instead of zinc oxide as the cationic counterpart. Two bilayers were sufficient to reduce the sensitivity towards water and switch surfaces from being highly hydrophilic to hydrophobic, or superhydrophobic. In addition, studying the LbL assembly with quartz crystal microbalance revealed that the adsorption of the wax particles increased with the pH of the PLL solution. Nevertheless, the oxygen permeability of the CNF films and moisture sorption of textiles were preserved in all cases. Having these properties, the enhanced cellulosic materials could be used in advanced applications, like smart packaging, passive climate control systems, and breathable superhydrophobic clothing for sports and outdoors...|$|E
