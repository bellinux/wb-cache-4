The MCGM {{supplies}} potable water to the city from six lakes, most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes. The Tansa lake supplies water to the western suburbs and parts of the island city along the Western Railway. The water is filtered at Bhandup, which is Asia's largest water filtration plant. India's first underground <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> was completed in Mumbai to supply water to the Bhandup filtration plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Colombian film director Simon Brand, in Los Angeles between April 6 and April 8, 2001, and was choreographed by Dan Karaty. Shot in a set with futuristic backdrops, Simpson assumes {{the role of a}} spy on a mission in the video. It begins with Simpson exiting a helicopter then entering a building to compromise evidence in a laboratory there. Simpson takes the elevator which opens onto a pathway. While she is walking, a gadget appears on the floor followed by a small explosion. In the next scene, Simpson walks through a <b>water</b> <b>tunnel,</b> out of which she is pulled by a robotic hand. As the video progresses, Simpson is shown dancing {{in a room full of}} mirrors. Scenes of ninjas climbing up a rope hanging from top of the building are inter-cut with scenes of Simpson dancing until the laboratory explodes. Simpson is next shown dancing on the rooftop alongside the ninjas before a helicopter arrives and Simpson boards it.|$|E

5|$|The {{region has}} been used by humans for centuries. Obsidian was {{collected}} by Mono Paiutes for making sharp tools and arrow points. Glassy rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration. Mono Mills processed timber felled on or near the volcanoes for the nearby boomtown Bodie in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Water diversions into the Los Angeles Aqueduct system from their natural outlets in Mono Lake started in 1941 after a <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> was cut under the Mono Craters. Mono Lake Volcanic Field and {{a large part of the}} Mono Craters gained some protection under Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984. Resource use along all of the chain is managed by the United States Forest Service as part of Inyo National Forest. Various activities are possible along the chain, including hiking, bird watching, canoeing, skiing, and mountain biking.|$|E
25|$|The Moffat Tunnel finally {{provided}} Denver with {{a western}} link through the Continental Divide, as both Cheyenne, Wyoming, {{to the north}} and Pueblo to the south already enjoyed rail access to the West Coast. It follows the right-of-way laid out by Moffat in 1902 while he was seeking a better and shorter route from Denver to Salt Lake City.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>tunnels</b> are {{emerging}} as a possible useful alternative to small low-speed wind tunnels for an expanded range of aerodynamic testing. In this report, an assessment is made regarding {{the extent to which}} <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> can be used for such testing. It was found that their suitability for testing given models needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For conventional tests on aircraft, such as force and moment measurements, they compare unfavourably with similar-sized wind tunnels, due to a mismatch in Reynolds numbers. <b>Water</b> <b>tunnels</b> are generally better suited to carrying out fundamental research than they are for applied aerodynamics testing. However, they are very useful as part of a large research program, by helping establish the testing schedule for large wind tunnels. In flow situations that are insensitive to Reynolds number, or where a test Reynolds number is close to that of a full-size vehicle, <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> should be regarded as the preferred option for experimental aerodynamics. Such examples include micro air vehicles, high-rate dynamic testing, and high-sweep sharp-edge configurations. <b>Water</b> <b>tunnels</b> are also very useful for providing validation data for computational-fluid-dynamics analyses of a flow. An earlier version of this work was prepared for the TTCP TR-AER-TP 5 Panel in August 2010...|$|R
25|$|The Moffat Tunnel is a {{railroad}} and <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> that {{cuts through the}} Continental Divide in north-central Colorado. Named after Colorado railroad pioneer David Moffat, the tunnel's first railroad traffic passed through in February 1928.|$|E
25|$|An {{underground}} {{power station}} is generally used at large facilities and {{makes use of}} a large natural height difference between two waterways, such as a waterfall or mountain lake. An underground tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in an underground cavern near the lowest point of the <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway.|$|E
25|$|Belameh, {{located a}} little over one mile (1.6km) south of Jenin, is an {{important}} Bronze Age site identified with the ancient city of Ibleam, one of the Palestinian cities mentioned in the Egyptian Royal Archive that was conquered by Thutmose III in the 15th century BCE. Excavations in Khirbet Belameh, led by Hamdan Taha of the Palestinian Antiquities Department, began in 1996. These have focused on a <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> carved out of rock sometime in the Late Bronze or Early Iron Age that connected the city {{at the top of}} the hill to its water source at the bottom, a spring known as Bir es-Sinjib. The tunnel allowed inhabitants to walk through it undetected, particularly useful during times of siege. There is evidence that the tunnel fell into disuse in the 8th century BCE, and that the entrance was subsequently rehabilitated some time in the Roman period, while the site itself shows occupation into the medieval period. Plans have been drawn up to turn the site into an archaeological park. G. Schumacher had described the <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> in 1908, and a small-scale excavation was conducted by Z. Yeivin in 1973. The water passage of Belameh is important for the understanding of ancient water systems in Palestine.|$|E

25|$|During this period, {{the city}} {{continued}} to grow, and {{at an even}} faster pace. By 1920, the population had reached 19,441, tripling in twenty years. The completion of the <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> under the mountains to newly completed Gibraltar Reservoir on the Santa Ynez River relieved the water shortages for a time. Also during the teens, a movement for city beautification commenced, led by Bernhard Hoffmann and later by Pearl Chase; their idea was to unify the city's architecture around a Spanish Colonial style, harmonious with the Mission and surviving pueblos. Many of the buildings from the late 19th century were, to their eyes and {{the eyes of many}} citizens, ugly, dilapidated, and no different from those in dozens of other run-down western towns. The Lobero Theatre, built {{on the site of the}} original Lobero Opera House in 1924, was an example of the architectural style they promoted, as was the first part of the Santa Barbara Natural History Museum.|$|E
25|$|After the war ended, {{many people}} who had seen Santa Barbara during the war came back to stay. The {{population}} grew by 10,000 by 1950, in just five years. During this time the University of California took over the blufftop Marine camp, {{turning it into a}} modern university. The burst of growth brought traffic, housing, and water problems, which led to improvements in the transportation system, such as the building of Highway 101 through town; tracts of low-cost housing, especially on the Mesa, where oil derricks were removed and replaced by houses; and the building of Lake Cachuma reservoir {{on the other side of}} the mountains, along with another <b>water</b> <b>tunnel</b> to bring its water to thirsty residents. During this period, the city selectively recruited businesses to relocate there, choosing clean industries such as aerospace and technology in preference to the oil industry which had already marred many local landscapes with abandoned wells and sumps.|$|E
25|$|New York City is {{supplied}} with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As {{a result of}} the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants. The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water. The ongoing expansion of New York City <b>Water</b> <b>Tunnel</b> No. 3, {{an integral part of the}} New York City water supply system, is the largest capital construction project in the city's history, with segments serving Manhattan and The Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and Queens planned for construction in 2020.|$|E

50|$|Whereas in {{wind tunnels}} {{the driving force}} is usually {{sophisticated}} multiblade propellers with adjustable blade pitch, in <b>water</b> and oil <b>tunnels</b> the fluid is circulated with pumps, effectively using a net pressure head difference to move the fluid rather than imparting momentum on it directly. Thus the return section of <b>water</b> and oil <b>tunnels</b> does not need any flow management; typically {{it is just a}} pipe sized for the pump and desired flow speeds. The upstream section of a <b>water</b> <b>tunnels</b> generally consists of a pipe (outlet from the pump) with several holes along its side and with the end open followed by a series of coarse and fine screens to even the flow before the contraction into the test section.
