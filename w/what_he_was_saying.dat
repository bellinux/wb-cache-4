In his autobiography, Kenny Rogers, who maintained a close friendship with West, stated that he did pay a visit her in hospital a few times prior to her death.

25|$|Exactly {{how and why}} did Merezhkovsky {{found himself}} on the German radio in June 1941 nobody was quite sure of. Gippius (according to Yury Terapiano who was quoting Nina Berberova) was blaming her own {{secretary}} Vladimir Zlobin who, using his German connections, allegedly persuaded the elderly man {{to come to the}} studio {{in the early days of}} the Nazi invasion into the USSR. In his speech (if its printed version entitled Bolshevism and Humanity is to be believed) Merezhkovsky, comparing Hitler to Joan of Arc, called for the anti-Bolshevik crusade, reiterating, among other things, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> all through the 1920s and 1930s:Bolshevism will never change its nature... because right from the start it's been not a national, but international phenomenon. From the very first day Russia has been – and remains to this very day – only a means to the end: that of its conquering the whole world.|$|E

25|$|Later {{attempts}} at discovering whether Lucas had actually killed anyone apart from Powell and Rich were complicated by Lucas's {{ability to make}} an accurate deduction that seemed to substantiate a confession. In one instance, he explained how he had correctly identified a victim in a group photograph through her wearing spectacles; a pair of glasses were {{on a table in}} a crime scene photo shown to him earlier. There were also suggestions that the interview tapes showed that, despite Lucas's supposedly low IQ, he had adroitly read the reactions of those interviewing him and altered <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> thereby making his confessions more consistent with facts known to law enforcement. The most serious allegation against investigators, that they had let Lucas read case files on unsolved crimes and thus enabled him to come up with convincingly detailed confessions, made it virtually impossible to determine if, as some continue to suspect, he had been telling the truth to the Lucas Task Force about a relatively large number of the murders.|$|E

During post-production, editors feared that Rich's mumbly voice would {{make it hard for}} viewers to {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> so he was brought back in to re-record his dialogue, which was then dubbed over the footage. In addition, during the scene wherein Mulder tells Scully Bobby's nickname at school, the original version featured Mulder saying [...] "Dickweed".

2500|$|Fox's autobiography, {{entitled}} Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith and Dreams of a Mexican President, {{was released}} in September 2007. To promote its release, Fox toured many U.S. cities to do book-signings and interviews with U.S. media. During his tour, however, he faced protests from Mexican immigrants who accused him of actions that forced them to emigrate and find jobs in the United States. He faced the subject several times during interviews, such as one held with Fox News's Bill O'Reilly, who questioned him about the massive illegal immigration problem of Mexicans into the United States. Finally, during an interview with Telemundo's Rubén Luengas, the interviewer asked Fox about allegations concerning some properties of Vicente Fox's wife, Marta Sahagún. After Fox explained the situation, he asked the interviewer not to make false accusations and to prove <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> Luengas said, [...] "I'm telling you in your face, I'm not a liar."

2500|$|That {{this shift}} of Brown's {{interests}} toward psychoanalysis {{led to the}} writing of Love's Body, which concluded that [...] "there is only poetry", showed, according to Brown, that pursuing the implications of Freud's ideas consistently led to the breakdown of [...] "categories of traditional 'rationality' still accepted as authoritative by both Marx and Freud; that massive breakdown...which Nietzsche baptized {{with the name of}} Dionysus." [...] Brown wrote that he now realized that he did not really know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> when he called for [...] "Dionysian consciousness" [...] in the last chapter of Life Against Death. Brown added that it was clear to him in that work [...] "that at that deep level which can only be expressed in myth or metaphor, Freud's 'instinct theory' needed to be remythologized in terms of Dionysus, that is to say in terms of instinctual dialectics rather than instinctual dualism. Or, to use another metaphor, in terms of Heraclitus rather than Empedocles." [...] Brown concluded that the last chapter of Life Against Death was disfigured by the misleading idea that the world could be 'a pastoral scene of peace and pleasure, luxe calme et volupté, Baudelaire's utopian image invoked by Marcuse in Eros and Civilization." ...|$|E
2500|$|Empress Dowager Longyu {{endorsed}} the [...] "Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor" [...] (清帝退位詔書) on 12 February 1912 under a deal brokered by Prime Minister Yuan Shikai (a {{general of the}} Beiyang Army) with the imperial court in Beijing and the Republicans in southern China. At the crucial meeting in the Forbidden City, Puyi watched the meeting between Longyu and Yuan, which he remembered as: [...] "The Dowager Empress {{was sitting on a}} kang [...] in a side room of the Mind Nature Palace, wiping her eyes with a handkerchief while a fat old man [...] knelt on a red cushion before her, tears rolling down his face. I was sitting {{to the right of the}} Dowager and wondering why the two adults were crying. There was nobody in the room besides us three and it was very quiet; the fat man was sniffing while he talked and I could not understand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> ... This was the occasion Yuan directly brought up the question of abdication". Under the [...] "Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication" [...] (清帝退位 優待條件), signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch. This was similar to Italy's Law of Guarantees (1870) which accorded the Pope certain honors and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the King of Italy. Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City (the Private Apartments) as well as in the Summer Palace. A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver taels was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years. Puyi himself was not informed in February 1912 that his reign had ended and China was now a republic and continued to believe that he was the still the Emperor for sometime afterwards. In 1913, when the Empress Dowager Longyu died, President Yuan Shikai arrived at the Forbidden City to pay his respects, which Puyi's tutors told him meant that major changes were afloat.|$|E

2500|$|The {{salmonella}} {{attack was}} noted {{as the first}} confirmed instance of chemical or biological terrorism to {{have occurred in the}} United States. Rajneesh stated that because he was in silence and isolation, meeting only with Sheela, he was unaware of the crimes committed by the Rajneeshpuram leadership until Sheela and her [...] "gang" [...] left and sannyasins came forward to inform him. A number of commentators have stated that they believe that Sheela was being used as a convenient scapegoat. Others have pointed to the fact that although Sheela had bugged Rajneesh's living quarters and made her tapes available to the US authorities as part of her own plea bargain, no evidence has ever come to light that Rajneesh had any part in her crimes. Nevertheless, Gordon (1987) reports that Charles Turner, David Frohnmayer and other law enforcement officials, who had surveyed affidavits never released publicly and who listened to hundreds of hours of tape recordings, insinuated to him that Rajneesh [...] as guilty of more crimes than those for which he was eventually prosecuted. Frohnmayer asserted that Rajneesh's philosophy was not [...] "disapproving of poisoning" [...] and that he felt he and Sheela had been [...] "genuinely evil". Nonetheless, US Attorney Turner and Attorney General Frohnmeyer acknowledged that [...] "they had little evidence of (Rajneesh) being involved in any of the criminal activities that unfolded at the ranch". According to court testimony by Ma Ava (Ava Avalos), a prominent disciple, Sheela played associates a tape recording of a meeting she had had with Rajneesh about the [...] "need to kill people" [...] in order to strengthen wavering sannyasins resolve in participating in her murderous plots: [...] "She came back to the meeting and [...] began to play the tape. It was a little hard to hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> [...] And the gist of Bhagwan's response, yes, {{it was going to be}} necessary to kill people to stay in Oregon. And that actually killing people wasn't such a bad thing. And actually Hitler was a great man, although he could not say that publicly because nobody would understand that. Hitler had great vision." [...] Sheela initiated attempts to murder Rajneesh's caretaker and girlfriend, Ma Yoga Vivek, and his personal physician, Swami Devaraj (Dr. George Meredith), because she thought that they were a threat to Rajneesh. She had secretly recorded a conversation between Devaraj and Rajneesh [...] "in which the doctor agreed to obtain drugs the guru wanted to ensure a peaceful death if he decided to take his own life".|$|E
