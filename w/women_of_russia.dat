The Union of <b>Women</b> <b>of</b> <b>Russia</b> had looked at the manifestos of 30 parties due to contest the December 1993 parliamentary elections and was unhappy about the lack of attention to women's issues. After writing to the parties and only receiving three, superficial responses, and amid concerns that the party lists contained few women, the decision was taken to form the party.|$|E

50|$|In {{nineteenth century}} Russia, the astounding {{literature}} being produced “equalled that written at any place {{at any time}} in history.” Aleksandr Pushkin (1799-1837), Mikhail Lermontov (1814-1841), Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852), Ivan Turgenev (1818-1883), Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821-1881), and Lev Tolstoi (1828-1910) were prominent Russian writers, who with their great literary achievements, helped make the nineteenth century the “Golden Age of the Russian novel”.

50|$|Women's higher {{profile in}} post-Soviet Russia also has {{extended}} to politics. At the national level, {{the most notable}} manifestation of women's newfound political success has been the <b>Women</b> <b>of</b> <b>Russia</b> party, which won 11 {{percent of the vote}} and twenty-five seats in the 1993 national parliamentary elections. Subsequently, the party became active in a number of issues, including the opposition to the military campaign in Chechnya that began in 1994. In the 1995 national parliamentary elections, the <b>Women</b> <b>of</b> <b>Russia</b> chose to maintain its platform unchanged, emphasizing social issues such as the protection of children and women rather than entering into a coalition with other liberal parties. As a result, the party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold of votes required for proportional representation in the new State Duma, gaining only three seats in the single-seat portion of the elections. The party considered running a candidate in the 1996 presidential election but remained outside the crowded field.|$|E
50|$|In the 1995 {{elections}} {{the party}} was expected to pass the 5% electoral threshold, but received 4.6% of the vote, failing to win any of the proportional seats, and only winning three seats.

Frequently the audience on Friday night broke into fervent applause as Stalin or his marshals (Timoshenko, Budenny, Voroshilov) appeared briefly on the screen. The awakening of the nation into the dread reality of war has been well dramatised, as has the Soviet's call upon its oil resources and its men and <b>women.</b> The scenes <b>of</b> <b>Russia's</b> scorched-earth policy in operation show the ruthlessness of this last defensive action, and add to the pathos of a film that pays tribute to a most heroic nation.|$|R
40|$|Human {{trafficking}} {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing criminal activities in today’s world and a violation of human rights. Sex trafficking <b>of</b> <b>women</b> from <b>Russia</b> and Ukraine was enabled by the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the incorporation of the new countries into the global economy. At the same time, this social problem generated a series of anti-trafficking campaigns in Russia, Ukraine, and internationally. This research analyzes social responses to the risks of sex trafficking <b>of</b> <b>women</b> from <b>Russia</b> and Ukraine. The analysis is based on sixteen-month multi-sited field research in Russia and Ukraine. I collected data through participant observation, interviewing, and document analysis. The research provides insight into the supply and demand sides of sex-trafficking markets and describes how sex trafficking <b>of</b> <b>women</b> is integrated into the overall organization of the global sex trade. I use institutional ethnography to map out different anti-trafficking institutions (NGOs, governmental offices, international organizations) and examine social relations engendered by anti-trafficking mobilizations. My research analyzes institutional interventions aimed at minimizing the risks to sex trafficking victims. I explore how the institutional actors form transnational regulatory spaces to combat the problem of sex trafficking. Finally, I analyze how female trafficking survivors negotiate their identities in response to the institutional power of anti-trafficking NGOs that assist them...|$|R

40|$|Feminism {{emerged as}} an {{important}} ideological trend in contemporary <b>Russia.</b> Different strands <b>of</b> this thought focus on divergent problems experienced by Russian women.

The difference in the focus of attention is reminiscent of the pre-existing Western division of the feminist thought on the feminism of equality and feminism of difference. This paper will consider the main directions of these debates in Russia focusing on key aspects pondered by feminism in general. It will also argue that the state deploys both strands of feminist thought selectively in situations that suits its ideological and political purposes...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Women</b> <b>of</b> {{eighteenth-century}} <b>Russia</b> were luckier {{than their}} European counterparts in some ways; in others, the life <b>of</b> a Russian <b>woman</b> was more difficult. The eighteenth-century {{was a time}} of social and legal changes that began to affect women {{in a way that they}} had never before experienced. Peter the Great ruled Russia from 1682-1725 and in that time brought about many changes to Russian culture, altering the orthodox traditions that had been observed since the fall of the Byzantine Empire. The three major social classes present during these reforms experienced changes in varying degrees according to their proximity to the tsar and urban settings where reforms could be more strictly enforced. Large cities underwent the westernization process more rapidly and successfully than the outlying rural villages. Noblewomen, merchant class women, and peasant (serf) women each witnessed Petrine reforms differently. For the lower classes it was not until the end of the eighteenth-century (during the time of Catherine the Great’s reign) that they began to see any changes at all. When these reforms did begin to change women’s lives legally, they also helped to expand their abilities socially. The Petrine reforms of this century allowed for more female participation in society, when before they were merely an afterthought as wives and mothers. “The change in women’s place in Russian society can be illustrated no better than by the fact that five women ruled the empire, in their own names, for a total of seventy years.” ...|$|R
