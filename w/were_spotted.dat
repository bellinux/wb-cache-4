5|$|Helgoland and six destroyers {{attempted}} {{to duplicate the}} success of the earlier raid on 18–19 October, but they <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> by Italian aircraft and turned back in the face of substantial Allied reinforcements alerted by the aircraft. She was caught under the guns of several mutinous armored cruisers during the Gulf of Kotor Mutiny in February 1918, but managed to escape without damage.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 U.S. recon {{photographs}} uncovered {{an unusual}} sight. POL barrels <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> {{floating in the}} waters of the Kong River south of Ban Bak, Laos. Soon, PAVN was making use of the Banghiang River which flowed southwestward from the Demilitarized Zone {{all the way to the}} Mekong River, for the same purposes. The watertight drums were launched en masse from tributary streams into the main channel, floated downstream, and were recovered by systems of nets and booms. The Kaman River was added to the system in 1969. By 1970 the North Vietnamese were making intense use of streams and rivers to supplement their logistical route, especially in the rainy season, when the water levels rose and the roadways became impassable mires. During one two and one-half month period during 1969, over 10,000 POL barrels <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> in the waterways of southeastern Laos.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{broadcast}} of Series 15 of Top Gear in 2010, the cast of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> and recorded driving along the A303 {{in what appeared to}} be house cars. The video was recorded and put on YouTube.|$|E
50|$|Large cats have <b>been</b> <b>spotted</b> {{near the}} river but as always these animals are elusive. A black panther <b>was</b> <b>spotted</b> {{approximately}} 2 km from the river in 1986. Jaguars have <b>been</b> <b>spotted</b> near the Haucas River Gorge.|$|R

5000|$|A rare {{visitor to}} the United States, a black-tailed gull <b>was</b> <b>spotted</b> from Burlington, Vermont, in October 2005. [...] The bird has <b>been</b> <b>spotted</b> in Illinois several times.|$|R
5|$|The four {{remaining}} North Korean pilots immediately {{retreated to}} the north. The aircraft likely staged at Pyongyang Air Base, and informed their superiors. No additional North Korean aircraft <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> {{in the area for}} the rest of the day. By the end of the day the US aircraft from the three squadrons had flown 163 sorties.|$|E
5|$|As the DVD {{featurette}} Within a Minute illustrates, {{the film}} required 910 artists and 70,441 man-hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone. Members of Hyperspace, the Official Star Wars Fan Club, received a special {{look into the}} production. Benefits included not only special articles, but they also received access to a webcam that transmitted a new image every 20 seconds during {{the time it was}} operating in Fox Studios Australia. Many times the stars, and Lucas himself, <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> on the webcam.|$|E
5|$|Bompart's {{squadron}} departed Brest {{late in the}} evening, {{hoping to}} slip past the inshore British blockade in the dark. However, they took too long to navigate the Raz passage, and <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> at dawn on 17 September by a frigate squadron under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, in HMS Boadicea. Keats immediately divided his forces, ordering HMS Ethalion under Captain George Countess and the brig HMS Sylph under Commander John Chambers White to follow the French force, while Keats brought news of the French movements to Admiral Lord Bridport, admiral of the Channel Fleet.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 French agents {{reported}} that the Germans were planning to mount an offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk {{in the ground and}} served by rail links. The first signs of abnormal activity at Mimoyecques <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> by analysts at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit in September 1943, when aerial reconnaissance revealed that the Germans were building railway loops leading to the tunnels into the eastern and western sites. Further reconnaissance flights in October 1943 photographed large-scale activity around the tunnels.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Loring's bombers {{were placed}} on alert after Soviet {{submarines}} <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> {{off the coast of}} the region. The base was briefly mentioned in the 1983 movie WarGames, although the film erroneously listed Loring as being home to the 43rd Bombardment Wing. In 1982, the base was hit by two earthquakes, which damaged the base hospital and caused cracks to appear {{on the walls of the}} control tower.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 2010, Hyde Park was {{the setting}} for a prayer vigil with Pope Benedict XVI {{as part of his}} visit to the United Kingdom, {{attended}} by around 80,000 people. A large crowd assembled along the Mall to see the Pope arrive for his address. An attempt to assassinate the Pope had been foiled after five street cleaners <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> within a mile of Hyde Park, and arrested along with sixth suspect.|$|E
25|$|A tornado <b>was</b> <b>spotted</b> in Sanilac County, Michigan around 5:21 pm EDT on August 23, after a hot muggy day caused {{convection}} east of {{an oncoming}} (eastbound) cold front.

5000|$|In {{following}} years, {{a number}} of other seals have <b>been</b> <b>spotted</b> around Japan. In 2004 [...] "Kamo-chan", a one year old <b>spotted</b> seal, <b>was</b> <b>spotted</b> near Kamogawa, Chiba and in 2011 [...] "Ara-chan", another spotted seal, appeared in Saitama Prefecture's Arakawa river in 2011.|$|R
5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} of trucks <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> by Jersey City police {{entering}} {{the city on the}} skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they were told that the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E
5|$|Sailing to Senegal {{and then}} Cayenne, La Meillerie's {{operations}} {{had little effect}} and by 18 May he {{was already on the}} return journey to France, hoping to anchor in the Biscay port of Rochefort. On 27 July, the frigates <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> by HMS Mars, a ship of the line of the British blockade squadron, and chased with the frigate Rhin rapidly falling behind. Declining to support the straggler, La Meillerie ran on towards France while Mars took possession of Rhin, and the surviving ships found safe ports along the Biscay coast.|$|E
5|$|The first flames <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> at 6:00pm, {{under the}} door of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the {{curtains}} and wood panels, and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace initially panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did not call for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, {{at the other end of}} the palace complex.|$|E

5|$|Unbeknownst to Cos, {{as early}} as September 18, several Texians, {{including}} James Fannin, Philip Dimmitt, and John Lin, had independently begun advocating a plan to seize Cos at either Copano or Goliad. As soon as Cos's warships <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> approaching Copano Bay, Refugio colonists sent messengers to San Felipe de Austin and Matagorda to inform the other settlements of Cos's imminent arrival. Concerned {{that a lack of}} artillery would make the presidio at Goliad impossible to capture, the central committee chose not to order an assault.|$|E
5|$|A large Japanese {{air raid}} at 12:30 by 20 fighters and 12 bombers struck the Australian {{positions}} around Launch Jetty and the Finschhafen airstrip. About 60 bombs were dropped. There were heavy casualties. The 2/3rd Field Company lost 14 killed and 19 wounded; the 2/12th Field Regiment lost two killed and 16 wounded, {{and the air}} liaison party's headquarters was hit, knocking out its radio set and killing Captain Ferrel, its commander. Another eight men were killed and 40 wounded in air raids on 25 September. During the night of 25/26 September, Japanese barges and a submarine <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> offshore. Windeyer had to bring a company of the 2/17th Infantry Battalion back to protect the brigade area.|$|E
5|$|After 17:30 Kamimura led his {{division}} in a fruitless pursuit {{of some of}} the Russian cruisers, leaving Tōgō's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 and opened fire when the range closed to 8000–9000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20:08 as night was falling. The surviving Russian ships <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range.|$|E
50|$|It was {{announced}} by Gary Michael Walters that production would start filming in summer 2017. On May 26, 2017, the film's crew <b>was</b> <b>spotted</b> at a farm filming the movie in London.

5|$|As {{the column}} {{approached}} Villers-Bocage, an Sd.Kfz. 231 armoured car crew observed the British advance and escaped. At 08:30, having covered , the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered {{the town to}} be greeted by celebrating residents; two German soldiers <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> leaving at high speed in a Volkswagen Kübelwagen. The two Hussar regiments made contact with German forces {{on either side of}} the 22nd Brigade group route and the 8th Hussars engaged German eight-wheeler armoured cars. The Hussars reported German tanks heading towards Villers-Bocage, but Lieutenant Charles Pearce, of 4th CLY, thought that these were probably self-propelled guns.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the invasion, the Syrian force {{consisted}} of a reinforced infantry brigade, supplemented by at least one armored battalion (including Renault R35 tanks) and a field artillery battalion. The troops moved to Kafr Harib and <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> by Haganah reconnaissance, but because the attack was not expected, the Israeli troops did not attack the invaders. At night between 15 and 16 May, the bulk of the Syrian forces set up camp in Tel al-Qasr in the southwestern Golan. One company with armored reinforcements split up to the south to proceed to the Jewish water station on the Yarmouk riverbank.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} month of the war the Royal Air Force (RAF) mostly focused its bomber attacks against anti-shipping {{operations}} on the German Bight.

Twenty-four twin-engine Vickers Wellington from No. 9 Squadron, No. 37 Squadron and No. 149 Squadron formed up over Norfolk heading for the island of Heligoland. Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects, but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and <b>were</b> <b>spotted</b> by a Freya radar on the East Frisian Islands.|$|E
