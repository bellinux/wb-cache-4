5|$|Cordray was unopposed in the May 7, 2002, primary {{election}} for the Democratic nomination as Franklin County treasurer. He defeated Republican incumbent Wade Steen, {{who had been}} appointed in May 2001 to replace Bobbie M. Hall. The election was close, unofficially 131,199–128,677 (50.5%–49.5%), official margin of victory 3,232. Cordray was the first Democrat to hold the position since 1977, and he assumed office on December 9, 2002, instead of after January 1 because he <b>was</b> <b>filling</b> Hall's unexpired term.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} with the {{discovery}} of the first transuranic elements, which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states like the lanthanides, that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals, with the transition-metal-like chemistry of the early actinides being the exception and not the rule. In 1945, when American physicist Glenn T. Seaborg and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium, he realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and <b>was</b> <b>filling</b> an f-block row, instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium filling a fourth d-block row.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} {{was not included in}} the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, they gave the stunt performer who <b>was</b> <b>filling</b> in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they could notify the network that the man out of focus was indeed clothed. The lights that can be seen in the distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930, and particularly its edicts concerning on-screen violence, Warners allowed Cagney a change of pace. They cast him in the comedy Blonde Crazy, again opposite Blondell. As he completed filming, The Public Enemy <b>was</b> <b>filling</b> cinemas with all-night showings. Cagney began to compare his pay with his peers, thinking his contract allowed for salary adjustments based on the success of his films. Warner Bros. disagreed, however, and refused to give him a raise. The studio heads also insisted that Cagney continue promoting their films, even ones he was not in, which he opposed. Cagney moved back to New York, leaving his brother Bill to look after his apartment.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel <b>was</b> <b>filling</b> with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E

25|$|A new {{cemetery}} {{was opened}} in 1842 on a ground behind the Elizabethan manor, Egerton House (now {{the site of}} the Rex Cinema), by Carlotte Catherine Anne, Countess of Bridgewater and widow of John Egerton, 7th Earl of Bridgewater. The cemetery, situated between Three Close Lane and the old St Peter's rectory, was extended in 1921. There are several Commonwealth War Graves in the cemetery from both World War I and World War II, and among the notable burials is the grave of General Horace Smith-Dorrien, a veteran of the Second Boer War and World War I and former Governor of Gibraltar. By the late 1940s the cemetery <b>was</b> <b>filling</b> up and a new civic cemetery was opened at nearby Kingshill.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{portion of}} the {{mountain}} {{is made up of}} volcanic and sedimentary deposits of what once was one or more island arcs of the Farallon Plate dating back to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, between 90 and 190 million years ago. During this time, the Farallon Plate was subducting beneath the North American continent. These deposits were scraped off the top and accreted onto the North American Plate. This resulted in the highly distorted and fractured basalt and serpentine of the Mount Diablo Ophiolite and metasediments of the Franciscan complex around the summit. East of the subduction zone, a basin <b>was</b> <b>filling</b> with sediment from the ancestral Sierra further to the east. Up to 60,000 feet (18,000 m) of sandstone, mudstone, and limestone of the Great Valley Sequence were deposited from 66 to 150 million years ago. These deposits are now found faulted against the Ophiolite and Franciscan deposits.|$|E

Houston responded with a 91-yard drive that consumed 9:44 and ended on Moon's 14-yard touchdown pass to running back Allen Pinkett. Then on the first play of Cleveland's next drive, Browns quarterback Don Strock, who <b>was</b> <b>filling</b> in for the injured Bernie Kosar and starting in a playoff game {{for the first time in}} his 16-season career, fumbled a snap and Oilers defensive lineman Richard Byrd recovered the ball. Strock sprained his wrist while going after the ball on the play, and was replaced by third-string quarterback Mike Pagel. Meanwhile, Houston scored on their first play after the turnover with Pinkett's 16-yard touchdown run, making the score 14–3. They had a chance to score again near the end of the half, but Wright picked off Moon's pass in the end zone.|$|E
25|$|A second theatre, {{the indoor}} Angus Bowmer Theatre (see below), opened in 1970, {{enabling}} OSF {{to expand its}} season into the spring and fall; within a year, attendance tripled to 150,000. Bowmer retired in 1971, and leadership of the festival passed to Jerry Turner, a respected actor/director and later a translator of Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg. He widened the Festival repertory to production of classics {{by the likes of}} Moliere, Ibsen, and Chekhov. By 1976, the festival <b>was</b> <b>filling</b> 99% of its seats while offering some 275 performances of eight plays each season. In 1977, the festival opened a third theatre, dubbed the Black Swan (see below), in what originally was an auto dealership, and attendance reached 300,000. By 1979, the year that Bowmer died, the Festival was producing 11 plays a season, the number that has been standard ever since. In 1983 OSF won both its first Tony Award for outstanding achievement in regional theatre and the National Governors’ Association Award for distinguished service to the arts, the first ever to a performing arts organization.|$|E

25|$|On the {{extinction}} of a religious house in any place, the property and rights of the religious revert to the Church, as represented by the local diocesans. But Catholic Europe was so incensed against Portugal for the initiative taken by the Marquess of Pombal against the Society of Jesus, that without waiting to weigh the justice of their action in turn, reprisals became {{the order of the}} day in the Diocese of Saint Thomas of Mylapur, the Congregation de propaganda fide supporting the missionaries of other nationalities against the Portuguese. On the suppression of the Society of Jesus by the Holy See, the Fathers of the Missions étrangères of Paris were sent out to take charge of the Society's missions in the Dioceses of Saint Thomas of Mylapur and of Cochin, of which Msgr Champenois, Bishop in partibus of Dolichum, was appointed Apostolic Vicar. Bishop São Caetano resented this, as he <b>was</b> <b>filling</b> up the places of the Jesuits with Indian secular missionaries from Goa; but his protests were of little avail. In course of time, as the members of the other religious orders died out, these same Indian missioners from Goa assumed charge of their churches under the order of their diocesans, though more often than not there was a dispute between them and the missionaries Apostolic. The latter did not hesitate to misrepresent the Goan missionaries to be ignorant and immoral as a whole though the diocesan seminary at Goa was conducted by the Jesuits until their suppression, and thereafter by members of the other religious orders until 1835. On the other hand, between 1652 and 1843, no less than seven of their fellow-countrymen were deemed worthy of episcopal consecration by the Crown of Portugal, the Holy See and the Sacred Congregation de Propaganda Fide, not to speak of the Venerable Joseph Vaz, who was of their race. Howbeit, since then the majority of the priests working in the diocese were Indian Secular missionaries from Goa.|$|E
