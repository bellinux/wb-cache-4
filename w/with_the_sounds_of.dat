5|$|Powerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of {{hardcore}} punk. The {{style is}} closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of Lärm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> bands such as Man Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} to allow this type of performance was a very unusual one for the city's government to make, as all other regions had instituted very restrictive laws regarding the musical performance of slaves, and even New Orleans had legislation that eliminated essentially every other aspect of the African culture. Nevertheless, the former Africans were able to play their traditional music, which started to intermingle <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the many other cultures in New Orleans at the time: Haitian, European, Cuban, and American, {{as well as many}} other smaller denominations. However, the people playing in Congo Square were not of the younger generation, the one traditionally associated with innovation and new attitudes toward mixing culture, but older musicians.|$|E
25|$|The guqin {{is nearly}} always used a solo instrument, as its {{quietness}} of tone {{means that it}} cannot compete <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> most other instruments or an ensemble. It can, however, be played together with a xiao (end-blown bamboo flute), with other qin, or played while singing. In old times, the se (a long zither with movable bridges and 25 strings) was frequently used in duets with the qin. Sadly, the se has not survived, though duet tablature scores for the instruments are preserved in a few qinpu, and the master qin player Wu Jinglüe {{was one of only}} a few in the twentieth century who knew how to play it together with qin in duet. Lately there has been a trend to use other instruments to accompany the qin, such as the xun (ceramic ocarina), pipa (four-stringed pear-shaped lute), dizi (transverse bamboo flute), and others for more experimental purposes.|$|E

25|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> battle echoing in the distance, Lt. Col. Manuel Chaves of the 2nd New Mexico Infantry, {{commander}} of the New Mexican volunteers, informed Maj. Chivington that his scouts had located the Confederate supply train at Johnson's Ranch. After watching the supply train for an hour, Chivington's force descended the slope and attacked, driving off or capturing the small guard with few casualties on either side. They then looted and burned 80 supply wagons and spiked the cannon, either killing or driving off about 500 horses and mules before returning with their prisoners to Kozlowski's Ranch. With no supplies to sustain his advance, Scurry had to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step on the long road back to San Antonio, Texas. Thanks to Chaves' assistance, the Federals had turned a defeat into victory and stopped further Confederate advances in the Southwest. Glorieta Pass was therefore the turning point {{of the war in}} the New Mexico Territory.|$|E
25|$|The Morgan State University Choir {{is one of}} the nation’s {{most prestigious}} {{university}} choral ensembles and was led {{for more than three decades}} by the late Dr. Nathan Carter, celebrated conductor, composer, and arranger. The groups that are subdivisions of the critically acclaimed choir include the University Choir, which is over 140 voices strong, and The Morgan Singers (approximately 40 voices). While classical, gospel, and contemporary popular music comprise the majority of the choir’s repertoire, the choir is noted for its emphasis on preserving the heritage of the spiritual, especially in the historic practices of performance. The Morgan State University Choir has performed for audiences throughout the United States and all over the world—including The Bahamas, Virgin Islands, Canary Islands, Canada, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Their most recent international appearance was in Saint Petersburg, Russia, at the invitation of Maestro Yuri Temirkanov, music director and conductor for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. In Russia, the Choir performed in the 5th International Festival Arts Square and was received enthusiastically by their Russian audiences. The Choir has appeared at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., and at the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York City on numerous occasions, performing and premiering works such as John Corigliano’s “Poem On His Birthday,” “Too Hot to Handel” arranged by Broadway composers Bob Christianson and Gary Anderson and Hannibal Lokumbe’s “African Portraits”, led by music director Leonard Slatkin, as part of the Kennedy Center’s African Festival. One of the Choir’s most historic moments came with the opportunity to sing under the baton of Robert Shaw, conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke's and joined by Jessye Norman and others in Carnegie Hall’s One Hundredth Birthday Tribute to Marian Anderson. A major milestone and historical movement occurred during the 1996–1997 season <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the “Silver Anniversary” concert being broadcast into households throughout the state of Maryland. The concert won three Emmy Awards for Maryland Public Television (MPT). MPT continues to air this hallmark performance during select sections of their membership drives. In 1993, the choir joined actor James Earl Jones in a performance of the Star-Spangled Banner at the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, broadcast on CBS.|$|E

500|$|... "Lucky Star" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{recorded}} by American singer Madonna for her eponymous debut studio album (1983). It was released as the fourth single from the album on September 8, 1983 by Sire Records. [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was produced by Reggie Lucas. However, during recording, Madonna was not impressed by Lucas' version. She called her then-boyfriend John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to remix the track according to her ideas. [...] "Lucky Star" [...] is a medium-paced dance track and combines the heavy beats of a drum <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> a guitar played in a high riff. The lyrics juxtapose the male body with the heavenly stars in the sky.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Leaving the City" [...] slowly builds {{up during the}} {{introduction}} and uses out of tune instrumentation and a repetitive chorus. Following [...] "Sinking Feeling", which uses a beat constructed from clicking sounds, is [...] "Night of the Dancing Flame", which combines synthesisers with 1920s jazz. It is written in waltz time and was compared to Stevie Wonder's work during his peak. After opening with noises such as rustling and coughing, the longest track [...] "Through Time" [...] proceeds into a ballad that was compared to those by Carole King. The fifth track [...] "Sow into You" [...] was released as the album's second single. The song uses a metaphor of rain and harvests to describe love and sex, atop a baroque pop brass arrangement. [...] "Dear Diary" [...] is a torch song mixing northern soul with disco music <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> doorbells and telephones ringing.|$|E
500|$|Rather Ripped is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} band's most accessible albums, featuring an abundance of concise and catchy melodies. Moore described it as [...] "a super song record" [...] that contains [...] "rockers and ballads". In addition, seven of the album's 12 tracks have a duration of less than four minutes, a feature that is uncommon in previous Sonic Youth releases. The album generally favors guitar textures over feedback or noise, which typically characterized the band's earlier works. Dave Heaton of PopMatters remarked that the guitars on Rather Ripped are joined together to form a vibrant and mysterious sound, stating that [...] "it often feels like Sonic Youth are taking all the instrumental tricks they've learned over the years and putting them in the service of building a lasting landscape of guitar sounds, one that reverberates <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the past but also feels eternally youthful".|$|E

500|$|... "City of Angels" [...] is a synthrock {{song with}} {{influences}} and elements from experimental music. It opens with an instrumental section and [...] "gently burbling" [...] synthesizers. It follows <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> drum beats, including taiko drums, then transitions into a piano melody. After the first verse, the chorus follows, with Leto singing, [...] "Lost in the City of Angels / Down {{in the comfort}} of strangers / I found myself in the fire burned hills / In the land of a billion lights". During the bridge, he ornaments his vocal lines with melodic crescendos, affirming [...] "I am home". After the final chorus, the song reaches a drum-heavy climax. Emily Zemler from Billboard cited [...] "City of Angels" [...] as an example of variety and experimentation in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. She described the song as a [...] "pulsating, subtler track that employs a blipping electronic beat rather than the band's usual rock backdrop".|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Tippett {{produced}} three single-movement instrumental works: the Symphony No. 4 (1977), the String Quartet No. 4 (1978), and the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello (1979). [...] The symphony, {{written in the}} manner of the tone poem or symphonic fantasia exemplified by Sibelius, represents what Tippett describes as a birth-to-death cycle, beginning and ending <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> breathing. This effect was initially provided by a wind machine, although other means have been tried, with mixed results—according to Bowen [...] "the sounds emitted can turn out to be redolent of a space-fiction film or a bordello". [...] The Fourth String Quartet, Tippett explains, is an exercise in [...] "finding a sound" [...] that he first encountered in the incidental music to a television programme on Rembrandt. In the Triple Concerto, which is thematically related to the Fourth Quartet and quotes from it, the three solo instruments [...] perform individually rather than as a formal grouping. The work acknowledges Tippett's past with quotations from The Midsummer Marriage.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{considered}} [...] "Subtle Invitation" [...] {{to be one}} of the album's strongest songs {{because of}} its [...] "well executed" [...] jazz influence. The song begins <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> people dining, then introduces the strong bassline and drums. Towards the end of the song, Carey belts out the climax. Sarah Rodman from The Boston Herald described it as fascinating and wrote, [...] "it sounds as though Carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice." [...] "Clown" [...] drew strong media attention, and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper Eminem, who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey. Rodman said [...] "Clown" [...] was [...] "languidly sinister", with lyrics such as, [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / when you know very well we never even touched each other." [...] Critics compared [...] "I Only Wanted" [...] with [...] "My All"s instrumentation and structure of verse, chorus and guitar solo. According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, Carey makes vague allusions to her ex-husband Tommy Mottola with the line, [...] "Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil". The song uses Latin-inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody, and dripping water as its percussion.|$|E

500|$|Atlus's senior {{project manager}} Masaru Nanba commented {{it was decided}} that [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] was to be kept in the title of Persona 3 and Persona 4, as it was {{believed}} that {{they were part of the}} same series as however, the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] title was omitted from both Persona 4 Golden and Persona 4 Arena, as it would have been much too long. Similarly, Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena and Persona 4: The Golden were shortened to the previously stated titles. As with Persona 3, the honorifics used in the Japanese voice track were retained in the English dub, despite proving contentions among series fans. This was done as part of an intended trend to remain faithful to the original source material. The pronunciations of honorifics, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> names, were a point that was carefully considered by the localization team and it took a while for the English cast to get used to them. A member of the English dub that also appeared in Persona 3 was Yuri Lowenthal. Though he had dubbed characters in Persona 3, Namba wanted him to have a larger part. His role as Yosuke ended up featuring 1000 more lines of dialogue than the other major characters. Important roles for the localization team were Teddie and Rise, as they would be the party's supports. Another element in the English script was that the use of swear words was increased over Persona 3: the first draft featured very strong language which was cut as it did not seem suited. The character Kanji was given a lot of swearing in his dialogue, due to his volatile nature. The use of swearing was carefully considered depending on the emotional situation.|$|E
