50|$|Making {{his will}} on 18 February 1607, {{he died on}} 30 May and was buried at Bearsted. In his will, proved on 11 June, he left small bequests to {{household}} servants, to the village church, to the poor in surrounding parishes and to the prisoners in Maidstone gaol. Legacies also went to his sister Catherine and brother Hugh. Most of his extensive real estate and personal effects were divided among his three surviving sons Thomas, John and Robert, with Robert also getting cash of 600 pounds (worth at least 120,000 pounds in 2015). To his three surviving daughters, Joan, Catherine and Sarah, bequests were minor, presumably because they already had portions on marrying. His wife Barbara kept her own goods and lands that she had brought to the marriage, with Thomas asked to let her live on at Milgate.

A national telephone survey conducted in 2012 with 2, 405 respondents aged 18 and over shows that <b>wills</b> <b>are</b> <b>predominantly</b> used to distribute assets to partners and/or equally to immediate descendants.

Only a minority consider bequests to charities as important. These findings reflect current social norms about entitlements to ‘family’ money, a narrow view of what and who constitutes ‘family’, limited obligation for testators to recompense individuals or organisations for care and support provided, and limited commitment to charitable organisations and civil society...|$|R

From 1939 to 1959, a blue shirt with a white 'v' was a common design.

Barrow's second kit from 2011 until 2013 was sky blue, however for the 2013/14 season, Barrow resolved back to a yellow away kit, and a blue and white hooped home kit.
