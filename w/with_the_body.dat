5|$|Vitamin E is the {{collective}} {{name for a}} set of eight related tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are fat-soluble vitamins with antioxidant properties. Of these, α-tocopherol has been most studied as it has the highest bioavailability, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> preferentially absorbing and metabolising this form.|$|E

Contemporary poster art also portrays Kamadhenu in this form.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these pupae emerge fully formed, sexually mature adult beetles, or imagos. Pupae never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the {{appendages}} are not {{attached to the}} body and {{are said to be}} exarate; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> (termed as obtect pupae).|$|E

5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or in contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, {{and then go}} into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E

5|$|Like many bipedal dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex was {{historically}} {{depicted as}} a 'living tripod', <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> at 45 degrees or less from the vertical and the tail dragging along the ground, similar to a kangaroo. This concept dates from Joseph Leidy's 1865 reconstruction of Hadrosaurus, the first to depict a dinosaur in a bipedal posture. In 1915, convinced that the creature stood upright, Henry Fairfield Osborn, {{former president of the}} American Museum of Natural History, further reinforced the notion in unveiling the first complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton arranged this way. It stood in an upright pose for 77 years, until it was dismantled in 1992.|$|E
5|$|René Descartes {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} dualism to tackle {{the issue of the}} brain's relation to the mind. He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid. This dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home.

Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery.

5|$|The spells of the Book of the Dead {{made use}} of several magical {{techniques}} which {{can also be seen}} in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets, which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy. Everyday magic {{made use of}} amulets in huge numbers. Other items in direct contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value. A number of spells also refer to Egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva.|$|E

5|$|On March 7, 1988, {{three weeks}} after Hairspray was {{released}} nationwide, Divine was staying at the Regency Plaza Suites Hotel in Los Angeles. He was scheduled to film a guest appearance the following day as Uncle Otto on the Fox network's television series Married... with Children in the second season wrap-up episode. After spending all day at Sunset Gower Studios for rehearsals, Divine returned to his hotel that evening, where he dined with friends at the hotel restaurant before returning to his room. Shortly before midnight, he died in his sleep, at age 42, of an enlarged heart. His body was discovered by Bernard Jay the following morning, who then sat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> {{for the next six}} hours, alongside three of Divine's other friends. They contacted Thomas Noguchi, the Chief Coroner for the County of Los Angeles, who arranged for removal of the body; Divine's friends were able to prevent the press from taking any photographs of the body as it was being carried out of the hotel.|$|E

5|$|Soldiers of {{the species}} Globitermes sulphureus commit suicide by autothysis– rupturing a large gland {{just beneath the surface}} of their cuticles. The thick, yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air, {{entangling}} ants or other insects which are trying to invade the nest. Another termite, Neocapriterme taracua, also engages in suicidal defence. Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals, then deliberately rupture themselves, releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies. The soldiers of the neotropical termite family Serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> rupturing between the head and abdomen. When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders, they engage in autothysis, creating a block that denies entry to any attacker.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{maintained}} an elaborate set of burial customs {{that they believed}} were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by mummification, performing burial ceremonies, and interring <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> goods the deceased would use in the afterlife. Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation. The arid, desert conditions were a boon {{throughout the history of}} ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the internal organs, wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars.|$|E
5|$|The bones {{found on}} 25 August were {{uncovered}} on 4 September and the grave soil dug back further {{over the next}} two days. The feet were missing, and the skull was found in an unusual propped-up position, consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> being put into a grave that was slightly too small. The spine was curved in an S-shape. No sign of a coffin was found; the skeleton's posture suggested the body had not been put in a shroud, but had been hurriedly dumped into the grave and buried. As the bones were lifted from the ground, a piece of rusted iron was found underneath the vertebrae. The skeleton's hands were in an unusual position, crossed over the right hip, suggesting they were tied together at the time of burial, although this could not be established definitively. After the exhumation, work continued in the trenches over the following week, before the site was covered with soil to protect it from damage and re-surfaced to restore the car park and playground to their former condition.|$|E
