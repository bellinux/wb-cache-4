Thus a period of reconciliation began, which facilitated a close relationship between the Persians and Medes, and enabled Ecbatana, capital of Media, to pass to the Persians as one of Persia's capitals in the newly formed empire.|$|E

He agreed for them to appear when the premise for [...] "Regeneration" [...] was suggested, saying that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> concept I couldn’t resist it".

However, {{a month before}} the band released Leave Home, Ramones' manager Danny Fields announced to the band that Carbona was a registered trademark and that their record label had to remove the song from the album's track listing. Legs McNeil recalled: [...] "I was shocked. It <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> song, so radio-friendly—like a song the Beatles or the Rolling Stones would have written if they were just starting out in 1976, with great harmonies and catchy lyrics." [...] Although early purchasers of the Sire release got an album that included the song, [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was later replaced by [...] "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker" [...] for the US release, and [...] "Babysitter" [...] for the UK release. In the early 90's, after being unavailable for years, the song was bootlegged as a 45RPM single with [...] "I Can't Be" [...] as the B-side.

500|$|As a manager, he was {{a strict}} disciplinarian, {{possibly}} {{a result of his}} military background.

He used to bawl players out for different things. I could take it, but we had ball players, when he'd get on them, they'd go into a shell, resented it, and didn't give him their best." [...] Another Monarchs pitcher, Chet Brewer, said that [...] "Rogan wasn't the best manager because he <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> ball player himself. [...] He couldn't teach pitchers much, because he'd say, 'All {{you have to do is}} go out and throw the man what I threw'." [...] According to historian Phil Dixon, [...] "In Rogan's first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch-hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends." [...] He didn't trust younger players, often inserting himself to pitch or pinch-hit for them. He sometimes treated rookies harshly. Eventually Rogan [...] "discarded his distant approach" [...] and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players.|$|E

Jackson has declared herself [...] "a very big Joni Mitchell fan", explaining [...] "As a kid I was drawn to Joni Mitchell records [...] Joni's songs spoke to me in an intimate, personal way."

Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be." [...] She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration. In her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine as musical influences.

500|$|Alan Simpson, the co-writer of Hancock, enjoyed {{writing for}} Jacques, {{and thought that}} she was [...] "almost like a fella in terms of playing comedy; you didn't write for her {{thinking}} she's a woman so we've got to write the feminine point of view. That made it easier for us". Neville Phillips thought she was a [...] "complete revelation", adding [...] "although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she had a way of playing comedy that put me in mind of the great Beatrice Lillie... a subtle, sophisticated actress". Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: [...] "She <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> comedienne... everyone wanted her but the movers and shakers of entertainment didn't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady". Guy Pearce, writing in the Daily Express, noted that [...] "she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing 'the fattie'." [...] The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been [...] "unimaginatively cast as the 'fat person'" [...] in ITMA, while in Sykes, her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes [...] "hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change". Gray considers that [...] "although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight".|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> letter. I was very lonely at the time, {{but at the same time}} I was very depressed that I would never meet her." [...] Second single [...] "The Good Life" [...] chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote the song after [...] "becoming frustrated with that hermit's life I was leading, the ascetic life. And I think I was starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And so I wrote the song. And I started to turn around and come back the other way." [...] Lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] addresses Cuomo's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard; he explained that the song [...] "is more about me, because at that point I hadn't even talked to the girl, I didn't really know much about her." [...] The album's final single, [...] "Pink Triangle", describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.|$|E

2500|$|Wilt Chamberlain <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{player and}} {{dominant}} force {{that he would}} be certain to be on the floor in late-game situations if the score was close. [...] However, he was such a poor free throw shooter (51%) that if the opposition needed to employ intentional fouling late in the game, Chamberlain would always be that team's target. [...] Just as the opposition was eager to send Chamberlain to the free throw line because of his ineptitude there, Chamberlain himself was reluctant to go for that same reason. [...] This led to the spectacle of virtually an entire other game being held away from the ball and almost completely outside of the basketball game being played, as Chamberlain essentially played a de facto game of tag with defenders, attempting to run from and dodge them as they chased him trying to foul him.|$|E

Through it Enoch led his people to become so righteous and obedient that they qualified to be translated as the City of Enoch. Noah held this priesthood, as did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
