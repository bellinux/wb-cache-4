5|$|After the attack, Selver roams {{through the}} forest for five days before coming upon an Athshean settlement. After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes {{to the people of the}} town the destruction of his town, known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then built their headquarters at the site. He also tells them about the enslavement of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life in the same way that the Athsheans do, which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels back towards the Terran headquarters.|$|E
25|$|Frank's {{style was}} very innovative, which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had such {{difficulty}} with early acceptance. He would bend notes and sing about the chordal {{context of a}} note rather than to sing the note directly, and he stressed each rhythmic downbeat, which {{was different from the}} smooth balladeer of his time.|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu {{served in}} the privy council and {{was in charge of}} state secrets for a long time. He was not only a talented writer, but also a deep thinker who {{understood}} very well his place as a subject of his lord. He knew what his lord expected of him and adapted his behaviour accordingly to please his lord. That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> managed to remain in Emperor Wu's favour and live a comfortable life until his death.|$|E

25|$|Michaels and Nash did not reunite until June 3, 2002, when Kevin Nash named Shawn Michaels as {{the newest}} {{member of the}} New World Order (nWo). On the June 10 episode of Raw, Michaels {{explained}} that his best friend, Kevin Nash, was always there for him, which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> returned to WWE to {{become a member of the}} nWo. He then shocked the audience by hitting Booker T with Sweet Chin Music to remove him from the nWo.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Tandy {{was working}} on his fencing foil, with the handle held in a vice. Although there was nothing touching it, the blade started to vibrate wildly. Further investigation led Tandy {{to discover that the}} extractor fan in the lab was emitting a frequency of 18.98Hz, very close to the resonant frequency of the eye given as 18Hz by NASA. This, Tandy conjectured, <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had seen a ghostly figure—it was, he believed, an optical illusion caused by his eyeballs resonating. The room was exactly half a wavelength in length, and the desk was in the centre, thus causing a standing wave which caused the vibration of the foil.|$|E
25|$|After being {{visited by}} the three men, Abraham and Sarah settled between Kadesh and Shur {{in the land of}} the Philistines. While he was living in Gerar, Abraham again claimed that Sarah was his sister. King Abimelech {{subsequently}} had her brought to him. Later, God came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a married woman. Abimelech, who had not laid hands on her, inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> continued to exist. However, if he did not return Sarah to Abraham, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.|$|E
50|$|Now {{an orphan}} without {{his father and}} mother, he stayed {{for a moment in}} the circus. But in this environment, {{everything}} reminded him his parent and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> made the decision to go away to be able to forget. However, he did not wish to change climate and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> chooses to come to Montreal in Canada, a city as cold as Moscow.|$|R

25|$|At an Anglo-French {{conference at}} Calais (6 July) Joffre and Kitchener, who {{was opposed to}} “too vigorous” offensives, reached a {{compromise}} on “local offensives on a vigorous scale”, and Kitchener agreed to deploy New Army divisions to France. An inter-Allied conference at Chantilly (7 July, including Russian, Belgian, Serb and Italian delegates) agreed on coordinated offensives. However, Kitchener now came to support the upcoming Loos offensive. He travelled to France for talks with Joffre and Millerand (16 August). The French leaders believed Russia might sue for peace (Warsaw had fallen on 4 August). Kitchener (19 August) ordered the Loos offensive to proceed, despite the attack being on ground not favoured by French or Haig (then commanding First Army). The Official History later admitted that Kitchener hoped to be appointed Supreme Allied Commander. Liddell Hart speculated that this <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> {{allowed himself to be}} persuaded by Joffre. New Army divisions first saw action at Loos in September 1915.|$|E
25|$|Travis {{has been}} {{compared}} to other characters in fiction, primarily action characters. Game Revolution editor Jesse Constantino comments that while Grasshopper Manufacture tries to portray him as punk, he's no more punk than his grandmother's doll collection, comparing him to Sam Spade of The Maltese Falcon. He was also described as what the love child between Fight Clubs Tyler Durden and Kill Bills The Bride would be. Game designer Steve Gaynor compared Travis' clothing to Durden's as well. He {{has been compared}} to another character from Goichi Suda in the video game Flower, Sun, and Rain called Sumio Mondo. Gaming Nexus editor Matt Mirkovich praised the voice work of his voice actor Robin Atkin Downes, calling it one of the best works in gaming. Game Style editor Garry Webber described him as an unashamedly geeky otaku as well as an amoral contemptuous assassin, but added that this <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was so likable. G4 TV editor Matt Kiel stated that Travis is an especially noteworthy aspect of the quality plot, adding that while he's amoral and a jerk, {{he is one of the}} most likable video game characters in a long time. Fox News editor Lou Kesten described Travis as the Wii's most ridiculously violent hero. He was awarded best new character of 2008 by GamePro magazine, and was nominated by GameSpot for the same award.|$|E
25|$|Asafa Powell {{opened his}} 2010 season on 20 February at the UWI Invitational Meet in Jamaica, by {{competing}} in the 400m. He won his heat {{in a time of}} 47.56s, but he was placed 3rd overall according to his time. He then ran the 200m at the UTech Classic on 17 April 2010, also in his homeland. He competed in the 200m in heavy rain and cold conditions. Powell opened up a huge lead in the first 100m after which he slowed drastically and won his heat in 21.27s in a 1m/s headwind. Later it was reported that Powell had suffered minor cramps on his left calf muscles, which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had to slow down. Powell was next scheduled to run in the highly anticipated 4x100m Penn Relays featuring Jamaica Yellow, and competing against Usain Bolt (Jamaica Black). But he pulled out of the race as it was reported by his assistant coach that he had an injured toe which would need some time to heal. At the IAAF Diamond League in Doha, Powell made a wind aided time of 9.75s in the heat and 9.81s in the final,also wind-aided. He subsequently set a 100m world leading time of 9.83s. En route to this performance, he also set the rarely run 100 yards dash world best at 9.07 s, beating the previous record of 9.21 set by Charlie Greene.|$|E

500|$|As R.O.O.T.S. was Flo Rida's second studio album, {{he wanted}} to show {{listeners}} musical growth by [...] "broaden my horizons," [...] which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> decided to record the song. After Luke produced the sample, the song was recorded. In the same night the song was written Aaron Bay-Schuck, Bruno Mars and Philip Lawrance decided to go to the studio and make the initial recording. It was recorded primarily at Conway Studios in Hollywood, California, with additional recording at Atlantic Studios, also located in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|During {{hearings}} in 1947, Jack Warner included Rossen {{among the many}} openly leftist writers whom his studio, Warner Bros., had hired as the earliest and most openly anti-Nazi studios in Hollywood (Warner Bros had made Confessions of a Nazi Spy (1939) [...] and were attacked by the Republicans for this at the time). Warner reportedly accused Rossen of incorporating Communist propaganda in scripts and claimed this <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had fired him, though in fact {{the real reason for}} Warner's enmity with Rossen were his writer's union activities.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} of The Wall, Waters, Gilmour and Mason became increasingly dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution to the album. Gilmour said that Wright [...] "hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little" [...] and this <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> [...] "got the boot". According to Mason, [...] "Rick's contribution was to turn up and sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'." [...] Waters commented: [...] " [...] {{was not prepared to}} cooperate in making the record... it was agreed by everybody... either [...] can have a long battle or [...] can agree to... finish making the album, keep [...] full share... {{but at the end of}} it [...] leave quietly. Rick agreed." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for Hollyoaks confirmed that Ste didn't realise [...] "how much {{power and control}} Brendan was wielding over him". This was because Ste was still {{coming to terms with}} his sexuality. Ste felt a connection he never felt before because he hadn't had another male partner. Brendan manipulated Ste into believing he was to blame for Brendan's anger. The representative said this <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> ended up apologising. The storyline also aimed to shock viewers with the [...] "dark depths" [...] Brendan would go to in order to control Ste. Marquess later stated that Brendan's past would be explained and that everyone should remember it was Ste who used to hit Amy first, adding: [...] "So it's a dark and interwoven story made all the more complicated by the introduction of a new love interest for Ste".|$|E
500|$|On November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party {{executive}} council voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. [...] "The {{general sense of}} the council was that he wasn't a serious candidate and that <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wasn't selected {{to be on the}} ballot", stated John Werner, the party's director. In addition, he was declared [...] "not viable", as he was running in only one state. Several days later he announced that he was dropping out of the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle. CNN has reported that Obama supporters pressured the South Carolina Democratic Executive Council to keep Colbert off the ballot. One anonymous member of the council told CNN that former State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum had placed pressure on them to refuse Colbert's application despite his steady rise in polls.|$|E
500|$|Sivaji Ganesan {{was cast}} as the male lead. Both the female leads– B. Saroja Devi and Sowcar Janaki– were cast in roles {{different}} from what they were earlier proposed for. According to Ganesan's eldest son Ramkumar, [...] "Sivaji always thought of Sowcar Janaki as classy and sophisticated," [...] which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> cast her as a [...] "modern woman" [...] in Puthiya Paravai. [...] "Before that Sowcar had only acted in homely roles". Mirasi, who made a cameo appearance as the hero's father in the film, was initially not convinced about Janaki acting in the film. But after seeing her performance in the song [...] "Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo", Mirasi decided to include her {{for the rest of the}} film. Janaki added her own subtle distinctions and inputs to her role as portraying an out-and-out seductive vamp, according to her, would have felt deplorable. Nagesh, S. V. Ramadoss, V. K. Ramasamy, M. R. Radha, O. A. K. Thevar and Manorama were cast in supporting roles.|$|E

500|$|Cross {{wanted to}} write [...] "a really old-fashioned scary episode of Doctor Who" [...] {{targeted}} especially at children nine to twelve, which was how he remembered Doctor Who at that age. He stated that [...] "time travel and ghosts are echoes of one another. What is a ghost, if not a fragment caught in time?" [...] He aimed to show suspense and tension, as {{he felt it was}} more terrifying than [...] "full-on shock horror blood and gore". Cross was inspired by The Quatermass Experiment and its sequels, and originally intended to have the Doctor meet Bernard Quatermass, though this was not possible, for copyright reasons. Cross was also inspired by Quatermass writer Nigel Kneale's The Stone Tape, which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> set the story in the 1970s. [...] "Hide" [...] was intended to be a [...] "very small, very restricted ghost story", but he was asked to make it bigger in the end. The different universe was present, but it was [...] "smoke and mirrors" [...] and the climax originally took place in the house, just in daylight and in the alternate world. The idea of the Crooked Man was something Cross said lurked in his imagination. The love story twist was added in later, because Moffat felt the monster should be more fleshed out, and Cross chose to mirror the love plot between Emma and the Professor.|$|E
