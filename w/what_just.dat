These scenes are depicted amongst numerous flashback sequences that comprise most of the issue.

5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back over the edge of the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of <b>what</b> <b>just</b> occurred.|$|E

This isn’t a drunken, {{convenient}} hook-up. This isn’t a let’s-see-how-this-goes peck. This is two people acting on years of something unacknowledged between them.

500|$|While School Rumble is {{generally}} recognised as a shōnen title targeting the young male market, Katherine Luther, staff reviewer for About.com, refers {{to it as}} a shōjo title aimed at girls and young women. Lisa Marie, reviewer for RightStuf's Anime Today podcast, agrees that others, notably males, might see the series as shōjo. Luther calls the first DVD [...] "the perfect back-to-school accessory", while Marie characterizes School Rumble as [...] "insane", asserting it appears on the surface more laid back than other titles like Excel Saga and Haré + Guu. However, it uses its [...] "cast to breakevery rule of reality, but it plays everything so straight [...] it takes you a moment to realize <b>what</b> <b>just</b> happened doesn't make any sense." [...] A fan of the subgenre, she praises the anime it for its surreal humour, and for being [...] "anime newbie friendly" [...] in that its jokes work on multiple levels. Not all are of Japanese origin—such as a reference to the long triangular resolution of Star Wars Return of the Jedi—giving the series broad appeal.|$|E
500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. David Hinckley of New York Daily News rated it {{four out of}} five stars and commented that although it may not make sense to some viewers, it is [...] "equally possible they will keep watching anyway because the jokes work so well all by themselves". Hinckley went on to remark that [...] "Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes. Happily, its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of the references are whizzing by unappreciated". RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes [...] "visual [...] ", cultural references and [...] "so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes" [...] that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: [...] "For example, you might be laughing so hard at <b>what</b> <b>just</b> happened that you miss a fun line..." [...] Lastly, Wagner observed that [...] "Ugly Americans can be gross and bizarre, but everything makes sense in the world that it has created".|$|E

500|$|In [...] "", the childhood's {{background}} of Elle is further explained: how she started a blackout in Athens, Ohio that took out three other counties. Elle's mother {{sent her to}} his father, Bob, to New York City to deal with her. Bob asked the help of Charles Deveaux, who recommended taking a fatherly approach, but ended up taking Dr. Zimmerman's advice: treat Elle as any other posthuman and test her abilities. During one of these tests, Bob tried to calm the weeping Elle turning her drinking straw into gold, but this backfired as it allowed Elle to accidentally shock her father. After this, Elle escaped and Bob enlisted Noah Bennet to go after her. Noah eventually found Elle at an arcade and anticipating her attack, he wore latex gloves. Elle quickly electrified a machine making it toss balls at Noah, so she could escape. When Noah followed Elle through a mini-golf course, she electrified a mini-windmill, making it throw blades at Noah. Finally, Elle was cornered; Noah promised her Bob would be proud if she came back with him. Once back at Primatech, Bob locked Elle up while discussing the situation with Kaito and Noah. Angela brought a young Haitian to mind-wipe Elle to forget <b>what</b> <b>just</b> happened and enjoy her 9th birthday cake.|$|E
500|$|According to Stevens, {{in one of}} {{his first}} games as head coach, he was nervous and [...] "felt like our team played on edge" [...] because of it. He decided that a team's play will reflect the mood of its coach; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in {{difficult}} game situations, while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. [...] "I don’t want to lose a game because of my approach," [...] he told himself. Accordingly, he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional, instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms. He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes, preferring to focus on [...] "the next play" [...] rather than <b>what</b> <b>just</b> happened. Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler's 2010 Final Four run by saying, [...] "When those big runs [...] came, Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words. Then he said he believes in us, he loves us and we're going to win the game." [...] On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player, he does it with [...] "positive reinforcement, just at a little louder decibel", according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves. Above all, Stevens wants his players to be confident, not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play.|$|E
500|$|Chris {{is shown}} {{participating}} in the video [...] "Take on Me" [...] — a song released by a-ha in 1985 — while fetching milk for Lois. He then breaks out on the other side, with no understanding of <b>what</b> <b>just</b> happened. Lois calls on Brian saying {{he was too busy}} eye-balling Glenn Close on Redbook magazine. Chris watches the movie The Blob. Peter riding Falkor the luckdragon is a reference to fantasy novel The Neverending Story. The chase sequence between Lois and Joe is a reference to a sequence from Raiders of the Lost Ark as Joe is pulled along by the attached garden hose and pulls himself under the moving car. Peter goes to a book club while Lois is gone, where the members are reading The Lovely Bones. The Griffins escaping out of their apartment to evade Joe is a reference to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids, {{with the rest of the}} chase through Asiantown being a reference to Revenge of the Pink Panther. The police helicopter pilot in Asiantown stating he pretends he is shooting at Jamie Farr and Alan Alda when firing rockets is a reference to the actors of M*A*S*H. Joe shooting down two TIE fighters while flying through the sewer is a reference to Star Wars. Characters from the 1985 adventure–comedy film The Goonies are seen talking with the Griffins in the sewer. The episode title is a reference to the Neil Sedaka song, [...] "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do." ...|$|E

500|$|The rest of {{the family}} tries to pass the time by playing charades and various other games. They are unable to keep {{themselves}} entertained and take their frustrations out on Meg as usual. But, having dealt with their abuse for years, Meg finally turns on them, starting with Chris for mistreating her with hurtful comments. Tired of her outburst, Lois tries to tell Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else, but Meg brings up Lois's past and tells her that she is [...] "the furthest thing from" [...] the perfect mother. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns eighteen, she is considering never seeing her again. Lois is reduced to tears and profusely apologizes to Meg. Meg then confronts Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing until she calls him a [...] "waste of a man." [...] Within moments, Peter, Lois and Chris turn their abusive criticisms on each other. Peter then runs away to his room crying, leaving Meg and Brian to discuss <b>what</b> <b>just</b> happened. Despite Brian complimenting her for standing up for herself, Meg concludes that her family cannot survive without a [...] "lightning rod" [...] to absorb its dysfunction, and that her enduring her family's antagonism helps keep them together. She then decides to apologize to her family and lies that she was taking her own problems out on everyone, restoring their egos and original opinions. Stewie then breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience about the dangers of drugs: [...] "Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use, but the simple fact is, it's no laughing matter. To learn more about drugs, visit your local library. There's probably a guy behind there who sells drugs." ...|$|E
