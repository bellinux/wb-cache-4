25|$|In topology, a ring torus is homeomorphic to the Cartesian {{product of}} two circles: S1×S1, {{and the latter}} is taken to be the {{definition}} in that context. It is a compact 2-manifold of genus 1. The ring torus {{is one way to}} embed this space into three-dimensional Euclidean space, but another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the Cartesian product of the embedding of S1 in the plane. This produces a geometric object called the Clifford torus, a surface in 4-space.|$|E
25|$|Because {{dark matter}} {{remains to be}} {{conclusively}} identified, many theories that aim to explain the observational evidence without invoking dark matter have emerged. The obvious <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to modify general relativity. General relativity is well-tested on solar-system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales is less certain. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably {{eliminate the need for}} dark matter. The most well-known theories of this class are MOND and its relativistic generalization TeVeS, f(R) gravity and entropic gravity. Alternative theories abound.|$|E

25|$|Further {{reduction}} is possible by using multiple coating layers, designed such that reflections from the surfaces undergo maximal destructive interference. One <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{to add a}} second quarter-wave thick higher-index layer between the low-index layer and the substrate. The reflection from all three interfaces produces destructive interference and anti-reflection. Other techniques use varying thicknesses of the coatings. By using two or more layers, each of a material chosen to give the best possible match of the desired refractive index and dispersion, broadband anti-reflection coatings covering the visible range (400–700nm) with maximal reflectivities of less than 0.5% are commonly achievable.|$|E
25|$|With the Authority {{beginning}} to forcefully expand {{its influence on}} the wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act {{with the help of}} Raine who is able to recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game concludes with all of the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active and surfacing.|$|E
25|$|When {{dealing with}} tons of water, {{it has to}} be {{distributed}} evenly and slowly. Occasionally main channels will need maintenance, or may be damaged due to external reasons. In order to even assess the problem, tons of water need to be removed from the main channel. The best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to slow the overall flow from the main dam and redirect all water flowing originally through the damaged channel to backup channels. Radial gates serve this purpose, they regulate the flow of water. It is imperative to keep water flowing. Lack of the flow will not only compromise all irrigation linked to that channel but also all cities linked will experience a power outage.|$|E

25|$|Models like PB and GB allow {{estimation}} of the mean electrostatic free energy but do {{not account for the}} (mostly) entropic effects arising from solute-imposed constraints on the organization of the water or solvent molecules. This is termed the hydrophobic effect and is {{a major factor in the}} folding process of globular proteins with hydrophobic cores. Implicit solvation models may be augmented with a term that accounts for the hydrophobic effect. The most popular <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> by taking the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) as a proxy of the extent of the hydrophobic effect. Most authors place the extent of this effect between 5 and 45 cal/(Å2 mol). Note that this surface area pertains to the solute, while the hydrophobic effect is mostly entropic in nature at physiological temperatures and occurs on the side of the solvent.|$|E
25|$|Applying a pinch {{current in}} a plasma {{can be used}} to {{counteract}} expansion and confine the plasma. A simple <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement {{along the length of the}} tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and there are ways to reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.|$|E
25|$|After {{interviewing}} 31 dogmen {{and attending}} 14 dog fights in the Southern United States, Evans, Gauthier, and Forsyth theorized on what attracts men to dog fights. In their study, Evans, et al., discussed dog fighting's attractiveness {{in terms of}} masculinity and class immobility. In the United States, masculinity embodies the qualities of strength, aggression, competition, and striving for success. By embodying these characteristics, a man can gain honor and status in his society. Yet, working class occupations, unlike middle or upper class occupations, provide limited opportunities to validate this culturally accepted definition of masculinity. So, working class men look for alternative ways to validate their masculinity and obtain honor and status. One <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> through dogfighting. This {{is supported by the}} Evans, et al. findings: the majority of committed dogmen were mostly drawn from the working class, while the middle and upper classes were barely represented. Men from middle and upper classes have opportunities to express their masculinity through their occupations; dog fighting, therefore, is just a hobby for them while it plays {{a central role in the}} lives of working class men. Those from the higher classes are drawn in by the thrill and excitement of the fight.|$|E

500|$|The basic {{feature of}} every finite group is its {{multiplication}} table, also called Cayley table, that records {{the result of}} multiplying any two elements. A representation of a group {{can be thought of}} new set of elements, finite-dimensional or infinite-dimensional matrices, giving the same multiplication table after mapping the old elements to the new elements in a one-to-one fashion. The same holds true {{in the case of an}} infinite group like the rotation group SO(3) or the Lorentz group. The multiplication table is just harder to visualize in the case of a group of uncountable size (same size as the set of reals). One <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to wellorder the elements of the group with an ordinal number [...] being the order type.

500|$|In {{the second}} instance, {{breaking}} the scheme {{is even more}} straightforward. Since {{there are only a}} limited number of possible shifts (26 in English), they can each be tested in turn in a brute force attack.

The example given is for the ciphertext [...] "EXXEGOEXSRGI"; the plaintext is instantly recognisable by eye at a shift of four. Another way of viewing this method is that, under each letter of the ciphertext, the entire alphabet is written out in reverse starting at that letter. This attack can be accelerated using a set of strips prepared with the alphabet written down in reverse order. The strips are then aligned to form the ciphertext along one row, and the plaintext should appear in one of the other rows.|$|E
