5|$|Despite the {{expansion}} {{in the number of}} positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female recruitment and retention, the growth in the proportion of female permanent defence personnel has been slow. In the 1989–1990 financial year <b>women</b> <b>made</b> up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%. As of 30 June 2016, <b>women</b> <b>made</b> up 15.5% of the ADF's permanent force and 16.6% of reservists. The proportion of women in the permanent force differs by service: 12.1% of members of the Army are female, compared to 19.1% of the RAN and 19.2% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase the proportion of service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women will make up 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.|$|E

From the raw cotton, the Muisca <b>women</b> <b>made</b> fine cotton mantles that were traded on the many markets in the Muisca territory.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} clothing system {{developed and}} used by the Eskimo peoples {{is the most effective}} cold weather clothing developed to date.

The multi-functional ulu (semilunar woman's knife) is used to process and cut skins for clothing and footwear. <b>Women</b> <b>made</b> most clothing of caribou (wild caribou Rangifer tarandus granti and domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus tarandus) and sealskin.
