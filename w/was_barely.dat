5|$|In {{the south}} near Bryansk, initial Soviet {{performance}} <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> {{more effective than}} at Vyazma. The Second Panzer Group executed an enveloping movement around the city, linking with the advancing 2nd Army and capturing Orel by 3 October and Bryansk by 6 October.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Heraclea, Attalus and Sulpicius sacked both Oreus, on the {{northern}} coast of Euboea, and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. However, with their forces divided, Philip, alerted by signal fire, attacked and took Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> able to escape to his ships.|$|E
5|$|By 1939, it {{was clear}} that war was looming, and the team began to turn their primary {{attention}} from ASV back to AI. A new set, built by combining the transmitter unit from the latest ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939. The system demonstrated a maximum range that <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> adequate, around , but the too-long minimum range proved to be a far greater problem.|$|E

5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E
5|$|In {{her final}} years, Santoso and Sastrosatomo lived off of their {{pensions}} in Jakarta; in her obituary, Tempo magazine {{reported that the}} pension <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> enough for day-to-day expenses.

5|$|Music {{composer}} James Horner {{felt he was}} {{not given}} enough time to create a musical score. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to write the score in six weeks, which {{he thought was a}} sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects, citing that Cameron spent two days with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, a 30-year-old studio that <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> able to patch in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required.|$|E

5|$|Newton Heath LYR Football Club {{was also}} founded as a cricket club, and the North Road ground {{was used by}} both {{branches}} of the club. However, the cricket and football seasons often overlapped, causing conflicts between the two sports. The ground <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> adequate for football, despite {{the best efforts of}} groundsmen Charlie and Ned Massey, but its use in the winter made it even less suitable for cricket in the summer.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, {{the storm}} {{deteriorated}} in organization as it continued northward. The lack of banding features indicated that by early on July 22, Becky <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> a tropical storm. The storm made landfall near Port St. Joe, Florida shortly thereafter, and weakened rapidly {{as it moved}} inland; as a rainstorm, it progressed northward into the Midwestern United States and completely dissipated over Michigan.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{launched}} repeated {{assaults on}} Vukovar {{but failed to}} make any progress. Its armour, designed for combat in open country, <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> able to enter Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry was lacking, and the TO's poorly trained and motivated troops were inadequate substitutes. The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little {{understanding of how to}} conduct urban operations and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground.|$|E

5|$|When {{hostilities}} resumed, they sacked both Oreus, on {{the northern}} coast of Euboea and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. With their forces divided, Philip attacked Opus.

5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia can only be guessed at, it seems {{unlikely}} to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with Blanca had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E

50|$|The reef {{is roughly}} elliptical. It {{measures}} 1.7 km east-west and 1.2 km north-south, covering {{an area of}} about 1.6 km². The land mass <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> 0.02 km². It <b>is</b> <b>barely</b> above water, as the sea breaks heavily over it. The reef's islet is in the western half. The location is 41 km north of {{the northern tip of}} Providence Atoll.|$|R
5|$|By {{early on}} August 27, the {{tropical}} storm became slightly better organized, although {{the most intense}} winds were still removed from the center. Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before wind shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft found that it <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> a tropical storm. After stalling during the afternoon, the center resumed a north or north-northwestward drift.|$|E
5|$|France's {{intervention}} in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta. In fact, France <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> criticised at all in Africa, other than a mild response by Dahomey and one by the Democratic Republic of Congo. The matter was not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February–29 February in Lagos. The revolutionary movement in French Africa immediately retrogressed following the coup.|$|E
5|$|His {{resting place}} {{is at the}} Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery, in Pyongyang. Today, Cho is {{regarded}} as the founding father of North Korean socialist realist poetry, or indeed poetry in general, or even North Korean literature as a whole. In the mid-1950s many Soviet Koreans, including Cho's close friends, were discredited in purges. According to Gabroussenko, Cho's untimely death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition. With the exception of a period in the 1970s when Cho's name <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> mentioned in official publications, his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in North Korea.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Brazil, now {{ascendant}} under Emperor Dom PedroII, provided {{support to}} the Uruguayan government that still held out in Montevideo, {{as well as to}} the ambitious Justo José de Urquiza, a caudillo in Entre Ríos who rebelled against Rosas. Once one of Rosas' most trusted lieutenants, Urquiza now claimed to fight for a constitutional government, although his ambition to become head of state <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> disguised. In retaliation, Rosas declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the Platine War. The army under Oribe in Uruguay surrendered to Urquiza in October. With arms and financial aid given by Brazil, Urquiza then marched through Argentine territory heading to Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|The NDH {{authorities}} {{only had}} weak forces in eastern Herzegovina {{at the time}} the mass uprising occurred, roughly equal to two Croatian Home Guard battalions, as well as gendarmerie posts in some towns. This <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> adequate to guard important locations, and was insufficient for offensive action. Deployed forces consisted of one company of the 10th Battalion in Trebinje, the headquarters and a reinforced company of the 7th Battalion in Bileća (the balance of the battalion being divided between Gacko and Avtovac), and a company of the 6th Battalion in Nevesinje. The remainder of the 10th Battalion was deploying to Trebinje {{at the time the}} rebellion broke out.|$|E
5|$|The Whitestone Branch {{would have}} had to be rebuilt if it were leased to the subway, with {{railroad}} crossings removed and the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned its attention back to the Main Street subway extension.|$|E
