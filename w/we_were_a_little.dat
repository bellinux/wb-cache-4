And I think we showed too much. I think maybe <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as you said, that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit unlucky. But this is a sport, but when you do something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E

The album was to be taped {{in the first quarter}} of 2011, and would feature special guests including Juanes, Calle 13, Andrés Calamaro and Zack de la Rocha. By February 2011, it was announced that Paulina Rubio and Diego Torres would join the band for the album recording session. For the band this presented a unique opportunity to re-invent their music and share the stage with talented performers. [...] "When MTV invited us to record the show, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tense, this was something different for us because Unplugged albums on MTV are usually recorded by artists from different genres from us," [...] the band said about the recording. Jesús Lara of MTV Tr3s called the production [...] "historic", since the band has been culturally a part of the life of the Hispanic community in Mexico and the US.|$|E

500|$|Writers Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa have {{admitted}} they were [...] "not computer literate", and felt {{this was a}} detriment to their writing. Gordon was disappointed in the episode, stating that it [...] "still qualifies {{as one of my}} biggest disappointments", ranking it as the worst episode of the first season. Glen Morgan felt that [...] "parts of the episode worked. What maybe fell a little flat is that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too afraid of doing HAL and, in a sense, I think that's what the building needed; to have a scary personality." [...] James Wong had mixed feelings, saying that the episode [...] "had some neat stuff at the end...although I think the ending was a little unsatisfying to me visually, as well as in terms of how Mulder comes to dismember the machine. Overall a fun episode." [...] Chris Carter was more supportive of the episode, stating that the script addressed the question of what made up an X-File, and that it doesn't always have to be paranormal. He also felt positive about the episode's action scenes.|$|E

I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough.

Tormé stepped down from his role as co-executive story editor, taking credit instead as a creative consultant. Following Hurley's modifications to Tormé's scripts for [...] "The Royale" [...] and [...] "", Tormé elected to be credited under a pseudonym only. At one point, Roddenberry had thought that Tormé would become eventual showrunner, but the writer left due to the re-writes required under Hurley's tenure. Hannah Louise Shearer also left the team between seasons, due to differences with Hurley, but contributed stories in later seasons. Other writers joined the team during the second season, including The Tears of the Singers author Melinda M. Snodgrass, who sold the script for [...] "". Hans Beimler and Richard Manning were hired in the newly created positions of executive script consultants. They had both been story editors for the final eight episodes of the first season. Snodgrass later explained that, [...] "Once I came on board there suddenly seemed to be this climate of discussion among the writers about {{what we wanted to}} do with the show. My impression was that this was a new phenomenon. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more on the same wavelength." [...] She was hired as a story editor following the submission of her first episode, alongside Leonard Mlodinow and Scott Rubenstein. The other two editors left after four more episodes, with Snodgrass remaining as the sole story editor for the rest of the season.|$|E

40|$|If some {{twenty-five years}} ago <b>we</b> had <b>been</b> told that <b>we</b> would write a large book on {{quantification}} in nonclassical logic, {{none of us would}} have taken it seriously. First — because at that times there was no hope for our effective co-operation.

Now the situation is completely different. Connections between Moscow and London became even easier than say, between Moscow and Novosibirsk. The title of the book is not surprising, and probably <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> late with the first big monograph in this field.

3000|$|While also a banlieue resident, Hinda, a 33 -year-old {{youth worker}} of Tunisian origin and {{divorced}} {{mother of a}} seven-year-old daughter, relates to where she lives very differently from Kamel. Hinda wants to move but she cannot; {{she does not have}} an attachment to her neighborhood. She has lived in the northeastern banlieue of Drancy for the past seven years. She dislikes living in Drancy, and describes her neighborhood as “sad.” Hinda explains that she “did not choose this neighborhood” and would rather live in Paris but it is too expensive. “It is not particularly pretty. [...].. the buildings are sad, there isn’t much life here, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too far outside [of Paris] here,” she laments. She feels unconnected to where she lives, and hopes {{to be able to move}} soon, either to Paris or another banlieue closer to Paris. Here, how Hinda relates to living in Drancy illustrates how she sees herself as a French citizen. That she is surrounded by those who look like her in Drancy is irrelevant, she dislikes living in Drancy for the same reasons she imagines any other French person would.|$|R

In between, they {{went to one of}} the recording sessions and were not impressed with the process of recording the song. Bettis commented, [...] "We went to one of the sessions, and to be honest, that particular session did not go all that well. [...] Jon and I were depressed about the way the song had come out. We heard nothing else about it and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nervous that the song was going to be dropped from the picture." [...] Bettis went to England to work on the 1985 fantasy film Legend with music producer Jerry Goldsmith. It was there he received a call from Lind, who informed Bettis that a new version of [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was recorded and was made ready for a single release. Bettis was surprised and went over to Lind's house, where he warmly received the new recorded version of the song. It had a different arrangement from the demo version, and the arrangement was done by composer Rob Mounsey who rearranged the original track and added the background vocals.
