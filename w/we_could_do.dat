5|$|Basil was no {{more than}} the name of {{bachelor}} uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few of us knew how to eat spaghetti or pick a globe artichoke to pieces.... Then came Elizabeth David like sunshine, writing with brief elegance about good food, that is, about food well contrived, well cooked. She made us understand that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> better with what we had.|$|E
25|$|It {{was really}} like a cry of survival. There won't be another album like it, put it like that. It was a cry from the depths, {{the only thing that}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|You {{do not put}} {{someone in}} {{detention}} for {{this period of time}} then not pursue the matter against him in the courts without some sort of... acknowledgement that a mistake was made, That's the least that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

25|$|For a {{transmitted}} ray <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something similar}} {{but in that}} case the distance traveled through the object would cause even faster intensity decrease. As an example of this, Hall & Greenbergfound that even for a very reflective scene, using this with a maximum depth of 15 resulted in an average ray tree depth of 1.7.|$|E
25|$|From {{the first}} the British had an {{extraordinary}} advantage, {{never to be}} balanced out {{at any time during}} the whole war, which was their radar and fighter control network and organization. It was for us a very bitter surprise. We had nothing like it. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> no other than knock frontally against the outstandingly well-organized and resolute direct defence of the British Isles.|$|E
25|$|It {{is obvious}} {{that if we could}} find {{characters}} or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> in all matters insofar as they are subject to reasoning all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.|$|E

500|$|Garfield did not {{consider}} Lincoln particularly worthy of re-election, but no viable alternative seemed available. [...] "He {{will probably be the}} man, though I think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> better." [...] The Ohioan attended the party convention and promoted Rosecrans as Lincoln's running mate, but delegates chose Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson. Both Lincoln and Garfield were re-elected. By then, Chase had left the Cabinet and had been appointed Chief Justice, and his relations with Garfield became more distant.|$|E
500|$|Stargate {{producers}} {{were not}} sure actor Richard Dean Anderson would return for the episode, so they devised many scenes where Anderson was [...] "in" [...] the episode but not actually shown. [...] However, Anderson was willing to return and appeared in several scenes. In the DVD special Stargate SG-1: Behind the 200th Cooper said, [...] "it {{was a big deal}} for us to have [...] back for the 200th episode. We obviously didn't think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it without him." ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Leyland from Total Film {{called it}} [...] "a {{throwaway}} blast of solid, stupid fun" [...] {{and gave it}} three out of five stars, particularly praising Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance as the treacherous Cobra Commander. Sister publication SFX called the film [...] "dumb and dopey, with plenty of bumpy bits" [...] and that [...] "GI Joe has a genuine cliffhanger charm, especially when the last act becomes a whole string of pulp plot twists. The ending screams 'To Be Continued'; <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> worse.", finally awarding the score of three stars out of five.|$|E

500|$|Hannah {{entered a}} period of {{remission}} but, in May 1903, became ill again. Chaplin, then 14, had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary, from where she {{was sent back to}} Cane Hill. He lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough, until Sydney – who had enrolled in the Navy two years earlier – returned. Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later, but in March 1905, her illness returned, this time permanently. [...] "There was nothing <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> but accept poor mother's fate", Chaplin later wrote, and she remained in care until her death in 1928.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{longtime}} Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich {{said of the}} song: [...] "We {{tried to}} record it countless times, but it never worked. The irony is you have that shitty live version [...] To Thom's credit, he needs to feel a song has validation, {{that it has a}} reason to exist as a recording. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> 'True Love Waits' and make it sound like John Mayer. Nobody wants to do that." [...] In 2016, more than 21 years after its debut, [...] "True Love Waits" [...] was finally released as the last track on Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, Feargus Urquhart, {{replying}} to {{an interview}} question about what franchises {{he would like to}} work on, said that [...] "if [...] could come across everything that [...] played", he would choose a Chrono Trigger game. At the time, Urquhart's company Obsidian Entertainment was making Dungeon Siege III for Square Enix. Urquhart said: [...] "You make RPGs, we make RPGs, {{it would be great to}} see what <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> together. And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together." [...] Yoshinori Kitase revealed in 2011 that he used the time travel mechanics of Chrono Trigger as a starting point for that of Final Fantasy XIII-2.|$|E

500|$|While Schmidt {{said before}} the game's release that the team wanted to develop [...] "a whole series of games {{that take place in}} the Terra Nova world", the game's poor sales made the {{creation}} of a sequel [...] "impractical", according to Paul Neurath. As the game's publisher, Looking Glass took on the full burden of its commercial underperformance, which contributed to the company's bankruptcy and closure in May 2000. Neurath later said, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> Terra Nova over, I would have dumped the cinematics and done online team play instead. Who knows, maybe then the Tribes II and Halo teams would be talking about the influence of Terra Nova on their games".|$|E
500|$|The {{founders of}} Circus Juventas, Dan and Betty Butler, met as {{teenagers}} at the Sailor Circus of Sarasota during the mid-1970s. Dan was a catcher on the flying trapeze, and Betty was an aerialist on the cloud swing. They began dating at age sixteen, {{went on to}} perform at Florida State University's Flying High Circus, and married in 1980. Dan became a successful real estate broker in Atlanta, but faced bankruptcy and chemical dependency. The couple came to reside in Minnesota because Dan Butler was receiving {{alcohol and drug abuse}} rehabilitation at Hazelden. The Butlers attended Sailor Circus reunions together and after one, in April 1994, Betty Butler wondered, [...] "Wouldn't it be great if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something in ?" ...|$|E
500|$|According to a December 2011 {{interview}} with Craig, [...] "We had the bare bones of a script {{and then there}} was a writers' strike and there was nothing <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes—and a writer I am not." [...] He said that he and Forster [...] "were the ones allowed to do it. The rules were that you couldn't employ anyone as a writer, but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We got away with it, but only just. It was never meant to be as much of a sequel as it was, but it ended up being a sequel, starting where the last one finished." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{journalist}} David Miller, {{writing for}} [...] The Times, described Cambridge's victory as [...] "crushingly conclusive". [...] Cambridge's Malcolm Baker said: [...] "We knew <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it after about 25 strokes." [...] Behrens explained [...] "Our strength {{was that we}} were more uniform than Oxford. [...] We have proved that {{you do not have to}} be an Olympic champion to win the Boat Race." [...] The Oxford Boat Club president Pinsent conceded: [...] "They put right a lot of mistakes they have made in the past, and they rowed outstandingly well." [...] Spracklen agreed: [...] "Cambridge got too far away. [...] They were a better boat in that race. [...] All credit to them." [...] Cambridge's number two, David Gillard, said [...] "there was a lot of revenge out there".|$|E
500|$|Many of The Simpsons writers {{had left}} the show or were absent at the {{beginning}} of season four, which left Al Jean and Mike Reiss to brainstorm plot ideas alone. After brainstorming [...] "Homer the Heretic", they thought of Lisa entering a beauty pageant. They assigned Jeff Martin to write the episode because they assumed he would fill it with songs, like he had done on previous episodes. Martin obliged, and wrote the episode and its music. He also based the episode on some of his own experiences, such as the scene where Lisa has a caricature of herself drawn. According to Jeff Martin, [...] "I'm not sure if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this episode today. People had a more innocent view of child beauty pageants before JonBenet Ramsey." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{several members}} of the team enjoyed racing games and had also worked on Diddy Kong Racing, they decided to include the futuristic Ant racing {{featured}} in the campaign and the top-down arcade racing games in the multiplayer. Developers initially considered the possibility to use the 4MB Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, but the idea was eventually dropped. According to Mountain, [...] "we wanted to deliver the same experience to all players and were confident that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this using the standard 4MB of RAM on the console." [...] This led to some confusion as the box cover for the original release stated that it did support such a feature. Nintendo provided a quick-fix to the mislabeled covers by providing stickers declaring its Rumble Pak compatibility and fixed later printings of the boxes.|$|E

6000|$|... "You say truly, brother," [...] {{cried the}} prince, his eyes {{kindling}} at the thought. [...] "Methinks that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> anything more pleasing to Our Lady than {{to drive the}} heathen Moors out of the country." ...|$|R
