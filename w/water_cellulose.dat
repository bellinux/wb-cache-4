40|$|Recently, a {{laboratory}} measurement facility has been realized {{for assessing the}} anisotropic reflectance and emittance behaviour of soils, leaves and small canopies under controlled illumination conditions. The facility consists of an ASD FieldSpec 3 spectroradiometer covering the spectral range from 350 – 2500 nm at 1 nm spectral sampling interval. The spectroradiometer is deployed using a fiber optic cable with either a 1 °, 8 ° or 25 ° {{instantaneous field of view}} (IFOV). These measurements can be used to assess the plant pigment (chlorophyll, xanthophyll, etc.) and non-pigment system (<b>water,</b> <b>cellulose,</b> lignin, nitrogen, etc.). The thermal emittance is measured using a NEC TH 9100 Infrared Thermal Imager. It operates in a single band covering the spectral range from 8 – 14 mm with a resolution of 0. 02 K. Images are 320 (H) by 240 (V) pixels with an IFOV of 1. 2 mrad. A 1000 W Quartz Tungsten Halogen (QTH) lamp is used as illumination source, approximating the radiance distribution of the sun. This one is put at a fixed position during a measurement session. Multi-angular measurements are achieved by using a robotic positioning system allowing to perform either reflectance or emittance measurements over almost a complete hemisphere.

Refuse decomposition was monitored in multiple replicate laboratory-scale sanitary landfills. A laboratory-scale landfill was dismantled weekly for microbial and chemical analysis. Leachate was neutralized and recycled to ensure methanogenesis. The methane concentration of the sampled containers increased to 64 % by day 69, at which time the maximum methane production rate, 929 liters of CH 4 per dry kg-year, was measured. Population increases of 2, 4, 5, 5, and 6 orders of magnitude were measured between fresh refuse and the methane production phase for the hemicellulolytic bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, butyrate-catabolizing acetogens, and acetate- and H 2 -CO 2 -utilizing methanogens, respectively. The cellulolytic bacteria and acetogens increased more slowly than the methanogens and only after the onset of methane production. The initial decrease in the pH of the refuse ecosystem from 7. 5 to 5. 7 was attributed to the accumulation of acidic end products of sugar fermentation, to the low acid-consuming activity of the acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria, and to levels of oxygen and nitrate in the fresh refuse sufficient for oxidation of only 8 % of the sugars to carbon dioxide and <b>water.</b> <b>Cellulose</b> and hemicellulose decomposition was most rapid after establishment of the methanogenic and acetogenic populations and a reduction in the initial accumulation of carboxylic acids.

One such technology is the rapid degradation of cellulose in supercritical water without the need for an enzyme or inorganic catalyst such as acid. This project focused on the study of reaction kinetics of cellulose hydrolysis in subcritical and supercritical <b>water.</b> <b>Cellulose</b> reactions at hydrothermal conditions can proceed via the homogeneous route involving dissolution and hydrolysis or the heterogeneous path of surface hydrolysis. The work is divided into three main parts. First, the detailed kinetic analysis of cellulose reactions in micro- and tubular reactors was conducted. Reaction kinetics models were applied, and kinetics parameters at both subcritical and supercritical conditions were evaluated. The second major task was the evaluation of yields of water soluble hydrolysates obtained from the hydrolysis of cellulose and starch in hydrothermal reactors. Lastly, changes in molecular weight distribution due to hydrothermolytic degradation of cellulose were investigated. These changes were also simulated based on different modes of scission, and the pattern generated from simulation was compared with the distribution pattern from experiments. For {{a better understanding of the}} reaction kinetics of cellulose in subcritical and supercritical water, a series of reactions was conducted in the microreactor. Hydrolysis of cellulose was performed at subcritical temperatures ranging from 270 to 340 °C (ô = 0. 40 - 0. 88 s). For the dissolution of cellulose, the reaction was conducted at supercritical temperatures ranging from 375 to 395 °C (ô = 0. 27 - 0. 44 s). The operating pressure for the reactions at both subcritical and supercritical conditions was 5000 psig. The results show that the rate-limiting step in converting cellulose to fermentable sugars in subcritical and supercritical water differs because of the difference in their activation energies. Cellulose and starch were both hydrolyzed in micro- and tubular reactors and at subcritical and supercritical conditions. Due to the difficulty involved in generating an aqueous based dissolved cellulose and having it reacted in subcritical water, dissolved starch was used instead. Better yield of water soluble hydrolysates, especially fermentable sugars, were observed from the hydrolysis of cellulose and dissolved starch in subcritical water than at supercritical conditions.

The removal of water contaminants via adsorption on carboxyl, sulphonic and phosphoryl functional groups on nanocellulose based membranes was evaluated. Freeze-drying was used as one approach to fabricate CNCSL based hybrid membranes. In spite of high percentage removal of positively charges dyes, low water flux and mechanical stability was recorded.

The aim of this approach was to provide mechanical stability without decreasing the water flux significantly. In the final study, to increase the adsorption capacity of CNCBE layered membranes; in situ functionalization (TEMPO oxidation) of top layer was performed.

40|$|Dissertação de mest., Qualidade em Análises, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2011 Cellulose is {{considered}} the most abundant natural polymer in our environment. It is assumed an almost infinite source of raw material for the increasing demand for environmentally friendly and biocompatible products. In spite of its very low solubility in <b>water,</b> <b>cellulose</b> is used {{in a wide range}} of applications including composites, netting, coatings, packing, paper, etc. The morphology of cellulose has a thoughtful effect on its reactivity, the hydroxyl groups located in the amorphous regions are highly accessible and highly reactive, whereas those in crystalline regions with close packing and strong interchain and intermolecular bonding can be completely inert. Cellulose nanofibers are one of the most fascinating nanoscale biomacromolecular building blocks that exist in nature. Their characteristic widths are in the range of 5 - 20 nm and their lengths may exceed 5 μm. This high aspect-ratio nanostructure is valuable and contributes to high mechanical performance of nanofiber networks and composite materials. In pharmaceutical industry cellulose derivatives are often used to adapt the release of drugs in tablet and capsule formulations and also as tablet binding, thickening and rheology control agents, for film formation, water retention, improving adhesive strength, for suspending and emulsifying. On the other hand microcrystaline cellulose (MIC) is used as diluent and disintegrating agent for release oral solid dosage. There is strong evidence for the catalytic role of transition metals during the oxidative degradation of cellulose. In the surface layer of Earth, vanadium is 22 nd in abundance (0. 013 % w/w) and more plentiful than copper and zinc. Vanadium is very a versatile metal acting as catalyzer and the use of such earth-abundant metal as an oxidant would be a significant advance in ability to break carbon-carbon bonds in 1. 2 -hydroxyether compounds such as lignin. It was the purpose of the present work to analyse the chemical behavior of a vanadium complex (VOSO 4) adsorbed onto two types of cellulose: microcrystalline (MIC) and native (NC). This was achieved by diffuse reflectance Ultraviolet Visible (DRUV) spectroscopy. The diffuse Reflectance (DR) {{is considered}} as special method for IR and UV-VIS spectroscopy used for powders and samples with irregular surface. The “Kubelka-Munk” (KM) function (F(R)) plays a significant role for the quantitative evaluation of DR spectra, which integrates the degree of reflection on the sample surface at infinite thickness and is expressed with following equation: F(R) =K/S or F(R) =((1 -R) 2) / 2 R, where R is the total amount of radiation reflected diffusely by the sample, K represents the absorption modulus and S the scattering modulus. The DRUV spectra, obtained after depositing the vanadium complex onto cellulose, show that the initial V(IV) complex can be involved in several equilibria, leading to the formation of different V(IV) and V(V) complexes. The main absorption band of V(IV) species has a maximum at 750 nm and a clear shoulder near 640 nm. In the region 200 to 500 nm is a high band overlapping for V(V) and V(IV) species is possible and the band assignment in this region is not straightforward. Nevertheless, the maximum at 240 nm can be related with oligovanadates forming from the oxidation and hydrolysis of V(IV) to V(V), in the case of the samples with a higher initial concentration of VOSO 4. The behavior of the vanadium complex spectra with the initial concentration of VOSO 4 was assessed comparing two different mathematical treatments for data analysis: the Kubelka-Munk function F(R) and log(1 /R). It was concluded that F(R) explains more accurately the vanadium species evolution deposited or adsorbed onto cellulose when comparing to the log(1 /R) function. The precision of the sample preparation method is represented by repeatability and intermediate precision. Precision was measured as units of F(R) measured at several wavelengths. It was obtained from the spectra of samples prepared within a limited period of time (~ 2 months) and replicates of samples prepared simultaneously. In this study repeatability represents variance between samples (duplicates and quadriplicates) prepared in the same day, and intermediate precision represents variance between samples (different series) prepared in the different days. In order to evaluate these parameters, data at the wavelength of 240, 380, 640 and 750 nm were chosen. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Office 2003 ANOVA software. The ANOVA data analysis showed that there is a difference in variance between Repeatability and Intermediate precision (p-values 1. 36 x 10 - 6 and 0. 0013 at 750 nm for MIC and NC, 3. 7 x 10 - 8 and 0. 0013 at 240 nm for MIC and NC, respectively) significant at a 5 % level, this means that the samples prepared within one day have much smaller variance comparing with the samples prepared in different days. The V(IV) species deposited onto cellulose, with maxima absorption at 640 and 760 nm, shown an almost linear behavior of F(R) with the initial concentration of VOSO 4, which might suggest that at these wavelengths the dominant band generating species are stable. The bands at 240 nm, probably due to V(V) formed by slow oxidation of V(IV), and at 260 nm was observed that in MIC there is higher linearity behavior of absorbing species comparing to NC where it can be observed a slight decrease and then increase of absorbing species. At 320 and 400 nm, where both V(IV) and V(V) complexes can absorb, the F(R) value is decreasing and then increasing with initial vanadium concentration, which is possible due to existence of two different absorbing species which are in equilibrium and one of them is decreasing and other one is increasing in concentration. Regarding the differences observed when comparing the results obtain with both celluloses they are mainly related with the values of F(R) than with the spectra profile. Therefore, the chemical behavior of the vanadium complexes is not much affected by the cellulose structure, ie the higher amount of amorphous regions (with more accessible reacting groups) do not alter significantly the equilibria of the vanadium species. It can be observed that the signal from vanadium species in MIC is much higher than in NC, this can be explained by the lower surface area of MIC, which results in a higher surface concentration of vanadium species...|$|E

This study consists in modifying cellulose by grafting of the amidoxime groups for its use in the adsorption of the Cu 2 +, Cr 3 + and sulphide ions present in industrial waste <b>waters.</b> <b>Cellulose</b> is an abundant biodegradable polymer. The amidoxime groups are strong complexants of metal ions. The grafting is achieved in two steps: cyanoethylation and amidoximation, confirmed by FT-IR. The optimum conditions and the parameters influencing the two reactions are determined by the kjeldahl's method and by FT-IR. The amidoxime quantity is determined by measuring the quantity of the amine functions by HCl proportioning. The implementation of the modified cellulose is intended for the adsorption of the metal ions Cu 2 + and Cr 3 + and sulphide ions S 2 − in a double adsorption. The FT-IR analysis reveals that the fixing of metal cations is based on the complexation of the latter with the ligands of the adsorbent. The optimum adsorption was recorded at pH = 6 for a contact time of 5 h and an initial concentration of 10 − 1 M in metals. The desorption of fixed metals is possible by the EDTA, and the re-use of the adsorbent confirms the effectiveness of recyclin...|$|R
40|$|Almost no δ(18) O {{data are}} {{available}} for leaf carbohydrates, leaving {{a gap in the}} understanding of the δ(18) O relationship between leaf <b>water</b> and <b>cellulose.</b> We measured δ(18) O values of bulk leaf water (δ(18) OLW) and individual leaf carbohydrates (e. g. fructose, glucose and sucrose) in grass and tree species and δ(18) O of leaf cellulose in grasses. The grasses were grown under two relative humidity (rH) conditions. Sucrose was generally (18) O-enriched compared with hexoses across all species with an apparent biosynthetic fractionation factor (εbio) of more than 27 ‰ relative to δ(18) OLW, which might be explained by isotopic leaf water and sucrose synthesis gradients. δ(18) OLW and δ(18) O values of carbohydrates and cellulose in grasses were strongly related, indicating that the leaf water signal in carbohydrates was transferred to cellulose (εbio =  25. 1 ‰). Interestingly, damping factor pex px, which reflects oxygen isotope exchange with less enriched <b>water</b> during <b>cellulose</b> synthesis, responded to rH conditions if modelled from δ(18) OLW but not if modelled directly from δ(18) O of individual carbohydrates. We conclude that δ(18) OLW is not always a good substitute for δ(18) O of synthesis water due to isotopic leaf water gradients. Thus, compound-specific δ(18) O analyses of individual carbohydrates are helpful to better constrain (post-) photosynthetic isotope fractionation processes in plants...|$|R

Experimental results show that both the adsorption method using magnesium oxide and the ion-exchange operations are effective in removing boron from the drainage <b>waters.</b> <b>Cellulose</b> as an adsorbent has a minimum efficiency. "t o / MgO can be used effectively at a Mg/B mo [ratio of 20 for three cleaning cycles wl. h 85,,, 0 removal efficiency but must be discharged and refreshed after the third cycle. Consumption of 18, 100 tons of MgO {{per year in the}} removal system makes this process uneconomical. Boron-specific resin Amberlite IRA- 743 in free-amine form is also uneconomical due to expensive regeneration steps. The capacity of this resin in salt-form was found to be 1. 5 mg boron ml- ~ resin at 10 Yo boron leakage and at a flow rate of 161 h- q- t. The possibility of reuse of 90 Yo of the regenerant and production of 4400 tons of boric acid in the removal system with salt-form boron-specific resin, compensate he annual cost of chemicals and also bring in some profit.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, cotton textile {{residues}} were employed as reinforcement. Cotton is a material almost totally constituted by cellulose (Saville, 2007; Kaswell 1963). This molecule {{has a strong}} tendency to form inter and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, mainly due to hydroxyl groups. The hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces between the various planes are responsible for adding fibrils and microfibrils, allowing it to form an ordered and compact structure which constitutes the crystalline structure of cellulose.
