500|$|While {{struggling}} with his past regenerations, the Doctor's Ganger alludes to several previous Doctors' words. He misquotes the First Doctor's line [...] "one day <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>get</b> <b>back...</b> yes, one day" [...] from An Unearthly Child as [...] "one day {{we will get}} back"; quotes the Third Doctor's catchphrase [...] "reverse the polarity of the neutron flow"; and speaks with {{the voices of the}} Fourth and Tenth Doctors (Tom Baker and David Tennant, respectively), the former expressing that Doctor's fondness for jelly babies. Growing frustrated by the humans' distrust of him, the Doctor asks both Amy and Cleaves' Gangers to refer to him as [...] "John Smith". This is an alias the Doctor has used on several occasions, beginning with The Wheel in Space (1968).|$|E

"Part of the year," [...] said Janet, {{who was in}} {{a wonderfully}} {{expansive}} and genial state; [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to London for the season, and {{know what it is to}} enjoy life and rationality again, and then we must all go abroad. Mother, how soon can we go abroad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very pleasant, indeed," [...] said Rollo. [...] "We {{walked in}} the Corso till Copley had bought his whip, {{and then we went}} on till we came to the bridge, and there we saw a {{steamboat}} which goes to Ostia and back. Copley wants me to go down with him in her to-morrow. <b>We</b> <b>shall</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> about this time, I suppose." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{shall have}} to stop under a tree and cut a stick presently," [...] Hawtry said. [...] "It will not do to get down, for I should {{never be able to}} climb up again. Mind, we must take our {{bearings}} carefully, else <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> never <b>get</b> <b>back</b> again. <b>We</b> have neither chart nor compass. Hallo! here comes the mules' master." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, mother, {{somebody}} {{has got to}} fight the French," [...] insisted the son. [...] "If we don't fight them, and whip them, how <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> ever <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to our home? I don't want to give all that up, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I, by St. Iago! Señor. It {{is enough}} for me that we are far from the Doña Mercedes, and a league more or less counts but little. Should your theory be true, and the earth prove to be round, I have the {{consolation}} of knowing that <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Spain, in time, even by chasing the sun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> {{again without}} any harm, mother. And as to getting {{killed in a}} street brawl, Lionel and I can use our hangers {{as well as most}} of them. Besides, nothing of that sort {{is going to happen to}} us. Now, mother, please let Ruth go at once, and tell her to put up our puce {{doublets}} that we had for the jousting at the castle, and our red hose and our dark green cloth slashed trunks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but they}} won't catch us. We won't venture into Swaziland again, but will {{make our way}} down on the Portuguese side, {{following}} the railway till we are fairly beyond the mountain range. We can ride fast {{now that we have}} got rid of the dynamite. It will be some time before they get the news about what has happened here, for the telegraph wires are sure to be broken and the instruments smashed. I really think that our best way will be to ride straight down to Lorenzo Marques. When we get there we can very well state that we had been ordered to leave Johannesburg, and that, as the trains are so slow and so crowded with fugitives, we had ridden down. I don't suppose that we shall attract the least notice, for we know that a great many of those who had intended to stay have been ordered off. That way <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Natal in a few days and avoid all danger." [...] The others agreed {{that this would be a}} capital plan; and the distance by the road, which they had crossed a few miles to the south, and which runs from Lorenzo Marques up to Ladysdorp and the Murchison and Klein Lemba gold-fields, would not be above seventy miles. They would wait till daybreak showed them the amount of damage that had been done, and then start, and would be down at Lorenzo Marques in the evening, when, even if the news of the explosion reached the town, the Boers' suspicions that some Englishmen were in the hills, and that it was probably their work, would not be known. Not until ten o'clock was a move made. Then they took up the packages of dynamite, and, accompanied by Jack, made their way noiselessly down to the railway yard.|$|E
60|$|WANKLIN. [Persuasively.] Come Chairman, we 're {{not free}} agents. We're {{part of a}} machine. Our only {{business}} is to see the Company earns as much profit as it safely can. If you blame me for want of principle: I say that we're Trustees. Reason tells us <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> never <b>get</b> <b>back</b> in the saving of wages what <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> lose if <b>we</b> continue this struggle--really, Chairman, we must bring it to an end, on the best terms we can make.|$|R
6000|$|The Ellisons {{were going}} up the Saguenay before coming on to Boston, and urged our friends hard to go with them. [...] "No, that must be for another time," [...] said Isabel. [...] "Mr. March has to be home by a certain day; and <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> just <b>get</b> <b>back</b> in season." [...] Then she made them promise to spend a day with her in Boston, and the Colonel coming {{to say that he}} had a {{carriage}} at the door for their excursion to Lorette, the two parties bade good-by with affection and many explicit hopes of meeting soon again.|$|R
6000|$|Frank Muller {{rose and}} walked twice {{up and down}} the room before he answered. [...] "Shall I tell you?" [...] he asked, and then, without waiting for a reply, went on: [...] "It will end in our <b>getting</b> the country <b>back.</b> That is what this {{armistice}} means. There are thousands of rooibaatjes there at the Nek; they cannot therefore be waiting for soldiers. They are waiting for an opportunity to yield, uncle. <b>We</b> <b>shall</b> <b>get</b> the country <b>back,</b> and you will be President of the Republic." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{will remain}} {{eternally}} true {{that if we}} have no Volk, we shall have no public, no nationality, no literature of our own which shall {{live and work in}} us. Unless our literature if founded on our Volk, we shall write eternally for closet sages and disgusting critics out of whose mouths and stomachs <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> what we have given." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{old wooden}} {{clock in the}} kitchen began to strike, and she rose briskly {{to her feet and}} went and laid the books she had been holding in her lap on the table beside Mrs. Camp's bed. [...] "We must really be going," [...] she said, as she leaned over and kissed the invalid. [...] "It is your dinner-time, and <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> barely <b>get</b> <b>back</b> for lunch if we go by the Loop road; and I want very much to have Mr. Homos see the Witch's Falls on the way. I have got two or three of the books here that Mr. Makely brought me last night--I sha'n't have time to read them at once--and I'm {{smuggling}} in one of Mr. Twelvemough's, that he's too modest to present for himself." [...] She turned a gay glance upon me, and Mrs. Camp thanked me, and a number of civilities followed from all sides. In the process of their exchange, Mrs. Makely's spirits perceptibly rose, and she came away in high good-humor with the whole Camp family. [...] "Well, now, I am sure," [...] she said to the Altrurian, as we began the long ascent of the Loop road, [...] "you must allow that you have seen some very original characters. But how warped people get living alone so much! That is the great drawback of the country. Mrs. Camp thinks the savings-bank did her a real injury in taking a mortgage on her place, and Reuben seems to have seen just enough of the outside world to get it all wrong. But they are the best-hearted creatures in the world, and I know you won't misunderstand them. That unsparing country bluntness--don't you think it's perfectly delightful? I do like to stir poor Reuben up, and get him talking. He is a good boy, if he is so wrong-headed, and he's the most devoted son and brother in the world. Very few young fellows would waste their lives on an old farm like that; I suppose, when his mother dies, he will marry and strike out for himself in some growing place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Once in {{the night}} I woke--a water-hen was crying, and in the {{moonlight}} a kingfisher flew across. The wonder on the river--the wonder of the moon and trees, the soft bright mist, the stillness! It was like another world, peaceful, enchanted, far holier than ours. It seemed like {{a vision of the}} thoughts that come to one--how seldom! and go if one tries to grasp them. Magic--poetry-sacred!" [...] He was silent a minute, then went on in a wistful voice: [...] "I looked at her, sleeping like a child, with her hair loose, and her lips apart, and I thought: 'God do so to me, if ever I bring her pain!' How was I to understand her? the mystery and innocence of her soul! The river has had all my light and all my darkness, the happiest days, and the hours when I've despaired; and I like to think of it, for, you know, in time bitter memories fade, only the good remain.... Yet the good have their own pain, a different kind of aching, for <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> never <b>get</b> them <b>back.</b> Sir," [...] he said, turning to me with a faint smile, [...] "it's no use crying over spilt milk.... In the neighbourhood of Lucy's inn, the Rose and Maybush--Can you imagine a prettier name? I have been all over the world, and nowhere found names so pretty as in the English country. There, too, every blade of grass; and flower, has a kind of pride about it; knows it will be cared for; and all the roads, trees, and cottages, seem to be certain that they will live for ever.... But I was going to tell you: Half a mile from the inn was a quiet old house which we used to call the 'Convent'--though I believe it was a farm. We spent many afternoons there, trespassing in the orchard--Eilie was fond of trespassing; if there were a long way round across somebody else's property, she would always take it. We spent our last afternoon in that orchard, lying in the long grass. I was reading Childe Harold for the first time--a wonderful, a memorable poem! I was at that passage--the bull-fight--you remember: ...|$|R

"Go back! {{of course}} not," [...] said the accountant; [...] "in {{a short time}} <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>get</b> into the old woodcutters' track of last year, and {{although}} it's not beaten at all, yet it is pretty level and open, so that <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> <b>get</b> on famously." ...|$|R
