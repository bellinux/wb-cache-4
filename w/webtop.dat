Calendars can contain feeds from Twitter, Blogger, MySpace, Facebook, WordPress, Vox, and Upcoming.org, which generates a social timeline listing all of a user's recent online activity. Users can also import and export data as ics or csv files, or as an RSS feed. The website includes a plain-language event adding feature, which allows users to type phrases such as “Drinks with Richard, tomorrow, 7-9pm, Flute and Whistle”. The website then translates the phrase into an event, determining the location, time, date, and description. Users can add buddies and share calendars with them. 30 Boxes features a simple <b>webtop,</b> which summarizes daily appointments and to-do items. Users can also add applets to the page, such as Google search, Yahoo! Mail, and Google Calendar, a competing online calendar service. 30 Boxes also offers a mobile version of their calendar.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the context}} of a web desktop, the term <b>Webtop</b> was first {{introduced}} by the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in 1994 for a web-based interface to their Unix operating system. This application was based on the provisional application entitled [...] "The Adaptive Internet Protocol System" [...] filed Nov. 13, 1997, serial number 60/065,521 and is the U.S. patent for the technology used in the Tarantella <b>Webtop.</b> Andy Bovingdon and Ronald Joe Record, who both explored the concepts in different directions, are often credited as the inventors. The initial SCO <b>Webtop,</b> developed by Record, utilized a Netscape Navigator plugin to display applications in a browser window via TightVNC. A trademark application for [...] "SCO Webtop" [...] was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on November 8, 1996. In order to avoid confusion with the more complex technology incorporated into the Tarantella <b>Webtop</b> it was abandoned on December 24, 1997 by The Santa Cruz Operation.|$|E

However, the leaks included many bugs, such as the <b>webtop</b> launcher causing systemUI to crash, white text in the widgets menu (In custom launchers), and facelock not enabling correctly. Leak 6.7.235 will not let users FXZ back to OTA 5.9.902.|$|E
50|$|The Atrix 4G {{was one of}} {{the first}} Motorola devices to ship with its <b>Webtop</b> platform. When the phone is placed into its HD Multimedia Dock or Laptop Dock accessories, the user can access an Ubuntu-based desktop {{featuring}} access to the phone and its applications via the Mobile View'application, integration of Android notifications into the desktop, multimedia playback through Entertainment Center, file management through Nautilus, and the Firefox web browser (along with support for Prism for the site-specific browsers used on <b>Webtop</b> mode).|$|E
50|$|The first SCO <b>Webtop</b> {{releases}} {{were part}} of SCO Skunkware before being integrated into SCO OpenServer version 5 and UnixWare 7. Tarantella was subsequently purchased by Sun Microsystems and integrated into their Sun Secure Global Desktop.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 SCO {{released}} the UnixWare 7.1 update which {{increased the number}} of editions, the Business (5-user), Department (25 user) and Enterprise (50 user) editions replaced the earlier personal and server editions. The <b>WebTop</b> application from Tarantella, Inc. was included.|$|E

50|$|Bovingdon's three tiered {{architecture}} (TTA) {{concept was}} launched as the Tarantella <b>Webtop.</b> This technology originated from early commercial use of web server technology by SCO. the first OS vendor {{to include a}} commercial web server, NCSA HTTPd, and commercial web browser, NCSA Mosaic. Their X.desktop product line, obtained when they acquired IXI Limited in the UK, {{was the first to}} have icons for URLs (controlled via the Deskshell scripting language) and an HTML-based help system, called DeskHelp, which extended the NCSA Mosaic web browser to include APIs and scripting linked to the X.desktop product for interactive control. The IXI Limited scripting language based on Python was later replaced with JavaScript. Tarantella allowed real UNIX and Windows applications to be displayed within a web browser through the use of Java to form a true web based desktop or <b>Webtop.</b>|$|E

50|$|As {{applications}} {{could be}} executed {{in an integrated}} and parallel way, the OOS could have been considered a web desktop or <b>webtop.</b> It provided basic services such as a GUI, a virtual file system, access control management and possibilities to develop and deploy applications online. As the Online Operating System was executed within a web browser, it was no real operating system but rather a portal to various web applications, offering a high usability and flexibility.|$|E
50|$|Development {{has been}} {{cancelled}} {{by the original}} programmer, however the code has been open-sourced. Development includes fixing bugs and uploading fixes as soon as possible, and testing {{to make sure the}} program works properly and is secure. Unlike earlier versions of the Desktop Edition, XProduct is not releasing updates unless they actually work and have been tested. A tablet version of xOS is in the works to add to the Desktop and Mobile platforms. A developer page is available on the xOS <b>Webtop</b> website for those interested in development.|$|E
5000|$|Metadata and {{multiple}}categorization {{can also}} be applied to provide multiple retrieval paths customized {{to the way the}} individual thinks and works with their information sources. <b>WebTop</b> allowed the user to create explicit links between documents, but then also merged these user-defined relationships with other types of associations. These included the hyperlinks contained in the documents, associations implied by structural relationships, and content similarities discovered by text analysis. The idea was that any way in which items can be considered [...] "related" [...] should be made available to the user for help with retrieval.|$|E
50|$|On January 5, 2011, Motorola Mobility {{announced}} that the Atrix 4G and the Droid Bionic were headed to AT&T and Verizon, respectively, with expected release dates in Q1 of 2011. The Atrix was released on February 22 as the world's first phone with both a Dual-Core Processor and 1 GB of RAM. The phone also had optional peripherals such as a Multimedia Dock and a Laptop Dock which launched a <b>Webtop</b> UI. On February 24, {{two days after the}} release of Atrix, the company released Motorola Xoom, the world's first Android 3.0 tablet, and followed it up shortly afterwards with an update to make it the world's first Android 3.1 tablet.|$|E
50|$|ZeroPC was a {{commercial}} <b>webtop</b> developed by ZeroDesktop, Inc. located in San Mateo, California. ZeroPC {{has been called}} a personal cloud OS.

The software was launched in September 2011 through Disrupt SF 2011 event and recently selected to the finalist of SXSW 2012 in Innovative Web Technology category. ZeroPC is web-based and required Java applet to operate bundled productivity tool Thinkfree. The web applications found on ZeroPC are built on Java in the back end. Features included drag-and-drop functionality, cloud dashboard and personal cloud storage meta services.|$|E
5000|$|The {{knowledge}} element actually {{represents an}} original source. This {{is the case}} for document management systems (<b>WebTop,</b> MyLifeBits, Haystack), integrated search facilities (NaviQue, CYCLADES), VIKI/VKB. [...] Tinderbox will also allow one of its notes to be a URL, and the user can control whether its contents should be captured once, or [...] "auto-fetched" [...] as to receive constant web updates. Many systems, in addition to storing a page of free text for each knowledge element, also permit any number of hyperlinks to be attached to a knowledge element (e.g., Freemind, PersonalBrain, Inspiration). VNS, which allows users to point to a community notebook page from within their personal notebook, gives similar functionality.|$|E
50|$|Desktoptwo {{was a free}} <b>Webtop</b> (whose URL was desktoptwo.com {{and which}} is now parked domain) {{developed}} by Sapotek (whose URL was sapotek.com, which also now is parked domain). It's also been called a WebOS although Sapotek stated on its website that the term is premature and presumptuous. It mimics the look, feel and functionality of the desktop environment of an operating system. The software only reached beta stage. It had a Spanish version called Computadora.de. Desktoptwo was web-based and required Adobe Flash Player to operate. The web applications' found on Desktoptwo were built on PHP in the back end. Features included drag-and-drop functionality. Sapotek had liberated all the web applications found on Desktoptwo through Sapodesk on an AGPL license.|$|E
