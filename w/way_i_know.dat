[...] In 1919, he helped start the tradition in which flags bearing gold stars {{are attached to the}} goals prior to the season opener. This was first done to honor three former Hopkins players who were killed in action during the First World War. The tradition has continued to date and additional stars have been added for players killed in the Second World War and Viet Nam.|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{has written}} nearly thirty books, {{some of which}} are {{mentioned}} here. After the 1996 season, he released an autobiography titled The Only <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know,</b> co-written with Mike Bryan, which was a New York Times bestseller. Following his retirement, he wrote several more, including Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Larry Burke, in 2005. He released the book Parenting Young Athletes the Ripken Way, co-written with Rick Wolff, in 2006 after seeing too many young athletes who he felt were being pressured unnecessarily by their parents. He said, [...] "I was thinking, 'This just creates too much pressure on kids.' They need to find an environment in which they can explore their game... without all these kinds of pressures being brought to bear. Once I started thinking about it, I saw we had more than enough to fill a book." [...] Then in 2007, he released three books, starting with Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Scott Lowe, which highlights 50 practice drills, topics include coaching responsibly, goal setting for youth, and effective practice planning. Later, in April of that year, he released two more books: Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference, co-written with Donald T. Phillips, described as a motivational guide to success; and The Longest Season, co-written with Ron Mazellan, a children's book about the Orioles' 1988 season. In 2011, he released Hothead, a children's fiction book co-written with Kevin Cowherd which was also a New York Times bestseller. In addition, he has been writing a weekly youth sports advice newspaper column in the Baltimore Sun since 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding his {{religious}} beliefs, Carolla has stated, [...] "I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don't {{think there is}} no God; I know there's no God. I know there's no God the same <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> many other laws in our universe. I know there's no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{private sector}} {{should be given}} more {{autonomy}} to direct matters that deal directly with youth empowerment and job creation. In this regard, NASSI will lead a networking initiative that will include value chain-related organisations along with states and local governments. NASSI will, through this partnership, adequately address the issues and factors that militate against the growth of SMEIs and work out positive and workable frameworks that will {{once and for all}} ensure the growth of SMEIs. Government can not create jobs in a sustainable way. There is need to boost production and ensure that small-scale industries contribute 90 to 95 per cent to GDP. That is why I ask you, can government actually create jobs? To this particular question, my answer is no! And I speak as an expert on this matter. The other sustainable <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> is to create a powerful private sector-driven entrepreneurial base, propelled and predicated on small and medium scale industries and the informal sector." ...|$|E

Furthermore, she stated [...] "whether it's gospel or not, I wrote about it", therefore expecting [...] "some of her gospel fans to be a little upset" [...] but wanted to [...] "keep it real".

Williams then said [...] "this whole album is about God's love and me". After being asked [...] "Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do You Know, as they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?", Williams responded [...] "That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what I went through, I know God is taking me to another level. I had people around me that were not going where I was going – I had to release them from my life." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{he gave to}} Uncut magazine in 2005 Plant recounted: We had some good songs Walking into Clarksdale, but I wasn't sure about the production. I felt kind of marooned.

And I realised once again {{there had to be}} another <b>way...</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had to get back to playing clubs and remember what pulse was all about.

5000|$|The {{thing about}} rock'n'roll {{is that for}} me anyway it wasn't enough...
