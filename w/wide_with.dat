5|$|Between Tilbury and Highway402, {{the highway}} remains four lanes <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> a grass median. The {{widening}} and upgrading {{of this section}} is in the planning stages, with construction possibly beginning in 2017 and lasting for several years. Several interchanges are slated to be upgraded {{as part of this}} construction.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the section}} Mycena, M.multiplicata {{is similar to}} the Malaysian species M.obcalyx in having a grayish-white cap, lobed cheilocystidia with finger-like outgrowths, and a lignicolous habitat. M.obcalyx may be {{distinguished}} by forming much smaller fruit bodies (with caps 2–4mm <b>wide)</b> <b>with</b> subdecurrent gills, a pruinose, hyaline white stem, and broadly ellipsoid spores.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} {{into the}} town of East Windsor, the roadway becomes two lanes <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> auxiliary left turn lanes and is known as South Main Street. It intersects with Route 191 (Phelps Street), {{which leads to the}} East Windsor town center. About half a mile (0.8km) north of this junction, US 5 leaves Main Street to go on Prospect Hill Road, bypassing the Warehouse Point area. There is also a partial interchange with I-91 in this area (at exit 44). Just south of the Enfield town line, US 5 intersects with Route 140, which crosses the Connecticut River {{into the town}} of Windsor Locks and Bradley International Airport.|$|E
50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1930 the lack of body room and {{difficult}} access to the interior was recognised by Wolseley and new four-seater two-door coachwork was provided which was considerably longer and <b>wider</b> <b>with</b> <b>wider</b> doors.|$|R

5|$|FM1957 {{begins at}} FM471 near Rio Medina, as a two-lane country road. It then {{traverses}} mostly rural, undeveloped land, {{before reaching the}} Bexar–Medina county line, where it becomes Potranco Road. In far western Bexar County, Potranco Road travels through recently built, patchy, residential developments. Development becomes somewhat heavier after the highway passes State Highway211 (SH211), but FM1957 still displays mostly rural characteristics until the highway reaches Loop1604, at which point it enters the San Antonio city limits. Now five lanes <b>wide,</b> <b>with</b> two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane, the legislative definition of FM1957 becomes UR1957; however, Potranco Road remains signed as FM1957.|$|E
5|$|In Coats Grove, Michigan, {{teenager}} Bobby Rich is berated by {{his stepfather}} Phil for not finishing his lawn {{work outside the}} house. Bobby runs into a nearby orchard and Phil gives chase. When Bobby's mother, Patti, follows them into the orchard, she discovers Phil's body partially buried, seemingly drowned in mud. Kneeling beside Phil is Bobby, his eyes <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> terror.|$|E
5|$|June 24, 2010: A tornado briefly {{touched down}} in {{downtown}} Bridgeport, {{embedded within a}} larger area of strong wind damage which downed trees and damaged several buildings. 9 roofs were damaged causing the city to declare a state of emergency. The National Weather service confirmed it as an EF1 tornado, estimating it to be 100 yards <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> winds of at least 100mph. The damage was especially concentrated to {{the east end of}} Bridgeport and the Lordship section of Stratford. Both areas were declared states of emergencies for at least 24 hours after the storm hit.|$|E

5|$|NY92 {{begins as}} a city-maintained highway at an {{intersection}} with US11 (State Street) in downtown Syracuse. The route heads eastward on East Genesee Street, passing under I-81 before splitting into a one-way couplet at Almond Street. For the next two blocks, the eastbound and westbound lanes of NY92 are separated by a small park situated within the block formed by Almond Street, Forman Avenue, and both directions of Genesee Street. The couplet ends just east of Forman Avenue, at which point NY92 continues on as a highway two lanes <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> dedicated cycle lanes in each direction.|$|E
5|$|Robert Mann's {{original}} 1730s {{house was}} a two-storey brick building seven bays <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> a break front. This was extended for the fifth Earl Cornwallis in 1825 by Thomas and William Cubitt. The Cubitts' alterations included adding a third storey to the original house and building two-storey wings four bays wide on each side. The {{house was a}}lso refinished with stucco render. Its hipped roof is covered with slates.|$|E
5|$|The Acors Barns House {{is located}} in New London, Connecticut. Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival house with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> a Greek Revival portico leading to the main entrance. Additions to the house include a {{projecting}} center dormer, and second-story projection over a partially enclosed veranda. The plain exterior is contrasted by interior's elaborate hall ceilings, detailed woodwork and arched marble fireplaces.|$|E

The north façade features tall sash windows on the ground and first floors of 12 panes; the second floor windows to the central section are shorter and of nine panes. moulded stucco cornices run above the ground and first floor windows. The east and west façades are five bays <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> a two-storey projecting bay on the east end and a single-storey projecting bay on the west end.|$|E
5|$|The family Balaenidae {{contains}} two genera and four species. All the Balaenidae whales have no ventral grooves; a distinctive head shape with a strongly arched, narrow rostrum, bowed lower jaw; lower lips that enfold {{the sides and}} front of the rostrum; long, narrow, elastic baleen plates (up to 9 times longer than <b>wide)</b> <b>with</b> fine baleen fringes; and fused cervical vertebrae rendering the head immobile.|$|E
5|$|The {{field at}} Waterloo was 5.5km <b>wide,</b> <b>with</b> two {{parallel}} ridges running west to east, creating a shallow valley 1.4km across. On the allied right lay the chateau of Hougoumont, {{a collection of}} walled farm buildings lying closer to the French line than the Allies' line. Recognising its defensive importance, Wellington ordered Hanoverian and Nassau troops to occupy the farm. In allied hands, it would provide cover for flanking fire against any French assault of the main allied line; in French hands, it would provide a bastion from which they could launch attacks. Since it defended the Nivelles road {{as well as the}} Allies' right flank, Wellington ordered that it was to be held at all costs.|$|E

50|$|In the 2000s, the {{franchised}} bus companies {{continued to}} introduce new super low floor double-deckers. In 2003, KMB introduced {{the first new}} generation super low floor double-decker (TransBus Enviro500) <b>with</b> <b>wider</b> (<b>with</b> the width of 2550mm instead of 2500mm) bodywork and straight staircase.|$|R
50|$|The Berryessa Valley {{was about}} 10 mi long and 3 mi at its <b>widest,</b> <b>with</b> Putah Creek running through its center. Several {{thousand}} years before Europeans arrived, Pomo {{people lived in}} relative ease on the rich land, as wildlife and plant foodstuffs were plentiful.|$|R
5|$|The first turuma, Norden, was c. 35m (116ft) {{long and}} 8m (26.5ft) <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> {{a draft of}} 3.3m (11ft). By the third ship, the Lodbrok (1771), the hull had been {{expanded}} to 38.5m (126ft) by 9.5m (31ft) and remained roughly the same. The armament was considerably heavier {{than that of the}} galleys, or the smaller udemas and pojomas. It had one full gundeck of 22 (24 in the ships built before 1790) 12-pounders in a regular broadside arrangement, firing through gunports. On the forecastle deck facing straight forward were two 18-pounders. For close-range action it carried another up to 24 3-pound swivel guns along the railings. In addition, there was also two 12-pound stern chasers.|$|E
5|$|The first udema Gamla was c. 30m (100ft) {{long and}} with a draft of 1.5m (5ft). The later udemas,Torborg and Ingeborg, carried a mizzen mast, and were both longer and wider, 37m (121ft) long and almost 9m (29ft) <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> a draft of just over 3m (10ft). Torborg, built in 1772, had three {{additional}} 12-pounders, eleven in the centerline and two in the bow facing forwards, housed under a decked superstructure with gun ports, but with the rowing seats left undecked. This arrangement proved to be less successful with reports about problems with splintering and lingering gunpowder smoke. She was also a poor sailer and slow under oars, earning the udema a poor reputation.|$|E
5|$|The front façade of {{the house}} faces a hill to the southwest. It is five bays <b>wide,</b> <b>with</b> the front {{entrance}} at the first floor's center bay. Wide double-hung sash windows are uniformly placed on the house's front façade, with four nine-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the first story and five six-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the second. Each window is surrounded by green-painted wooden shutters and white-painted wooden lintels and sills.|$|E
50|$|Hot metal {{typesetting}} {{in earlier}} times used the so-called optical scaling, when fonts were cut bolder and <b>wider</b> <b>with</b> decreasing point size. With analogue calculations Peter Karow {{made it possible to}} automatically adjust the fonts to certain point sizes. Nowadays, however, this technique is not often used.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, {{it became}} abundantly {{clear that the}} low {{scientific}} level of the nation could not possibly yield elaborate weapons. Thus, {{during the course of}} the war, the gap between the Japanese and the American scientific potential for national defense grew ever <b>wider</b> <b>with</b> the passage of time.|$|R

5|$|The {{mushrooms}} {{produce a}} white spore print, and the spores are broadly elliptical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, measuring 6–7.5 by 4–5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, without clamps, and measure 17–32 by 6.0–7.5μm. The hymenium lacks cystidia. The {{arrangement of the}} hyphae in the cap cuticle ranges from a cutis (with hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (hyphae perpendicular to the cap surface); these hyphae are roughly cylindrical, and measure 3.5–8.0μm <b>wide,</b> <b>with</b> roughly cylindrical to club-shaped ends that are 6.0–11.0μm wide. There are no clamp connections in the hyphae of T.vaccinum.|$|E
5|$|The spherical spores measure 3–5μm, {{including}} an outer covering (an epispore) of about 0.5μm. Their surface texture ranges from smooth to faintly warted. They have an oil droplet, and a translucent pedicel (a small stalk) up to 2.5μm long. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 10–12.5μm long by 5–7.5μm wide. The capillitium comprises short, highly branched (resembling antlers) and entangled threads measuring 5–10μm <b>wide</b> <b>with</b> walls up to 2.5μm thick. Capillitial threads {{do not have}} septa.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the chamber is closed off with a slab {{measuring}} about 4.42 metres (14 feet, 6 inches) <b>wide,</b> <b>with</b> a thickness of 30 centimetres (1 foot) and a depth of around 2.44 metres (8 feet). A collapsed, broken slab lies at the chamber's opening, eastern end. It {{is also possible that}} a largely rectangular slab {{at the bottom of the}} slope had once been part of the chamber's eastern end. Excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens; 20th-century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement, allowing the stones to continue standing upright.|$|E
