500|$|Lord Carteret read {{passages}} from the fourth letter about Irish constitutional independence to the Irish Privy Council and claimed that they were treasonable. It was then that Harding was arrested for printing the letters and a reward of £300 was offered for {{the identity of the}} Drapier. Lord Carteret wrote that the arrest and bounty were the result of an [...] "unfortunate accident" [...] and {{he did not want to}} respond in such a way. Lord Midleton was also forced to denounce his previous ally, the Drapier, <b>when</b> <b>did</b> so when he wrote, [...] "to provoke England to that degree as some have endeavoured to do, is not the true way to keep them out". Archbishop King responded to the letters by saying they were [...] "ludicrous and satyrically writ". However, the Archbishop publicly supported the constitutional actions more than the other three, and his support caused others important officials to criticise him.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song were criticized with BBC's Nick Reynolds saying that {{although}} the group [...] "reinvent themselves as domestic goddesses for some lucky man", the song was neither convincing nor good. He further opined [...] "I thought {{they were supposed to}} be independent women?!" [...] juxtaposing it with the group's earlier song [...] "Independent Women" [...] (2000). Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone echoed his statements, writing [...] "Jerkins should hang his head in shame for having a hand in the maudlin 'Cater 2 U,' a saccharine tune about how low Knowles, Rowland and Williams will stoop to prove their devotion to their man... Since <b>when</b> <b>did</b> these independent women become so craven?". Sean Fennessey of Pitchfork Media also stated that [...] "their swan song of sorts... completely defies the winking empowerment most of their greatest jams provided". He further described the production as [...] "milky and slight", the chorus as [...] "limp" [...] and the song overally as [...] "a Prince mock-up of the worst kind". Jess Harvell of the same website offered similar criticism: [...] " [...] reneged on everything early DC stood for in a parade of kept-wifey pleas". Alex MacPherson of Stylus Magazine dismissed the sincerity of the lyrics classifying [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] as a [...] "queasy" [...] song. Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph panned it as [...] "cringe inducing, with lots of sensuous moaning". Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote, [...] "I thought this was the kind of song bands recorded by mistake then hid guiltily in the attic".|$|E

[...] Grove of Film Threat panned Cook, uttering that [...] "she’s no great actress, but she’s a real looker" [...] and teased that [...] "since <b>when</b> <b>did</b> a horror movie suffer from having two dumb blondes as leads", the other actress referring to Larter, whom [...] "spends the whole movie looking miserable with her frigid acting." [...] Dustin Putman of TheMovieBoy.com commented how [...] "Cook is serviceable as the premonition-fueled Kimberly, but doesn't evoke enough emotion in the scenes following the brutal deaths of her close friends." [...] Robin Clifford of Reeling Reviews stated that [...] "Cook was strident as the catalyst that sparks events with her premonitions of disaster and her fervent desire to cheat the Reaper" [...] whereas Larter was [...] "giving the smart-ass edge her character needs"; while Brett Gallman of Oh, The Horror! claimed that Larter [...] "is again the bright spot", along with Cook and Landes who were [...] "serviceable as leads" [...] and Todd [...] "whose purpose has still yet to be revealed in the franchise." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2005 Lancashire {{starred in}} The Rotters' Club as a {{housewife}} in 1970s Birmingham. Also in 2005 {{she appeared in}} the BBC television film Cherished as Angela Cannings, a British woman who was wrongfully convicted of killing her two baby sons. Lancashire was proud {{to be involved with}} the project, having greatly admired Cannings strength of character during her ordeal, and being able to relate to her sense of anguish as a parent. In December 2005, Lancashire returned to West End theatre, taking on the role of Miss Adelaide in the Donmar Warehouse production of Guys and Dolls at the Piccadilly Theatre. Lancashire was due to stay with the production until March 2006, but due to a severe chest infection made her last appearance on 4 January. In 2006 Lancashire accepted an invitation to write a short autobiographic entry in Who's Who, an establishment [...] "bible" [...] of influential figures judged to have {{had a significant impact on}} British life and culture. Lancashire's only television acting role in 2006 was as house-wife and cake-maker Elaine in the BBC comedy drama Angel Cake. In November she presented an episode of the Five documentary series Disappearing Britain in which she interviewed people with memories of Wakes Week holidays in Blackpool during the early 20th century. In February 2007 she made an appearance in the E4 teen drama series Skins. This was followed by a leading role in the BBC Two television drama Sex, the City and Me as solicitor Ruth Gilbert. In October, Lancashire appeared in her first feature film, David Nicholls' And <b>When</b> <b>Did</b> You Last See Your Father? in which she played aunt Beaty. In December, she played the supporting role of Mrs Corney in the BBC's 2007 adaption of Charles Dickens' 1838 novel Oliver Twist. Whilst ambivalent about the serial as a whole, The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon singled Lancashire out for praise stating that she [...] "really sets the tone for the cold, unfeeling world into which orphaned Oliver is born." ...|$|E
