25|$|The halting {{problem is}} {{historically}} {{important because it}} was one of the first problems to be proved undecidable. (Turing's proof <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> in May 1936, whereas Alonzo Church's proof of the undecidability of a problem in the lambda calculus had already been published in April 1936 (Church, 1936).) Subsequently, many other undecidable problems have been described.|$|E
25|$|Krause {{publicly}} portrayed Jackson as a two-faced {{character who}} {{had very little}} regard for his assistant coaches, a perception that certain Krause associates in the Bulls organization had sought to spread about Jackson. At {{the height of the}} hard feelings in the spring of 1998, one of Krause's scouts <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> row in Chicago's United Center to explain to a reporter the insidious nature of Jackson's ego (excerpt from the Phil Jackson biography Mindgames).|$|E

25|$|In 1716, {{he became}} censor {{as well as}} a {{director}} of the College of Physicians, but the Hanoverians were not as taken with Blackmore as William or Anne had been. In that year, he had two volumes of Essays upon Several Subjects published, with an attack on Alexander Pope in the second volume.

25|$|Apollinaire first {{intended}} {{this book}} to be a general collection of his writings on art entitled Méditations Esthétiques rather than specifically on Cubism. In the fall of 1912 he revised the page proofs to include more material on the Cubist painters, adding the subtitle, Les Peintres Cubistes. When the book <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press,</b> the original title was enclosed in brackets and reduced in size, while the subtitle Les Peintres Cubistes was enlarged, dominating the cover. Yet Les Peintres Cubistes appears only on the half t.p. and t.p. pages, while every other page has the title Méditations Esthétiques, suggesting the modification was made so late that only the title pages were reprinted.|$|E
25|$|The Evening Chronicle <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> for {{the last}} time in 1980. In 1981 Edward D. Miller left the newspaper, and Donald P. Miller {{returned}} as chairman. The publisher and chief executive officer was Bernard C. Stinner. They retained control of the newspaper until 1984, when it was sold to The Times Mirror Company, joining the Los Angeles Times, Newsday, The Baltimore Sun, the Hartford Courant and Southern Connecticut Newspapers Inc., publishers of the Stamford Advocate and Greenwich Times. Gary K. Shorts was publisher and chief executive officer from 1987 until succeeded by Guy Gilmore in 2000. Susan Hunt was named publisher in June 2001.|$|E

25|$|This strife also {{involved}} the Wandervogel movement, a youth organization emphasizing a romantic view of nature. Wandervogel took flight in 1896, {{the same year}} that the journal Der Eigene <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press.</b> It was published by a twenty-two-year-old German, Adolf Brand, and it advocated classical pederasty as a cure for the moral flabbiness of German youth. Influenced by the ideas of Gustav Wyneken, the Wandervogel movement was quite open about its homoerotic tendencies, although this kind of affection was supposed to be expressed in a nonsexual way. The founding of Young Wandervogel happened largely as a reaction to the public scandal about these erotic tendencies, which were said to alienate young men from women.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours was that most, if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: no one had been seen in the parquet or parquet circle. No one had been seen in the dress circle. It was true that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what he knew was not general knowledge. When the morning papers <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press,</b> none carried news of casualties.|$|E
25|$|To {{those who}} worked with him at Bazaar, the {{pinnacle}} of Brodovitch's career as a designer was the unfailing elegance of his pages. This elegance, combined with an element of innovation was the ideal mix for a fashion magazine. The quality that guaranteed his success was his devotion to the new, unending surprise and vitality. Frances MacFadden, Bazaars managing editor for much of Brodovitch's tenure, explained his working method:It was a pleasure to watch him work. He was so swift and sure. In emergencies, like the time the Clipper bearing the report of the Paris Collections was held up in Bermuda, his speed was dazzling. A quick splash or two on the cutting board, a minute's juggling of the photostats, a slather of art gum, and the sixteen pages were complete. His layouts, of course, were the despair of copywriters whose cherished tone poems on girdles or minks had to be sacrificed to his sacred white space. Just before we <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press,</b> all the layouts were laid out in sequence on Carmel Snow's floor, and there, under his eye, re-arranged until the rhythm of the magazine suited him.|$|E

New information about Georgine Milmine, moreover, suggests that she would have welcomed biased opinion for its sensational and commercial value. The exact nature of Willa Cather's part in the compiling and writing of the biography remains, accordingly, a matter for further scholarly investigation.|$|E
500|$|The papers did not publish {{news of the}} {{submarine}} attack until 2 June, {{as most of the}} attack occurred after the newspapers <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> on the morning of 1 June. Instead, on the morning after the attack, the front pages carried news of Operation Millennium, the Royal Air Force's first 1,000-bomber raid, although several newspapers included a small interior article mentioning the final reconnaissance flyover. The Federal Censor ordered total censorship of the events, issuing an official statement on the afternoon of 1 June which reported that the Allies had destroyed three submarines in Sydney Harbour, and described the loss of Kuttabul and the 21 deaths as the loss of [...] "one small harbour vessel of no military value". Smith's Weekly finally released the real story on 6 June, and follow-up material in the 13 June issue caused more political damage, prompting the Royal Australian Navy to attempt to charge the newspaper with releasing defence information.|$|E

Dave Campbell's Texas Football {{put out a}} 45,000-copy special issue titled One for the Ages – Vince Young Leads Longhorns to the Fourth National Title. This issue included a column from Longhorn fan Matthew McConaughey as well as 15pages of photos from the Rose Bowl. The cover featured Young kissing the [...] "crystal football" [...] national championship trophy. Sports Illustrated held up their regular weekly edition to await {{the results of the}} Rose Bowl. They finally <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> with a cover showing Young diving into the end zone with the label [...] "Superman". Analysis inside the issue gave Young {{a large part of the}} credit for the win. They also printed a special commemorative issue in the state of Texas with Young on the cover, shouting in triumph amidst a storm of multi-colored confetti after winning the game. Features in the special edition included a story on Vince Young's Glory Days by Tim Layden, as well as a story dissecting How the Rose Bowl was won by Austin Murphy. The issue was on sale alongside the regular edition of the magazine. General Mills produced a commemorative issue Wheaties box featuring Mack Brown and a Texas Longhorns football helmet on the front. The commemorative packaging was sold nationwide. Texas is the first national college football champion to be featured since Nebraska was on the box in 1997.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the more}} serious {{allegations}} – such as stealing from the dead and assault of police officers and rescue workers – appeared on 18 April, although several evening newspapers published on 15 April 1989 also gave inaccurate reporting of the disaster, as these newspapers <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> before the full extent or circumstances of the disaster had been confirmed or even reported. This included the Wolverhampton-based Express & Star, which reported that the match had been cancelled {{as a result of}} a [...] "pitch invasion in which many fans were injured". This article was presumably published before there were any reports that people had been killed.

2500|$|The Suns {{headline}} [...] "Gotcha" [...] {{is probably}} the most notorious headline in a British newspaper about the incident. Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of the popular tabloid, is reported to have used an impromptu exclamation by The Suns features editor, Wendy Henry, as the inspiration for the headline. The accompanying text reported that General Belgrano had only been hit and damaged, not sunk. [...] After early editions <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> further reports suggested a major loss of life and Mackenzie toned down the headline in later editions to read [...] "Did 1,200 Argies drown?" [...] Despite its notoriety, few readers in the UK saw the headline at first hand as it was only used on copies of the first northern editions; southern editions and later editions in the north carried the toned-down headline.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are other}} {{elements}} {{to the book}} which are intriguing and mysterious. They require careful analysis, to piece together a likely sequence of {{events that led to}} production of the final version. Luckily Matthew is quite informative and open about the events occurring simultaneous to his writing, and that he found them to be of such considerable importance that not only did they distract his attention so he completely forgot about his book sitting with the printers, but they also had consequence for the relevancy of some of his ideas already committed to the page. In response to certain events, Matthew clearly added sections, marked by his introductory statements, such as, [...] "Since writing the above …", [...] "Since this volume <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> …", [...] "After the preceding parts of this volume had gone to press …", etc. This post hoc approach has created a distinctive halting flow and discontinuity between sections. The book is therefore structured in an unorthodox way, {{as a result of the}} iterative process in assembling the content, and the reviews reflect this confusion.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{foreword}} to his book, Huygens wrote: [...] "It {{should be}} said, also, {{that for some}} time {{some of the best}} mathematicians of France have occupied themselves with this kind of calculus so that no one should attribute to me the honour of the first invention. This does not belong to me. But these savants, although they put each other to the test by proposing to each other many questions difficult to solve, have hidden their methods. I have had therefore to examine and go deeply for myself into this matter by beginning with the elements, and it is impossible for me for this reason to affirm that I have even started from the same principle. But finally I have found that my answers in many cases do not differ from theirs." [...] (cited by [...] ). Thus, Huygens learned about de Méré's Problem in 1655 during his visit to France; later on in 1656 from his correspondence with Carcavi he learned that his method was essentially the same as Pascal's; so that before his book <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> in 1657 he knew about Pascal's priority in this subject.|$|E
