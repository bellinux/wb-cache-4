5|$|Virginia Dare: The {{daughter}} of Ananias Dare, {{and the first}} English child born in the Americas. In this world, the Roanoke Colony did not disappear in the 1580s; when Steve Rogers <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> world he saved the colony, {{which would have been}} killed by starvation. Dare touches the rift caused by Roger's arrival. She has the ability to transform into white-furred animals when frightened, which she later learns to control, and appears to be the equivalent to Alpha Flight's Snowbird who has a similar appearance and powers, though Neil Gaiman had denied this.|$|E

25|$|Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> {{business}} in 1882 {{when he set}} up a shop in London designing various electrical devices. Ferranti believed in the success of alternating current power distribution early on, {{and was one of the}} few experts in this system in the UK. With the help of Lord Kelvin, Ferranti pioneered the first AC power generator and transformer in 1882. John Hopkinson, a British physicist, invented the three-wire (three-phase) system for the distribution of electrical power, for which he was granted a patent in 1882.|$|E

25|$|With other teams' results {{around them}} not going their way, Blues dropped to 18th {{in the league}} table. Birmingham's final game of April came on the 26th against Liverpool at St Andrew's. Birmingham <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> game having drawn four and won two of their last six {{meetings}} against Liverpool in the Premier League. Birmingham opened the scoring through Forssell on the 34th minute, were looking comfortable {{throughout most of the}} game, and Larsson scored a 30-yard free kick to make it 2â€“0. Birmingham, however, let their lead slip, after Peter Crouch and Yossi Benayoun both scored for Liverpool to share the points. Birmingham remained in 18th position.|$|E
25|$|The Scots <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> tournament as favourites, being {{holders of}} the Intercontinental Cup and the ICC Trophy. However, rain in Utrecht {{prevented}} them from a good start against the Dutch, who bowled well enough to have them all out for 217 on the first day. Ian Stanger hit his second first-class fifty and Ryan Watson 46, but South African-born Ryan ten Doeschate took three important, albeit expensive, wickets and medium-pacer Edgar Schiferli finished with four for 46. In reply, Maurits van Nierop lashed out, taking 24 off the Scottish bowlers as the Dutch made 31 for 0 to see them to stumps on day 1. Play was impossible on the next two days, and the Scots now needed to thump Ireland in Aberdeen {{if they were to}} have any hope of qualifying for the semi-finals.|$|E

[...] According to John Hay, who would later become Secretary of State under McKinley, [...] "What a glorious record Mark Hanna has made this year!

500|$|The Boat Race is a {{side-by-side}} rowing {{competition between}} the University of Oxford (sometimes {{referred to as the}} [...] "Dark Blues") and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the [...] "Light Blues"). [...] The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the [...] Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. [...] Oxford <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> year's race as reigning champions, having defeated Cambridge by eleven lengths in the previous year's race. [...] Cambridge however led overall with eight wins to Oxford's six.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{confessed that}} she never tried to change the {{situation}} because [...] " [...] used to be insecure and cautious, and so [...] would {{listen to what the}} people said." [...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, increasing the amount of conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue {{at the drop of a}} hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, I had more time, and I focused more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E
500|$|The Parisian critic Arnold Mortier, {{in a long}} {{review of}} the play, {{described}} it as [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "elegant", and highly praised Dailly's performance as Valdemar, but believed the staging lacked originality: [...] "a {{great deal of money}} <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> production, but very few ideas." [...] Like Sarcey, he commented with some asperity on the metaphorical use of Volsius and Ox as symbols of Good and Evil, rather than attractive young women playing Good and Bad Fairies: [...] "Is it not time, perhaps, to return to that practice?" [...] An anonymous reviewer for The New York Times said of the play: [...] "I have never seen anything more idiotically incoherent, or of which the dialogue is more pretentious," [...] but predicted {{that it would be a}} success because of its spectacular production values. Henri de Bornier gave the play a brief but highly positive notice in La Nouvelle revue, highlighting the elegance of the decor and commenting Verne and d'Ennery had done humankind a [...] "true service" [...] by exploring impossible domains on the stage.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "Refugee Camp Mix" [...] of [...] "Blood on the Dance Floor" [...] {{appeared}} on Jackson's video collection, HIStory on Film, Volume II and Michael Jackson's Vision. The original song would later {{appear on the}} Number Ones DVD, which contained previously unreleased [...] scenes. Furthermore, Paterson recorded an unreleased, alternate version of the music video, shot with an 8 mm camera. Writer David Noh, described it as, [...] "grainy, overexposed, and sexy as shit". According to Paterson, [...] "Michael loved it, but Sony hated it and refused to release it". The New York Times described the United States promotional effort for the Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix campaign as [...] "subdued", creating [...] "hardly a sound" [...] and [...] "perplexing to {{many people in the}} industry". Jackson's label Epic Records, refuted allegations they were not promoting the album sufficiently, saying, [...] "We are completely behind the album... Michael is certainly one of our superstars and is treated as such... We just <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> one with our global hats on". The New York Times acknowledged that promotion was stronger internationally, where Jackson had more commercial force and popularity.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were mostly positive. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio felt that [...] "most of Ortved's work {{provides}} a solid basic history." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a [...] "B+", writing, [...] "you have to admire all the work that <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> unauthorized history." [...] He noted that he [...] "felt a little bad afterward for the central players who got sucker punched. [...] The subsequent testimony about the empire Groening created is contentious and mesmerizing. It's also conflicting and compromised, since {{some of the biggest}} fishies of all did not talk to Ortved. [...] The reader should be wary when sources assert that Groening is little more than an affable frontman for the show or that Brooks sometimes wielded his power imperiously: The guys aren't there to defend themselves. In most cases, though, Ortved amasses quotes from many sources to establish such points, so the negative stuff doesn't seem gratuitous." [...] Michael C. Lorah of Newsarama described the book as a [...] "very effective, very worthwhile read" [...] but felt that Ortved's [...] "editorializing" [...] was [...] "probably the most distracting element {{of the book}}." [...] Michael Hingston of See Magazine called the book [...] "a well-told patchwork that shines formidable light on the show" [...] and gave it three and a half stars. However, he felt the book was released prematurely and should have been published {{after the end of the}} show, also criticizing Ortved's narration and the lack of quotes from Matt Groening or James L. Brooks. Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club pointed out that the book has [...] "numerous factual errors" [...] that [...] "may only trip the alarms of hardcore fans, but even casual readers may be put off by the book's redundancy." [...] He concluded that despite flaws, the [...] "insight into its routines and eccentric personalities can't help but fascinate." ...|$|E
500|$|Kurtzman {{recruited}} his long-time collaborator Will Elder {{to work on}} the strip's illustrations. He {{suggested to}} Elder an [...] "outlineless", painted style, then thought the strip would be better suited by an India inked, outlined comic book style with flat color behind it. Hefner, whose opinion prevailed, preferred the more difficult, fully painted, outlineless look. Kurtzman's suggestions for the feature's name included The Perils of Zelda, The Perils of Irma, and Little Mary Mixup; he settled on Little Annie Fanny, its title and logo a parody of Harold Gray's Little Orphan Annie. The cartoonist began submitting story ideas for the multi-page comic strip to Hefner for approval. Over the twenty-six years he wrote the character, he was allowed (with Playboy substantial budget) to travel for research, photography, and sketching. He followed this with a preliminary script for Hefner, who revised it. Kurtzman then worked out the story's composition, pacing, and action in thumbnail drawings and pencil roughs of each page of the comic, followed by larger, more-detailed layouts on translucent vellum specifying lighting, color, and speech balloon placement. These also required Hefner's approvalâ€”a typical two- to seven-page episode would take as many as nine pages of layout. Kurtzman then discussed the layout with Elder, who drove from his home in New Jersey to Kurtzman's in New York. Kurtzman acted out every detail of the strip; according to Elder, [...] "He would change his voice and take on the characteristics of each role... We'd crack each other up and fall down laughing." [...] This gave Elder what he needed to create the penciling, including [...] "eye pops" [...] (background gags worked into blank areas of Kurtzman's layout; Hefner rejected many, so Elder created as many as possible) and the final rendering. Elder painted in oil, tempera, and watercolor, never using ink. Beginning with a white illustration board, Elder explained he would [...] "pile on" [...] his oil paint, light colors over dark, then apply tempera, then layer several watercolor washes to give Annie luminous tones. [...] "The colors were like gems to me," [...] he said. [...] "I worked very hard to give them iridescence." [...] The work was labor-intensive and deadlines were often difficult to meet, so other artists, including Russ Heath, Arnold Roth, Jack Davis, Al Jaffee, Frank Frazetta, and Paul Coker, were occasionally enlisted to help finish the art. Jaffee, a childhood friend of Elder, said about the experience: [...] "Little Annie Fannie was the most unique, lavishly produced cartoon cum illustration feature ever. Each panel was a miniature masterpiece that Willie glazed and re-glazed in brilliant watercolor until he reached the level of 3-D-like translucence that he wanted. I know from first-hand experience what <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> project." [...] Letterers inked the dialog balloons before Kurtzman cleaned and submitted the finished work. Little Annie Fanny, [...] first comic strip, was the first multi-page comics feature in a major American magazine.|$|E

2500|$|Research was key to {{discovering}} Booker and his music. [...] He died in 1983 {{and many}} of the people who knew him are either dead or reaching that certain age when memories start to fade. [...] So we talked to a lot of people and those conversations led to boxes of old photographs and tapes, video and music libraries in the States and in Europe, and the vaults of television stations, record companies, and museums.

Hall stated that [...] "I met a researcher who was working on soft robots. â€¦ It was an inflatable vinyl arm and the practical app {{would be in the}} healthcare industry as a nurse or doctor's assistant. He had me at vinyl. This particular researcher <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> long pitch but the minute he showed me that inflatable arm, I knew we had our huggable robot." [...] Hall stated that the technology [...] "will have potential probably in the medical industry in the future, making robots that are very pliable and gentle and not going to hurt people when they pick them up." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} by Epic Records on May 20, 1997. HIStory on Film, Volume II was released on the same dayâ€”a video collection of Jackson's music videos and television performances from the HIStory era of 1995â€“1997. By Jackson's prior standards, it was not widely promoted upon release. The New York Times described the US promotional effort as [...] "subdued", creating [...] "hardly a sound" [...] and [...] "perplexing to {{many people in the}} industry". Jackson's label Epic Records, refuted allegations they were not promoting the album sufficiently in the United States, saying, [...] "We are completely behind the album...Michael is certainly one of our superstars and is treated as such...We just <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> one with our global hats on". The New York Times acknowledged that promotion was stronger internationally, where Jackson had more commercial force and popularity. Jackson effectively no longer needed the US market to have a hit record. By June 1997, only ten percent of sales from Jackson's prior studio album came from within the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Named after a 1945 book {{of graphic}} {{black and white}} {{photographs}} by Weegee the band performed an aggressive mix of [...] "soundtrack themes, bluesy hard bop, speedy hardcore rock, squealing free jazz [...] metallic funk". Zorn stated that [...] "Naked City started with rhythm and blues/Spillane type things then <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> hard-core thing... because I was living in Japan and experiencing a lot of alienation and rejection... My interest in hard-core also spurred the urge to write shorter and shorter pieces." [...] This approach culminated {{in a string of}} [...] "hardcore miniatures", intense brief compositions often lasting less than a minute, 42 of which were featured on the EP, Torture Garden (1989). Some of these tracks had also featured on the band's debut Naked City and others would resurface on the band's next full-length release, Grand Guignol (1992), which also included performances of works by Claude Debussy, Alexander Scriabin, Orlande de Lassus, Charles Ives, and Olivier Messiaen. [...] The band's third album, Heretic (1992), featured more of these short improvisations produced for the soundtrack of an underground S/M film Jeux des Dames Cruelles. The band released a second EP, Leng Tch'e, in 1992 featuring a single composition which lasted just over half an hour. Radio, released in 1993, was the first Naked City album composed solely by Zorn, and featured tracks crediting a wide range of musical influences.|$|E
