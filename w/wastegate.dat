25|$|A {{turbocharger}} remedies {{this problem}} by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures (turbo-normalizing), or even much higher (turbo-charging), {{in order to produce}} rated power at high altitude. Since the size of the turbocharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the turbocharger is oversized for low altitude. The speed of the turbocharger is controlled by a <b>wastegate.</b> Early systems used a fixed <b>wastegate,</b> resulting in a turbocharger that functioned much like a supercharger. Later systems utilized an adjustable <b>wastegate,</b> controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or electric system. When the aircraft is at low altitude the <b>wastegate</b> is usually fully open, venting all the exhaust gases overboard. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the <b>wastegate</b> must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the <b>wastegate</b> fully closes and the engine still produces full power is the critical altitude. When the aircraft climbs above the critical altitude, engine power output decreases as altitude increases, just as it would in a naturally aspirated engine.|$|E
25|$|A <b>wastegate</b> {{regulates the}} {{exhaust gas flow}} that enters the exhaust-side driving turbine and {{therefore}} the air intake into the manifold {{and the degree of}} boosting. It can be controlled by a boost pressure assisted, generally vacuum hose attachment point diaphragm (for vacuum and positive pressure to return commonly oil contaminated waste to the emissions system) to force the spring-loaded diaphragm to stay closed until the overboost point is sensed by the ecu or a solenoid operated by the engine’s electronic control unit or a boost controller, but most production vehicles use a single vacuum hose attachment point spring-loaded diaphragm that can alone be pushed open, thus limiting overboost ability due to exhaust gas pressure forcing open the <b>wastegate.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{petrol engine}} {{turbocharger}} applications, boost pressure {{is limited to}} keep the entire engine system, including the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including pre-ignition, overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid engine knocking (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the intake manifold pressure must not get too high, thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the <b>wastegate</b> allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe, thus reducing boost pressure. The <b>wastegate</b> can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the engine control unit).|$|E
50|$|External <b>wastegates</b> {{generally}} use a valve {{similar to}} the poppet valve found in the cylinder head. However they are controlled by pneumatics rather than a camshaft and open in the opposite direction. External <b>wastegates</b> can also use a butterfly valve, though that is far less common.|$|R
25|$|Many {{turbocharger}} installations use additional technologies, such as <b>wastegates,</b> intercooling and blow-off valves.|$|R
5000|$|Turbochargers with low-inertia titanium-aluminide {{turbines}} and vacuum-actuated <b>wastegates</b> {{for more}} responsive torque production ...|$|R
25|$|With older {{supercharged}} aircraft, {{the pilot}} must continually adjust the throttle {{to maintain the}} required manifold pressure during ascent or descent. The pilot must also take care to avoid over-boosting the engine and causing damage. In contrast, modern turbocharger systems use an automatic <b>wastegate,</b> which controls the manifold pressure within parameters preset by the manufacturer. For these systems, {{as long as the}} control system is working properly and the pilot's control commands are smooth and deliberate, a turbocharger cannot over-boost the engine and damage it.|$|E
25|$|Yet the {{majority}} of World War II engines used superchargers, because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers, which were larger, involved extra piping, and required exotic high-temperature materials in the turbine and pre-turbine section of the exhaust system. The size of the piping alone is a serious issue; American fighters Vought F4U and Republic P-47 used the same engine, but the huge barrel-like fuselage of the latter was, in part, needed to hold the piping {{to and from the}} turbocharger {{in the rear of the}} plane. Turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines. Pilots must make smooth, slow throttle adjustments to avoid overshooting their target manifold pressure. The fuel/air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of stoichiometric combustion needs to avoid pre-ignition or detonation in the engine when running at high power settings. In systems using a manually operated <b>wastegate,</b> the pilot must be careful not to exceed the turbocharger's maximum rpm. The additional systems and piping increase an aircraft engine's size, weight, complexity and cost. A turbocharged aircraft engine costs more to maintain than a comparable normally aspirated engine. The great majority of World War II American heavy bombers used by the USAAF, particularly the Wright R-1820 Cyclone-9 powered B-17 Flying Fortress, and Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp powered Consolidated B-24 Liberator four-engine bombers both used similar models of General Electric-designed turbochargers in service, as did the twin Allison V-1710-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning American heavy fighter during the war years.|$|E
25|$|Bottas's {{preparation}} for his final timed lap was slightly compromised, {{and made a}} mistake in the first turn, restricting him to eighth. Magnussen took ninth and Kvyat rounded out the top ten after only having the super soft compound tyre available to him. Button was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session; his best lap time of one minute and 46.943 seconds was 1.1 seconds slower than Rosberg's pace in the second session. He locked his front tyres at the turn 13 hairpin on his final timed lap and went wide, losing him time, and struggled with front-end grip despite changing engine and differential settings. Vergne did not improve on his second attempt, struggling with front-end grip, and locked his tyres, restricting him to 12th. The two Force India cars qualified in 13th and 15th (with Hülkenberg ahead of Pérez) after being unable to improve on their fastest laps at their second attempts and were separated by Gutiérrez in the faster of the two Sauber entries. Romain Grosjean was the slowest driver in the second session; he suffered from a turbocharger <b>wastegate</b> problem that prevented him from driving at full power and vented his frustration to Lotus over the radio after being eliminated. Adrian Sutil failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, after having energy management and engine problems that prevented him from pushing hard. Maldonado was affected by the same problem his teammate had and was only able to qualify 18th. Jules Bianchi made minor mistakes on his first timed lap en route to 19th and was ahead of Kamui Kobayashi in 20th. Max Chilton could not extract full engine power on his first attempt because of mapping problems and had to prepare for another lap and took 21st. Marcus Ericsson ventured onto the track late in the first session after his team worked quickly to rectify an electrical issue and completed the field in 22nd.|$|E
50|$|Some 1940s {{aircraft}} engines featured electrically operated <b>wastegates,</b> {{such as the}} Wright R-1820 on the B-17 Flying Fortress. General Electric was the biggest manufacturer of these systems. Being {{before the age of}} computers, they were entirely analog. Pilots had a cockpit control to select different boost levels. Electric <b>wastegates</b> soon fell out of favor due to design philosophies which mandated the separation of the engine controls from the electrical system.|$|R
25|$|The {{control of}} {{turbocharger}} boost {{has changed dramatically}} over the 100-plus years of their use. Modern turbochargers can use <b>wastegates,</b> blow-off valves and variable geometry, as discussed in later sections.|$|R
5000|$|Early-2002 through mid-2003 {{model year}} CRDs were {{equipped}} with a 2.5lt VM Motori Diesel producing [...] and 343 Nm. An external <b>wastegated</b> turbo was standard and the engine was available only with a manual transmission.|$|R
500|$|The turbine itself {{used two}} large exhaust pipes. [...] However, a [...] third pipe was {{situated}} off-center {{for use with}} a <b>wastegate.</b> [...] The <b>wastegate</b> was designed to eliminate the lag between the driver pressing the accelerator and the turbine increasing its revolutions. [...] Once the turbine was at its maximum revolutions, the <b>wastegate</b> helped regulate the amount of fuel actually entering the turbine, thus increasing or decreasing the power output.|$|E
500|$|During Haines' {{ownership}} of chassis #GTP2, Bob McKee completed a spare frame, known as #GTP3, to original specification for Haines. [...] Again, {{due to the}} lack of a Continental turbine, an Allison unit was used instead. [...] The different powerplant required some redesign, as the exhaust was now vented out of the top of the engine cover instead of out the rear of the car. #GTP3 does not have the <b>wastegate</b> system. Haines has entered the car in historic motorsport events, including the 2007 Goodwood Festival of Speed. #GTP4 is still owned by Bob McKee.|$|E
500|$|The second car, chassis #GTP2, was {{converted}} from its open-cockpit bodywork {{back into its}} original closed-cockpit design in a restoration carried out by McKee Engineering {{at the behest of}} new owner Chuck Haines. [...] The restoration of Chassis #GTP2 was completed in July 1996. [...] Original Continental turbines could not be obtained, so an Allison 250C18 turbine was installed. [...] Chuck Haines participated three times at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. [...] In 2006, It was later sold to Xavier Micheron who adapted the <b>wastegate</b> system to the Allison turbine. [...] #GTP2 has since participated in the Le Mans Classic event in 2008, 2010 and 2012, the Classic Endurance Racing series from 2009 to 2012, as well as the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2009. [...] It is now a part of the ROFGO collection.|$|E
50|$|The YD22DDT {{is used in}} the X-Trail, N16 Almera. It {{features}} the VP44 electronic rotary injection system and <b>wastegated</b> turbochargers. The VP44 pump models are easily spotted due to a flat acoustic cover over the engine.|$|R
5000|$|The L28ET used {{a single}} Garrett AiResearch TB03 {{internally}} <b>wastegated</b> turbocharger and no intercooler. Boost {{was limited to}} [...] Other modest changes {{were made to the}} turbo model, with static compression reduced to 7.4:1, and automatic transmission models were given a higher-volume oil pump. The most significant change aside from the turbocharger itself was the introduction of a new engine control system, Nissan's Electronic Concentrated Control System (ECCS).|$|R
50|$|In {{automotive}} applications, 'boost' {{refers to}} the amount by which intake manifold pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure. This {{is representative of the}} extra air pressure that is achieved over what would be achieved without the forced induction. The level of boost may be shown on a pressure gauge, usually in bar, psi or possibly kPa.The control of turbocharger boost has changed dramatically over the 100-plus years of their use. Modern turbochargers can use <b>wastegates,</b> blow-off valves and variable geometry, as discussed in later sections.|$|R
500|$|Following {{completion}} of the two Howmet TXs, the cars {{were brought to the}} 24 Hours of Daytona, the opening round of the 1968 International Championship for Makes. Before even entering competition the TX earned attention, and was featured prominently {{on the cover of the}} race program. [...] Although both cars were in attendance, only the newer (#GTP2) of the two was entered in the race; the other car (#GTP1) was kept as a spare. The driving team of Heppenstall, Dick Thompson, and Ed Lowther qualified with a lap time seventh fastest overall. Several competitors made early refueling stops allowing the Howmet to improve to third place but on lap 34 the turbine <b>wastegate</b> failed to reopen, giving the driver too much power for the corner he was in. [...] The car spun and hit a barrier, forcing the team to retire.|$|E
500|$|By the 12 Hours of Sebring a {{few months}} later, the TX was able to improve its pace, this time {{qualifying}} third, only a second behind a Porsche 907 and a Ford GT40. [...] The turbine ran reliably at first but, as the race continued, debris damaged the turbine and caused it to shake loose from its mounts. The TX was eventually retired after six hours. [...] Following Sebring, the International Championship returned to Europe, and the Howmet team followed. They entered the BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch. <b>Wastegate</b> problems once again caused the car to wreck, this time after only seven laps. [...] Staying in Britain, the Howmet team entered a national sprint race at Oulton Park for British driver Hugh Dibley. The failure of a starter motor during a pit stop, however, once again denied the TX the possibility of finishing the hour-long event.|$|E
500|$|Honda {{started to}} {{introduce}} their {{third and final}} round of upgrades ahead of the , focusing on {{the internal combustion engine}} and associated exhaust parts with the aim of improving the efficiency of the MGU-H and gradually introducing new parts over the next three rounds. The engine ancillaries were reconfigured to allow for better packaging within the chassis, while the axial compressor was replaced with a more conventional—albeit smaller—design. The exhaust <b>wastegate</b> was also updated ahead of planned development for 2016, with the exhaust outlets reconfigured to improve the engine's power curve. Honda chose to focus on the internal combustion engine instead of directly addressing the problems with the MGU-H as they felt that the problems could not be adequately addressed with their remaining allowance for in-season development, and instead deferred development of the MGU-H {{until the end of the}} season when the restrictions on development would be lifted. The upgrades were given to Alonso, with Button scheduled to receive them two rounds later at the [...] The updates were received positively by Alonso, who pointed out that he had been setting lap times that were faster than those recorded by Lewis Hamilton during the opening phase of the race, and that the team had identified the potential to gain two and a half seconds per lap in 2016 through further refining of the engine and by adopting aerodynamic design elements used by other teams. Button was less optimistic, pointing out that the engine would struggle in Mexico as the high altitude of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez—some [...] above sea level—would leave the turbine down on power given the low density of the air. Although the team's predictions of a difficult weekend were proven true after qualifying, they highlighted the deficit to the leading Mercedes through the less power-dependent sectors of the circuit as being consistently within three tenths of a second, the narrowest the margin had been over the course of the season.|$|E
5000|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} added for 1982. This created the Power Ram 50 in the US, as in Dodge's {{nomenclature}} the [...] "Power Ram" [...] name {{was used for}} four wheel drive models. A turbo diesel engine was available in US models between 1983 and 1985. The 1983 turbodiesel was fitted with a TC05 non-wastegated turbo and produced [...] and 125 lbft Nm torque. The 1984-85 turbodiesels were fitted with a TD04 <b>wastegated</b> turbo which resulted in [...] and 134 lbft Nm torque.|$|R
50|$|This engine {{features}} the VP44 rotary injection pump and is turbocharged and intercooled. In the Presage/Bassara it is fitted sideways with a variable vane turbocharger (garrett GT1749V) and torque {{is limited to}} approximately 280 Nm accommodate the 4 speed automatic gearbox attached.In the D22 Navara/Kingcab/Frontier the engine {{is essentially the same}} other than modifications to accessories, mounts and plumbing to accommodate the longitudinal engine layout. The turbo is a <b>wastegated</b> IHI RHF4 which is also intercooled. The stronger gearbox allows it to produce more torque than the Presage/Bassara version.|$|R
5000|$|Though undeniably {{still an}} MR2, the T020 was in all essence a more refined automobile, {{as is the}} nature of any TOM'S {{outfitted}} vehicle. Whilst the T020 was a normally aspirated vehicle, TOM'S also produced equipment for turbocharged models — e.g. <b>wastegates,</b> boost controllers, air filters, a 3S-GTE version of their [...] "TOM'S Barrel" [...] exhaust system, and [...] "T.E.C. II" [...] Engine Control Units. Despite the fact that these products are no longer purchasable brand new, some of these modification parts may still be procured as second-hand items, and are highly sought after by the MR2 community. TOM'S still keeps a T020 part list on their website, and there are still T020 part catalogues in circulation between enthusiasts to this day, albeit second-hand.|$|R
2500|$|Increasing upper-deck air {{pressure}} (compressor discharge) and improving <b>wastegate</b> response ...|$|E
2500|$|A free {{floating}} turbocharger is the simplest type of turbocharger. This configuration has no <b>wastegate</b> and can’t control its own boost levels. They are typically designed to attain maximum boost at full throttle. Free floating turbochargers produce more horsepower {{because they have}} less backpressure, but are not driveable in performance applications without an external <b>wastegate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As the {{turbocharged}} aircraft climbs, {{however, the}} pilot (or automated system) can close the <b>wastegate,</b> forcing more exhaust gas through the turbocharger turbine, thereby maintaining manifold pressure during the climb, {{at least until}} the critical pressure altitude is reached (when the <b>wastegate</b> is fully closed), after which manifold pressure falls. With such systems, modern high-performance piston engine aircraft can cruise at altitudes up to 25,000 feet (above which, RVSM certification would be required), where low air density results in lower drag and higher true airspeeds. This allows flying [...] "above the weather". In manually controlled <b>wastegate</b> systems, the pilot must take care not to overboost the engine, which causes detonation, leading to engine damage.|$|E
50|$|Finally, in 1993 Ford made {{available}} a turbocharged {{edition of the}} 7.3L. An internally <b>wastegated,</b> AR.82 Garrett T3 series turbo {{was used as the}} OEM for the factory turbocharger system. The system was tuned to minimize performance loss at high elevation, rather than to improve peak performance. A primary limiting factor to the performance potential of the engine is an incredibly restrictive stock down-pipe. It is commonly believed, but not officially verified, that this is deliberate and due to Ford's impending release of the T444E (Powerstroke) engine. Factory turbo vehicles received numerous additional improvements. Pistons had an enlarged primary compression ring, added intermediate ring, an enlarged ring land and wrist pin, as well as an anodized piston face. Other improvements included tweaks to the injection pump, and an upgraded oil-coolant heat exchanger.|$|R
50|$|The RB26DETT {{engine is}} a 2.6 L Inline-6 engine {{manufactured}} by Nissan, {{for use in}} the 1989-2002 Nissan Skyline GT-R. The RB26DETT engine block is made from cast iron, while the cylinder head is made from aluminium. The cylinder head contains 24 valves (4 valves per cylinder), and uses a dual overhead camshaft setup. The intake of the RB26DETT varies from other RB-series motors in that it has six individual throttle bodies (3 sets of 2 throttle assemblies that are siamesed together) instead of a single throttle body. The engine also uses a parallel twin-turbo system, using a pair of T25-type ceramic turbochargers set by the <b>wastegates</b> to limit boost pressure to 10 psi, although the Skyline GT-R has a built in boost restrictor to keep boost under 14 psi.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{versions}} of the PA30 were produced: the original, a B model, and a C model. The B and C models can carry six passengers and can be identified by the additional side windows. Factory turbocharged engines became available with the B model. Turbo models can be identified {{by the presence of}} vents on the nacelle sides. These use Rajay turbochargers with manual <b>wastegates</b> operated by twin knobs under the throttle quadrant. They are properly termed [...] "turbonormalized" [...] since the compression ratio and maximum manifold pressure remained unchanged. Pilots are required to use care to avoid overboosting at low altitudes, since no overboost popoff valves are used. Since there is no accompanying power increase, the B/C models simply give owners a fuel vs. passenger tradeoff. The two rearmost seats, occupying the baggage compartment, are quite small.|$|R
2500|$|Power {{came from}} an enlarged, 2.9L (2936 cc) [...] version of the GTO's IHI twin {{turbocharged}} V8 developing a 478bhp, according to Ferrari. Most experts today agree the number was well over 500 bhp. The F40 did without a catalytic converter until 1990 when US regulations made them a requirement for emissions control reasons. The flanking exhaust pipes guide exhaust gases from each bank of cylinders while the central pipe guides gases released from the <b>wastegate</b> of the turbochargers. Engines with catalytic converters bear F120D code.|$|E
2500|$|The new A70 Supra engine, the Toyota 7M-GE, was the {{flagship}} engine of Toyota's arsenal. Both {{versions of the}} engine contained 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead cams. The turbocharged 7M-GTE engine was Toyota's first distributor-less engine offered in the US which used coil packs sitting on the cam covers and a cam position sensor driven by the exhaust camshaft. It was equipped with a CT26 turbocharger and was rated at [...] at 5600 rpm while the naturally aspirated 7M-GE engine was rated at [...] at 6000 rpm. Further refinement on the turbo model increased power to [...] and [...] in 1989. This was mostly due to a redesign of the <b>wastegate.</b> All models used the same tire size of 225/50R16 on 16x7 inch wheels. Spare tires were full-sized but on steel wheels.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the year}} of 1989, {{modifications}} to the <b>wastegate</b> actuator, feed location and engine management netted another [...] on the turbo model. The engine mount and brace were also changed in late 1989, with the exact date not known as of this writing. The changes made to the cross member and mounts made to accommodate the 1JZ engine for Japan models. The protective body molding was also changed by taking away the steel reinforcement. This made the molding lighter and prevented the rusting problem on the previous years. The [...] "white package" [...] was introduced as well, featuring white body molding and white [...] "saw blade" [...] wheels. Interior choices were limited to blue and burgundy only. Other than pure cosmetics, there was nothing different from other models. All models received rear 3-point seat belts to replace the previous years' two-point lap belts. New tail lights, front bumper with integrated lower grille (as opposed to the previous years' detachable grille), side mirrors, turn signals, upper grilles, foglights, steering wheel, door panels, climate control, window switches and bezels, and stereo. Addition of coat hooks on B-pillar and removal of rear seat pockets round out interior changes. Turbo models received three piece spoiler with an integrated LED brake light. 1989 also {{marked the end of}} headlight washers in the US and SuperMonitor; an advanced system offered by Toyota able to calculate miles able to be traveled on current tank, ability to check vehicle codes from inside the cabin, among other features.|$|E
5000|$|The Lamborghini Diablo VTTT (viscous {{traction}} twin turbo) was {{an extremely}} limited production (6 made in 1995, 2 made in 1998, although some say 7 overall) modification of the standard Diablo VT, offered as a special dealer upgrade by Platinum Motors, the Lamborghini dealership of southern California. The cars were equipped with twin blueprinted, water-cooled, Garrett T4 turbochargers with electronically controlled <b>wastegates,</b> custom-built intercoolers, competition-type valves with race-type guides, cylinder heads with polished ports, and a reprogrammed electronic fuel injection system. Modifications to the drivetrain included a custom Kevlar twin-plate clutch {{to cope with the}} extra torque and a new short ratio gearbox to improve acceleration. The brakes were upgraded with cross-drilled, ventilated discs and carbon fiber brake pads. The VTTT featured a dash-mounted switch with three different engine settings including a very limited valet mode and two levels of turbocharger boost ( [...] and [...] ).|$|R
5000|$|The new SL65 AMG Black Series coupe {{features}} a carbon-fiber fixed roof, front fenders, hood, trunk lid, and {{front and rear}} aprons. With the absence of retractable roof hardware, the car is more than 550 pounds lighter than the standard SL. AMG placed {{a modified version of}} the 6.0-liter AMG V12 engine that now delivers [...] and 1000 Nm of torque. This is the same 6.0L engine as used in the previous SL65 model with remapped timing and fuel curves to produce 58 PS more. Torque remains the same, as the previous model, due to transmission limitations. This engine has been labeled as the engine with the largest output that will be made by AMG. Its twin turbochargers are 12 percent larger, passages for intake air and the turbo <b>wastegates</b> have been modified, and the intake air intercooler is 30 percent more efficient. The result is 0-to-60 mph acceleration of 3.8 seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of 198 mph.|$|R
40|$|Turbocharged {{diesel engines}} {{are widely used}} in {{off-road}} applications including construction and mining machinery, electric power generation systems, locomotives, marine, petroleum, industrial and agricultural equipment. Such applications contribute significantly to both local air pollution and CO 2 emissions and are subject to increasingly stringent legislation. To improve fuel economy while meeting emissions limits, manufacturers are exploring engine downsizing by increasing engine boost levels. This allows an increase in IMEP without significantly increasing mechanical losses, which results in a higher overall efficiency. However, {{this can lead to}} poorer transient engine response primarily due to turbo-lag, which is a major penalty for engines subjected to fast varying loads. To recover transient response, the turbocharger can be electrically assisted by means of a high speed motor/generator. When the engine load is increased, the electrical machine acts as a motor to accelerate the turbocharger so that the torque demand can be met rapidly. Conversely, when boost delivery exceeds demand the electrical machine can act as a generator to recover energy that would otherwise be <b>wastegated.</b> This paper presents a model for the transient response of the electrically-assisted turbocharged engine when subjected to a step increase of torque demand. The base model is representative of a 7 -litre turbocharged intercooled diesel engine and has been implemented in Matlab-Simulink and calibrated against test bed data. The model is used for the analysis of the dynamic behaviour of the engine with different levels of electric assist to the turbocharger. The results show that while turbocharger response improves with electric assist, compressor surge can occur in generating mode and that limitations on electric assist power are present.
