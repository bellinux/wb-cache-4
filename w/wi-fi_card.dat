40|$|Abstract––Wi-Fi is {{a fantastic}} new gadget, but its reach is only about 50 to 100 meters. Fortunately it is {{possible}} to build our own antenna cheaply (less than 10 US dollars) in an hour or two. Now a day, more individuals, businesses and local governments are enjoying wireless internet access proliferating Wi-Fi hotspots, home, office, and public wireless networks. However, Wi-Fi users are rarely completely satisfied with the signal strength offered by the off the shelf <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>cards,</b> routers, access points and USB adapters. Compounding to the coverage problems, many locate their routers, access points or desktop <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>cards</b> in a closet, against the wall or under a desk, diminishing signal strength and limiting bandwidth. This research paper includes the steps for the Biquad antenna construction, requirements and software testing of antenna on desktop to check the signal strength at various locations in campus area...|$|R

40|$|Most laptops {{and many}} desktop PCs include a {{provision}} for wireless connectivity (commonly called “Wi-Fi”). However, computers rarely have a provision {{for more than}} one WiFi connection at a time, because its own card must serve each connection. Some laptops allow for two WiFi cards, but even that may be problematic because of the physical size and shape of the cards, and because of their need for power. We propose a software-based approach, called vWLAN TM. This software solution virtualizes multiple <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>cards</b> within the same computer. That is, it creates two or more software WiFi cards in computer memory so that multiple Wi-Fi connections can take place essentially at the same time. This means that the same computer simultaneously can be connected to multiple access points, to different WiFi networks, to multiple nodes in an ad hoc network, or to multiple Wi-Fi channels on the same network. The expanded functionality opens up new applications that previously have been unaddressable by computers equipped with only a single <b>Wi-Fi</b> connection. <b>cards</b> solve a number of important problems with existing wireless network. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II, presents some application that motivated us towards building vWLAN.

MaTrack does not require any offline training compared to existing signature-based systems and is insensitive to changes in environment.

50|$|The TasWireless {{site was}} first started in 1999. It {{started as a}} spliter group from TasLUG, the Tasmanian Linux Users Group. There was {{only a small number}} of people who were {{interested}} in wireless networking at this time, less than five each in Hobart and Launceston. A node database (http://www.nodedb.com) for Tasmanian regions was started, the mailing list was put on line, but due to the lack of practical experience and knowledge, very little happened. The cost of <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>cards</b> and wireless access points was also a problem.In early 2002, a flood of cheap SkyNet Global 802.11b PC card cards flooded the market.

40|$|We unveil the {{existence}} of a vulnerability in Wi-Fi, which allows an adversary to remotely launch a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack that propagates both in time and space. This vulnerability stems from a coupling effect induced by hidden nodes. Cascading DoS attacks can congest an entire network and do not require the adversary to violate any protocol. We demonstrate the feasibility of such attacks through experiments with real <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>cards,</b> extensive ns- 3 simulations, and theoretical analysis. The simulations show that the attack is effective both in networks operating under fixed and varying bit rates, as well as ad hoc and infrastructure modes. To gain insight into the root-causes of the attack, we model the network as a dynamical system and analyze its limiting behavior. The model predicts that a phase transition (and hence a cascading attack) is possible when the retry limit parameter of Wi-Fi is greater or equal to 7, and explicitly characterizes the phase transition region in terms of the system parameters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – RF-powered {{computers}} are small devices that com-pute and communicate using only {{the power that}} they harvest from RF signals. While existing technologies have harvested power from ambient RF sources (e. g., TV broadcasts), they require a dedicated gateway (like an RFID reader) for Internet connectivity. We present Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system that bridges RF-powered devices with the Internet. Specifically, we show {{that it is possible}} to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to provide Internet connectivity to RF-powered devices. To show Wi-Fi Backscatter’s feasibility, we build a hardware prototype and demonstrate the first communication link between an RF-powered device and commodity Wi-Fi devices. We use off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices including Intel <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>cards,</b> Linksys Routers, and our or-ganization’s Wi-Fi infrastructure, and achieve communication rates of up to 1 kbps and ranges of up to 2. 1 meters. We believe that this new capability can pave the way for the rapid deployment and adoption of RF-powered devices and achieve ubiquitous connectiv-ity via nearby mobile devices that are Wi-Fi enabled...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Mesh {{networks}} {{have emerged as}} a strong alternative for providing last mile broadband network access. To further improve their performance, in light of increasing consumer bandwidth demands, much effort is being put into better using the available bandwidth resources. Cognitive dynamic spectrum access is one such technique that allows opportunistic use of underused spectrum, thereby increasing spectrum utilization. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a new medium access control (MAC) protocol called Dynamic Spectrum Cognitive MAC (DySCO-MAC). It enables cognitive dynamic spectrum access for a single radio, asynchronous wireless mesh/ad hoc network. This protocol {{is based on a}} unique approach of node cooperation that takes advantage of the broadcast nature of the wireless channel. We have implemented DySCO-MAC using an open source Linux Wi-Fi device driver and evaluated its performance on a real-world testbed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that implements dynamic spectrum use at the MAC level using COTS <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>cards.</b> The experimental measurements confirm that cognitive dynamic spectrum access is a promising realistic technology for boosting the performance of next generation wireless networks.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen major {{innovations}} in cross-layer wireless designs. Despite demonstrating significant throughput gains, hardly any of these technologies have made it into real networks. Deploy-ing cross-layer innovations requires adoption from Wi-Fi chip man-ufacturers. Yet, manufacturers hesitate to undertake major invest-ments without {{a better understanding of}} how these designs interact with real networks and applications. This paper presents the first step towards breaking this stalemate, by enabling the adoption of cross-layer designs in today’s networks with commodity <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>cards</b> and actual applications. We present OpenRF, a cross-layer architecture for managing MIMO signal pro-cessing. OpenRF enables access points on the same channel to cancel their interference at each other’s clients, while beamform-ing their signal to their own clients. OpenRF is self-configuring, so that network administrators need not understand MIMO or physical layer techniques. We patch the iwlwifi driver to support OpenRF on off-the-shelf Intel cards. We deploy OpenRF on a 20 -node network, showing how it manages the complex interaction of cross-layer design with a real network stack, TCP, bursty traffic, and real applications. Our results demonstrate an average gain of 1. 6 × for TCP traffic and a significant reduction in response time for real-time applications, like remote desktop...|$|R
