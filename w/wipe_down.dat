25|$|A saddle {{should be}} cleaned {{regularly}} if it used for work. It is usually easiest to clean a saddle when {{placed on a}} moveable saddle rack. Ideally, a rider should quickly <b>wipe</b> <b>down</b> the saddle after every ride with a slightly damp, but not wet, sponge or cloth, in order to remove any dirt and sweat. Once a week, or after every 5–7 rides, a more thorough cleaning should be performed.|$|E
25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A <b>wipe</b> <b>down</b> with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E

50|$|In many countries, {{restaurants}} {{are subject to}} inspections by health inspectors to maintain standards for public health, such as maintaining proper hygiene and cleanliness. As part of these inspections, cooking and handling practices of ground beef {{are taken into account}} to protect against the spread of E coli poisoning. The most common kind of violations of inspection reports are those concerning the storage of cold food at appropriate temperatures, proper sanitation of equipment, regular hand washing and proper disposal of harmful chemicals. Simple steps can be taken to improve sanitation in restaurants.

5000|$|... ==== Fur ==== Fur may be gently cleaned with a soft-bristled {{brush or}} comb, {{which will help}} loosen {{particulates}} that have built up. A vacuum with a soft brush attachment will also work to remove dust and dirt. For particularly dirty furs, conservators may opt to wash the specimen’s fur with water and a mild detergent or soap. If a mount has been exposed to fire and is covered with fine soot, a smoke sponge {{may be used to}} <b>wipe</b> <b>down</b> the fur. Some taxidermists promote cleaning of fur with furniture polish, however, this method will cause wax to build up and eventually dull the color of the fur.|$|E

50|$|Preventive {{conservation}} involves {{actions taken}} to delay deterioration of cultural heritage. For outdoor artworks, this usually involves {{the application of}} a protective coating and regular maintenance. The particular protective coating is chosen based on its durability, adhesion to the surface, ease of maintenance, and surface appearance on the work. The coating provides some protection from environmental factors, but must be occasionally be reduced and reapplied for best results. A long-term conservation schedule should be created and implemented to ensure the longevity of the artwork. A maintenance walk-through schedule should also be established to routinely check the condition of the objects. This may be a weekly procedure; it is useful as conservators can assess and document any damage caused by visitors or environmental conditions, and may rinse and <b>wipe</b> <b>down</b> sculptures.|$|E

50|$|The oozing fluids {{released}} by scratching blisters do not spread the poison. The fluid in the blisters {{is produced by}} the body {{and it is not}} urushiol itself. The appearance of a spreading rash indicates that some areas received more of the poison and reacted sooner than other areas or that contamination is still occurring from contact with objects to which the original poison was spread. Those affected can unknowingly spread the urushiol inside the house, on phones, door knobs, couches, counters, desks, and so on, thus in fact repeatedly coming into contact with poison ivy and extending the length of time of the rash. If this has happened, <b>wipe</b> <b>down</b> the surfaces with bleach or a commercial urushiol removal agent. The blisters and oozing result from blood vessels that develop gaps and leak fluid through the skin; if the skin is cooled, the vessels constrict and leak less. If poison ivy is burned and the smoke then inhaled, this rash will appear on the lining of the lungs, causing extreme pain and possibly fatal respiratory difficulty. If poison ivy is eaten, the mucus lining of the mouth and digestive tract can be damaged. A poison ivy rash usually develops within a week of exposure and can last anywhere from one to four weeks, depending on severity and treatment. In rare cases, poison ivy reactions may require hospitalization.|$|E
