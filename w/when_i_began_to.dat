5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, Pullin was {{included}} in the Births and deaths section of Wisden, a rarity for non-players, due to his standing as a reporter. Wisden described him {{as one of the greatest}} authorities on cricket. Pullin retired in 1931. Although his reputation was later obscured by writers such as Neville Cardus, Allison believes that [...] "Pullin's greatest achievement was to define the role of the journalist in sport as the critic, popularizer, and interpreter of a particular team to its public." [...] Cardus himself wrote that Pullin [...] "was one of the first writers who gave me help and counsel <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> write on cricket. He belonged to the dignified old school of cricket journalism and had much in common with Sydney Pardon, though he was always the hard-headed Yorkshireman. He kept his mind on the game, had no use for frills, and despised modern stunting." ...|$|E

Somehow, I always get back <b>to</b> that fact <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> conjecture. The two nurses hated each other—everybody admits that. Mildred hated mildly; Inez venomously.” ...|$|R

2500|$|... "In {{spite of}} everything, {{it was a}} very fertile period for me. During the first weeks, I had a dream almost every night, some of which {{anticipated}} my future work. In my cell I was surrounded by a profound silence. I could work on myself and that is <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> write a novel. My neighbors simply waited for each day to pass. That time of captivity was precious to me because I could exercise zazen meditation and remain in immobility for hours." ...|$|E
2500|$|After much thought, I {{decided to}} take this way out. It took more thought than anyone can think possible. It started about a week ago, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{think of a way}} to get out of this. Running away would not do any good, the police would find me where ever I went and would bring me back to it all. No, Mother and Daddy are not to blame, it is just me. If I had done what they told to do this would have never happened. Studying instead of playing around, going out with the people in my age group instead of staying home and dreaming...." ...|$|E

'Upon {{our past}} {{meetings}} at Ellangowan; and, truly, I think very often we discourse concerning Miss Lucy, for Mr. Charles Hazlewood {{in that particular}} resembleth me, Mr. Mac-Morlan. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> speak of her <b>I</b> never know <b>when</b> to stop; and, as I say (jocularly), she cheats us out of half our lessons.' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "So the {{question}} is: 'How to win?' That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> develop what you now see full-fledged in the 'wedge' strategy: 'Stick {{with the most}} important thing' —the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because {{you do not want}} to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument in such a way that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, 'Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?' and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Times David Chater commented {{positively}} on {{the episode}} [...] "Elliot's Wonderful Life", writing that: [...] "Holby City fans will love this episode [...] It is highly effective {{in what it}} sets out to do, although – like so much television at Christmas – you need to drink a pint of warm Baileys for the full effect." [...] The episode was selected as recommended viewing by several TV critics, including Dydd Iau of the Liverpool Daily Post, and Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury, who noted: [...] "It sounds a bit strange, but there's snow, carols and an uplifting happy ending for a change." [...] The Mirror Maeve Quigley called it [...] "a timeless story", though questioned the plausibility of {{a world in which}} Elliot's patients went untreated, as [...] "the NHS isn't a one- man band after all". In contrast, Robert Hanks of The Independent reviewed the episode negatively, calling it [...] "incompetent to the point of sacrilege". Hanks wrote: [...] "What it did add to the mix, that James Stewart never achieved, was to give the viewer an authentic frisson of empathy: there was a point towards the end - during an encounter with Elliot's miraculously resurrected, motor-neurone-disease-afflicted yet remarkably soignée and articulate wife - <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> see never having been born as preferable, sometimes, to prime-time TV." ...|$|E

[...] "I shall {{be back at}} the Spittal without any one's knowing of my absence, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> tell him of you, he will tremble, lest it means my refusal to marry him; when he knows it does not, he will wonder only why I told him anything." ...|$|R

60|$|So we {{conceive}} the stars. We {{are told}} that they are other worlds.

60|$|September 4th.--I made {{a voyage}} in the Pond-Lily {{all by myself}} {{yesterday}} morning, and was much encouraged by my success in causing the boat to go whither I would.
