The Word Network eventually returned to WADL on September 18 of that year, replacing Antenna TV on 38.4. WADL will add Cozi TV to 38.4 on February 1, 2016, displaced from WMYD 20.2 by Antenna TV. It is unknown <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Word Network's current affiliation on 38.4, but on May 4, 2017, returned The Word Network on a newly-created fifth subchannel, and added Justice Network to the new 38.6 subchannel. WADL also added the simulcast of WFDF-AM (audio only) to the new 38.7 subchannel, on May 26, 2017.|$|E

These acts (of intentional animal cruelty or non-accidental injury) may be indicators of serious psychological problems. According to the American Humane Association, 13% of intentional animal abuse cases involve domestic violence. As many as 71% of pet-owning women seeking shelter at safe houses have reported that their partner had threatened and/or actually hurt or killed {{one or more of}} their pets; 32% of these women reported that one or more of their children had also hurt or killed pets. Battered women report that they are prevented from leaving their abusers because they fear <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> animals in their absence. Animal abuse is sometimes used as a form of intimidation in domestic disputes.|$|E

500|$|In 1982 Sheldon Jaffery and Roy Torgeson {{met with}} Weinberg to propose taking over as licensees, but Weinberg {{decided not to}} pursue the offer. [...] The {{following}} year, Brian Forbes approached Weinberg with another offer. Forbes' company, the Bellerophon Network, was an imprint of a Los Angeles company named The Wizard. [...] Ashley reports that Weinberg was only able to contact Forbes by phone, and even that was not always reliable, so negotiations were slow. [...] Forbes' editorial director was Gordon Garb and the fiction editor was Gil Lamont; Forrest Ackerman also assisted, mainly by obtaining material to include. [...] There {{was a good deal}} of confusion between the various participants in the project: according to Locus, a science fiction trade journal, [...] "Ackerman says he has had no contact with publisher Forbes, does not know <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> material he put together, and is as much in the dark as everybody else. [...] Lamont says that he is still renegotiating his contract and is not sure where he stands". The original plan was for the first issue to appear in August 1984, dated July/August, but before it appeared the decision was taken to change the contents, and a new, completely reset issue finally appeared {{at the end of the}} year, dated Fall 1984. [...] Even with this delay a final agreement had not yet been reached with Weinberg over licensing. [...] Only 12,500 copies were printed; these were sent to two distributors who both went into bankruptcy. [...] As a result, few copies were sold, and Forbes was not paid by the distributors. [...] Despite the financial setback, Forbes attempted to continue, and a second issue eventually appeared. [...] Its cover date was Winter 1985 but it was not published until June 1986. [...] Few copies were printed; reports vary between 1,500 and 2,300 in total. [...] Mark Monsolo was the fiction editor, but Garb continued as editorial director; Lamont was no longer involved with the magazine.|$|E

2500|$|Kublai {{renamed the}} Mongol regime in China Dai Yuan in 1271, {{and sought to}} sinicize his image as Emperor of China {{in order to win}} control of {{millions}} of Chinese people. When he moved his headquarters to Khanbaliq, also called Dadu, at modern-day Beijing, there was an uprising in the old capital Karakorum that he barely contained. Kublai's actions were condemned by traditionalists and his critics still accused him of being too closely tied to Chinese culture. They sent a message to him: [...] "The old customs of our Empire are not those of the Chinese laws... <b>What</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old customs?" [...] Kaidu attracted the other elites of Mongol Khanates, declaring himself to be a legitimate heir to the throne instead of Kublai, who had turned away from the ways of Genghis Khan.

In Berlin, we were told: why all this trouble; we cannot use them in the Ostland or the Reichskommissariat either; liquidate them yourselves!" [...] Two days later, Himmler recorded the outcome of his discussion with Hitler. The result was: [...] "als Partisanen auszurotten" [...] ("exterminate them as partisans"). Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer wrote that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from Hitler for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust.

[...] However, Gu Li brandished his sword at the crew and threatened, [...] "I'll execute any person who does not go to Fankou." [...] Upon reaching the port at Fankou, the storm had not subsided yet so they remained there. Sun Quan then asked Gu Li, [...] "Were you afraid of the river?" [...] Gu Li knelt down and said, [...] "Your Majesty is the master of thousands. You should not venture into treacherous waters and brave the storm. The ship may be large and steady, but if you encounter danger, <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state? That was why I strongly objected (to sailing towards Luozhou)."

2500|$|Jordanian, Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iraqi and Saudi troops invaded Palestine {{subsequent}} to the British withdrawal and the declaration of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948. The Arab invasion was denounced by the United States, the Soviet Union, and UN secretary-general Trygve Lie, although it found support from Taiwan and other UN member states. The Arab states proclaimed their aim of a [...] "United State of Palestine" [...] in place of Israel and an Arab state. The Arab Higher Committee said, {{that in the future}} Palestine, the Jews will be no more than 1/7 of the population. i.e. only Jews that lived in Palestine before the British mandate. They did not specify <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other Jews. They considered the UN Plan to be invalid because it was opposed by Palestine's Arab majority, and claimed that the British withdrawal led to an absence of legal authority, making it necessary for them to protect Arab lives and property. About two thirds of Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from the territories which came under Jewish control; the rest became Arab citizens of Israel. All of the much smaller number of Jews in the territories captured by the Arabs, for example the Old City of Jerusalem, also fled or were expelled. The official United Nations estimate was that 711,000 Arabs became refugees during the fighting.|$|E

2500|$|The missionary {{position}} is sometimes mocked as a plain vanilla sex position. Archer stated, [...] "To all the sex gymnasts, {{this kind of}} banal preference looks lazy, unimaginative and uninformed," [...] but she rebuts this by pointing out the existence of variations: [...] "Missionary {{is kind of like}} tofu: You have to add your own flavor." [...] Perhaps due to the ubiquity of this position, its typical role as the first position used by couples, its tendency to put the man in control of speed, tempo and depth, its ability to cause him to quickly reach orgasm, {{and the fact that it}} is literally a [...] "male-superior" [...] position with the man on top, missionary is sometimes associated with men who are dominating and uncreative and selfish about sex. According to Gina Ogden, [...] "the cultural missionary position—man on top" [...] is not conducive to romance since [...] "If a relationship is based on authoritarian control, keeping one person on top and the other underneath, it gets old pretty fast—for both partners, really". In Women Who Love Sex, Ogden writes, [...] "Think <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> missionary position when women, en masse, opt for pleasures that stir body and soul instead of continuing to do good-girl intercourse by the book." [...] In Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, the main character ridicules the idea of women making decisions by saying that one might as well say that the woman lies on top of the man when they are making the baby.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nuclear power}} debate is a long-running {{controversy}} {{about the risks}} and benefits of using nuclear reactors to generate electricity for civilian purposes. [...] The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, as more and more reactors were built and came online, and [...] "reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies" [...] in some countries. [...] Thereafter, the nuclear industry created jobs, focused on safety and public concerns [...] mostly waned. In the last decade, however, with growing public awareness about climate change and the critical role that carbon dioxide and methane emissions plays in causing the heating of the earth's atmosphere, there's been a resurgence in the intensity nuclear power debate once again. [...] Nuclear power advocates and those who are most concerned about climate change point to nuclear power's reliable, emission-free, high-density energy and a generation of young physicists and engineers working to bring a new generation of nuclear technology into existence to replace fossil fuels. On the other hand, skeptics can point to two frightening nuclear accidents, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and subsequently the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, combined with escalating acts of global terrorism, to argue against continuing use of the technology. The debate continues today between those who fear the power of nuclear and those who fear <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earth if we don't use nuclear power. At the 1963 ground-breaking for what would become the world's largest nuclear power plant, President John F. Kennedy declared that nuclear power was a [...] "step on the long road to peace," [...] and that by using [...] "science and technology to achieve significant breakthroughs" [...] that we could [...] "conserve the resources" [...] to leave the world in better shape. Yet he also acknowledged that the Atomic Age was a [...] "dreadful age" [...] and [...] "when we broke the atom apart, we changed the history of the world." ...|$|E
