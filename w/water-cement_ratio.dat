40|$|One of the {{problems}} that reduce durability; thus, performance of concrete is the development of plastic shrinkage cracking (PSC). Traditionally, the development of PSC has been minimized by controlling its exposure to weather conditions or by adding fibers. In this study, concrete re-vibration was used as an alternative technique to control PSC because of the limited availability of fibers in the developing countries. In this study, the wait time after slab casting and before vibration was selected to be 90 minutes while length of re-vibration time was varied from 15 to 45 seconds. Also, the <b>water-cement</b> <b>ratios</b> were selected to be 0. 5, 0. 55 and 0. 6. The slabs were cast based on the form dimensions proposed by ASTM C 1579 criteria. Image analysis of cracks was performed to process digital images of the cracks 2 ̆ 7 widths and lengths to estimate crack growth. Cracks widths and lengths were unevenly reduced based on the <b>water-cement</b> <b>ratios</b> and the lengths of re-vibration. Re-vibrated and fibered slabs showed similar reduction in cracks dimension. This technique and the fact that re-vibrating is cheaper than adding fibers makes the proposed approach a very suitable alternative for controlling plastic shrinkage cracks, especially in arid regions of the world. ...|$|R

Hajime Okamura envisioned the need for concrete which is highly workable and does not rely on the mechanical force for compaction. During the 1980s, Okamura and his Ph.D. student Kazamasa Ozawa at the University of Tokyo developed self-compacting concrete (SCC) which was cohesive, but flowable and took the shape of the formwork without use of any mechanical compaction.

50|$|SCC can be {{used for}} casting heavily {{reinforced}} sections, places where there can be no access to vibrators for compaction and in complex shapes of formwork which may otherwise be impossible to cast, giving a far superior surface than conventional concrete. The relatively high cost of material used in such concrete continues to hinder its widespread use in various segments of the construction industry, including commercial construction, however the productivity economics take over in achieving favorable performance benefits and works out to be economical in pre-cast industry. The incorporation of powder, including supplementary cementitious materials and filler, can increase the volume of the paste, hence enhancing deformability, and can also increase the cohesiveness of the paste and stability of the concrete. The reduction in cement content and increase in packing density of materials finer than 80 µm, like fly ash etc. can reduce the <b>water-cement</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the high-range water reducer (HRWR) demand. The reduction in free water can reduce the concentration of viscosity-enhancing admixture (VEA) necessary to ensure proper stability during casting and thereafter until the onset of hardening. It has been demonstrated that a total fine aggregate content ("fines", usually sand) of about 50% of total aggregate is appropriate in an SCC mix.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} strength of concrete {{is influenced by}} the water-cementitious ratio (w/cm), the design constituents, and the mixing, placement and curing methods employed. All things being equal, concrete with a lower water-cement (cementitious) ratio makes a stronger concrete than that with a higher ratio. The total quantity of cementitious materials (portland cement, slag cement, pozzolans) can affect strength, water demand, shrinkage, abrasion resistance and density. All concrete will crack independent of whether or not it has sufficient compressive strength. In fact, high Portland cement content mixtures can actually crack more readily due to increased hydration rate. As concrete transforms from its plastic state, hydrating to a solid, the material undergoes shrinkage. Plastic shrinkage cracks can occur soon after placement but if the evaporation rate is high they often can actually occur during finishing operations, for example in hot weather or a breezy day.In very high-strength concrete mixtures (greater than 70 MPa) the crushing strength of the aggregate can be a limiting factor to the ultimate compressive strength. In lean concretes (with a high <b>water-cement</b> <b>ratio)</b> the crushing strength of the aggregates is not so significant. The internal forces in common shapes of structure, such as arches, vaults, columns and walls are predominantly compressive forces, with floors and pavements subjected to tensile forces. Compressive strength is widely used for specification requirement and quality control of concrete. Engineers know their target tensile (flexural) requirements and will express these in terms of compressive strength.|$|E
