5|$|The player's primary mode of {{transportation}} is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, customize the player's armor, travel to numerous planetary systems, and scan planets for mineral resources. These resources allow the player to research numerous in-game upgrades that {{are found in the}} missions, providing benefits such as increasing weapon damage, fortifying the player's health, or extending the ship's fuel capacity, among others. Scanning requires the player to move a reticle over a planet and launch a probe when an oscilloscope <b>warns</b> <b>of</b> near resources. Additional upgrades, equipment, and nonessential items such as magazines and decorations for the ship can be purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E
5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It <b>warns</b> <b>of</b> the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
5|$|Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, {{finally coming}} to his senses, thanks the young hero for {{stopping}} him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon {{thought of as}} a fad.

However, he had lost touch with reality and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete.

5|$|On September 8, 1995, Cedar Point {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new roller coaster, which would open as the tallest, fastest, and longest stand-up roller coaster in the world. The ride was to be named Banshee after the mythical wailing ghost in Irish folklore. In the days following the announcement, there was some negative reaction from the public regarding the term Banshee, which in the dictionary is described as a female spirit that <b>warns</b> <b>of</b> an impending family death. On November 14, 1995, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Mantis, which later became the ride's official name. As a result of the name change, its logo was also changed to resemble a mantis. The discarded name would later be reused for Banshee at Kings Island which opened in 2014.|$|E

25|$|Nance {{emphasizes}} the splintered nature of al-Qaeda, {{and points out}} that it is in fact operating as a collective of smaller groups inspired by Osama bin Laden. The author <b>warns</b> <b>of</b> the power of the Internet as used by terrorists for recruitment and communication. He observes that where al-Qaeda had previously functioned as a set of terrorism criminal entities, it shaped its operations to become more like a business. Nance cites key business elements to al-Qaeda and ways it serves as a central organizing hub for splinter groups globally, that include: use of videos and audio recordings of Osama bin Laden, beheading videos, and martyrdom videos, serving as a central repository of information, giving armament materials to followers, motivating each other, and providing economic funding for terrorist operations.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{rigorous}} debate in Indian literature on relative merits of these theoretical spiritual practices. For example, Chandogyopanishad suggests {{that those who}} engage in ritualistic offerings to gods and priests will fail in their spiritual practice, while those who engage in tapas will succeed; Svetasvataropanishad suggests that a successful spiritual practice requires a longing for truth, but <b>warns</b> <b>of</b> becoming 'false ascetic' who go through the mechanics of spiritual practice without meditating {{on the nature of}} Self and universal Truths. In the practice of Hinduism, suggest modern era scholars such as Vivekananda, the choice between the paths is up to the individual and a person's proclivities. Other scholars suggest that these Hindu spiritual practices are not mutually exclusive, but overlapping. These four paths of spirituality are also known in Hinduism outside India, such as in Balinese Hinduism, where it is called Catur Marga (literally: four paths).|$|E
25|$|Six months later, in {{the midst}} of a {{masquerade}} ball, the Phantom makes his first appearance since the chandelier disaster, in costume as the Red Death. He announces that he has written an opera entitled Don Juan Triumphant and demands that it be produced immediately, with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) in the lead role, and he <b>warns</b> <b>of</b> dire consequences if his demands are not met ("Masquerade/Why So Silent?"). Noticing an engagement ring on a chain around Christine's neck, the Phantom angrily pulls it from her and vanishes in a blinding flash of light. As the masquerade attendees scatter in fear, Raoul accosts Madame Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the Phantom. Giry reluctantly explains that the Phantom is actually a brilliant scholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer who was born with a terrifyingly deformed face. Feared and reviled by society, he was cruelly exhibited in a cage as part of a travelling fair until he eventually escaped and disappeared. He has since taken refuge beneath the opera house, which has now become his home.|$|E
