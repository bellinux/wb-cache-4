50|$|The alongshore {{shape of}} spur and groove {{formations}} varies from smoothly varying rounded spurs, to flat spurs with shallow rectangular grooves, or deeply cut rectangular or overhanging channels sometimes called buttresses. Spur and groove formations have typical scales of: spur height 0.5 to 10 m, alongshore wavelength 5 to 150 m, <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>groove</b> 1 to 100 m, and found in depths from 0 to 30 m. The mechanism for maintaining preferential coral growth {{on the spur}} {{is thought to be}} caused by higher wave stress on the spur which causes sediment to be shed towards the groove and downslope and preferential coral growth on the spur. Thus, it is believed that spur and grooves are essentially constructional in formation, while a less important mechanism may occur from sediment scour in the grooves.|$|E

The micorspheres are driven toward the patherned grooves of different widths and form two or three-dimensional close-packed structures.

If w D and, a coplanar structure exists in the groove but when D>H, the double-layered zigzag structure appears again to replace the coplanar structure. When the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>groove</b> continues to increase, the coplanar structure is also favorable because more space allows for microspheres to modulate their arrangement. 本研究利用液體蒸發對流法將單一尺寸微米級聚苯乙烯球以自組裝方式，沈積排列於具有矩形溝槽微圖案的矽晶片上，所設計的不同寬度圖案溝槽提供的微球粒子填入填疊，成為二維或三維緊密堆積結構產生於其中。影響排列的製程參數包括溫度、粒徑(D) 與圖案溝槽的寬度(W) 、深度(H) 。本實驗發現 45 °C為最佳沈積溫度，當粒徑與圖案寬度比值是D/W= 0. 7415 時，粒子以上下交互堆疊結構呈現，不會形成共平面緊密堆積排列，此是因為圖案寬度不符合W≧ 2 +√ 3 / 2 D造成。當W≧ 2 +√ 3 / 2 D，且粒徑小於溝槽深度 1 / 3 H H，則仍會以上下交互堆疊的非共面結構呈現，此時再增加所使用圖案之寬度，即能讓粒子有足夠空間調整排列形成共面結構...|$|E

Mixing also important in Lab-On-Chip (LOC) system because the chemical reaction carried out in this system requires on-chip mixing. Mixing performance in this system relies mainly on effective and rapid mixing of sample and reagent. Therefore, development of groove micromixer for application of blood and reagent mixing carried out in this project. In this study, two fluids involve in the mixing, which is the blood and reagent (two type of reagent with lower and higher viscosity compared to blood). Two pattern of the groove namely oblique groove and herringbone groove were designed and simulated using CoventorWare 2010 software at low Reynolds number. The design of groove micromixer obtained by analyzing the geometries effect of groove pattern on mixing performance of blood and reagent with the visualization of simulation and evaluation of mixing performance for difference geometry parameter of groove micromixer.

Two mixer namely Y-Shape mixer and Y-Shape oblique groove mixer are designed and simulated using CoventorWare 2010 software at low Reynolds number. The development <b>of</b> oblique <b>groove</b> micromixer are obtained by analyzing the geometries effect <b>of</b> <b>groove</b> pattern on mixing performance. In this study, it has been demonstrated that the YShape mixer with the oblique groove structure located at {{the floor of the}} mixing channel can increase the mixing performance. Thus, the simulation result in this study shows that mixing performance can be enhanced when depth and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> oblique <b>groove</b> having 40 % <b>of</b> the channel <b>width</b> with the angle <b>of</b> oblique <b>groove</b> is 45 º...|$|R
40|$|Grooves were {{etched in}} a {{conductive}} layer of a conductive, transparent glass, and a nanoporous TiO 2 film was deposited {{on both the}} conductive and nonconductive area. The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grooves</b> was 100 μm and 150 μm. A transparent TiO 2 film was dye-sensitized, covered with an electrolyte, and sandwiched with a cover glass. The conductivity of the dye-sensitized TiO 2 film permeated with electrolyte was studied {{in the dark and}} under illumination, and was observed to be dependent on light intensity, wavelength and applied voltage. This study shows that dye-sensitized nanoporous films {{can be used as a}} wavelength dependent photoconductor. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{determine}} the response and impact energy absorbing capability of the square hollow section (SHS) column with U-shape grooves, subjected to dynamic mid span loading. Geometrical parametric study i. e. <b>width</b> and depth <b>of</b> the <b>grooves</b> and spacing between grooves was carried out using non-linear explicit finite element package ABAQUS. Comparison between plain SHS column with grooved SHS column in terms of initial peak force (IPF), specific energy absorption (SEA) and crush force efficiency (CFE) was carried out. It {{was found that the}} depth and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>groove</b> and spacing between grooves have significant effect on the impact response of SHS column. The grooved column has a higher SEA, shorter crushing distance but slightly lower CFE as compared to the plain column. This would make the grooved column a better option when designing for side intrusion protection. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this study, a three {{dimensional}} numerical {{heat transfer}} {{model has been}} used to simulate the laser structuring of polymer substrate material in the Three-Dimensional Molded Interconnect Device (3 D MID) which is used in the advanced multi-functional applications. A finite element method (FEM) transient thermal analysis is performed using APDL (ANSYS Parametric Design Language) provided by ANSYS. In this model, the effect of surface heat source was modeled with Gaussian distribution, also the effect of the mixed boundary conditions which consist of convection and radiation heat transfers have been considered in this analysis. The model provides a full description of the temperature distribution, as well as calculates the depth and the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>groove</b> upon material removal at different set of laser parameters such as laser power and laser speed. This study also includes the experimental procedure to study the effect of laser parameters on the depth and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the removal <b>groove</b> metal as verification to the modeled results. Good agreement between the experimental and the model results is achieved {{for a wide range of}} laser powers. It is found that the quality of the laser structure process is affected by the laser scan speed and laser power. For a high laser structured quality, it is suggested to use laser with high speed and moderate to high laser power...|$|R
40|$|ATP-sensitive {{potassium}} (K(ATP)) channels comprise Kir 6. 2 and SUR subunits. The site {{at which}} ATP binds to mediate K(ATP) channel inhibition lies on Kir 6. 2, but {{the potency of}} block is enhanced by coexpression with SUR 1. To assess {{the structure of the}} ATP-binding site on Kir 6. 2, we used a range of adenine nucleotides as molecular measuring sticks to map the internal dimensions of the binding site. We compared their efficacy on Kir 6. 2 -SUR 1, and on a truncated Kir 6. 2 (Kir 6. 2 DeltaC) that expresses in the absence of SUR. We show here that SUR 1 modifies the ATP-binding pocket of Kir 6. 2, by increasing the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>groove</b> that binds the phosphate tail of ATP, without changing the length <b>of</b> the <b>groove,</b> and by enhancing interaction with the adenine ring...|$|R
40|$|AbstractV-shaped grooves were {{prepared}} by patterning of line and space (LS) using photolithography and Reactive Ion Etching (RIE), and anisotropic etching using hot KOH solution on the patterned 100  nm- SiO 2 /Si(001) substrate. The V-shaped <b>grooves</b> consist <b>of</b> two 〈 111 〉 planes. The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> was varied from 1 to 10  μm while keeping intervals (line-shaped spaces) between the grooves. The InSb bi-layer was prepared onto the 〈 111 〉 surfaces and the heteroepitaxial growth of InSb films was performed using two-step growth procedure via the InSb bi-layer. Compared with the samples directly grown on the V-grooved Si(001) substrate, the samples grown via the InSb bi-layer showed higher crystal quality. The weak InSb(004) peak {{was observed in}} the 2 θ/ω scan at χ= 0 o, indicating the 〈 001 〉 planes of the InSb films don’t face toward to the normal direction of Si(001) substrate. This means that the InSb films grown via InSb bi-layer rotate by 30 ∘ {{with respect to the}} 〈 111 〉 surfaces <b>of</b> the V-shaped <b>grooves.</b> The confirmation <b>of</b> the rotated InSb(111) peak was difficult, because the incident and diffracted X-ray were obstructed by the grooves. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the InSb(111) peak in the 2 θ/ω scan at χ= 54. 7 ∘ became broader with decrease in the space width between the line-shaped 〈 001 〉 surfaces. This {{may be related to the}} areal ratio of the line-shaped 〈 001 〉 surfaces, on which the InSb bi-layer don’t form under the present growth condition...|$|R
