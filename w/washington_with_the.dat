5|$|During {{the course}} of the war, Fort Bayard came under attack only once. During the Battle of Fort Stevens in July 1864, Confederate general Jubal Early {{launched}} a 25,000-man raid into Maryland with the hope of drawing off some of General Ulysses S. Grant's troops, who were pressing hard against the Army of Northern Virginia in the Siege of Petersburg. The raid hoped to attack Washington, thereby distracting Grant and potentially allowing the Confederate forces time to rest and regroup. On the morning of July 11, Confederate cavalry and infantry under the command of Brigadier General John McCausland advanced towards <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> goal of capturing Fort Reno, which defended the village of Tenleytown. Though they drove back the skirmish line in front of Fort Bayard, the Confederate cavalry were met with a heavy barrage of cannon fire from Bayard and its supporting forts. Discouraged by the resistance, McCausland's brigade moved to join up with the rest of Early's force, which was grouping for an assault on Fort Stevens.|$|E
5|$|Of all the draft-eligible juniors, only Rolando McClain and Kareem Jackson {{declared}} their {{eligibility for}} the 2010 NFL Draft. Ten Alabama players, eight seniors and two juniors, {{were invited to}} the NFL Scouting Combine. The invited Alabama players were tight end Colin Peek, offensive lineman Mike Johnson, defensive linemen Terrence Cody, Brandon Deaderick and Lorenzo Washington, linebacker Rolando McClain, defensive backs Javier Arenas, Kareem Jackson and Justin Woodall, and placekicker Leigh Tiffin.

25|$|East of the Cascades, a large region {{experiences}} strong rain shadow effects. Semi-arid conditions {{occur in}} much of eastern <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central Columbia Plateau—especially the region {{just east of the}} Columbia River from about the Snake River to the Okanagan Highland. Thus instead of rain forests much of eastern Washington is covered with grassland and shrub-steppe.|$|E
25|$|Hospital Maciel {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{hospitals}} in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaraní and <b>Washington,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of José Toribio (son of Tomás Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaraní street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaraní and 25 de Mayo) and Julián Masquelez (1889). The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Estévez in 1798.|$|E

25|$|In Washington State, {{the first}} plantings of Cabernet Franc were {{cultivated}} in experimental blocks by Washington State University in the Columbia Valley during the 1970s. In 1985, Cabernet Franc was {{planted in the}} Red Willow Vineyard for use in Bordeaux style blends. The first varietal Cabernet Franc in Washington was released in 1991 by Columbia Winery followed by Chateau Ste Michelle in 1992 with grapes planted from their Cold Creek Vineyard. In the 1990s, Chinook Winery introduced the state's first Cabernet Franc rosé. Today it is the fourth most widely planted grape in the state behind Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah. Washington Cabernet Franc is distinctive for its fruit forward style with blueberry and raspberry fruit. The characteristic vegetal notes are toned down in <b>Washington,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wines tending to show more notes of ground coffee and olives.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, 1861, McDowell {{departed}} <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> largest field army yet {{gathered on}} the North American continent, about 35,000 men (28,452 effectives). McDowell's plan was to move westward in three columns and make a diversionary attack on the Confederate line at Bull Run with two columns, while the third column moved around the Confederates' right flank to the south, cutting the railroad to Richmond and threatening {{the rear of the}} Confederate army. He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the Rappahannock River, the next defensible line in Virginia, which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital. McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July, but the troops, unaccustomed to marching, moved in starts and stops. Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to wander off to pick apples or blackberries or to get water, regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks.|$|E
25|$|Indian Head Highway was {{constructed}} by the U.S. federal government as a military access highway in the mid-1940s to connect <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Indian Head Naval Proving Ground and Fort Washington. The previous highway between Washington and Indian Head was Livingston Road, which was traced in the late 18th century and improved in the 1920s and early 1930s as MD 224. The new highway incorporated several sections of meandering MD 224 into its straight path. Indian Head Highway was fully designated MD 210 in the mid-1950s when the road was transferred from federal to state control. MD 210 was expanded to a divided highway in Forest Heights in the late 1940s and south through Fort Washington in the 1960s. Another section of divided highway was completed through Charles County in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The final divided highway section was completed through Accokeek in the mid-1980s. MD 210 was connected with I-295 in 1989 and its interchange with I-95 and I-495 was reconstructed in the mid-2000s. The Maryland State Highway Administration has long-term plans to replace the highway's major intersections with interchanges from Oxon Hill south through Fort Washington.|$|E

The largest tributary of the Columbia River, the Snake River watershed makes up about 41% of the entire Columbia River Basin.

500|$|Stimson, who {{had just}} {{finished}} a series of arguments with the British {{about the need for}} an invasion of France, was reluctant to appear to disagree with them about everything, and spoke in conciliatory terms about the need for good post-war relations between the two countries. For his part, Churchill disavowed interest in the commercial applications of nuclear technology. The reason for British concern about the post-war cooperation, Cherwell explained, was not commercial concerns, but so that Britain would have nuclear weapons after the war. Anderson then drafted an agreement for full interchange, which Churchill re-worded [...] "in more majestic language". News arrived in London of Roosevelt's decision on 27 July, and Anderson was dispatched to <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> draft agreement. Churchill and Roosevelt signed {{what became known as the}} Quebec Agreement at the Quebec Conference on 19 August 1943.|$|E
500|$|Maryland Route 500 (MD 500) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Queens Chapel Road, the highway runs [...] from Michigan Avenue at the District of Columbia {{boundary}} in Avondale north to MD 410 in Hyattsville. MD 500 connects <b>Washington</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Prince George's County cities of Mount Rainier and Hyattsville. The state highway also connects those communities {{with a pair of}} stations on the Green Line of the Washington Metro. Queens Chapel Road was constructed as the original MD 210 from Washington to Hyattsville in the 1910s. MD 500 was built from Hyattsville through University Park to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in the early 1930s. MD 500 assumed the course of MD 210 in the mid-1940s. The highway was relocated in West Hyattsville and expanded to a divided highway toward Washington in the early 1950s. MD 500 was truncated at MD 410 when University Park took over the highway prior to the construction of the Metro Green Line through the town in the late 1980s.|$|E
