5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
25|$|Several real-life {{incidents}} were also mentioned or {{used for the}} movie. For instance, references to Viktor Belenko's defection to Japan in 1976 were mentioned by Arakawa himself <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Goto and Nagumo. Another incident with the nearly fatal dogfight over Tokyo was supposedly based on an accident in a computer simulation that forced the US military to go onto DEFCON 3 and almost went to nuclear war with the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Saret Koheh {{made good}} on the threats of the “Night Letter” posted in Kamdesh {{beginning}} the campaign season of 2007. It also confronted Lieutenant Colonel Kolenda commanding American forces {{in the area in}} Naray, with the fact that COIN operations in Nuristan were facing a crisis. AAF operations in the area were expanding, involving a greater proportion of the local population, and were being supported by Taliban organizations in Pakistan. American forces were strung out in a thinly held and poorly supplied picket line from Naray to Kamdesh along the Landay-Sin River. The American forces were too outnumbered to survive in sustained combat with the local population. Something had to be done to put the Americans and the Afghans of Nuristan on the same side. The first effort in a new COIN campaign was made by First Lieutenant Dave Roller. He decided that the appearance of American soldiers in their “battle rattle” war gear gave the impression of soulless killing machines. Encased in armor, helmets, and weapons, Americans appeared to be looking for a fight. As a contrast Dave attended his next meeting with the Kamdesh village leaders dressed in a T-shirt and shorts. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> them he discussed their common values as leaders of families and communities working toward a better future for their children. Mawlawi Abdul Rahman of Kamdesh was a local elder much impressed with this new approach. He began building a consensus of village elders in support of the Afghan government. Through {{the rest of the summer}} and fall of 2008, Captain Joey Hutto, the new commander of COP Keating, and his troops expanded this initiative. Hutto had worked for years on COIN campaigns in Central America, and put his skills to good use in Nuristan.|$|E

60|$|Ted {{said it was}} all nonsense, {{but it was no}} good, and {{the next}} night he went off alone and came back very cross, saying that Mrs. Jennings 'ad been with 'em all the time, and <b>when</b> <b>'e</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Emma about it she said it was just tit for tat, and {{reminded}} 'im 'ow she had 'ad to put up with Charlie.

60|$|The Inspector stood {{very still}} for a brief space of time, very still and very silent. His face, too, was quite expressionless. Yet his tone, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> seemed <b>to</b> have taken to itself a note of sternness.|$|R
500|$|Nevertheless, Vizzini wielded {{considerable}} power. The Italian journalist Luigi Barzini, {{who claimed}} to know Vizzini well, described his stature and daily life in Villalba in his book The Italians: [...] Vizzini’s generous and protective manner, the deferential greetings of passers-by, the meekness of those approaching him, the smiles of gratefulness <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> them, reminded Barzini of an primeval scene: a prince holding court and handing out justice publicly. However, Barzini also concluded, [...] "f course, the many victims of his reign were not visible, the many corpses found riddled with bullets in the countryside during {{more than half a}} century, the widows weeping, the fatherless orphans." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his inaugural}} talk, Schneerson said [...] "one {{must go to}} a place where nothing is known of godliness, nothing is known of Judaism, nothing is even known of the Hebrew alphabet, and while there to put oneself aside and ensure that the other calls out to God." [...] <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Forward {{journalist}} Asher Penn that year, he said, [...] "we must stop insisting that Judaism is in danger, an assertion that does little but place Jewry on the defensive. We need to go on the offensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maxwell {{was picked}} in the Australian A side to play South Africa, {{replacing}} an injured Jon Holland. Selector John Inverarity said <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Maxwell he [...] "said 'you're the spinner, you're {{in the hot}} seat, get on with it', and we hope he responds to that sort of challenge. Glenn is a player of particular interest, a player of great skill and exuberance and enthusiasm. We want him as an allrounder, so we're very keen {{for him to get}} opportunity with his spin bowling, and we're putting him in the hot seat here." [...] Maxwell scored 64 and took 2-70.|$|E

2500|$|Speck later {{claimed he}} had no {{recollection}} of the murders, but he had confessed the crime to Dr. LeRoy Smith at the Cook County Hospital. Smith did not testify, because the confession was made while Speck was sedated. Illinois Supreme Court Justice John J. Stamos, Cook County's state attorney when Speck was tried, who knew of the hospital confession stated, [...] "...we didn't need it. We had an eyewitness." [...] Speck confessed to the murders {{for the first time}} in public <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene in 1978. In a film inmates made at the Stateville Correctional Center in 1988, Speck recounted the brutal murders.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{appearance}} at Libby's trial, Cooper recounted how he first learned about Valerie Wilson on July 11, 2003, from Rove. Cooper testified that Rove {{told him to}} be wary of Joe Wilson’s criticisms in The New York Times. [...] "Don't go too far out on Wilson," [...] Cooper recalled Rove saying, adding that Wilson's wife worked at [...] "the agency." [...] Rove reportedly ended the call by saying, [...] "I've already said too much." [...] Cooper testified that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Libby, he told Libby that he had heard that Joe Wilson's wife worked at the C.I.A. According to Cooper, Libby responded, [...] "I heard that too." [...] In Libby's grand jury testimony, Libby recalled telling Cooper that he'd heard something to that effect but that he didn't know for sure if it were true. In Libby's trial, Cooper's notes became the subject of intense scrutiny by the defense.|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, Frank Paroubek {{told police}} he had spoken to a man {{he did not know}} who told him he had seen Elsie late in the {{afternoon}} of April 8 on Kedzie Avenue, south of 28th St., long after she {{was supposed to have been}} taken by the [...] "gypsies." [...] Lt. Costello assigned detectives to find the man. The previous reported sighting of Elsie had her walking toward the canal on South Troy St., a half block south of her aunt's house. If the unknown man told the truth, Elsie was only three blocks away from a bridge. Despite the coroner's findings, Lt. Costello had become convinced that Elsie's death was an accident and that she had simply fallen into the canal, although Inspector Healey had had the canals and drainage ditches dragged repeatedly during the search. Coroner Hoffman continued to insist Elsie was murdered. Apparently some confusion had occurred during the initial examinations. The first physician (probably Dr. Kingston) to examine Elsie on the night of May 9 told Lt. Costello that she had drowned, with no marks of abuse, and Costello had repeated this <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the family. However, the following day, the same physician's autopsy findings concluded Elsie had not drowned and that she appeared to have been suffocated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] Amelius answered. [...] "When I {{called on}} her, {{on the morning}} of her death, I had no {{apprehension}} whatever of her committing suicide. I went to the house as the bearer of good news; and I said so to the doctor, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
60|$|Roswell was provoked; but {{his pride}} was touched also. Biting his lip, {{he was silent}} for a moment, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> very much <b>to</b> the point, but generously, and like a man.|$|R
60|$|Aynsley left them, and Clay {{was silent}} for a moment or two. He lay back on the pillows with his eyes closed, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> it seemed <b>to</b> be with an effort.|$|R
2500|$|Jeb Stuart {{enjoyed the}} glory of circumnavigating an enemy army, which he had done on two {{previous}} occasions in 1862, during the Peninsula Campaign {{and at the end}} of the Maryland Campaign. It is possible that he had the same intention <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Robert E. Lee following the Battle of Upperville. He certainly needed to erase the stain on his reputation represented by his surprise and near defeat at the Battle of Brandy Station. The exact nature of Lee's order to Stuart on June 22 has been argued by the participants and historians ever since, but the essence was that he was instructed to guard the mountain passes with part of his force while the Army of Northern Virginia was still south of the Potomac and that he was to cross the river with the remainder of the army and screen the right flank of Ewell's Second Corps. Instead of taking a direct route north near the Blue Ridge Mountains, however, Stuart chose to reach Ewell's flank by taking his three best brigades (those of Wade Hampton, Fitzhugh Lee, and John R. Chambliss, the latter replacing the wounded W.H.F. [...] "Rooney" [...] Lee) between the Union army and Washington, moving north through Rockville to Westminster and on into Pennsylvania, hoping to capture supplies along the way and cause havoc near the enemy capital. Stuart and his three brigades departed Salem Depot at 1 a.m. on June 25.|$|E
2500|$|During World War I, {{at around}} the same time he was {{appointed}} Director of the British Admiralty's laboratories, Weizmann, in a conversation with David Lloyd George, suggested the strategy of the British campaign against the Ottoman Empire. [...] From 1914, [...] "a benevolent goodwill toward the Zionist idea" [...] emerged in Britain when intelligence revealed how the Jewish Question could support imperial interests against the Ottomans. [...] Many of Weizmann's contacts revealed the extent of the uncertainty in Palestine. [...] From 1914-1918, Weizmann developed his political skills mixing easily in powerful circles. [...] On November 7 and 8, 1914, he had a meeting with Madame Dolly Rothschild. [...] Her husband James de Rothschild was serving with the French Army, but she was unable to influence her cousinhood to Weizmann's favour. [...] Although <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Charles, second son of Nathan Mayer Rothschild, he approved the idea. [...] James de Rothschild advised Weizmann seek to influence the British Government. [...] By the time he reached Lord Robert Cecil, Dr Weizmann was enthused with excitement. [...] Cecil's personal foibles were representative of class consciousness, which the Zionists overcome through deeds rather than words. C. P. Scott, the editor of The Manchester Guardian, formed a friendship with Weizmann after the two men encountered each other at a Manchester garden party in 1915. Scott described the diminutive leader as extraordinarily interesting, a rare combination of idealism and the severely practical which are the two essentials of statesmanship a perfectly clear sense conception of jewish nationalism, an intense and burning sense of the Jew as Jew, just as strong, perhaps more so, as that of the German as German or the Englishman as Englishman, and secondly arising out of that and necessary for its satisfaction and development, his demand for a country, a home land which for him and for anyone during his view of Jewish nationality can be no other that the ancient home of his race.|$|E

60|$|The reply {{trembling}} on Miss Tyrell’s lips realised that it {{was utterly}} inadequate to the occasion, and remained unspoken.

He glanced at a clock in a baker’s shop as they passed, and saw {{that it was}} just seven.|$|R
2500|$|In contrast, Haig's {{speech was}} disastrous. According to John Charteris, {{he did not}} read out his written statement, which gave a [...] "clear and convincing account of his views, {{he did not even}} refer <b>to</b> it <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> but <b>to</b> the dismay of his staff {{attempted}} to extemporise. In the effort he became totally unintelligible and unbearably dull. The university dignitaries soon fell asleep, Haig's friends became more and more uncomfortable, only he seemed totally unconscious of his failure." ...|$|R
50|$|Parker was {{appointed}} by George W. Bush as Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), with oversight of the Army Corps of Engineers, which has numerous projects in Parker's home state of Mississippi. Parker {{was one of the}} first political casualties of the Bush administration's heavily centralized management style <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> out <b>to</b> promote the corp of engineers priorities and was then asked to leave in the summer of 2002. In recent years Parker has been a Washington lobbyist, specializing in infrastructure issues.|$|R

60|$|The tone {{in which}} she said those words made it impossible, even for old Mr. Ablewhite, to mistake her any longer.

60|$|Thus adjured, Leo {{told her}} the {{wonderful}} story of the casket and of the potsherd that, written on by his ancestress, the Egyptian Amenartas, had been the means of guiding us to her. Ayesha listened intently, and, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had finished, <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|R
50|$|During the Civil War II storyline, Ulysses later {{received}} {{a vision that}} tipped off Blue Marvel about Infinaut's ninth manifestation attempt enabling him, Giant-Man, and the Ultimates {{to work on a}} Pym Particle accelerator within a week.

60|$|I {{begged him}} to wait until he was more composed, until he was better able to speak; {{but he did not}} appear to notice what I said. Slowly, and {{struggling}} as it seemed against himself, he turned a little away from me, and, bending his head over the table, supported it on his hand. The packet of letters with which I had seen him occupied when I came in lay just beneath his eyes. He looked down on it steadfastly <b>when</b> <b>he</b> next <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there came}} into his face {{something}} which she had seen there once before, and which ever since she had recalled with a vague uneasiness--the look murderous. The veins in his forehead became like whipcord--there was a red flash in his eyes. Yet his self-control was marvellous. His voice, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> seemed scarcely <b>to</b> rise above a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|Strether seemed, in his way, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> next <b>spoke,</b> <b>to</b> {{take some}} of them up.
