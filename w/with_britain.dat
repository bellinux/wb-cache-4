5|$|Hitler was {{concerned}} that a military attack against Poland {{could result in a}} premature war <b>with</b> <b>Britain.</b> Hitler's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, assured him that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland. Accordingly, on 22 August 1939 Hitler ordered a military mobilisation against Poland.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson-Clarendon treaty, {{presented}} to Congress by President Ulysses S. Grant, was overwhelmingly {{defeated by the}} Senate and the claims remained unresolved. Anglophobia led by Charles Sumner was {{at an all-time high}} when Fish became Secretary of State. Sumner had demanded Britain cede Canada to the United States as payment for the Alabama Claims. In late 1870, an opportunity arrived to settle the Alabama Claims under Prime Minister William Gladstone. Fish, who was determined to improve relations <b>with</b> <b>Britain,</b> along with President Grant and Senate supporters, had Charles Sumner removed by vote from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the door was open for renewed negotiations <b>with</b> <b>Britain.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{military}} operation {{plan for the}} invasion of Ireland in support of Operation Sea Lion was drawn up by the Germans in August 1940. Occupied Ireland was to be ruled along <b>with</b> <b>Britain</b> in a temporary administrative system divided into six military-economic commands, {{with one of the}} headquarters being situated in Dublin. Ireland's future position in the New Order is unclear, but it is known that Hitler would have united Ulster with the Irish state.|$|E

5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet {{victory in the}} Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began {{to recognize that the}} war could no longer be won. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or <b>with</b> <b>Britain.</b> Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E
5|$|After the War of the Oranges, Portugal {{adopted a}} double policy. On {{the one hand}} John, Prince of Brazil, as regent of Portugal, signed the Treaty of Badajoz with France and Spain by which he assumed the duty to close the ports to British trade. On the other hand, not wanting to breach the Treaty of Windsor (1386) with Portugal's oldest ally, Britain, he allowed for such trade to {{continue}} and maintained secret diplomatic relations with them. However, after the Franco-Spanish defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar, John grew bold and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations <b>with</b> <b>Britain.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{military}} importance of Jersey, the British government had ordered that the island be heavily fortified. On 6 January 1781, a French invasion force of 2,000 men set out {{to take over the}} island, but only half of the force arrived and landed. The Battle of Jersey lasted about half an hour, <b>with</b> <b>Britain</b> successfully defending the island. There were about thirty casualties on each side, and the British took 600 French prisoners whom were subsequently sent to England. Both British and French commanders were slain.|$|E

50|$|Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer (1723 - November 16, 1790) was a {{politician}} and a Founding Father of the United States.

5|$|Blaine’s {{earliest}} expressions in {{the foreign}} policy sphere were those of a reactionary Anglophobe, {{but by the end}} of his career his relationship with the United Kingdom had become more moderate and nuanced. A dispute over seal hunting in the waters off Alaska was the cause of Blaine’s first interaction <b>with</b> <b>Britain</b> as Harrison’s Secretary of State. A law passed in 1889 required Harrison to ban seal hunting in Alaskan waters, but Canadian fishermen believed they had the right to continue fishing there. Soon thereafter, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships near the Pribilof Islands. Blaine entered into negotiations <b>with</b> <b>Britain</b> and the two nations agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration by a neutral tribunal. Blaine was no longer in office when the tribunal began its work, but the result was to allow the hunting once more, albeit with some regulation, and to require the United States to pay damages of $473,151. Ultimately, the nations signed the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, which outlawed open-water seal hunting.|$|E
5|$|Following the German invasion, Molotov {{conducted}} urgent negotiations <b>with</b> <b>Britain</b> and, later, the United States for wartime alliances. He took {{a secret}} flight to Glasgow, Scotland, {{where he was}} greeted by Eden. This risky flight, in a high altitude Tupolev TB-7 bomber, flew over German occupied Denmark and the North Sea. From there he took a train to London to discuss with the British government the possibility of opening a second front against Germany.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to gain even local air superiority in the Battle of Britain, Operation Sea Lion was {{postponed}} indefinitely. Hitler and his generals {{were aware of the}} problems of an invasion. Hitler was not ideologically committed to a long war <b>with</b> <b>Britain</b> and many commentators suggest that German invasion plans were a feint never to be put into action.|$|E

5|$|Germany was {{dependent}} on imported oil; a confrontation <b>with</b> <b>Britain</b> over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail Germany's oil supplies. This forced Hitler to call off Fall Grün, originally planned for 1 October 1938.

5|$|He was {{promoted}} to lieutenant-general on 25 April 1808, and in June was given command of 9,000 men set to invade revolutionary Spanish America. But in 1807, Napoleon had invaded Portugal, via Spain, intent on preventing its continued trade <b>with</b> <b>Britain.</b> He replaced the Spanish royal family with his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, in May 1808. In Madrid, the people attempted a rebellion against the French occupation which spread across Spain resulting in mass executions in reprisal, leading both the Portuguese and Spanish juntas (local administrations) to call on British support.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander {{met at the}} Congress of Erfurt to {{preserve}} the Russo-French alliance. The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807. By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was {{under pressure from the}} Russian nobility to break off the alliance. A major strain on {{the relationship between the two}} nations became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance <b>with</b> <b>Britain.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1842 Secretary of State Daniel Webster {{negotiated}} <b>with</b> <b>Britain</b> the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which {{determined the}} border between Maine and Canada. That issue had caused tension between the United States and Britain for decades and had brought the two countries {{to the brink of}} war on several occasions. Though the treaty improved Anglo-American diplomatic relations,, Tyler was nevertheless unsuccessful in concluding a treaty with the British to fix the boundaries of Oregon. On Tyler's last full day in office, March 3, 1845, Florida was admitted to the Union as the 27th state.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, the Senate {{took up the}} {{question}} of ending the joint occupancy of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain. Lewis Cass, a senator from Michigan, supported an immediate termination of the joint occupation agreement and maintained that a war with the British over the matter was inevitable. Crittenden disagreed, and insisted that Britain be given two years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended {{in order to allow}} time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden's position prevailed, and a compromise <b>with</b> <b>Britain</b> was effected, setting the dividing line between the two nations' claims at the 49th parallel north.|$|E

At the outset of the War of 1812, Johnson was {{commissioned}} a colonel in the Kentucky Militia and commanded a regiment of mounted volunteers from 1812 to 1813. He and his brother James served under William Henry Harrison in Upper Canada. Johnson participated in the Battle of the Thames. Some reported that he personally killed the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, which he later used to his political advantage.|$|E
