5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> became {{a writer for the}} show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows was perfect for the role because she was very sweet, and the staff {{had a lot of fun}} during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans regarding what characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E

25|$|Bush played most of {{his career}} for Cardiff RFC making 171 {{appearances}} and scoring 66 tries between 1899 and 1913. He captained the club for three seasons. He won eight caps for Wales (1905–1910), including for the famous 1905 victory over New Zealand. He also played in four tests for the 1904 British Isles on their tour to Australia and New Zealand. This <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had been capped by Wales. He was the undoubted star of the tour, being dubbed 'Will o' the Wisp' by the Australian press for his devastating play.|$|E
25|$|Kondo was {{the third}} person hired by Nintendo to create music and sound effects for their games, joining Hirokazu Tanaka and Yukio Kaneoka. However, {{he was the first}} at Nintendo to {{actually}} specialize in musical composition. The first game he worked on was the arcade game Punch-Out!!, although it <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had officially joined Nintendo. Despite creating mostly jingles and sound effects, he was able to overcome the challenges of early arcade sound hardware. As the Famicom had become highly popular in Japan, Kondo was assigned to compose music for the console's subsequent games at Nintendo's new development team, Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD). Kondo also wrote an instruction manual on how to program Japanese popular music into the Famicom using the peripheral Family BASIC. To conclude his first year at Nintendo, he created the music to Devil World alongside Akito Nakatsuka. In 1985, Nintendo started marketing the Famicom abroad under the name the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) to capitalize on the 1983 video game crash that devastated Atari, Inc. He composed the music for the hit releases Super Mario Bros. (1985) and The Legend of Zelda (1986), which helped the system to sell 60 million copies in total and established some of the most well-known melodies in the video game industry.|$|E
500|$|Having lost a {{significant}} amount of his vision in his left eye, Malhotra struggled in his first full season since the injury in 2011–12. He was supplanted as the Canucks' third-line centre by rookie Cody Hodgson and later Samuel Pahlsson. Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault assessed Malhotra during the season as [...] "not the same physical player he was before," [...] adding that [...] "He's still contributing but not maybe to the degree that he <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> got injured." [...] Playing left wing on the fourth line, he remained {{an integral part of the}} team by playing on the penalty kill and taking important defensive zone faceoffs. Near the end of the campaign, Malhotra was chosen as the Canucks' nominee for the Bill Masterton Trophy, an annual NHL award for perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. With a diminished offensive role, Malhotra finished his second season in Vancouver with 7 goals and 18 points over 78 games, as well as a -10 plus-minus rating. He remained among the league's elite in terms of faceoffs, however, ranking fourth with a 58.5% percentage.|$|E

500|$|... 16.38 million American viewers tuned {{into this}} episode. Reviews were mixed. Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly praised Jorge Garcia's and Michael Emerson's performances, {{and said that}} the episode made the island [...] "feel {{dangerous}} again". Ryan J. Budke of TV Squad felt that the B-story in the hatch was more interesting than Hurley's scenes, and considered [...] "Dave" [...] depressing, in opposition to the other [...] "so light-hearted" [...] Hurley-centered episodes. IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7 out of 10, considering it entertaining even if it [...] "doesn't really impact the series as a whole," [...] but the website later ranked [...] "Dave" [...] as the 9th worst Lost episode ever, describing it as meaningless and saying the flashback [...] "felt pretty extraneous." [...] New York magazine listed [...] "Dave" [...] sixth in a [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Episodes of Lost" [...] list, considering that [...] "using an episode to disprove a theory that wasn’t so prevalent was a waste of time." [...] On the other hand, the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the 30th best of the series, describing it as [...] "perhaps the most misunderstood episode of Lost ever," [...] saying that Dave not being real {{was meant to be a}} twist, but just [...] "the biggest expression of just how messed up Hurley <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> found the island." ...|$|E
500|$|Adam's most {{significant}} influence following his death {{is in the}} next episode [...] "Restless", where the cost of defeating Adam is made apparent. Buffys fourth season was a first in the series in that the Scoobies' defeat of the Big Bad did not occur in a two-part grand season finale. [...] "Primeval" [...] is not the last episode of the season. Joss Whedon felt so strongly {{about the importance of}} the four core characters that he dedicated the finale to exploring their development. [...] "Restless" [...] opens with Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles arriving at Buffy's mother's house still brimming with the energy of the spell that bound them together in [...] "Primeval". Each of them falls asleep quickly, however, and their dreams are a pastiche of enigmatic episodes that both reveal much about each character, but also foreshadow what will occur in seasons to come. Their dreams also mirror their roles in the spell they performed to kill Adam. The magic they used to defeat the influence of science creates an inverse crisis, violating the series' set of laws. Both Riley and Adam, now only in human form, appear in Buffy's dream. They are wearing business suits, sitting together at a glass conference table as Buffy walks into the room, telling her they are naming things—as Adam did in the Garden of Eden—and making plans to take over the world. Buffy asks Adam what his name <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was a monster, but he cannot tell her. Adam appears once more in the series as one of the faces of the First Evil, the seventh season's Big Bad, in [...] "Lessons".|$|E

The {{grandson}} of the First Tsuchikage, Ishikawa, and a protege of the Second, Mu, he presides {{over one of}} the longest reigns of a Kage, having personally met many figures long dead in the present, including Madara Uchiha. He possesses the Particle Style, a kekkei tota that combines Fire, Earth, and Wind elements to create three-dimensional shapes capable of disintegrating anything it touches, as well as the ability to alter gravity, enabling him flight. He is very proud, despite his frailty, and shows little respect to those much younger than him. During the Kage Summit, he admitted to have frequently hired Akatsuki. He defended his action, stating that the use of Akatsuki was necessary to protect themselves while still demilitarizing, but this and his advanced age still lead Mifune to deny him leadership of the forces to lead against Akatsuki. When Sasuke intrudes on the meeting room chasing after Danzo, he refuses {{to take part in the}} fight. Due to Gaara's actions and words during the meeting, Onoki reverts back to the noble man he once <b>was</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> became hard-headed. Later, he goes out to find Kabuto and prevent him from finding Killer Bee and Naruto and succeeds in protecting them. Throughout the war, Onoki's techniques proved instrumental in keeping Alliance members alive and he becomes the de-facto leader in the assault against the real Madara Uchiha. Years later, Onoki retires due to his failing health and passes down his title to his granddaughter, Kurotsuchi. He is voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura in the Japanese anime, while in the English adaptation, he is voiced by Steven Blum.|$|E

The book, which has been positioned as fiction written anonymously, covers 35 days of the Indian Bollywood League (IBL).

The central plot of the book is the chase to unmask a treacherous anonymous blogger who is upsetting the IPL. And through this story, FIP supposedly exposes cricket's dark underbelly. Critical reviews of the book were polarised with some praising it and some others criticising the book and its purpose. The 7 June 2010 issue of India Today put The Gamechangers at No. 9 in the list of Top 10 national best-sellers.|$|E

The Outside is a spacetime plane where aiúas initially exist. (Aiúa is the term given to the pattern defining any specific structure of the universe, whether a particular atom, a star, or a sentient consciousness.) Formic hive queens are called from Outside after birth, giving awareness to the new body. Jane is able to contain within her vast computing power the pattern defining the billions of atoms and overall structure comprising a simple [...] "starship" [...] (little more than a room), with passengers included, and take them Outside. By bringing them Outside, where relative location is nonexistent, then back [...] "Inside" [...] at a different spot in the physical universe, instantaneous travel has been achieved, finally matching the instantaneous communication of the Ansibles and Formics. They quickly arrange to take Ender, Ela, and Miro to Outside. While Ela is Outside, {{she is able to}} create the recolada virus, which is a safe replacement of the descolada, and a cure to the godspoken genetic defect.
