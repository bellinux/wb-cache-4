5|$|Negombo Tamils, or Puttalam Tamils, {{are native}} Sri Lankan Tamils <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western Gampaha and Puttalam districts. The term {{does not apply}} to Tamil {{immigrants}} in these areas. They are distinguished from other Tamils by their dialects, one of which is known as the Negombo Tamil dialect, and by aspects of their culture such as customary laws. Most Negombo Tamils have assimilated into the Sinhalese ethnic group through a process known as Sinhalisation. Sinhalisation has been facilitated by caste myths and legends (see Passing (sociology)).|$|E

5000|$|According {{to another}} theory, the name derives from a Lusignan called Etienne, <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, and <b>the</b> people <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village were {{mentioning}} his house as [...] "Etienne's Place" [...] (Greek: [...] "Στου Ετιένου", stou etiennou), and {{in later years}} that changed into Athienou.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} more {{citizens}} who live in areas corresponding to classes 1–3 than those <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> areas corresponding to classes 5 and 6. For example, in Bogotá 73% of the population live in zones of classes 1–3, whereas only 10% live in zones classified as 5 and 6. Consequently, the tariff system permanently causes deficits which require subsidies paid by the national government.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the history}} of Canada, {{heraldry}} in the country has incorporated aboriginal and First Nations symbols and elements. The Coat of Arms of Nunavut, for example, includes elements such as an inukshuk, a qulliq, and an igloo, all of which are references to the Inuit peoples <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, while the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority include ravens, a First Nations symbol of creation and transformation. In addition, some Canadians choose to bear their arms on a roundel rather than a shield, a reference to a drumhead; an example is the coat of arms of Nunavut.|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{identify}} {{anywhere from}} 230 to 282 different folks and linguistic groups in Cameroon. The Adamawa Plateau broadly bisects these into {{northern and southern}} divisions. The northern peoples are Sudanese groups, <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central highlands and the northern lowlands, and the Fulani, who are spread throughout northern Cameroon. A small number of Shuwa Arabs live near Lake Chad. Southern Cameroon is inhabited by speakers of Bantu and Semi-Bantu languages. Bantu-speaking groups inhabit the coastal and equatorial zones, while speakers of Semi-Bantu languages live in the Western grassfields. Some 5,000 Gyele and Baka Pygmy peoples roam the southeastern and coastal rainforests or live in small, roadside settlements. Nigerians make up {{the largest group of}} foreign nationals.|$|E

5|$|In {{the outer}} garden is an arboretum, planted in 1977 by Bishop John Bickersteth {{to commemorate the}} Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The mute swans on the moat {{have been trained to}} ring bells by pulling strings, to beg for food. The first swans were trained by one of the daughters of Bishop Hervey in the 1870s. Two swans which were given to the bishop by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006, are still able to ring for lunch fed to them by the caretakers <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gatehouse.|$|E
5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore. Encantados {{are said to be}} fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among people <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E

DeVry University's Keller School of Management operates a branch in Lincolnshire, alongside the Southlakes Campus of the College of Lake County, which is located just to the north in the village of Vernon Hills. Alumni of Stevenson High School who wish to apply for the University of Illinois may do so at an extension site located in Grayslake, a village in northern Lake County.

5|$|The {{following}} chapters {{describe in}} detail the places Wallace visited. Wallace includes numerous observations on the people, their languages, ways of living, and social organisation, {{as well as on}} the plants and animals found in each location. He talks about the biogeographic patterns he observes and their implications for natural history, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels. The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among the people <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} people of Enugu include the Ogui Nike <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> areas surrounding Hotel Presidential, Obiagu, Ama-Igbo, Ihewuzi and Onu-Asata. Other groups include the Awkunanaw people, who live {{mainly in the}} Achara Layout and Uwani areas. The Enugwu Ngwo people live in Hilltop on {{the west of the}} city with their farm lands sprawling all over the valley. Other Nike people live around the Abakpa, Iji-Nike, and Emene areas of the city. Most of the non-{{indigenous people}} of Enugu are migrants {{from other parts of the}} Igbo cultural area. After the majority Igbo, the Yoruba people are another significant ethnic group found present in Enugu; other groups include the Hausa, Kanuri, Ijaw, and Fulani people.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode of}} the {{television}} series Smallville premiered on The WB on October 16, 2001. It was written by series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, and directed by David Nutter. The Smallville pilot introduces the characters of Clark Kent, an orphaned alien with superhuman abilities, and {{his friends and family}} <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fictional town of Smallville, Kansas. It follows Clark as he first learns of his alien origins, and attempts to stop a vengeful student from killing Smallville High School students. The episode introduces many themes that were designed to run either the course of the season or the entire series, such as the triangular relationships of the main characters.|$|E

The {{government}} fears that if they converge on a single state, they could win {{a seat in the}} United States Senate. Garcian travels to Coburn Elementary School near Seattle, Washington and discovers tapes that reveal the school as a front for the UN Party to train children as assassins. The tapes focus on Emir Parkreiner, a gifted killer trained at the school. Garcian learns that Japan uses Coburn to control the vote of the US presidential election. The assassins battle a group of invincible Smiles and all but Garcian are incapacitated. Garcian travels to the Union Hotel where he witnesses visions of the other members being killed in their rooms. At the top, he discovers that his true identity is Emir Parkreiner, the one who killed the killer7 at the Union Hotel over 50 years ago. Following that incident, Harman absorbed Emir as a persona and Emir's memories were lost.|$|E
5|$|William Taylor and Helen Cartwright are two {{children}} <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Bellbridge (a fictionalised version of London). Will is an aspiring football player, Helen a prodigy violinist. Over the years, both have grown {{apart from their}} respective parents; Helen has chosen {{to spend more time}} practising the violin with her friends rather than with her mother, a choice which has begun to fill her with guilt, while Will's father is transferred to another city for work and leaves his son by himself. Both children suffer nightmares and come under attack by the Nightmaren, who chase them into the world of Nightopia. There, the {{two children}} meet and free Nights, who has the ability to merge with the children, allowing them to share Nights' body and fly through the skies. Learning that Wizeman is plotting to take over the dream world and consequently enter the real world, the children and Nights resolve to stop Wizeman, but face resistance from the Nightmaren he commands, particularly Nights' sibling, Reala.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{references to}} Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There {{have been few}} attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, {{rather than in a}} single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.|$|E
