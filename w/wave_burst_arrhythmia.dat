40|$|Abstract. Monte-Carlo {{simulations}} {{are used}} in the gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>burst</b> detection community to demonstrate and compare the properties of different search techniques. We note that every Monte-Carlo simulation has a corresponding optimal search technique according to both the non-Bayesian Neyman-Pearson criterion and the Bayesian approach, and that this optimal search technique is the Bayesian statistic. When practical, we recommend deriving the optimal statistic for a credible Monte-Carlo simulation, rather than testing ad hoc statistics against that simulation. PACS numbers: 04. 80. Nn, 07. 05.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} methods have been proposed to identify unanticipated burst sources of gravitational waves in data arising from LIGO and other gravitational wave detectors. When confronted with such {{a wide variety of}} methods one is moved to ask if they are all necessary, i. e. given detector data that is assumed to have no gravitational wave signals present, do they generally identify the same events with the same efficiency, or do they each 'see' different things in the detector? Here we consider three different methods, which have been used within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration as part of its search for unanticipated gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>bursts.</b> We find that each of these three different methods developed for identifying candidate gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>burst</b> sources are, in fact, attuned to significantly different features in detector data, suggesting that they may provide largely independent lists of candidate gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>burst</b> events.

40|$|The {{sites of}} action of {{ketamine}} (CI- 581; 2 -(0 -chlorophenyl) - 2 -methylamino cyclohexamine HCl) were determined {{in the central}} nervous system using electrophysiological techniques in both acute and chronic cat experiments. It was demonstrated in chronic preparations that the cataleptic anesthetic state induced by ketamine is accompanied by an alternating pattern of hypersynchronous delta <b>wave</b> <b>bursts</b> and low voltage, fast wave activity in the neocortex and thalamus. The delta <b>wave</b> <b>bursts</b> had a distribution in the neocortex similar to that of spindles produced by low doses of barbiturates or natural sleep. Subcortically, the delta <b>wave</b> <b>bursts</b> were observed prominently in the thalamus and in the caudate nucleus. The EEG patterns of the diffusely projecting thalamic nuclei were closely related phasically to the delta waves of the neocortex. EEG changes in the midbrain reticular formation and hypothalamus were not as prominent. Paradoxically, the hippocampus showed theta "arousal" waves during the delta <b>wave</b> <b>burst</b> period of the thalamo-neocortical system. This functional dissociation between the thalamo-neocortical and limbic system was one of the EEG characteristics of ketamine. Ketamine, in contrast to the barbiturates, depressed the recruiting response at a time when neocortical EEG activation was minimally affected. Somatosensory potentials evoked from stimulation of the median nerve were depressed primarily in the nonspecific thalamic nuclei, midbrain reticular formation, somatosensory cortex and sensory relay nuclei, respectively, with minimal anesthetic doses. Multiple neuronal unit activity showed clear grouping in the thalamus. The closest relationship of multiple unit activity to the delta waves in the neocortex was observed in the diffusely projecting thalamic nuclei. After ketamine the reticular formation showed neither grouping nor suppression of multiple unit activity during the neocortical delta bursts. Based upon these observations, the site of action of ketamine in minimal anesthetic doses appears to be in the non-specific thalamo-neocortical system. This system seems to be a primary factor in producing the hypersynchronous delta <b>wave</b> <b>burst</b> pattern in the EEG...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Though it {{has been}} widely viewed that the light {{consists}} of quantum particles known as photons, the light is not made of quantum particles or photons, and the light is always a wave. What is quantized in the light is the frequency. The electromagnetic frequency is always quantized due to the quantized nature of the electromagnetic energy; the quantum energy results in quantum frequency. The light {{is made up of}} many discrete electromagnetic <b>wave</b> <b>bursts</b> of constant durations; each burst consists of an electromagnetic wave of a single frequency determined by an integer multiple of the indivisible quantum energy units. The quantum energy and frequency are synonymous; they are one and the same. The duration of a <b>wave</b> <b>burst</b> is a universal constant, and it is the same for all the <b>wave</b> <b>bursts</b> irrespective of the frequency of the electromagnetic wave they contain. Since the quantum energy is in the frequency of the electromagnetic wave in a <b>wave</b> <b>burst,</b> the light can be propagated unlimited distances with the quantum energy intact, without which, the evolution of life would not have occurred. The quantum energy is not affected by any gradual path degradation even after the propagation of light for billions of light years since the quantum energy is the frequency; this would have been an impossible task by any other means such as carrying the quantum energy in a particle or photon on a wave. The light is always a wave, and never a particle; there is no wave-particle duality. There is absolutely no need for an unrealistic, artificial quantum light particle, or photon hypothesis. The hypothetical mass-less particles only exist in human imagination; they do not exist in the nature...|$|R

40|$|We {{perform a}} search for {{gravitational}} <b>wave</b> <b>bursts</b> {{using data from the}} second science run of the LIGO detectors, using a method based on a wavelet time-frequency decomposition. This search is sensitive to bursts of duration much less than a second and with frequency content in the 100 - 1100 Hz range. It features significant improvements in the instrument sensitivity and in the analysis pipeline with respect to the burst search previously reported by LIGO. Improvements in the search method allow exploring weaker signals, relative to the detector noise floor, while maintaining a low false alarm rate, O(0. 1) µHz. The sensitivity in terms of the root-sum-square (rss) strain amplitude lies in the range of h(rss) ~ 10 ^(- 20) - 10 ^(- 19) Hz^(- 1 / 2). No gravitational wave signals were detected in 9. 98 days of analyzed data. We interpret the search result in terms of a frequentist upper limit on the rate of detectable gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>bursts</b> at the level of 0. 26 events per day at 90 % confidence level. We combine this limit with measurements of the detection efficiency for selected waveform morphologies in order to yield rate versus strength exclusion curves as well as to establish order-of-magnitude distance sensitivity to certain modeled astrophysical sources. Both the rate upper limit and its applicability to signal strengths improve our previously reported limits and reflect the most sensitive broad-band search for untriggered and unmodeled gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>bursts</b> to date...|$|R

We first present filters based on the linear fit of whitened data to short straight lines in a given time window and combine them in a non linear filter named ALF. We study the performances and efficiencies of these filters, with the help of a catalogue of simulated supernova signals. The ALF filter is the most performant and most efficient of all filters. Its performance reaches about 80 % of the Optimal Filter performance designed for the same signals. Such a filter could be implemented as an online trigger (dedicated to detect bursts of unknown waveform) in interferometric detectors of gravitational waves. Comment: 14 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
