500|$|Although Monteux {{retained}} his vitality {{to the end}} of his life, in {{his last}} years he suffered occasional collapses. In 1962 he fainted during a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. In 1963 he collapsed again after being presented with the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, Britain's highest musical honour. The presentation was made by Sir Adrian Boult, who recalled that as they left the platform, [...] "Monteux gave two little groans as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the passage, and I suddenly found my arms full of violins and bows. The orchestra had recognized the signs. Their beloved chief was fainting." [...] Monteux suffered another collapse the following year, and David Zinman and Lorin Maazel deputised for him at the Festival Hall.|$|E
2500|$|... (On a {{reconnaissance}} trip to occupied Benghazi.) <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> {{the middle}} of the street arm in arm, whistling and doing our best to give the impression that we had every right to be there. Nobody paid the slightest attention to us. On such occasions it's one's manner that counts. If only you can behave naturally, and avoid any appearance of furtiveness, it is worth any number of elaborate disguises and faked documents.|$|E
60|$|After reloading, <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> {{the outside}} of the {{palisade}} to see to the fallen enemy. He was stone dead--shot through the heart.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I'm afraid I'm late. I won't {{keep you}} long. Shall <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the road? You {{may not have}} been followed, but it is as well {{to be on the safe}} side.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see how we're {{going to}} get these down to Timminsport unless <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> there," [...] remarked Jack. [...] "And a walk {{of five or six}} miles through this snow each way wouldn't be an easy job." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{took the}} {{path through the}} plantation, and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to the village through the woods which bordered {{one side of the}} estate.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to {{the drug}} store. On entering, Mr. Harrison ordered a couple of glasses of soda water and then called the {{proprietor}} aside.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's one thing," [...] said I, as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to the station. [...] "If the husband's {{name was}} James, {{and the other}} was Henry, what was this talk about David?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The moment I have sealed this letter; <b>we</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> together, if you like!" [...] {{and in a}} {{few minutes}} they left the club.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then, gentlemen," [...] {{said the}} merchant, rising, [...] "if you have quite finished, <b>we</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> to the harbour and inspect the goods." ...|$|R
50|$|Since <b>we</b> have to <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> {{the entire}} {{height of the}} trie, this process takes O(log M) time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Walk by me," [...] said I, nerving myself; {{and side}} by side <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the narrow way, taking little heed of the dim Things that peered at {{us out of the}} huts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come to the 'Gray's-inn Coffee-house,'" [...] Pinto said, [...] "and I {{will tell}} you how THE NOTCH CAME TO THE AXE." [...] And <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> Holborn at about thirty-seven minutes past six o'clock.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> {{the steps}} together. 'What a picturesque old town!' I said, looking round me, well pleased. Its beauty appealed to me, for I had fifty pounds in pocket, and I had lunched sumptuously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{let us take}} a walk. If you too {{are staying}} at this inn, we are fellow-travellers. <b>We</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the Arno to the Cascine. There are several things I should like to ask of you." ...|$|R
60|$|Judge Hoover was the Bugle's {{candidate}} for congress. Having {{to confer with}} him, I sought his home early the next morning; and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> together <b>down</b> town through a little street with which I was unfamiliar.|$|R
60|$|Holmes was curiously distrait, and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> up and <b>down</b> {{the garden}} path {{for some time}} in silence.|$|R
6000|$|She {{would not}} consent. [...] "I know I am {{a good deal}} younger than I was. I feel quite in the mood of that morning when <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> Broadway on our wedding journey. Don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush! hush! boys,' said Lady Merrifield. 'I do {{not mean}} to {{interfere}} with your pleasure, 'but I had rather our discussions were not entirely selfish. Suppose, Gillian, <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to Casement Cottages, and consulted Miss Hacket.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Tag mounted his own horse; and, as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the avenue, [...] "I thought," [...] he said, [...] "you told me {{you knew}} how to ride; and that you had ridden once fifty miles on a stretch!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you are {{thinking}} of," [...] the professor interrupted. [...] "Well, well, give me your arm and <b>we</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> to the hall together. My friends," [...] the professor added, turning round, [...] "I wish you all a good-night!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{carried a}} scythe, and <b>we</b> <b>walked,</b> pleasantly weary, <b>down</b> the hill towards the farm. The {{children}} {{had gone home}} with the rabbits.|$|R
40|$|Oh, {{the good}} old metro stations! No matter how much we change, how much our society changes, they all look pretty much the same. <b>We</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the stairs, grab a coffee on the way, pass the gates, get to our {{platform}} and then we wait. But what if? What if it wasn’t like that? What if we could decide not to rush down to the platform, but instead enjoy the few minutes we have, before being drawn back to our daily life, in a nice, entertaining environment? A place for everyone to enjoy, not just those who own a metro card. After all, a station is still a public space, isn’t it...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help seeing {{a good deal of}} force in her arguments, {{although}} I wished very much to set the thing straight, and we discussed the matter again as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to the camp, after breakfast next morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am doing}} it entirely on Mrs. Deering's I account," [...] said my wife that evening after tea, as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the side-street that descended from our place to Broadway. [...] "She has that girl on her hands, and I know {{she must be}} at her wits' end." ...|$|E
60|$|This suited me. It {{is always}} easier to talk intimately in the dark, and I {{did not wish}} to be {{interrupted}} by the sudden entrance of the Hired Man or Mrs. Beale, of which there was always a danger indoors. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to the paddock. Ukridge lit a cigar.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear young ladies," [...] he said, [...] "it was {{delightful}} to {{find you}} here. I came upon the chance, I admit, but who in Ostend {{would not be here}} between six and eight? <b>We</b> dine, <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> to the quay, and if you will, you shall wave your hands and wish us bon voyage, but London just now is triste. It is here you may live the life the bon Dieu sends, where the sun shines all the time and the sea laps the sands like a great blue lake, and you, mademoiselle, can wear those wonderful costumes and charm all hearts. There is nothing like that for you in London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not before midnight, I think. Shall <b>we</b> go and <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> by the lake, {{it will be}} cooler there, and {{we shall}} be quite undisturbed? Walls have ears sometimes, you know." ...|$|R
40|$|VALUES @ work In our 2010 report, {{the color}} wheel {{represents}} the seven core values of EDC. While each color {{corresponds to a}} single value, as a wheel it shows {{the importance of these}} values coming together. As one, they serve as our guiding light now that <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the road to our vision of becoming the number one geothermal company in the world. By spinning the color wheel and revealing each core value, we symbolize how we create ripples of action that flow beyond the confines of our work areas to a broader community that is the Philippines.

6000|$|I {{could not}} {{understand}} the woman. There was such an extraordinary mixture of masculine decision and womanly tenderness about her, with the consciousness of something all her own in the background, that she fairly puzzled me. I hardly knew, therefore, how to answer Cowles when, as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the street together, he asked the comprehensive question-- ...|$|E
60|$|The ladies nex morning {{set out for}} the City, and I walked behind, {{doing the}} genteel thing, with a nosegy and a goold stick. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the New Road--we walked down the City Road--we walked to the Bank. We were {{crossing}} from that heddyfiz {{to the other side of}} Cornhill, when all of a sudden missis shreeked, and fainted spontaceously away.|$|E
60|$|Thence {{ascending}} {{with increased}} difficulty to the hill-top, {{we arrived at}} a large stuccoed platform,[FN#2] with prayer-niche {{and a kind of}} obelisk, mean and badly built of lime and granite stone, whitewashed, and conspicuous from afar. It is called the Makam, or Mada’a Sayyidna Adam.[FN#3] Here we performed the customary ceremonies amongst a crowd of pilgrims, and then <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the little hill.|$|E
60|$|After tea <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> on <b>down</b> again {{towards the}} Tweed, our host {{and his friends}} waiting on us to the boat. As we passed through the village of Dryburgh, all the {{inhabitants}} of the cottages seemed to be standing in their doors, bowing and smiling, and expressing their welcome in a gentle, kindly way, that was quite touching.|$|R
6000|$|... "She did well. Speak on, my good boy, if <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> up and <b>down</b> here {{we shall}} be private. It does my heart good to commune with a {{faithful}} young son of the Church." ...|$|R
60|$|If <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> the street, {{taking all}} the jurymen who have not formed {{opinions}} and leaving all the jurymen who have formed opinions, it seems highly probable that we shall only succeed in {{taking all the}} stupid jurymen and leaving all the thoughtful ones. Provided that the opinion formed is really of this airy and abstract kind, provided {{that it has no}} suggestion of settled motive or prejudice, we might well regard it not merely as a promise of capacity, but literally as a promise of justice. The man who took the trouble to deduce from the police reports would probably be the man who would take the trouble to deduce further and different things from the evidence. The man who had the sense to form an opinion would be the man who would have the sense to alter it.|$|R
