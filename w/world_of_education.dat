25|$|As Witmer {{believed}} in the appropriate training of these school psychologists, he also {{stressed the importance of}} appropriate and accurate testing of these special children. The IQ testing movement was sweeping through the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> after its creation in 1905. However, the IQ test negatively influenced special education. The IQ test creators, Lewis Terman and Henry Goddard, held a nativist view of intelligence, believing that intelligence was inherited and difficult if not impossible to modify in any meaningful way through education. These notions were often used as a basis for excluding children with disabilities from the public schools. Witmer argued against the standard pencil and paper IQ and Binet type tests in order to help select children for special education. Witmer's child selection process included observations and having children perform certain mental tasks.|$|E

2500|$|The Vanguard Press {{published}} Oates' first novel, With Shuddering Fall (1964), {{when she}} was 26 years old. In 1966, she published [...] "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?", a short story dedicated to Bob Dylan and written after listening to his song [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue." [...] The story is loosely based on the serial killer Charles Schmid, also known as [...] "The Pied Piper of Tucson". It has been anthologized many times and adapted as a film, Smooth Talk starring Laura Dern (1985). In 2008, Oates said that of all her published work, she is most noted for [...] "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?". Another early short story, [...] "In a Region of Ice" [...] (The Atlantic Monthly, August 1966), features a young, gifted Jewish-American student. It dramatizes his drift into protest against the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> and the sober, established society of his parents, his depression, and eventually murder-cum-suicide. It {{was inspired by a}} real-life incident (as were several of her works) and Oates had been acquainted with the model of her protagonist. She revisited this subject in the title story of her collection Last Days: Stories (1984). [...] "In the Region of Ice" [...] won the first of her two O. Henry Awards. Her second novel was A Garden of Earthly Delights (1967), first of the so-called Wonderland Quartet published by Vanguard 1967 to 1971. All were finalists for the annual National Book Award.|$|E
