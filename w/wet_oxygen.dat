Historically the Bay's oyster population was {{in the tens of}} billions they circulated the entire Bay volume in a matter of days. Due to pollution, disease and over-harvesting their population are a fraction of their historic levels. Water that was once clear for meters is now so turbid and sediment ridden that a wader may lose sight of their feet before their knees are <b>wet.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> is normally supplied by [...] "Submerged Aquatic Vegetation" [...] (SAV) via photosynthesis but pollution and sediments have reduced the plant population as well. Resulting in a reduction of dissolved oxygen levels rendering areas of the bay unsuitable for aquatic life. In a symbiotic relation the plants provide the oxygen needed for underwater organisms to proliferate, in exchange the filter feeders keep the water clean and thus clear enough for plants to have sufficient access to sunlight. Researchers have proposed that oxygenation through artificial means as a solution to help improve water quality. Aeration of hypoxic water bodies seems an appealing solution and it has been tried successfully many times on freshwater ponds and small lakes. However no one has undertaken an aeration project as large as an estuary.|$|E

To compare changes in lung function after submerged (wet) and non-submerged (dry) oxygen dives. Thirteen healthy male divers (mean ± SD: 25 ± 2 years, 184 ± 7 cm, 85 ± 10 kg) made a dry and a wet dive to 150 kPa for 3 h, during which they breathed 100 % oxygen. At baseline, within 1 and 4 h after their dives, spirometry and diffusing capacity were measured. Data were analysed with ANOVA using Bonferroni correction and paired t-tests.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) are {{a highly}} promising material for future interconnects. It {{is expected that}} the decoration of CNTs with Cu particles or also the filling of the interspaces between the CNTs with Cu instead of the currently used SiO 2 can enhance the performance of CNT-based interconnects. Due to the high aspect ratio of CNTs an appropriate deposition technique has to be applied which is able to coat such structures uniformly. The current work is therefore considered with thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) of CuxO from the liquid Cu (I) β-diketonate precursor [(nBu 3 P) 2 Cu(acac) ] and <b>wet</b> <b>oxygen</b> at 135 °C on variously pretreated multi-walled CNTs. The different in-situ pre-treatments of the CNTs with oxygen, water vapor and <b>wet</b> <b>oxygen</b> in a temperature range from 100 to 300 °C at a pressure of 1. 33 mbar {{have been carried out}} prior to the ALD to enable uniform nucleation on the otherwise chemical inert CNT surface. The reduction of the CuxO as well as the filling of the space between the CNTs is not part of this work. Variations of the oxidation temperature as well as the oxidation agents resulted in different growth modes of the CuxO. An oxidation with <b>wet</b> <b>oxygen</b> at 300 °C yielded in a partially layer like growth of the CuxO. It is expected that this growth mode is connected to a partial destruction of the outer CNT shell due to the oxidation. However, the damage introduced to the CNTs was not high enough to be detected by Raman spectroscopy. For all other investigated pretreatments, the formation of nanoparticles (NPs) was observed by electron microscopy. This formation of CuxO NPs {{can be explained by the}} metal-tube-interaction. Furthermore, the NPs probably decorate defect sites of the CNTs due to their higher reactivity. Additionally, analysis of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements suggests that the used precursor [(nBu 3 P) 2 Cu(acac) ] requires reactive oxygen surface groups for initiating the ALD growth. The observation of layer-like growth of CuxO on CNTs pretreated with <b>wet</b> <b>oxygen</b> at 300 °C appears promising for deposition processes of Cu seed layers on CNTs.

Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of <b>oxygen.</b> <b>Wet</b> soils {{tend to become}} deficient in oxygen (this {{is especially true in}} wetlands), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth. When the rains return and soils become wet, the osmotic gradient between the bacterial cells and the soil water causes the cells to gain water quickly. Under these conditions, many bacterial cells burst, releasing a pulse of nutrients. Decomposition rates also tend to be slower in acidic soils. Soils which are rich in clay minerals tend to have lower decomposition rates, and thus, higher levels of organic matter. The smaller particles of clay result in a larger surface area that can hold water. The higher the water content of a soil, the lower the oxygen content and consequently, the lower the rate of decomposition. Clay minerals also bind particles of organic material to their surface, making them less accessibly to microbes. Soil disturbance like tilling increase decomposition by increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil and by exposing new organic matter to soil microbes.|$|R
40|$|Lithium-air and sodium-air {{batteries}} are promising energy storage systems for future smart grids and electric vehicles {{due to their}} extremely high theoretical energy densities. However, electrode material development and architecture design for cathode {{as well as the}} battery cycleability are big challenges for these batteries. This research aims at developing various novel nanomaterials with desired morphology and structure as cathode materials for lithium-air and sodium-air batteries. For lithium-air batteries, various carbon nanostructured cathodes were developed. They include: (1) Carbon black nanoparticles were treated under ammonia and carbon dioxide/hydrogen atmospheres and the surface area, porosity, defects, nitrogen-doping, and functional groups were modulated. These parameters for battery performance were investigated and {{it was found that the}} surface area of mesopores rather than others played an important role for the discharge capacity due to the passivation effect of discharge products. (2) One-dimensional (1 D) nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) electrode showed 50 % higher of discharge capacity and better electrocatalytic activity for discharge product decomposition than pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs) electrode. (3) Two-dimensional (2 D) graphene nanosheets (GNSs) electrode delivered extremely high discharge capacity compared to porous carbon blacks due to the ideal porosity which increased the electrolyte <b>wetting</b> and <b>oxygen</b> diffusion, improving the efficiency of reactions. (4) Nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (N-GNSs) exhibited 1. 5 times higher of electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction than GNSs, further improved 40 % of the discharge capacity. In addition, the morphology of discharge products was changed due to the defects and functional groups introduced by nitrogen doping. (5) The correlation between discharge product morphology and battery performance for sulphur-doped GNSs was studied and it was found that the discharge product contained structural defects such as oxygen and/or lithium vacancies resulting in different charge performance. In terms of exploring catalysts which have potential for improving battery cycleability, a facile rapid microwave-assisted hydrothermal method was developed and it was shown that the morphology and crystallinity of MnO 2 were easily controlled by adjusting the reaction parameters. For sodium-air battery cathode, it was also found that N-GNSs showed higher electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, resulting in improving discharge and charge performance...|$|R
