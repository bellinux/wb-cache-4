5|$|World {{demand for}} {{palladium}} increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300tons in 2000. The global production of palladium from mines was 222tonnes in 2006 {{according to the}} United States Geological Survey. Many are concerned about {{a steady supply of}} palladium in the wake of Russia's military maneuvers in Ukraine, partly as sanctions could hamper Russian palladium exports; any restrictions on Russian palladium exports would exacerbate <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> expected to be a large palladium deficit in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E
5|$|In {{the prime}} universe, Nina Sharp helps {{to set up}} Massive Dynamic's {{resources}} to track these occurrences, preparing to deploy limited supplies of the amber substance to contain them if needed. Nina advises Olivia to find Sam Weiss, a man that William Bell had trusted and instructed Nina to also listen to. However, Sam has disappeared and cannot be found. Walter and Peter, along with Massive Dynamic staff, debate how to disable the machine, but Peter realizes that he himself is the only option. Walter comes {{to recognize that the}} Observer's efforts from earlier ("The Firefly") were to prepare him to lose Peter. After preparing himself, Peter goes to touch the machine, but is sent flying by an electrical spark, wounding him and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital chapel, Walter tries to find repentance from God for his actions, while Olivia arrives after hearing the news. She steps outside to observe the sunset when Sam Weiss runs up to her and demands to be taken to the machine to stop <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> happening.|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{the notion}} of the Porphyrian tree as an actual diagram comes later than Porphyry himself. Still, {{scholars}} do speak of Porphyry's tree as in the Isagoge and they mean by this only that the idea of dividing genera into species via differentiae is found in the Isagoge. But, of course, Porphyry <b>was</b> only following <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> in Aristotle, and Aristotle <b>was</b> following <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> in his teacher, Plato.|$|R

25|$|Moreover, {{the basis}} is {{associated}} with the primordial or original Buddhahood, also called Samantabhadra, which is said to be beyond time itself and hence Buddhahood is not something to be gained, but an act of recognizing <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> immanent in all sentient beings. Likewise, this view of the basis stems from the Indian Buddha-nature theory. Other terms used to describe the basis include unobstructed (ma 'gags pa), universal (kun khyab) and omnipresent.|$|E
25|$|Ben Goldacre {{has argued}} that {{regulators}} – such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States – advance {{the interests of the}} drug companies rather than the interests of the public due to revolving door exchange of employees between the regulator and the companies and friendships develop between regulator and company employees.

25|$|In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed {{legislation}} eliminating {{six of the}} exceptions to the Act 1 Index.

The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels. Further increases in payroll cannot be used to raise the district’s exception for pension payments.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} high school, Hull went on {{to study}} at Alma Academy. He continued to excel in mathematics, particularly geometry. His interest in geometry inspired him to begin thinking about how the mind can create new connections based on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> known. It was during his time at Alma Academy that he read the works of Baruch Spinoza, who he admired, though ultimately disagreed with. As {{he was about to}} graduate from the academy, he attended a banquet where the food was contaminated, and contracted a near deadly case of typhoid, which delayed his return to college. Many died during that time and Clark himself almost died. He was left with permanent amnesia and a general bad memory for names which affected him throughout the rest of his life. As Clark's health improved, he returned to Alma College, where he studied math, physics, and chemistry, intending to become an engineer. His intent was to qualify for a mining engineering program at another institution.|$|E

500|$|Louis Dupré differentiates between {{signs and}} symbols, proposing that a sign points to {{something}} while a symbol represents it. A symbol holds its own meaning: {{rather than merely}} pointing someone towards another object, it {{takes the place of}} and represents that object. He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign. Dupré believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself. A symbol reveals a reality beyond <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived. Dupré differentiates between religious and aesthetic symbols, suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which [...] "remains forever beyond our reach". He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it.|$|E
500|$|Chapter three {{describes}} {{the concept of}} [...] "regulatory capture," [...] whereby a regulator– such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States– ends up advancing {{the interests of the}} drug companies rather than the interests of the public. Goldacre writes that this happens for a number of reasons, including the revolving door of employees between the regulator and the companies, and the fact that friendships develop between regulator and company employees simply because they have knowledge and interests in common. The chapter also discusses surrogate outcomes and accelerated approval, and the difficulty of having ineffective drugs removed from the market once they have been approved. He argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> available, or even that they be particularly effective.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. He praised the storytelling, positively commenting {{on how it}} revolved around Skinner and his past life. In addition he wrote that the episode possessed some [...] "good scares". However, {{he felt that the}} [...] "central paranormal mystery of the episode is handled in a fashion that feels a bit muddled". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode fails to capitalize on the idea of delving into the world of Walter Skinner. The conspiracy elements seem a bit redundant, and the paranormal side of the episode is a forced and inconsistent mess. Instead of developing something unique about Skinner, the episode dwells on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> known or suggested, leaving the character in the same emotional place at the end as in the beginning." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Avatar" [...] a D+, describing it as [...] "ridiculous" [...] and saying, [...] "The clench-toothed Skinner deserves more air time, but not this USA Network reject".|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics upon release. It {{was referred}} to by GameFan as [...] "quite possibly the greatest game ever made", a quote selected for the back cover of the game's jewel case. GameSpot commented that [...] "never before have technology, playability, and narrative combined {{as well as in}} Final Fantasy VII," [...] expressing particular favor toward the game's graphics, audio, and story. IGN's Jay Boor insisted the game's graphics were [...] "light years beyond anything ever seen on the PlayStation", and regarded its battle system as its strongest point. Computer and Video Gamess Alex C praised the dramatic story and well-developed characters. Edge noted that Final Fantasy VII had come close to being an interactive movie in playable form, praising its combination of a complex story that went against Western graphic adventures trends and [...] "excellently orchestrated chip music". RPGamer praised the game's soundtrack, both in variety and sheer volume, stating that [...] "Uematsu has done his work exceptionally well" [...] and saying that it was potentially his best work. Final Fantasy VII has received some negative criticism. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine (OPM) and GameSpot questioned the game's linear progression. OPM considered the game's translation [...] "a bit muddy" [...] and felt the summon animations were [...] "repetitive." [...] RPGamer cited its translation as [...] "packed with typos and other errors which further obscure <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> a very confusing plot." [...] GamePro also considered the Japanese-to-English translation a significant weakness in the game, and IGN regarded the ability to use only three characters at a time as [...] "the game's only shortcoming." ...|$|E
500|$|Braid {{has been}} {{considered}} a masterpiece, and was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer noted the creative variation on time manipulation {{and the need to}} understand the non-linearity of his actions made him feel as if [...] "years of gaming blinders have been ripped away." [...] Jason Hill of The Age stated the puzzles were [...] "elaborate and formidable", but [...] "impeccably designed and hugely satisfying to solve", a point reiterated by Sunday Herald Suns Paddy Reiley. The connection between the puzzles and the overall presentation of the game was favorably received; Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that Braid was [...] "the rare game that will make you rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging you {{to come to terms with}} its mature tale the next". Sam Roberts, game director for the Slamdance Film Festival Guerrilla Gamemaking Competition, was impressed that Braid did not [...] "feel immature" [...] as it [...] "expects [...] much" [...] of the player as any other form of media and [...] "doesn't short you in any respect". Braids artwork and presentation were given high regards. Nick Suttner of 1UP.com commented that Braids artwork [...] "juxtapose old-school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand-painted environments", while McShea stated that the game's visuals were [...] "eye-catching but never distracting". Wireds Jean Snow wrote that Braids [...] "beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> an impressive and unique vision", and that [...] "the soothing tunes are probably the reason you never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles". Arthouse Games' Jason Rohrer interpreted the ability to rewind time indefinitely as a commentary about traditional platform game design: the fact the player is not forced to restart the level when they die gives greater emphasis to the game's [...] "core challenges".|$|E
