Setting: Team doctors and physiotherapists supporting England football teams recorded players' SCAT 3 baseline tests from August 1, 2013 to July 31, 2014. Participants: A convenience sample of 249 England footballers, of whom 185 were players <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> (male: 119; female: 66) and 64 were players with disability (male learning disability: 17; male cerebral palsy: 28; male blind: 10; female deaf: 9). Assessment and Outcome Measures: Between-group comparisons of median SCAT 3 total and section scores were made using nonparametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon ranked-sum test. Main Results: All footballers with disability scored higher symptom severity scores compared with male players <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Male footballers with learning disability demonstrated {{no significant difference in the}} total number of symptoms, but recorded significantly lower scores on immediate memory and delayed recall compared with male players <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Male blind footballers' scored significantly higher for total concentration and delayed recall, and male footballers with cerebral palsy scored significantly higher on balance testing and immediate memory, when compared with male players <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Female footballers with deafness scored significantly higher for total concentration and balance testing than female footballers <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Conclusions: This study suggests that significant differences exist between SCAT 3 baseline section scores for footballers with and <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Concussion consensus guidelines should recognize these differences and produce guidelines that are specific for the growing number of athletes living with disability...|$|R

Training groups practiced five FMS (run, jump, kick, throw, catch) in weekly 45 -min sessions for 4 weeks. Control groups had their regular physiotherapy (CP) or physical education (TD) sessions. FMS were evaluated using process- and product-oriented measures, and PA was measured using accelerometers, before and after training. Results: It was verified that training groups gained improvements in FMS while control groups did not. No significant changes in weekday PA were found. Increased weekend moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was found in the CP-FMS group, while decreased weekend sedentary time was found in the CP-FMS and TD-FMS groups. The percentages of participants who exceeded the minimum detectable change (MDC) in MVPA and sedentary time were larger in children with CP than in children <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Conclusion: The findings suggest that improved FMS proficiency could potentially contribute to heightened PA and decreased sedentary time during weekends for children.

500|$|Language and {{literacy}} have far reaching effects as they facilitate self-expression and social interaction {{in a variety}} of settings. Furthermore, literacy fosters independence by providing access to educational and vocational opportunities. Children whose disabilities require AAC often experience developmental delays in language skills such as vocabulary knowledge, length of sentences, syntax, and impaired pragmatic skills. These delays may be {{due in part to the}} fact that expressive language is limited by more than the children's own language knowledge. Unlike speaking children, children who use AAC do not always have access to their AAC system, and don't select the content available on the device. These external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities. Most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically developing 7–8 year old. [...] Cognitive, language and learning delays contribute to difficulty with literacy development, but environmental factors also play a role. The most literate AAC users often report having access to abundant reading and writing material at home as well as in school during childhood. Studies have shown that many children who use AAC have literacy experiences that are reduced quality, quantity, and opportunity at home and at school as compared to children <b>without</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Research suggests that with explicit reading instruction, AAC users can develop good literacy skills.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the optimum {{mode of delivery}} of the early preterm fetus in breech presentation. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of two cohorts of preterm breech fetus. SETTING: Two tertiary care centres: at one centre the preferred management for preterm breech presentation was vaginal delivery; at the other centre, the preferred method was caesarean section. POPULATION: All singleton infants delivered after breech presentation from 1984 through 1989, at a gestational age of 26 to 31 weeks. Those with lethal congenital abnormalities, placenta praevia, placental abruption, fetal death or fetal distress {{before the onset of}} labour were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> or handicap documented at two years corrected age. The influence of a number of relevant variables on this outcome was assessed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: There was no difference in survival <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> or handicap between the centres (odds ratio 1. 5, 95 % CI 0. 6 - 3. 9 vaginal delivery compared with caesarean section). Survival <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> or handicap was positively influenced by increasing birthweight and corticosteroids > 24 h before birth, and negatively influenced by footling presentation.

40|$|There {{is a body}} of {{theoretical}} work, and some empirical research, which suggests that non-disabled people assume people with physical disabilities not to be suitable romantic partners, not have sexual drives or desires, or not be sexually active. Access to sexual and reproductive health services for the latter group is a challenge: it has been proposed that people with physical disabilities face barriers to sexual health care access which are structural (such as inaccessible health care provider offices) {{as well as social}} (such as health care providers suggesting that people with physical disabilities should not procreate). The present paper explores non-disabled South Africans’ beliefs concerning the degree to which individuals have sexual and reproductive rights, and benefit from sexual and reproductive healthcare, for people with physical <b>disabilities</b> and people <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> Using a survey, we asked 1, 989 South Africans to estimate the degree to which people with physical <b>disabilities</b> and people <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> have sexual rights, and benefit from sexual and reproductive healthcare services, respectively. Respondents were more likely to support the idea that the population <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> were deserving of sexual rights compared to people with physical disabilities. Respondents {{were also more likely to}} rate the degree to which people with physical disability benefit from sexual and reproductive healthcare as less than that for people <b>without</b> physical <b>disabilities.</b> These findings provide some of the first empirical support that nondisabled people perceive people with physical disabilities as having fewer sexual and reproductive rights, and deriving less benefit from sexual and reproductive health services, than the population <b>without</b> <b>disability.</b> To have diminished sexual rights, and benefit less from sexual and reproductive healthcare, we suggest, evinces a negation of the sexual and reproductive needs and capacity of people with physical disabilities...|$|R

Workers <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> (Neck Disability Index (NDI) score = 9 / 100, n = 52) and 22 controls (women who did not work and without neck pain) participated in this study. Two logistic regression models were constructed to test the association between various measures in (1) workers with and <b>without</b> <b>disability,</b> and (2) workers <b>Without</b> <b>disability</b> and controls. Measures included those {{found to be significantly}} associated with higher NDI in our previous studies: psychosocial domains; individual factors; task demands: quantitative sensory measures and measures of motor function. In the final model, higher score on negative affectivity scale (OR = 4. 47), greater activity in the neck flexors during cranio-cervical flexion (OR = 1. 44), cold hyperalgesia (OR = 1. 27) and longer duration of symptoms (OR = 1. 19) remained significantly associated with neck pain in workers. Workers <b>without</b> <b>disability</b> and controls could only be differentiated by greater muscle activity in the cervical flexors and extensors during a typing task. No psychosocial domains remained in either regression model. These results suggest that impairments in the sensory and motor system should be considered in any assessment of the office worker with neck pain and may have stronger influences on the presenting symptoms than workplace and psychosocial features.
