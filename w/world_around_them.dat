5|$|Although the Egyptians {{believed}} their gods {{to be present}} in the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances. In literature, gods may appear to humans in a physical form, but in real life the Egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication.|$|E

The song {{was performed on the}} HIStory World Tour in 1996–1997. It was covered a few times by other artists.|$|E
5|$|Legend of Mana, {{originally}} {{released in}} Japan as Seiken Densetsu: Legend of Mana, is a 1999 action role-playing game developed {{and published by}} Square (now Square Enix) for the PlayStation. It is the fourth game in the Mana series, following 1995's Seiken Densetsu 3. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows an unnamed hero as they restore the land of Fa'Diel by creating the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> and completing a number of interrelated quests in order to restore the Tree of Mana.|$|E
40|$|In {{their second}} {{collaborative}} sequence, Daniel Y Harris and Rupert M Loydell explore the temporality of place, the haunted landscapes and unknown <b>worlds</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> and within them, in melancholic and magical prose poems. Bracing the electric storms of memory to resurrect the impossible, these texts draw on surrealism and magic realism {{to chart the}} dysfunctions and diversions that make us human, the languages we hardly dare to speak...|$|R
40|$|The Permaculture Design Course is a three-credit {{course that}} offers {{students}} a foundation in permaculture history, ethics, principles, design process, and practical applications. The framework behind {{the theory and}} practice of permaculture is rooted in the observation of natural systems. By observing key ecological relationships, we can mimic and apply these beneficial relationships in the design of systems that serve humans while helping to restore the natural world. This course trains students as critical thinkers, observers, and analysts of the <b>world(s)</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> and then goes on to provide students with the tools needed to design for inspired and positive change...|$|R
40|$|Drawing {{primarily}} on the theoretical works of Sara Ahmed and Robin Bernstein, this paper explores how children’s complicity and victimhood in the wars within Caryl Churchill’s Far Away and Bertolt Brecht’s Mother Courage and Her Children become symbolic of humanity’s demise. The essay uses Far Away and Mother Courage as case studies to examine broader social scripts on childhood. The paper argues that the children in each play are characterized by social expectations that children {{are meant to be}} ignorant to the <b>worlds</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> as well as embodiments of the hope that the future will be better than the present. Finally, this paper argues that social scripts of childhood ignorance and innocence place unrealistic expectations onto children that ultimately limit their agential choices...|$|R
5|$|The trio {{explored}} the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> experiencing a second childhood with no wives, jobs, or responsibilities. They passed {{the time by}} speculating about their fellow townspeople and testing inventions. Regular subplots {{in the first decade}} of the show included: Sid and Ivy bickering over the management of the café, Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge having a secret love affair that everyone knows about, Wally trying to get away from Nora's watchful eye, Foggy's exaggerated war stories, and Compo's schemes to win the affections of Nora Batty.|$|E
5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E
5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E
5000|$|The Guardians of the Universe are one {{of several}} races that {{originated}} on the planet Maltus and {{were among the first}} intelligent life forms in the universe. At this time they were short greyish blue humanoids with black hair. They became scientists and thinkers, experimenting on the <b>worlds</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> In a pivotal moment billions of years ago, a Maltusian named Krona used time-bending technology to observe the beginning of the universe. However, this experiment unleashed disaster upon all existence. Originally, the experiment splintered the universe into the multiverse and created the evil anti-matter universe. Following the retroactive destruction of the Multiverse, it was revealed that Krona flooded the beginning of the universe with entropy causing it [...] "to be born old".|$|R

5000|$|The Guardians evolved on {{the planet}} Maltus, and {{were among the first}} {{intelligent}} life forms in the universe. At this time they were tall greyish blue humanoids with black hair, who roughly resembled humans except for their skin color. They became scientists and thinkers, experimenting on the <b>worlds</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> One experiment {{led to the creation of}} a new species, the Psions. In a pivotal moment, billions of years ago, a Maltusian named Krona used time-bending technology to observe the beginning of the Universe. However, this experiment, and later attempts to stop it, unleashed disaster upon all existence.

50|$|The novel {{extensively}} references Platonic idealism, {{the philosophical}} concept that postulates the independent existence of Ideas. According to Plato, {{the realm of}} Ideas is the only true reality; our world {{is made up of}} imperfect, ephemeral imitations of the true ideas. The epilogue penned by Philotextus references Plato's allegory of the cave when states that he believes philosophers are the ones inside the cave, oblivious to the real (that is, material) <b>world</b> all <b>around</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{game has}} three {{different}} modes. The main story mode, {{during which the}} plot progresses. The player finds the Diary of Faces and allows Maya to escape from it. In this mode, the player must use the 3DS cameras, serving as the Camera Obscura, to find hints within the diary and battle ghosts in the real <b>world</b> environment <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> In Haunted Visions, the player completes three challenges. In Cursed Pages, the player plays four minigames.|$|R
50|$|A man {{convicted of}} murder, Adam Grant (Weaver), tries to {{convince}} those about to execute {{him that the}} <b>world</b> all <b>around</b> <b>them</b> is just his recurring nightmare.

He claims that the district attorney and lawyers are all people he has known in his past, selected by his subconscious to play roles in his dream.|$|R
25|$|A prayer {{group is}} a group of people that meet to pray together. These groups, formed mostly within Christian congregations but {{occasionally}} among Muslim groups as well, gather outside of the congregation's regular worship service to pray for perceived needs, sometimes within the congregation, sometimes within their religious group at large. However, these groups often pray also for the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> including people who do not share their beliefs.|$|E
25|$|A few sociologists {{studying}} TCKs, however, {{argue that}} the commonality found in international TCKs is {{not the result of}} true commonality, but rather the researcher's bias projecting expectations upon the studied subculture. They believe that some of the superficial attributes may mirror each other, but that TCKs from different countries are really different from one another. The exteriors may be the same, but that the understanding of the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> differs.|$|E
25|$|The {{new style}} in English poetry during the 17th century {{was that of}} the metaphysical movement. The metaphysical poets were John Donne, George Herbert, Andrew Marvell and others. Metaphysical poetry is characterised by a spirit of {{intellectual}} investigation of the spiritual, rather than the mystical reverence of many earlier English poems. The metaphysical poets were clearly trying to understand the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> and the spirit behind it, instead of accepting dogma on the basis of faith.|$|E
50|$|Learning in {{cognitive}} psychology and neuroscience {{has focused on}} how individual humans and other species have evolved to extract useful information from the natural and social <b>worlds</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> By contrast, education, and especially modern formal education, focuses on descriptions and explanations {{of the world that}} learners cannot be expected to acquire by themselves. In this way, learning in the scientific sense, and learning in the educational sense can be seen as complementary concepts. This creates a new challenge for cognitive neuroscience to adapt to the real world practical requirements of educational learning. Conversely, neuroscience creates a new challenge for education, because it provides new characterizations of {{the current state of the}} learner - including brain state, genetic state, and hormonal state - that could be relevant to learning and teaching. By providing new measures of the effects of learning and teaching, including brain structure and activity, it is possible to discriminate different types of learning method and attainment. For example, neuroscience research can already distinguish learning by rote from learning through conceptual understanding in mathematics.|$|R
50|$|Love (as in many {{works of}} literature) is {{presented}} here {{as one of}} the highest human aspirations, something that can energize a spirit and set it free. Morath lives for many years in a twilight world of secrets and danger, and seems to take solace in a series of easy women who ask no questions about the things that matter to him. By forging a relationship with someone who demands to know what is truly important to him (Mary Day), he finds his soul mate even as their physical <b>world</b> crumbles <b>around</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{model the}} {{endogenous}} emergence of social perceptions about occupations {{and their impact}} on occupational choice. In particular, an individual’s social approval increases with his community’s perception of his skill in his chosen career. These perceptions vary across communities because individuals better assess the skill of those in occupations similar to their own. Such imperfect assessment can distort choices away from comparative advantage. When skill distributions differ across occupations and/or correlate positively, the community perceives one occupation more favorably. This favored sector experiences overcrowding, but misallocation occurs across both sectors. Furthermore, a positive skill correlation can produce multiple steady states. Like children on the merry-go-round who look up to see if anyone is watching, youth who are attaining an education look around to see if their work is being appreciated by the adult and teenage <b>worlds</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> The absence of a favorable response takes away the fun. (Akerlof 1997) The first part of our title is inspired by an interesting book by Robert Frank (1985) that deals with the issue of how social status concerns affect decision making in different walks of life.

25|$|Applications {{range from}} {{tasks such as}} {{industrial}} machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications.|$|E
25|$|Suggested by Leon Festinger, {{cognitive}} dissonance occurs {{when an individual}} experiences some degree of discomfort resulting from an inconsistency between two cognitions: {{their views on the}} <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> and their own personal feelings and actions. For example, a consumer may seek to reassure themselves regarding a purchase, feeling that another decision may have been preferable. Their feeling that another purchase would have been preferable is inconsistent with their action of purchasing the item. The difference between their feelings and beliefs causes dissonance, so they seek to reassure themselves.|$|E
25|$|For Marx and Engels, then, {{the ruling}} classes control the {{subordinate}} classes through {{domination of the}} ideas available in the culture. In this way the subordinate classes {{are said to be}} mediated by the effects of ideology, or “false consciousness” or a belief system that doesn’t allow them to see the oppression they are enduring for what it is. The problem with this idea, as many Marxists have noted, is that it doesn’t leave room for members of the subordinate classes to act on the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> through alternate forms of mediation.|$|E
5000|$|The novel epitomizes many of Dick's themes {{with its}} {{concerns}} {{about the nature of}} reality and ordinary people in ordinary lives having the <b>world</b> unravel <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> The title is a reference to the line uttered by Hamlet to Horatio after being visited by his father's ghost and learning that his uncle Claudius murdered his father; in short, a shocking supernatural event that fundamentally alters the way Hamlet perceives the state and the universe ("The time is out of joint; O cursed spite!/That ever I was born to set it right!" [...] I.V.211-2), much as do several events in the novel.|$|R
50|$|Groulx's {{films are}} {{the work of}} a worried man perpetually {{questioning}} life and the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> him.
