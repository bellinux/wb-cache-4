5|$|The series {{takes place}} in a {{neighborhood}} inhabited by hand puppets with human qualities, and is shown from the perspective of Oobi. The puppets frequently communicate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and encourage participatory viewing. The characters' dialogue is made up of basic vocabulary and they speak in simple sentences. The show is intended to help preschool-aged viewers build skills such as mathematics, early literacy, and logical thinking.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets {{observed}} that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than {{at the start of the}} race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows like The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was even reflected in her fashion choices, wearing more informal clothes in place of her previous designer pieces. The View appearance was partly intended to help soften her public image, and it was widely covered in the press.|$|E
5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert {{acted as}} stage {{director}} {{for his own}} plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier, to complete. Pinafore opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique.|$|E
50|$|The show aired from 9:30pm to 11:00pm every weeknight, {{sometimes}} including Saturdays. The show included singing, dancing, short dramas {{and variety}} show games that interacted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences.</b>|$|R

5|$|McCormack is {{involved}} in many Los Angeles and Canadian-based charitable organizations including Project Angel Food. The Wellness Community West Los Angeles Tribute to the Human Spirit Awards dinner presented an award to McCormack for his breast cancer awareness advocacy. He shared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> how his comedy helped his mother, Doris McCormack, endure her breast cancer treatments. Doris was honored at the Lifetime's Breast Cancer Heroes Luncheon in 2004. He serves as an honorary {{board member of the}} Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) and was given the MMRF Spirit of Hope Award in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, customs {{agents at}} Toronto International Airport {{detained}} Hendrix after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.|$|E
5|$|The group held a {{press conference}} on 13 January 1971, {{explaining}} that they would be giving a series of concerts at the Young Vic theatre, where they would develop the fictional elements of the proposed film along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> After Keith Moon had completed his work on the film 200 Motels, the group performed their first Young Vic concert on 15 February. The show included a new quadrophonic public address system which cost Â£30,000 and the audience was mainly invited from various organisations such as youth clubs, with only a few tickets on sale to the general public.|$|E

50|$|From October 1980 until March 1981 {{the band}} {{prepared}} new material inspired by Joy Division, The Stranglers, The Cure and Magazine. The band changed the style to post-punk and dark wave, presenting a different sound and image, which mostly failed to connect <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> <b>the</b> way their debut did. The album Strah od monotonije (Fear of Monotony), released in May 1981, {{was sold in}} about 8,000 copies.|$|R

5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E
5|$|Grimaldi and Dubois {{appeared}} {{together again}} later that spring at Sadler's Wells in Dibdin's Harlequin Alchemist, which {{set up a}} mock duel between the two Clowns, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> deciding who could pull the most hideous face. Grimaldi consistently won. In the next piece, Harlequin Benedick; or, The Ghost of Mother Shipton. Dubois was relegated {{to the role of}} Pierrot, while Grimaldi played Clown. Grimaldi's mother was in the cast, appearing as the Butcher's Wife. He then appeared in another Dibdin play, The Great Devil. During the run, he accidentally injured himself on stage by shooting himself in the foot and was confined to bed for five weeks. His mother became so concerned at her son's fragile and still grief-stricken state that she employed a dancer at Drury Lane, Mary Bristow, to care for him full-time during those weeks. They formed a close friendship, which resulted in a loving relationship, and they married on 24 December 1801.|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} Russell Square, London, with a read through. After {{a week of}} rehearsing, Welles left to secure further funding and Edwards {{directed}} the play, working on blocking and lighting. Welles returned {{two days before the}} premiere and the cast had their first dress rehearsal, which lasted until 3 a.m. After premiering at the Grand Opera House in Belfast on February 13, 1960, and receiving a good review from a Variety correspondent, the play closed after five performances because of low attendances. It moved to the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, where it fared no better. By {{the end of the second}} week, Welles had resorted to reading portions of the works of Irish author J. M. Synge, and from Riders to the Sea, to attract an audience. Eventually the play simply became a version of An Evening with Orson Welles, which would often include a question and answer section <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and Welles's solo performance of Moby DickâRehearsed or the works of Isak Dinesen.|$|E

5|$|Steve, the host, {{presents}} {{the audience with}} a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog... To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked {{with one of her}} paw prints. In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of games â mini-puzzles â <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> that are thematically related to the overall puzzle... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, {{at the end of the}} story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down in a comfortable chair to think â a chair known, of course, in the literal world of Blue's Clues, as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to come up with the answer.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} {{four members of}} the nobility was {{sufficiently}} important to ensure that the event was recorded in contemporary chronicles, most notably by Froissart and the Monk of St Denis, and subsequently illustrated in a number of copies of illuminated manuscripts. While the two main chroniclers agree on essential points of the eveningâthe dancers were dressed as wild men, the King survived, one man fell into a vat, and four of the dancers diedâthere are discrepancies in the details. Froissart wrote that the dancers were chained together, which is not mentioned in the monk's account. Furthermore, the two chroniclers are at odds regarding the purpose of the dance. According to the historian Susan Crane, the monk describes the event as a wild charivari <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> participating in the dance, whereas Froissart's description suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation.|$|E
5|$|Wall, {{along with}} Tommy Tallarico, has {{produced}} the Video Games Live concert series, which began on July 6, 2005. The two had been planning the concert series, which presents orchestrated versions of music from dozens of games, for three years. The concerts consist of segments of video game music performed by a live orchestra with video footage and synchronized lighting and effects, {{as well as several}} interactive segments <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> conducted by Wall. Video Games Live was intended to take the idea of a symphonic video game music concert, which was popular in Japan, and combine it with a rock concert to make it appealing to western fans. The series is international and ongoing, with more than 70 shows planned for 2009. Although Wall composed the soundtracks to three games released in 2005 including the award-winning score to Jade Empire, his works released since then have been 2007's Mass Effect and 2010's Mass Effect 2. Mass Effects score earned Wall several awards and nominations, as did Mass Effect 2.|$|E

50|$|The International Year of Canadian Music in 1986 {{was another}} celebration that induced new operas. IstvÃ¡n Anhaltâs work Winthrop was {{composed}} in this context. In this opera, as before in La Tourangelle, Anhalt plays <b>with</b> <b>the</b> notion {{of time and}} combines the historical time represented in <b>the</b> story <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audienceâs</b> contemporary time.|$|R
25|$|The Happy Days Live {{tour was}} Oliver's first live show in 2001 and {{included}} several dates in the UK and Australasia. Performing to sold-out venues, he cooked {{on stage and}} interacted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> <b>with</b> competitions, music and special effects only usually seen in pop concerts. He took <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> by surprise by singing and drumming to a song called Lamb Curry written by his longtime friend Leigh Haggerwood.|$|R
5|$|Todd was {{initially}} a short-term villain, but his popularity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison, like most soap operas {{had done with}} rapists in the past. While keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion. They took steps to redeem him and made him {{an integral part of}} OLTL canvas, despite Howarth's objections to a redemption storyline. With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc, the writers borrowed from nineteenth-century melodrama and Gothic traditions, and literature such as Frankenstein. Todd became the product of an affair between his father, Victor Lord, and his mother, Irene Manning, which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters, including his sisters, Tina and Victoria Lord. An important aspect of the character became his appearance, most notably the scar on his right cheek, which emerged as synonymous with him and served to remind him of his past misdeeds against Marty. Music and the use of humor were also key to Todd's development. Although he formed many relationships (including with his wives, Blair Cramer and TÃ©a Delgado), and fathered children, a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} the {{television}} appearance, on 11 February 1964, the Beatles' first U.S. concert took place, at Washington Coliseum, a sports arena in Washington, D.C. The concert was attended by eight thousand fans. The Beatles performed on a central stage in the arena, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> on all sides, and there were regular pauses to enable the band to turn their equipment around and perform facing in another direction. The concert generated intense excitement. The following day, the Beatles performed a second concert, in Carnegie Hall, New York, which was attended by two thousand fans. The concert was again well received. Following the Carnegie Hall concert, the Beatles flew to Miami Beach and on Sunday 16 February 1964 made their second television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, which this time was broadcast live from the Napoleon Ballroom of the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach. As it had done on 9 February, the television broadcast attracted around 70million viewers. On 22 February 1964, the Beatles returned to the UK. Arriving at Heathrow airport at 7 am, they were met by an estimated ten thousand fans.|$|E
5|$|When {{the release}} of Homogenic was delayed by a month, its tour began <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> not being {{familiar}} with the album's songs since {{it had not been}} released yet. The tour started at the beginning of September with a backing band that consisted only of Mark Bell and made stops in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Spain, and England. These shows were brief live shows lasting about half an hour consisting of only new material. Another tour took place in late October and lasted less than four weeks. Stops on this tour included Italy, Switzerland, France, England, Scotland, Germany, Ireland, and Denmark. In late November, BjÃ¶rk was diagnosed with a kidney infection and while she was still healthy she was advised to take a three-week rest and was forced to cancel her American tour. In 1998, a North American tour with Radiohead was announced but canceled later due to difficulty of changing the stage between performances of the acts. BjÃ¶rk had another tour in the middle of 1998 through Europe, and outside of the continent through other countries, including Chile, Brazil and Argentina. Opening acts for portions of the tour included electronic musician Âµ-Ziq.|$|E
