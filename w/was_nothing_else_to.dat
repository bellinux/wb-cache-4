They were both taken ill there, and two months of work were lost. By mid-April 1892 the scoring of the first act was complete and by June–July Verdi was considering potential singers for roles in Falstaff. For the title role he wanted Victor Maurel, the baritone who had sung Iago in Otello, but at first the singer sought contractual terms that Verdi found unacceptable: [...] "His demands were so outrageous, exorbitant, [...] incredible that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do but stop the entire project". Eventually they reached agreement and Maurel was cast.|$|E
500|$|David Leitch {{directed}} a scene featuring Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in December 2016, which {{was believed to}} be intended as a post-credits scene for the 2017 film Logan. This was meant to tease the film Deadpool 2, which Leitch had been hired to direct a month earlier. However, this report was denied by Reynolds, Logan director James Mangold, and star Hugh Jackman. After Logans runtime was extended by three minutes shortly before its release, there was new speculation that a post-credits scene had been added to tease an upcoming X-Men film, but Mangold denied this again, saying that he wanted to [...] "make a movie that begun and ended on its own terms. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say, because we had said it." [...] Instead, a Deadpool scene was shown as a teaser for Deadpool 2 before Logan, confirmed to be the scene directed by Leitch in December 2016. It was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers of the Deadpool films.|$|E
