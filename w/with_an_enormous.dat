5|$|Other uses of organobromine {{compounds}} include high-density drilling fluids, dyes (such as Tyrian {{purple and}} the indicator bromothymol blue), and pharmaceuticals. Bromine itself, {{as well as}} some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> number of applications (e.g. silver bromide for photography). Zinc–bromine batteries are hybrid flow batteries used for stationary electrical power backup and storage; from household scale to industrial scale.|$|E
5|$|In Puranic literature, Sharabha is {{associated}} with god Shiva, who incarnates to subdue fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting Narasimha - the man-lion form of Vishnu - brings to fore the overt rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu (Vaishnavite sect) and those of Shiva (Shaivite sect), which exposes the fierce debate aspect. According to Roy, the Narasimha-Sharabha encounter may be a Shiava version of Vedic tale of Vishnu piercing the boar. Shiva Purana describes Sharabha as thousand-armed, lion-faced and with matted hair, wings and eight feet. Sharabha Upanishad portrays Sharabha with two heads, two wings, eight legs of the lion with sharp claws and a long tail. Kalika Purana describes Sharabha as black in colour, with four feet downwards and four feet uplifted, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> body. It also has a long face and nose, nails, eight legs, eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. It jumps high repeatedly making a loud cry.|$|E

25|$|Mangammal had {{frequent}} troubles {{from the}} time of her regency with Maratha King Shaji of Thanjavur. In the following year the Madurai forces under Dalavoy Narasappiah crushingly defeated the Tanjore Marathas near their capital, when they suddenly stormed into their capital. The disheartened King Shaji of Tanjore was only glad enough to buy off the invading army <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> bribe, after almost emptying his treasury.|$|E
25|$|The 16th-century Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent {{commissioned}} Venetian craftsmen {{to make a}} 4-tiered tiara {{modeled on}} the papal design, to demonstrate that his power and authority exceeded that of the Pope. This was a most atypical piece of headgear for an Ottoman sultan, which he probably never normally wore, but which he placed beside him when receiving visitors, especially ambassadors.

25|$|The {{competition}} {{winner was}} the Philadelphia-based architectural firm of Mitchell/Giurgola, with the on-site work {{directed by the}} Italian-born architect Romaldo Giurgola, with a design which involved burying most of the building under Capital Hill, and capping the edifice <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> spire topped by a large Australian flag. The façades, however, included deliberate imitation {{of some of the}} patterns of the Old Parliament House, so that there is a slight resemblance despite the massive difference of scale.|$|E

25|$|Thor was {{the most}} {{powerful}} god and ruled over thunder and lightning, wind and rain, sunshine and crops. He sat in the centre with a hammer (Mjolnir) in his hand, and on each side were Odin, the god of war, in full armour and Frey, the god of peace and love, attributed <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> erect phallus.

25|$|Priapus' iconic {{attribute}} was his priapism (permanently erect penis); {{he probably}} absorbed some pre-existing ithyphallic deities as his cult developed. He was represented {{in a variety}} of ways, most commonly as a misshapen gnome-like figure <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> erect phallus. Statues of Priapus were common in ancient Greece and Rome, standing in gardens or at doorways and crossroads. To propitiate Priapus, the traveler would stroke the statue's penis as he passed by. The Athenians often conflated Priapus with Hermes, the god of boundaries, and depicted a hybrid deity with a winged helmet, sandals, and huge erection.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} truly Renaissance {{images in}} Florence {{date from the}} first year of the century known in Italian as Quattrocento, synonymous with the Early Renaissance. At that date a competition was held to find an artist to create a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistry of St. John, the oldest remaining church in the city. The Baptistry is a large octagonal building in the Romanesque style, whose origins had been forgotten and which was popularly believed to date from Roman times. The interior of its dome is decorated <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> mosaic figure of Christ in Majesty thought to have been designed by Coppo di Marcovaldo. It has three large portals, the central one being filled at that time by a set of doors created by Andrea Pisano eighty years earlier.|$|E
25|$|As Otto was finalizing {{actions to}} {{suppress}} his brother's rebellion in 939, the Slavs on the Elbe River revolted against German rule. Having been subdued by Otto's father in 928, the Slavs saw Henry's rebellion {{as an opportunity}} to regain their independence. Otto's lieutenant in east Saxony, Count Gero of Merseburg, was charged with the subjugation of the pagan Polabian Slavs. According to Widukind, Gero invited about thirty Slavic chieftains to a banquet; after the feast his soldiers attacked and massacred the unsuspecting drunken guests. The Slavs demanded revenge and marched against Gero <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> army. Otto agreed to a brief truce with his rebellious brother Henry and moved to support Gero. After fierce fighting, their combined forces were able to repel the advancing Slavs; Otto then returned west to subdue his brother's rebellion.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, perhaps, Sambhuvarman's reign was {{marred by}} one of the most devastating invasions ever {{suffered}} by the country of Champa. In 605 AD, the Chinese general Liu Fang led an army southwards from the area of what is now northern Vietnam, defeated the elephant-riders of Sambhuvarman, and sacked the Cham capital, making off <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> booty that included over one thousand Buddhist books as well as the gold tablets commemorating the reigns of the previous eighteen kings. Heading back north with their heist, the Chinese invaders were struck by an epidemic that felled a large number of them, including Liu Fang. Sambhuvarman, for his part, returned home to his kingdom, began the process of rebuilding, and made sure to send regular shipments of tribute to the Chinese court, in order through appeasement to prevent a recurrence of the recent disaster.|$|E

25|$|McGovern ran on a {{platform}} of immediately ending the Vietnam War and instituting guaranteed minimum incomes for the nation’s poor. His campaign was harmed by his views during the primaries (which alienated many powerful Democrats), the perception that his foreign policy was too extreme, and the Eagleton debacle. With McGovern’s campaign weakened by these factors, the Republicans successfully portrayed him as a radical left-wing extremist incompetent to serve as president. Nixon led in the polls by large margins throughout the entire campaign. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> fundraising advantage and a comfortable lead in the polls, Nixon concentrated on large rallies and focused speeches to closed, select audiences, leaving much of the retail campaigning to surrogates like Vice President Agnew. Nixon did not, by design, try to extend his coattails to Republican congressional or gubernatorial candidates, preferring to pad his own margin of victory.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{years would}} pass {{before they would}} first lift the Currie Cup in 1946, when they {{defeated}} the Western Province 11-9 at home at Loftus Versfeld thanks to two dropped goals (one off his left foot) by Springbok flyhalf Hansie Brewis; the score was 8-9 to Province (a drop goal counted 4 points in those days). With time running out Brewis, the first true Northerns legend, received the ball in his own twenty-two. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> kick, {{he tried to get}} the ball rolling out in the north-eastern corner, but the ball kept rolling and the Western Province full-back, Con de Kock, carelessly waited for it to roll out. When the ball jumped back in field, De Kock noticed Johnny Lourens storming down at full pace and, realising the danger, kicked hastily at the ball but missed it completely. Lourens scooped it up to score the winning try.|$|E
25|$|In 1977 the government, {{although}} reasonably unpopular, {{felt sure}} {{of an election}} victory and June date for the poll was fixed. The National Coalition's spirits had been buoyed up {{by the actions of}} the Minister for Local Government, James Tully. In {{what became known as the}} Tullymander (a pun on the word gerrymander) he re-drew every constituency in Ireland (as he had authority to do), apparently favouring Fine Gael and Labour Party candidates. However, when the election took place the coalition was swept out of office by Fianna Fáil which won an unprecedented twenty seat Dáil majority and over 50% of the first preference votes. Lynch himself received the biggest personal vote in the state. Although the large parliamentary majority seemed to restore Lynch as an electoral asset, the fact that the party was returned <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> vote allowed Lynch to be undermined by many new TDs who were not loyal to Lynch and wanted him removed.|$|E

25|$|In Tutrakan the {{citizens}} allowed the Turks {{to install a}} small garrison but then they killed the Turkish soldiers and prepared for siege. Ali Pasha immediately burned the surrounding fields and soon the starving town had to surrender. After this success they advanced to the west towards Nicopolis, {{one of the strongest}} Bulgarian fortresses along the Danube. The defence was organized by Ivan Shishman who was currently in the town. Although the Ottomans had nearly 30,000 men they could not take it and Ali Pasha had to seek reinforcements from Murad himself. According to Seadeddin the Sultan marched to Nikopol <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> army firmly decided to seize the town at all costs. When Ivan Shishman faced the new enemy he sought a truce. Murad agreed and the Bulgarians saved Nikopol but were forced to cede another key Danubian fortress, Dorostolon. However, when Ali Pasha reached Silistra, the Bulgarians refused to surrender the town. Murad besieged Nikopol for a second time and this time Ivan Shishman agreed to the Ottoman conditions and a Turkish garrison was installed in Silistra.|$|E
25|$|Only one {{remaining}} ruler, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (the Qutbshahi {{ruler of}} Golconda), refused to surrender. He and his servicemen fortified themselves at Golconda and fiercely protected the Kollur Mine, {{which was then}} probably the world's most productive diamond mine, and an important economic asset. In 1687, Aurangzeb led his grand Mughal army against the Deccan Qutbshahi fortress during the Siege of Golconda. The Qutbshahis had constructed massive fortifications throughout successive generations on a granite hill over 400ft high <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> eight-mile long wall enclosing the city. The main gates of Golconda {{had the ability to}} repulse any war elephant attack. Although the Qutbshahis maintained the impregnability of their walls, at night Aurangzeb and his infantry erected complex scaffolding that allowed them to scale the high walls. During the eight-month siege the Mughals faced many hardships including the death of their experienced commander Kilich Khan Bahadur. Eventually, Aurangzeb and his forces managed to penetrate the walls by capturing a gate, and their entry into the fort led Abul Hasan Qutb Shah to surrender peacefully.|$|E
25|$|Cameron's {{choice of}} cinematographer {{on the movie}} was Mikael Salomon – a US-based Danish {{national}} who {{would go on to}} work on other blockbusters such as Backdraft and Arachnophobia before moving into the director's slot on a myriad of films and TV shows including two editions of the acclaimed HBO WW2 series Band of Brothers. Salomon used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed. Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had {{to figure out how to}} keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> tarpaulin. Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.|$|E
