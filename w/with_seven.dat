40|$|Background: In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} whether thymosin β (Tβ) in saliva and in minor salivary glands is differentially expressed {{in patients with}} primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and patients with autoimmune diseases (systemic sclerosis [SSc], systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], and rheumatoid arthritis [RA], with and without sicca syndrome [ss]). Methods: Saliva specimens of nine patients <b>with</b> pSS, <b>seven</b> <b>with</b> ss/SSc, <b>seven</b> <b>with</b> ss/SLE, <b>seven</b> <b>with</b> ss/RA, <b>seven</b> <b>with</b> SSc, <b>seven</b> <b>with</b> SLE, and <b>seven</b> <b>with</b> RA, as well as ten healthy subjects, were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source to investigate the presence and levels of Tβ 4, Tβ 4 sulfoxide, and Tβ 10. Immunostaining for Tβ 4 and Tβ 10 was performed on minor salivary glands of patients with pSS and ss. Results: Tβ 4 levels were statistically higher in patients with pSS {{with respect to the}} other subgroups. Tβ 10 was detectable in 66. 7 % of patients with pSS and in 42. 8 % of those with ss/SSc, while Tβ 4 sulfoxide was detectable in 44. 4 % of patients with pSS and in 42. 9 % of those with ss/SSc. Tβ 10 and Tβ 4 sulfoxide were not detectable in patients without associated ss and in healthy control subjects. Regarding thymosin immunostaining, all patients had immunoreactivity for Tβ 10, and a comparable distribution pattern in the four different subgroups of patients was observed. Tβ 4 immunoreactivity was present in patients with ss/SSc and those with ss/SLE, while it was completely absent in patients with pSS and those with ss/RA. Conclusions: Our data show that higher salivary Tβ expression characterizes patients with pSS, while Tβ 4 sulfoxide and Tβ 10 salivary expression was selectively present in patients with sicca symptoms. Moreover, at the immunohistochemical level in patients with pSS, minor salivary glands showed a peculiar pattern characterized by immunostaining for Tβ 10 in acinar cells {{in the absence of any}} reactivity for Tβ 4. These findings, taken together, suggest a different role for Tβ 4 and Tβ 10 in patients with pSS who have ss and other autoimmune disease...|$|R
