5|$|<b>Workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> older {{typically}} start satellite nests {{and have}} more developed ovaries. Younger and lesser-developed workers join the satellite after its establishment. The distribution of workers between the main nest and satellite is very important because they are needed {{for the establishment of}} the satellite and for the continued running of the main nest. Although, after several months the main nest can become abandoned. If not enough workers follow the initial worker to the new nest, then it will most likely fail as a satellite.|$|E
