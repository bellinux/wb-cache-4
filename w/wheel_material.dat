40|$|The {{investigations}} {{were aimed}} at determining the causal relation between {{the size of a}} formed crack and the amount of acoustic energy emitted during its formation, as well as between the size of the crack and the residual strength of a ceramic-bonded grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>material,</b> i. e. its time to failure under constant load conditions. With regard to the correlation between crack size and acoustic emission the area of the crack was shown to be proportional to the amount of acoustic energy emitted during its formation. The laws of linear-elastic fracture mechanics apply to the subject grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>material.</b> The relationship between acoustic emission and the residual strength, or time to failure, of bend test bars was derived {{on the basis of the}} determined proportionality constants and material parameters. The derived formulae indicate the residual strength level or time to failure to be anticipated, when a certain amount of acoustic energy is emitted during overspeed testing. Experiments i nvolving artificially induced cracks were conducted as a means of verifying the correctness of the theoretically determined correlation. These results demonstrate conclusively that AEA enables the reliable detection of strength-reducing crack formation and hence, that is suitable for use in the testing of grinding wheels. Combining AEA with a proof test yields a new concept for the testing of grinding wheels. The results were obtained on a particular type of grinding wheel that satisfied all preconditions with regard to characterization via unequivocal material constants...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop more durable <b>wheel</b> <b>materials</b> {{to cope with the}} new {{specifications}} being imposed on wheel wear, a greater understanding is needed of the wear mechanisms and transitions occurring in wheel steels, particularly at higher load and slip conditions. In this work wear assessment of <b>wheel</b> <b>materials</b> is discussed as well as wear rates, regimes and transitions. Twin disc wear testing, used extensively for studying wear of <b>wheel</b> and rail <b>materials,</b> has indicated that three wear regimes exist for wheel materials; mild, severe and catastrophic. These have been classified in terms of wear rate and features. Wear rates are seen to increase steadily initially, then level off, before increasingly rapidly as the severity of the contact conditions is increased. Analysis of the contact conditions in terms of friction and slip has indicated that the levelling off of the wear rate observed at the first wear transition is caused by the change from partial slip to full slip conditions at the disc interface. Temperature calculations for the contact showed that the large increase in wear rates seen at the second wear transition may result from a thermally induced reduction in yield strength and other material properties. Wear maps have been produced using the test results to study how individual contact parameters such as load and sliding speed influence wear rates and transitions. The maps are also correlated to expected wheel/rail contact conditions. This improved understanding of wheel wear mechanisms and transitions and will help in the aim of eventually attaining a wear modelling methodology reliant on material properties rather than wear constants derived from testing...|$|R
