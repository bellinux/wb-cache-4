5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory {{in the electoral college}} was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.|$|E
5|$|Halloween is an American horror {{franchise}} {{that consists of}} ten films, novels, comic books, merchandise, and a video game.

Fifteen years later, he escapes to stalk and kill the people of Haddonfield, Illinois while being chased by his former psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis. Michael's killings occur on the holiday of Halloween, on <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the films primarily take place.|$|E

5|$|In early 1975 Merlyn Rees set up {{elections}} for the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention at <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Northern Ireland's politicians would plan their way forward. These were held on 1 May 1975 and the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC), which had won 11 out of 12 Northern Irish seats in the February 1974 general election, won a majority again. As the UUUC would not abide any form of power-sharing with the Dublin government, no agreement could be reached and the convention failed, again marginalising Northern Ireland's politicians and the communities they represented.|$|E
5|$|Oobi is an American children's {{television}} series created by Josh Selig of Little Airplane Productions. It {{began as a}} series of shorts commissioned by the Noggin network during a three-year period in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the channel's programming was co-produced by Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop. Full-length episodes of the show began airing on April 7, 2003, and the series ended its run on February 11, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of modern {{tropical}} cyclone tracking technology, notably satellite imagery, many hurricanes that did not affect land directly went unnoticed, and storms that did affect land were not recognized until their onslaught. As a result, information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete. Modern-day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms. In many cases, the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path, and judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships, and their location {{in relation to the}} storm, it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm's center of circulation for a given point in time. This is the manner in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the eleven known storms in the 1906 season were identified by hurricane expert José Fernández-Partagás's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910. Partagás also extended the known tracks of three other hurricanes previously identified by scholars. The information Partagás and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some slight adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity, although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed, listings on some storms are incomplete.|$|E
