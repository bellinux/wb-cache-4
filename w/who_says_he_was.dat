Chu, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> inspired {{to create the}} series by Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller" [...] and [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] music videos and by the dancers he met while filming the movie [...] He has described the show as [...] "balletic", [...] "operatic", [...] "high quality" [...] and a [...] "Justice League of dance." [...] The series was choreographed by Christopher Scott and Harry Shum, Jr. with assistant choreography by Galen Hooks. Members had {{a wide variety of}} specialties including hip-hop, krumping, contemporary, tricking, popping, b-boying, jazz, tap, and ballet. All of the choreography and stunts were real; there were no special effects or wire work and the entire series was shot on location without the use of green screens.|$|E
2500|$|Jason Holland testified he {{was drunk}} and lagging behind the others and did not see how the {{argument}} between his brother Micah and McLoren started.

[...] Jason opened a folding pocketknife and [...] "pricked" [...] McLoren twice in the back to get him off his brother, then stabbed him in the chest. [...] When Farris entered the fort to help McLoren, Jason stabbed him twice and Hein punched him in the head and face. [...] McLoren survived his wounds but Farris died in the emergency room. [...] When Jason Holland learned from his mother that he was wanted for murder, he went into hiding but several weeks later voluntarily surrendered.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Hinch {{found that}} Michael Glennon, who had {{previously}} been convicted {{on a charge of}} indecent assault with a minor, was to be tried on new charges while still running a youth camp. Hinch, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> concerned that parents were unknowingly sending their children to Glennon's camp, first appealed privately to then Victorian Premier John Cain and the then-Attorney General, as well {{as the head of the}} Roman Catholic Church in Australia, but in Hinch's words, they [...] "washed their hands" [...] of the situation. Subsequently, Hinch publicly identified Glennon during his trial on the third set of charges, in spite of the strong sub judice rule under Australian jurisprudence. This delayed the trial while Hinch was tried on contempt of court charges; Hinch was fined $10,000 and imprisoned for 12 days. This was the first time anyone had gone to prison on a prior restraint issue in Australia. Hinch appealed his case as far as the High Court of Australia, which affirmed his conviction. In its ruling the Court held that despite Hinch's motivation of warning the public that Glennon continued to hold a position in a youth organisation, it was sufficient to inform them of the current charges against him, and that the information about his prior conviction was prejudicial under Australian law. Hinch called the incident [...] "the thing I'm most proud of in my life." ...|$|E
