5|$|An {{official}} {{in charge of}} ethnic and religious affairs in Guangdong said that the province had hired Uygurs, aged from 18 to 29, in May. A small group of Uyghurs arrived on 2 May, and <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> factory remarked that {{relations between the two}} groups deteriorated as the number of Uyghurs increased. State media confirmed that all the workers were from Shufu County. China Labor Watch reported that <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Shaoguan factory, where the Uyghurs were employed, earned 28 yuan per day compared with 41.3 yuan in its factory in Shenzhen. They noted that rights of workers, Han and Uyghur alike, were frequently violated by verbal abuse from factory supervisors, unpaid overtime, poor dormitory conditions and illegal labour contracts. Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch said that low pay, long hours and poor working conditions combined with the inability to communicate with their colleagues exacerbated deeply held mistrust between the Han and Uyghurs.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, over 120 {{international}} artists urged {{a boycott}} of both the Louvre and Guggenheim museums over concerns regarding the abuse and exploitation of construction workers employed to develop the complex.

A spokeswoman said the strike did not affect electricity output.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{increasing}} anti-British sentiment {{spread throughout}} the Arab World and led to riots in Bahrain. The riots focused on the Jewish community. In 1948, following rising hostilities and looting, most members of Bahrain's Jewish community abandoned their properties and evacuated to Bombay, later settling in Israel (Pardes Hanna-Karkur) and the United Kingdom. , 37 Jews remained in the country. In the 1950s, the National Union Committee, formed by reformists following sectarian clashes, demanded an elected popular assembly, removal of Belgrave and carried {{out a number of}} protests and general strikes. In 1965 a month-long uprising broke out after hundreds of <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bahrain Petroleum Company were laid off.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{industrial}} unrest, trade unions for black workers were instituted in 1946, though they lacked power and influence. <b>Workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> UMHK continued to demand higher wages, and strikes were {{common in the}} colony for the next decade. Nevertheless, both wages and living conditions improved significantly {{in the years after}} the war. The war began a second wave of industrialisation that lasted right up to Congolese independence in 1960.|$|E

5|$|His unmailed {{letter was}} found {{by one of his}} staff and {{circulated}} among <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Anemia Commission. When Rhoads learned of this, he quickly made a public apology at a meeting of all staff and doctors.

With relations having deteriorated locally, he returned to New York in December 1931.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, {{shortly after}} the Navy's public {{acknowledgment}} of the sinking, <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Quincy shipyard, where the ship had been built twenty-one years earlier, cabled Navy Secretary Frank Knox and proposed {{a change in the}} name of one of the new Essex-class fleet carriers currently under construction there to Lexington (from Cabot). Knox agreed to the proposal and the carrier was renamed as the fifth Lexington on 16 June 1942. On 17 February 1943, her successor was formally commissioned as USS Lexington (CV-16), which served as the flagship of Task Force 58 (TF 58) during the Battle of the Philippine Sea and remained in service until 1991.|$|E
5|$|In March 1960 the Royal Navy ceased {{operating}} the Sheerness dockyard and the Medway Port Authority {{took over the}} site for commercial use. The dockyard closure led to thousands of job losses, {{and most of the}} nearby houses and shops in the Bluetown area were eventually abandoned and demolished. By the 1961 census, the population of Sheerness had fallen to 13,691. The dockyard closure also led to the decline of the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society, as many of its members were dockyard <b>workers.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, the society was the island's main retailer, but it has since been reduced to a few shops and been merged with a larger society.|$|E

5|$|Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) {{is now the}} {{location}} of a wood yard, used since the 1930s to prepare local willow for the production of cricket bats. The trees are grown at Harbour Hill Copse, where 70 trees are felled annually for this purpose. There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time. The <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> yard cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|Similarly 'marked' {{armed guards}} arrive {{from the plant}} and take Dillon away. Whilst being taken Dillon threateningly tells Quatermass not to follow. After the guards' {{departure}} Quatermass speaks with a tramp, who explains that {{there used to be}} a small government research unit consisting of a few huts by Winnerden Flats, and that a year ago they expanded and bulldozed the village, and built the plant and a prefab town for the construction <b>workers.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> prefab town, Quatermass sees that 'the mark' and strange behaviour are associated with those who find the fallen meteorites, but before he can find out more the community police order him away.|$|E
5|$|The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights {{reported}} on 11 February 2013 that the dam {{was captured by}} the Syrian opposition in their fight against the government. As of December 2016 the village near the dam, Al-Thawrah, is occupied by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In 2013, four of the dam's eight turbines were operational and the original staff continued to manage the dam. <b>Workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dam still received pay from the Syrian Government and fighting in the area temporarily ceased if repairs were needed. January 2017 saw a raid against ISIS by combined SDF and US special forces between the dam and nearby Al-Thawrah.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of sales was overestimated; in 1956, 525 Vanajas were sold and in March 1957, the volume {{for the whole}} year was estimated to reach about 400units. VAT employed about 200 <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time and changed to a four-day working week. The company blamed the government's import licence bureaucracy for the problemit was difficult to get diesel engines from abroad. In the following month, over 30 Vanajas that were otherwise ready were awaiting diesel engines. The economy improved in 1959.|$|E
5|$|A 3km {{protection}} zone, 10km {{surveillance zone}} and a restricted zone encompassing 2000km2 were set up. Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the cull being completed {{on the evening}} of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as to the action to be taken. Around 320 <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu. The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes of the Russian {{space program}} and NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, many <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir {{was more important than}} the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.|$|E

5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Debs {{was a member}} of the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884. After working with several smaller unions, including the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Debs was instrumental in the founding of the American Railway Union (ARU), one of the nation's first industrial unions. After <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Pullman Palace Car Company organized a wildcat strike over pay cuts in the summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU. He called a boycott of the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars, in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike, affecting most lines west of Detroit, and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states. To keep the mail running, President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike. As a leader of the ARU, Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye was edited to be {{guaranteed}} a PG-13 rating from the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC. The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head {{when he is}} shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her a rabbit punch in the car. In 2006, the film was re-mastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15. However, the original MPAA edits still remain.|$|E
5|$|Historically part of Gateshead Fell in County Durham, Sheriff Hill was {{the site}} of a battle between William the Conqueror and Malcolm III of Scotland in 1068. A road was built through Gateshead Fell in the early 13th century, {{attracting}} some settlers. A procession of bishops, sheriffs and noblemen known as the Sheriff's March took place on the road in 1282 and continued biannually until the 1830s. By then, Gateshead Fell had been enclosed and a village had grown around the road, largely populated by an influx of tinkers, coalminers working at Sheriff Hill Colliery and <b>workers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local pottery, mill and sandstone quarry. By the turn of the 20th century these industries were in steep decline. The local authority built a large council estate at Sheriff Hill to alleviate dangerous overcrowding in Gateshead, effectively turning the area into a residential suburb. It ceased to be an independent village on 1 April 1974 when it was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead {{under the terms of the}} Local Government Act 1972.|$|E
