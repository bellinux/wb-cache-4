But he looked so {{harmless}} in his finery, and the expression of his comely face was so winning and honest, that the man's hesitancy faded {{as soon as it}} sprang up. Removing his cap, he drew from within the crown the letter, which he had placed there to keep dry. This package he now handed to Gonzaga, who, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>word</b> of instruction to the sentry touching the finding of raiment for the messenger, stepped out to go his errand.

60|$|Joan {{had been}} placed wholly apart and conspicuous, to signify the Church's {{abandonment}} of her, and she sat there in her loneliness, waiting in patience and resignation for the end. Cauchon addressed her now. He had been advised to read the form of her abjuration to her, and had brought it with him; but he changed his mind, fearing that she would proclaim the truth--that she had never knowingly abjured--and so bring shame upon him and eternal infamy. He contented himself with admonishing her {{to keep in mind}} her wickednesses, and repent of them, and think of her salvation. Then he solemnly pronounced her excommunicate and cut off from the body of the Church. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>word</b> he delivered her over to the secular arm for judgment and sentence.|$|E
60|$|As {{she stood}} thus in vain {{endeavor}} to fathom this inexplicable mystery {{the sound of}} voices broke upon her ears. Instantly she was all alert. They were coming closer! A second later she recognized the lurid profanity of the Swede. Malbihn, her persecutor, was returning! Meriem ran quickly {{to the opening of}} the tent and looked out. It was too late! She was fairly cornered! The white man and three of his black henchmen were coming straight across the clearing toward the tent. What was she to do? She slipped the photograph into her waist. Quickly she slipped a cartridge into each of the chambers of the revolver. Then she backed {{toward the end of the}} tent, keeping the entrance covered by her weapon. The man stopped outside, and Meriem could hear Malbihn profanely issuing instructions. He was a long time about it, and while he talked in his bellowing, brutish voice, the girl sought some avenue of escape. Stooping, she raised the bottom of the canvas and looked beneath and beyond. There was no one in sight upon that side. Throwing herself upon her stomach she wormed beneath the tent wall just as Malbihn, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>word</b> to his men, entered the tent.|$|E

5000|$|Hoppus {{said the}} song's {{inspiration}} came from [...] "reading a magazine where some teenage kid had killed himself {{and left a}} letter for his family." [...] Untrue online rumors purported that the song {{was inspired by a}} friend from Hoppus' high school years who committed suicide, or a play titled Adam's Letter that has the same focus. A fictional suicide note {{was a part of the}} script for Adam's Letter, a play that wasn't written until two years after [...] "Adam's Song" [...] came out. John Cosper, the writer behind Adam's Letter, said: [...] "The play was written in 2001 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different title, <b>Final</b> <b>Word.</b> It was renamed and released on the web as Adam's Letter in around 2005. The actual suicide note was written by me as a part of the play script. As it was written two years after the blink song, there is absolutely no connection whatsoever between the note and the writing of the song. By the same token, the naming of the central character was a coincidence. The name goes back to the original script; I had no knowledge of Blink-182 or their music at that time." [...] In his memoir Can I Say, drummer Travis Barker wrote that the song's title was taken from a [...] "sketch on Mr. Show about a band that writes <b>a</b> song <b>with</b> that name encouraging one particular fan to kill himself." [...] David Cross, co-creator of Mr. Show, confirmed this, commenting, [...] "They were fans of the show and that was a knowing tribute that I thought was pretty cool." ...|$|R

All creatures and things {{understand}} and, to a degree, can speak the Speech intuitively, but specifically, it is the wizards who use it as their primary language and means of performing their works of magic. It is incredibly detailed and describes things which other languages cannot. Describing something inaccurately in the Speech may result in catastrophic effect (including changing the nature of the thing or being therein mis-described); therefore, wizards are advised to never curse or lie in the Speech. Spells are described in the Speech; the wizard tells the object/subject what he/she wants to happen to it. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>word,</b> the spell can be let loose to do what it was supposed to do.|$|E
40|$|Amyloid nanofibrils are {{ubiquitous}} biological protein fibrous aggregates, with a {{wide range}} of either toxic or beneficial activities that are relevant to human disease and normal biology. Protein amyloid fibrillization occurs via nucleated polymerization, through non-covalent interactions. As such, protein nanofibril formation is based on a complex interplay between kinetic and thermodynamic factors. The process entails metastable oligomeric species and a highly thermodynamically favoured end state. The kinetics, and the reaction pathway itself, can be influenced by third party moieties, either molecules or surfaces. Specifically, in the biological context, different classes of biomolecules are known to act as catalysts, inhibitors or modifiers of the generic protein fibrillization process. The biological aggregation modifiers reviewed here include lipid membranes of varying composition, glycosaminoglycans and metal ions, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>word</b> on xenobiotic compounds. The corresponding molecular interactions are critically analysed and placed in the context of the mechanisms of cytotoxicity of the amyloids involved in diverse pathologies and the non-toxicity of functional amyloids (at least towards their biological host). Finally, the utilization of this knowledge towards the design of bio-inspired and biocompatible nanomaterials is explored...|$|E

40|$|The author 2 ̆ 7 s {{memories}} of 2 ̆ 2 {{the movie version}} 2 ̆ 2 of The Lawyering Process, two courses she took in Gary Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s first two years at Harvard Law School (1971 - 73), are compared to the text and problem supplements published in 1978. The author traces the influence of those courses and books on her externship course and textbook, written with others. She cites the value of Bellow 2 ̆ 6 Moulton 2 ̆ 7 s pioneering employment of visual and kinesthetic learning modes and explicit statement to students about educational goals and methods. She identifies paradigms for lawyering tasks that have remained useful to her throughout her career. With twenty-one years as a Professional Responsibility teacher, she marvels at the {{breadth and depth of}} the books 2 ̆ 7 treatment of ethical issues and recalls the critical stance toward conventional statements of lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s role that suffused the course and book. She finds that the decision-making model, which she now recognizes as a creative problem-solving process, and the emphasis on social justice that she found central to the course are obscured by the complexity and scope of the books.

40|$|In the Fall of 2013 we team-taught a {{disability}} studies course {{for a small}} group of first-year students. The course, Minding the Body, integrated scholarship from disability studies, feminist/queer studies, psychology, and Russian Studies. Originally envisioned and taught independently in the Fall of 2012 by Joan Ostrove and focused entirely on the U. S., Anastasia Kayiatos's arrival in the Department of German and Russian Studies at Macalester College afforded us an opportunity for collaboration and co-instruction that we found invigorating, compelling, and transformative. Grounded from the outset in disability studies, the course asked students to interrogate such questions as: What is a "normal" body? A "beautiful" body? Why do we feel the way we do about our bodies? How are bodies objectified, exploited, and regulated? How and why do we discriminate against people with non-normative bodies? How do people represent the experience of having a disabled body? How can we think critically about the various ways in which people change, regulate, and enhance their bodies? How do sexism, racism, classism, colonialism, homophobia, transphobia and other forms of oppression influence how different bodies are viewed, treated, educated, and experienced? The integration of Russian Studies importantly allowed us to ask how these questions and ideas change when we travel across time and geographical space. In our paper we will reflect on our experience of co-authoring the syllabus (we will include both the solo-taught and co-taught versions of the syllabus in an appendix); outline some of our techniques for team-teaching; and analyze an exemplary assignment and class meeting. We will conclude <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>word</b> about the unique forms of teaching and learning that happened in our class as a consequence of its collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, which opened up new perspectives in disability studies not only for our students but also for us...|$|E
