5|$|In {{terms of}} skull length, the {{smallest}} subspecies {{of the blue}} wildebeest is the western white-bearded wildebeest. It is also the darkest subspecies, the eastern white-bearded wildebeest being the lightest race. Both these subspecies possess a creamy <b>white</b> <b>beard,</b> whereas the beard is black in both the Nyassaland wildebeest and the common wildebeest. The longest muzzles {{are found in the}} Nyassaland wildebeest, and the shortest in female western white-bearded wildebeest.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{weary of}} his workload, Gray {{and his wife}} {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} Britain, Egypt (for three months), and Switzerland in September 1868. It was during the winter spent in Egypt that Gray first grew his <b>white</b> <b>beard.</b> They returned in autumn 1869. In early 1872 Gray tried to resign his professorship and garden duties still with no replacement for himself. He proposed only looking after the herbarium and writing books in exchange for the rent of the house in which he and his wife lived on the university grounds. Due to the way the finances of the funding sources were handled and the lack of a replacement, Gray was unable to resign at that time.|$|E
5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a <b>white</b> <b>beard</b> alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E

25|$|In {{both the}} Last Judgment and the Coronation of the Virgin {{paintings}} by Rubens he depicted God the Father using {{the image that}} by then had become widely accepted, a bearded patriarchal figure above the fray. In the 17th century, the two Spanish artists Velázquez (whose father-in-law Francisco Pacheco {{was in charge of}} the approval of new images for the Inquisition) and Murillo both depicted God the Father using a patriarchal figure with a <b>white</b> <b>beard</b> in a purple robe.|$|E

25|$|According to legend, Charlemagne noted to the Abbey {{sections}} of the slope where the snow melted first and ordered that grapevines be planted on that slope. His orders were followed and the hill of Corton was planted first entirely with red grape varieties. A couple decades later, Charlemagne's fourth wife Luitgard {{was said to be}} displeased with red wine drippings on the <b>white</b> <b>beard</b> of the king and ordered that a section of the hill be pulled up and replanted with white grape varieties—a section that is today known as Corton-Charlemagne.|$|E
25|$|My {{favorite}} {{king was}} King Melchior, {{because he was}} the oldest and had a long <b>white</b> <b>beard.</b> My brother's favorite was King Kaspar. He insisted that this king was a little crazy and quite deaf. I don't know why he was so positive about his being deaf. I suspect it was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood what the word meant.|$|E
25|$|Sagan wrote {{frequently}} {{about religion}} {{and the relationship between}} religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example: Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long <b>white</b> <b>beard,</b> sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.|$|E

25|$|Yellow is {{the code}} for monks, mendicants and women. Minukka (radiant, shining) {{with a warm}} yellow, orange or saffron typifies noble, virtuous {{feminine}} characters such as Sita, Panchali and Mohini. Men who act the roles of women also add a false top knot to their left and decorate it in a style common to the region. Vella Thadi (<b>white</b> <b>beard)</b> represents a divine being, someone with virtuous inner state and consciousness such as Hanuman. Teppu are for special characters found in Hindu mythologies, such as Garuda, Jatayu and Hamsa who act as messengers or carriers, but do not fit the other categories. Face masks and head gear is added to accentuate the inner nature of the characters. The garments colors have a similar community accepted code of silent communication.|$|E
25|$|In his sixties, al-Jazzar was {{described}} as having a <b>white</b> <b>beard</b> and being agile and of muscular build. His native tongue was Bosnian, but he spoke Ottoman Turkish and Arabic with a distinctively Egyptian accent. Although he had previously been a frequent drinker, he quit consuming alcohol following his participation in the Hajj of 1791.

He would typically either don a standard Arab dress or a coarse cloth and turban. He would often meet guests sitting beneath a date palm or on a cushion-less board. He was an avid gardener and later took up paper artwork as a hobby with which he entertained his guests and his harem.|$|E
25|$|On September 5, {{two weeks}} after the riot had been controlled, Anthony Graziosi, an Italian sales {{representative}} with a <b>white</b> <b>beard</b> dressed in dark business attire, was driving in the neighborhood. As he stopped at a traffic light at 11pm, six blocks away from where Yankel Rosenbaum had been murdered, a group of four black men surrounded his car and one of them shot and killed him. It was alleged by Graziosi's family and their attorney, as well as Senator Al D'Amato, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, State Attorney General Robert Abrams, former Mayor Ed Koch, and a number of advocacy organizations, that Graziosi's resemblance to a Hasidic Jew precipitated his murder. The New York Police Department, Mayor Dinkins, newspaper columnist Mike McAlary, and the U.S. Justice Department did not agree. The murder was not treated as a bias crime.|$|E

500|$|In Hawaii, Rosenberg {{was known}} for his long <b>white</b> <b>beard</b> and his personality, which was {{described}} by those who knew him as charming and witty. He cast optimistic horoscopes for anyone who asked, and soon became popular with Hawaiians. He was nicknamed [...] "Rosey", owing to his cheery attitude and witty remarks. After Rosenberg became well known, he {{came to the attention of}} King Kalākaua, who granted him a royal audience. Rosenberg was present at a birthday celebration for King Kalākaua at ʻIolani Palace in November 1886. Rosenberg's fame led to satire: he regularly appeared in a Hawaiian Gazette gossip column, which mockingly called him [...] "Holy Moses", and was satirized by a troupe of amateur minstrels at the Hawaii Opera House. In February 1887, he paid for a notice to be placed in The Honolulu Advertiser, in which he claimed to have lost a letter that was sent to him by Queen Victoria. There has been speculation that the advertisement was a hoax designed by Rosenberg to lend himself prestige.|$|E
