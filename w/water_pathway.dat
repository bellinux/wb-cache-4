60|$|For {{nearly a}} hundred years before the {{discovery}} of America the Portuguese had been endeavouring to find an ocean route to the spice islands of the East and to the great Oriental empires which, tradition said, lay far off on a distant ocean, and which Marco Polo and other travellers had reached by years of painful land travel across the interior of Asia. Prince Henry of Portugal was busy with these tasks at {{the middle of the}} fifteenth century. Even before this, Portuguese sailors had found their way to the Madeiras and the Canary Islands, and to the Azores, which lie a thousand miles out in the Atlantic. But under the lead of Prince Henry they began to grope their way down the coast of Africa, braving the torrid heats and awful calms of that equatorial region, where the blazing sun, poised overhead in a cloudless sky, was reflected on the bosom of a stagnant and glistening ocean. It was their constant hope that at some point the land would be found to roll back and disclose an ocean pathway round Africa to the East, the goal of their desire. Year after year they advanced farther, until at last they achieved a momentous result. In 1487, Bartholomew Diaz sailed round the southern point of Africa, which received the significant name of the 'Cape of Good Hope,' and entered the Indian Ocean. Henceforth a <b>water</b> <b>pathway</b> to the Far East was possible. Following Diaz, Vasco da Gama, leaving Lisbon in 1497, sailed round the south of Africa, and, reaching the ports of Hindustan, made the maritime route to India a definite reality.|$|E

The model features an explicit physical represen-tation of the surface mixed layer, realistic basin geometry, observed wind and heat flux forcing, and a horizontal grid-stretching technique and a vertical sigma coordinate to obtain a realistic simulation of the subtropical/ tropical circulation. Velocity fields, and isopycnal and trajectory analyses are used to understand the mean flow of mixed layer and thermocline waters between the subtropics and Tropics. Subtropical/tropical <b>water</b> <b>pathways</b> are not simply direct meridional routes; the existence of vigorous zonal current systems obviously complicates the picture. In the surface mixed layer, upwelled equatorial waters flow into the subtropical gyre mainly through the midlatitude western boundary current (the model Kuroshio). There is additionally an interior ocean pathway, through the Subtropical Countercurrent (an eastward flow across {{the middle of the}} subtropical gyre), that directly feeds subtropical subduction sites.

5000|$|GCaMP is {{a genetically}} encoded calcium indicator, or GECI {{initially}} developed by Junichi Nakai. GCaMP is created from {{a fusion of}} green fluorescent protein (GFP), calmodulin, and M13, a peptide sequence from myosin light chain kinase. The advantage of GECI's {{is that they can}} be genetically specified for studies in living organisms. The first transgenic mouse expressing a GCaMP was reported in 2004 [...] and GCaMP was subsequently improved to GCaMP2, which was stable at mammalian body temperatures and enabled the first in vivo mammalian recordings using a GECI. [...] GCaMPs have been subsequently modified to progressively improve the range of the fluorescence signal, resulting in GCaMP3 through GCaMP8. [...] Additionally, red fluorescence GECIs have been developed that expand the spectral options for multi-lineage imaging GFP is circularly permutated so that the N- and C-termini are fused, creating a new terminus {{in the middle of the}} protein. Fused to the new terminus is calmodulin (CaM) and the M13 domain of a myosin light chain kinase. Calmodulin is a symmetrical, hinge-like protein that binds to four calcium ions via E-F motifs. When calcium is present, CaM undergoes a conformational change, and the hinge region is able to bind helical peptide chains on target proteins, such as M13. In the absence of calcium, the circularly permutated fluorescent proteins exist in a poorly fluorescent state due to a <b>water</b> <b>pathway</b> that enable protonation of the chromophore and poor absorbance at the excitation wavelengths. Ca2+ binding to the calmodulin moiety results in a structural shift that eliminates this solvent pathway, rapid de-protonation of the chromophore, and bright fluorescence.|$|E

The modified Landis technique (Michel, Mason, Curry & Tooke, 1974) {{was used to}} measure hydraulic conductivities of the capillary wall. Sucrose osmotic reflexion coefficients of the capillary wall were measured in four capillaries when the superfusate contained 100 mM-sucrose. All experiments were made at 22 - 24 degrees C. The hydraulic conductivity of arterial capillaries varied from 0. 3 to 1. 26 X 10 (- 7) cm/(s cmH 2 O) with a mean of 0. 79 X 10 (- 7) cm/(s cmH 2 O) (six capillaries). The hydraulic conductivities of mid-capillaries varied from 0. 43 to 1. 86 X 10 (- 7) cm/(s cmH 2 O) with a mean value of 0. 72 X 10 (- 7) cm/(s cmH 2 O) (six capillaries). The mean reflexion coefficient to sucrose was 0. 12 +/- 0. 05 (S. D.). The measured reflexion coefficients to sucrose conform to the hypothesis that 90 % of the transcapillary water flow crosses the capillary wall via the principal hydrophilic pathway. The remaining 10 % crosses via an exclusive <b>water</b> <b>pathway.</b> The distribution of water flow is similar to that previously described in frog mesenteric capillaries. The mean value of the hydraulic conductivity of frog muscle capillaries is about one-seventh the mean value of the hydraulic conductivity of frog mesenteric capillaries measured at the same temperature. The result conforms to the hypothesis that only a small fraction (mean 10 %) of the area of junctional contact between adjacent endothelial cells is available for water and solute exchange in frog muscle capillaries. The hydraulic and diffusional conductances per unit length of open junction appear to be very similar when muscle capillaries are compared to mesenteric capillaries in the frog.

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{development}} of urbanisation and the associated pollutions, peri-urban rivers face an increasing pressure on the receiving waters and an enhancement of floods. In order to limit the risks and define adapted management scenarios, it is important to identify the key factors over which action is possible. In particular, due to the Water Framework Directive, discharge of polluted water into rivers must be limited and actions must be undertaken in order to restore the ecological quality of water. In this context, integrated modelling tools, taking into account anthropogenic effects on the water cycle are interesting as they provide ways to test and evaluate the efficiency of different management scenarios. However improvements are still required to derive tools allowing a continuous and long term modelling of the hydrological cycle in peri-urban areas. The models must take into account the surface heterogeneity (mixture of rural and urbanised areas), and also the natural and artificial <b>water</b> <b>pathways,</b> which influence the water quality. These questions are the focus of the AVuPUR (Assessing the Vulnerability of Peri-Urban Rivers) project. Its aims are 1) to provide a better description of the heterogeneity of peri-urban catchments and of the associated <b>water</b> <b>pathways</b> using field survey, GIS and remote sensing analysis of high resolution images; 2) to provide long term detailed simulation models of the hydrological cycle in peri-urban catchments to increase our understanding of the processes involved; 3) to improve existing hydrological models with a better handling of the urbanised areas in order to derive tools usable by stakeholders; 4) to run long term simulations of the hydrological cycle using past and future land-use and climate scenarios and quantify the impact on the hydrological regime. The project focuses on two experimental catchments: the Yzeron catchment (147 km 2), a peri-urban catchment located in the west of Lyon (south-east of France) and the Chézine catchment (34 km 2) located close to the city of Nantes (west of France). Both catchments are part of hydrometeorological observatories which ensures a long-term monitoring of the catchments. Both catchments experience a rapid increase of urbanisation. They are located in two contrasted climates and physiographic contexts: Mediterranean type climate and marked topography for the Yzeron catchment and oceanic climate with rather flat areas for the Chézine catchment. This will allow testing the robustness and transferability of the developed approaches. The presentation will focus on the data which are currently acquired in the framework of the project: rainfall, streamflow, water levels in ephemeral reaches, lidar survey, geophysical surveys, infiltration tests. A diachronic analysis of land use since the 50 th is also performed using satellite and aerial photographs.

The work presented in this paper has taken place within the Pin Sec catchment (Nantes, France); it consists of collecting and analyzing groundwater, wastewater and rainwater in the catchment and then applying the isotopic and chemical results to trace the mixing that occurs in the pipes. Results reveal that isotopic tracing is indeed relevant on this catchment. The isotopic signatures of drinking water and groundwater vary sufficiently during spring, up to 1. 50 for ´ 18 O and up to 120 for ´ 2 H in May. The ratios of defective connections and water seepage may be deduced from this output. Chemicals also support the findings of the isotopic tracing results.
