6000|$|... "Oh, it is beautiful!" [...] {{she gasped}} at last. [...] "Poor papa! What {{a time he}} will have! But it's all for his own good, {{as he used to}} say when we had to be punished <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little.</b> Oh, Clara, I do hope your heart won't fail you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{know many}} of the ports you touched at," [...] Maria said when he had finished, [...] "for <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> girls, papa took us {{sometimes}} for voyages in his ships, when the times were peaceful {{and there was no}} danger. Now let us order a gondola, and go for a row. Papa is sure to be occupied for ever so long with your captain." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Karnath, I am Tarzan of the Apes," [...] {{said the}} ape-man {{in the vernacular}} of the tribe. [...] "You {{remember}} me. Together <b>we</b> teased Numa <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> still <b>little</b> apes, throwing sticks and nuts {{at him from the}} safety of high branches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My sister Nelly and I went {{to visit}} an aunt of ours, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> girls, {{but we did n't}} have a very good time, for she was {{extremely}} strict. One afternoon, when she had gone out to tea, and old Debby, the maid, was asleep in her room, we sat on the doorstep, feeling homesick, and ready for any thing to amuse us.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know you," [...] {{answered}} Pharaoh slowly, [...] "as well I may, {{seeing that}} we played together <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little.</b> You are that Hebrew whom my sister, she who sleeps in Osiris, {{took to be}} as a son to her, giving to you a name that means 'drawn forth' because she drew you forth as an infant from among the reeds of Nile. Aye, I know {{you and your brother}} also, but your errand I know not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{wonder at}} that. We {{lived with a}} {{stepfather}} there. Our mother died there, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> children. We have had a wretched existence. She made him our guardian, {{and he was a}} miserly wretch who grudged us food to eat, and clothes to wear. At his death, he passed us over to this man; for no better reason that I know of, than his being a friend or connexion of his, whose name was always in print and catching his attention.’ ...|$|E
60|$|The {{reason he}} had to wait in vain at Reddy's door {{was that she was}} dead; she had been dead {{for quite a long time}} when Tommy came back to look for her. You mothers who have lost your babies, I should be a sorry knave were I to ask you to cry now over the death of another woman's child. Reddy had been lent to two people for a very little while, just as your babies were, and when the time was up she blew a kiss to them and ran gleefully back to God, just as your babies did. The gates of heaven are so easily found <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>little,</b> and they <b>are</b> always {{standing}} open to let children wander in.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{certainly}} have none. Then {{we will start}} by the first train on Wednesday morning for Albury. We must have our heavy things sent round by sea to Sydney, and get them from there as best <b>we</b> can. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a <b>little</b> fixed, one of us can run down to Sydney.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{outside the}} <b>little</b> town I found the starlight was quite {{sufficient}} for my purpose. The white roadway, the low walls, and objects about us, {{could easily be}} distinguished.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do so, Isobel. Of {{course there}} will be danger, but the danger will be nothing to that we have passed through together. The Sepoys will no doubt fight hard, but already they must have begun to doubt; their {{confidence}} in victory must be shaken, and they begin to fear retribution for their crimes. The fighting will, I think, be less severe as the struggle goes on, and at any rate the danger to us, fighting as the assailants, is as nothing to that run <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> groups surrounded by a country in arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it's horrid to say it," [...] she said, {{with a white}} face; [...] "but it's horrider to keep it in! Oh, Jack! <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little,</b> {{and used}} to fight and quarrel, I never was mean--was I? I never was underhanded--was I? I never lied--did I? And I can't lie now. Jack," [...] she looked hurriedly around her, [...] "HE wants {{to get hold of}} the land--HE thinks there's gold in the slope and bank by the stream. He says dad was a fool to have located his claim so high up. Jack! did you ever {{prospect}} the bank?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did, {{many years}} ago, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> more than boys. He {{saved my life}} by jumping into a deep pool in a lake and rescuing me from the crocodiles. I had fallen in off the steep bank. I could not swim, and he could. After that we made the {{alliance}} of brotherhood. Laihova was not a Christian at that time. Since then God has made use of me to rescue him from a more awful death than that which threatened me. Laihova is grateful, and, knowing that I run much risk in going near the capital, has come, as you see, to help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but he is}} so kind. He used {{to carry}} us about and play with us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> quite <b>little</b> children, and since I have been older he has made me almost a companion. He taught me to ride, and trained my bay pony, my {{beautiful}} Mayflower, and read with me, and helped me in my music and drawing." ...|$|R
60|$|We went on {{still for}} two days, and still {{we found the}} land {{extending}} itself south, till the third day in the morning, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> a <b>little</b> surprised to find ourselves, as it were, embayed, being {{in the bottom of}} a deep gulf, and the land appearing right ahead, distance about three leagues; the coast having turned away to the east and by south, very high land and mountainous, and the tops of some of the hills covered with snow.|$|R
6000|$|... "O Chaka," [...] I broke in, [...] "I am Mopo, son of Makedama of the Langeni tribe. It was I {{who gave}} thee a gourd of water many years ago, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> both <b>little.</b> Then thou badest me come to thee when thou hadst grown great, vowing that thou wouldst protect me and never do me harm. So I have come, {{bringing}} my sister with me; and now, I pray thee, {{do not eat}} up the words of long ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{friendship}} between Mrs. Carraby and myself," [...] Julien continued, [...] "has been patent to every {{one for a}} great many years. I knew her long before I did you. It began, in fact, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> more than children. It finished--to-day. There is only one thing I {{want to say to}} you about it, and that is this. Our friendship was of that sort which is fairly well recognized and even approved of by {{the world in which we}} live. It contained, of course, certain elements of flirtation--I am not denying that. There was never at any time, however, anything in that friendship which made it an error even of taste on my part to ask you to become my wife." ...|$|E
60|$|Most of us {{leave school}} with the {{impression}} that there was a good deal of bullying <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little,</b> but that the institution has died out. The truth is that we have grown too big to be bullied, and too good-natured to bully ourselves. When I left school, I thought bullying was an extinct art, like encaustic painting (before it was rediscovered by Sir William Richmond). But a distinguished writer, who was a small boy when I was a big one, has since revealed to me the most abominable cruelties which were being practised at the very moment when I supposed bullying to have had its day and ceased to be. Now, the small boy need only have mentioned the circumstances to any one of a score of big boys, and the tormentor would have been first thrashed, and then, probably, expelled.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sorais, {{ever have}} I {{been a good}} sister to thee. When our father died, and there was much talk in the land as to whether thou shouldst sit upon the throne with me, I being the elder, I gave my voice for thee and said, [...] "Nay, let her sit. She is twin with me; we were born at a birth; {{wherefore}} should the one be preferred before the other?" [...] And so has it ever been 'twixt thee and me, my sister. But now thou knowest in what sort thou hast repaid me, but I have prevailed, and thy life is forfeit, Sorais. And yet art thou my sister, born at a birth with me, and we played together <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> and loved each other much, and at night we slept in the same cot with our arms each around the other's neck, and therefore even now does my heart go out to thee, Sorais.|$|E
60|$|My dear Mina, why are men so noble <b>when</b> <b>we</b> women <b>are</b> so <b>little</b> {{worthy of}} them? Here was I almost {{making fun of}} this great hearted, true gentleman. I burst into tears, I am afraid, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter {{in more ways than}} one, and I really felt very badly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't you. Haven't {{you seen}} how Cilly has run restive from babyhood? A pretty termagant she was, as even I can remember. And how my poor father spoilt her! Any one but Honor {{would have given}} her up, rather than have gone through what she did, so firmly and patiently, till she had broken her in fairly well. But then come in these Charterises, and Cilly runs frantic after them, her own dear relations. Much they had cared for us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{troublesome}} <b>little</b> pests. But it's all the force of blood. Stuff! The whole truth {{is that they are}} gay, and Honora quiet; they encourage her to run riot. Honora keeps her in order.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You really don't think," [...] she said, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> alone, and <b>little</b> Pat, {{with his}} upturned blue eyes serenely {{surveying}} {{the features of}} the good lady who knew how to feed him, was placidly pulling away at his india-rubber tube, [...] "that I will consent to your keeping such a creature as this in the house? Why, he's a regular little Paddy! If you kept him he'd grow up into a hod-carrier." ...|$|R
60|$|BARBARA. Yesterday I {{should have}} said, because I {{was in the}} power of God. [She resumes her self-possession, {{withdrawing}} her hands from his with a power equal to his own]. But you came and showed me that I was {{in the power of}} Bodger and Undershaft. Today I feel--oh! how can I put it into words? Sarah: do you remember the earthquake at Cannes, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> children?--how little the surprise of the first shock mattered compared to the dread and horror of waiting for the second? That is how I feel in this place today. I stood on the rock I thought eternal; and without a word of warning it reeled and crumbled under me. I was safe with an infinite wisdom watching me, an army marching to Salvation with me; and in a moment, at a stroke of your pen in a cheque book, I stood alone; and the heavens were empty. That was the first shock of the earthquake: I am waiting for the second.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It would, I suppose. Yet I wish I {{could get}} a living by some simple humble occupation, and drop the name of Petherwin, and be Berta Chickerel again, and live in a green cottage {{as we used to}} do when I was small. I am miserable to a pitiable degree sometimes, and sink into regrets that I ever fell into such a groove as this. I don't like covert deeds, such as coming here to-night, and many are {{necessary}} with me from time to time. There is something without which splendid energies are a drug; and that is a cold heart. There is another thing necessary to energy, too--the power of distinguishing your visions from your reasonable forecasts when looking into the future, so as to allow your energy to lay hold of the forecasts only. I begin to have a fear that mother is right when she implies that I undertook to carry out visions and all. But ten of us are so many to cope with. If God Almighty had only killed off three-quarters of us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little,</b> a body might have done something for the rest; but as we are it is hopeless!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it so?" [...] he said presently. [...] "Wow! I {{say again}} that {{had it not}} been for Saduko, the son of Matiwane, yonder, who had some quarrel with Indhlovu-ene-Sihlonti about a woman and took his chance of vengeance, it might have been I who died of a broken heart upon a rock above the river. Oh, Saduko, I owe you a great debt and will pay you well; but you shall be no friend of mine, lest we also should chance to quarrel about a woman, and I should find myself dying of a broken heart on a rock above a river. O my brother Umbelazi, I mourn for you, my brother, for, after all, we played {{together}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> and loved each other once, who in the end fought for a toy that is called a throne, since, as our father said, two bulls cannot live in the same yard, my brother. Well, you are gone and I remain, yet who knows but that at the last your lot may be happier than mine. You died of a broken heart, Umbelazi, but of what shall I die, I wonder?"[*] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not just yet, my dear friend," [...] Montague interposed. [...] "It seems a {{shame to}} have taken a dislike to so amiable a gentleman, {{but the fact remains}} that we do not like you, Joe Hartwell and I. Once or twice you have been too clever for us. We want to linger over the time <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> just a <b>little</b> too clever for you. So au revoir, Jacob Pratt, until after lunch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{a soldier}} of Dingaan," [...] {{answered}} the man, [...] "but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> attacking the <b>little</b> {{people on that}} mountain I fell sick. Still I came away with the impi, but here my strength failed me, and here I have lain for a round {{of the sun and}} a round of the moon.

6000|$|... "Since {{you think}} it my duty, Mr. Farebrother, I {{will tell you that}} I have too strong a feeling for Fred to give him up for any one else. I should never be quite happy if I thought he was unhappy for the loss of me. It has taken such deep root in me--my {{gratitude}} to him for always loving me best, and minding so much if I hurt myself, from the time <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> very <b>little.</b> I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to make that weaker. I should like better than anything to see him worthy of every one's respect. But please tell him I will not promise to marry him till then: I should shame and grieve my father and mother. He is free to choose some one else." ...|$|R
6000|$|We wandered many a mile, always {{following}} paths {{which had}} been our favorites from the days <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little,</b> and always {{we talked about the}} old times. All the blitheness was with Nikolaus; we others could not shake off our depression. Our tone toward Nikolaus was so strangely gentle and tender and yearning that he noticed it, and was pleased; and we were constantly doing him deferential little offices of courtesy, and saying, [...] "Wait, let me do that for you," [...] and that pleased him, too. I gave him seven fish-hooks--all I had--and made him take them; and Seppi gave him his new knife and a humming-top painted red and yellow--atonements for swindles practised upon him formerly, as I learned later, and probably no longer remembered by Nikolaus now. These things touched him, and he could not have believed that we loved him so; and his pride in it and gratefulness for it cut us to the heart, we were so undeserving of them. When we parted at last, he was radiant, and said he had never had such a happy day.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{reared in}} the same village with her. I played with her every day, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> {{children}} together, just as you play with your mates. Now that we perceive how great she was, now that her name fills the whole world, it seems strange that what I am saying is true; for {{it is as if}} a perishable paltry candle should speak of the eternal sun riding in the heavens and say, [...] "He was gossip and housemate to me when we were candles together." [...] And yet it is true, just as I say. I was her playmate, and I fought at her side in the wars; to this day I carry in my mind, fine and clear, the picture of that dear little figure, with breast bent to the flying horse's neck, charging {{at the head of the}} armies of France, her hair streaming back, her silver mail plowing steadily deeper and deeper into the thick of the battle, sometimes nearly drowned from sight by tossing heads of horses, uplifted sword-arms, wind-blow plumes, and intercepting shields. I was with her to the end; and when that black day came whose accusing shadow will lie always upon the memory of the mitered French slaves of England who were her assassins, and upon France who stood idle and essayed no rescue, my hand was the last she touched in life.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next moment}} Sir Miles's {{thoughts}} {{had gone back}} to the recent episode. So absorbed was he in his musings, that when the King presently handed him the paper which he had been writing, he received it and pocketed it without being conscious of the act. [...] "How marvellous strange she acted," [...] he muttered. [...] "I think she knew me--and I think she did NOT know me. These opinions do conflict, I perceive it plainly; I cannot reconcile them, neither can I, by argument, dismiss either of the two, or even persuade one to outweigh the other. The matter standeth simply thus: she MUST have known my face, my figure, my voice, for how could it be otherwise? Yet she SAID she knew me not, and that is proof perfect, for she cannot lie. But stop--I think I begin to see. Peradventure he hath influenced her, commanded her, compelled her to lie. That is the solution. The riddle is unriddled. She seemed dead with fear--yes, she was under his compulsion. I will seek her; I will find her; now that he is away, she will speak her true mind. She will remember the old times <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>little</b> playfellows together, and this will soften her heart, and she will no more betray me, but will confess me. There is no treacherous blood in her--no, she was always honest and true. She has loved me, in those old days--this is my security; for whom one has loved, one cannot betray." ...|$|E
40|$|The letter reads: "Dear Bill, Let me {{thank you}} for {{inviting}} me to participate on the panel of Civil Rights at the Southern Labor School of AFL-CIO. It was truly a very meaningful experience. Equally, having the opportunity to talk with you en route and upon my return to Atlanta was most enjoyable as well as stimulating. The enclosed letter to Mr. Meany speaks to our conversation regarding his participating in our January 13 - 15 annual meeting and MLK birthday celebration as speaker on January 13, 1977. I hope that you can help to expedite this matter. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> very late with out planning this year due to my total involvement in the presidential election.

6000|$|During my school-days I {{had been}} intimately {{associated}} with a lad named Percy Phelps, who was of much {{the same age as}} myself, though he was two classes ahead of me. He was a very brilliant boy, and carried away every prize which the school had to offer, finished his exploits by winning a scholarship which sent him on to continue his triumphant career at Cambridge. He was, I remember, extremely well connected, and even <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all <b>little</b> boys together we knew that his mother's brother was Lord Holdhurst, the great conservative politician. This gaudy relationship did him little good at school. On the contrary, it seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him about the playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. But it was another thing when he came out into the world. I heard vaguely that his abilities and the influences which he commanded had won him a good position at the Foreign Office, and then he passed completely out of my mind until the following letter recalled his existence: ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{carpenter}} of {{the name}} of Bates was called in, so distant a relative of Mrs Bowater's apparently that she never by nod, word, or look acknowledged the bond.
