5|$|Parker and Stone <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> {{with the}} episode, but {{received}} feedback from fans {{that it was}} one of the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had nothing to do with the plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} a {{financial}} {{success for the}} NZRFU. The NZRFU had asked for a £500 financial guarantee from the SRU for the game, but because of their poor finances, the SRU offered instead to give the entire gate (minus expenses). Due to a big attendance, the NZRFU received a fee of over £1700 for the game. Although the SRU <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with this (they offered the same terms to the Springboks when they toured in 1906), there were also concerns about the three shillings a day each All Black received whilst on tour. After {{they found that the}} Rugby Football Union had approved the payments, a Calcutta Cup match was cancelled.|$|E

25|$|Although {{this was}} not a happy result for Brogdens, the results for New Zealand and the {{families}} themselves were good. New Zealand obtained useful citizens who <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with their work, wages, food and social conditions. Their letters home encouraged more people to come. Many of today's New Zealanders have ancestors who were members of the families who emigrated at this time.|$|E
25|$|The only {{case of a}} {{polygamous}} rabbi {{recorded in}} the Talmud provides an excellent illustration: Rabbi Tarfon married 300 women. Why? Because there was a famine in the land. But Rabbi Tarfon had plenty of food, {{since he was a}} kohen and received the priestly tithes. The wife of a kohen is also permitted to eat those tithes. Those 300 women <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> that the Torah permitted polygamy.|$|E

The European explorer Samuel Hearne traveled with Chipewyan Dene in 1771 and recorded {{their views on}} the ed-thin ('caribou'). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when caribou fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy.</b>|$|E

25|$|The expedition's {{weaponry}} and askaris {{had proved}} their superiority over muskets and Msiri's people {{were more interested}} in the succession than revenge. Stairs backed Mukanda-Bantu to succeed Msiri, but as chief of a reduced territory, and he restored the Wasanga chiefs overthrown by Msiri 30 years before. Mukanda-Bantu signed the treaties, and the restored Wasanga chiefs <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> to do so too. Msiri's brothers were unhappy with the sub-chieftainships they were given and refused to sign up, until threatened with the same fate as Msiri. By early January 1892 the expedition had the papers sufficient to convince their British rivals that they now had Katanga.|$|E
25|$|Episode four: Chris and Tracey - Tracey and Chris {{have been}} married {{just over a year}} and were very much in love. But even though they <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> together, they feel under {{constant}} pressure from others around them, because Tracey is forty-two and her husband Chris is just twenty-four. With an eighteen-year age gap, Chris is often mistaken for Tracey's son. Woodall and Susannah see that both their wardrobes needed revamping and modernising which will help the couple bridge their age gap. Tracey and Chris hope that by dressing differently they might begin to look more like a couple and be more accepted together. Constantine helps Tracey to overcome her body insecurities by investing in some good items that will emphasize her good figure. As a result of a new appearance, Tracey begins to feel more glamorous. The pair are given a new look and are once again reunited.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} {{staff for}} Smallville <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with the finished result. Gough and Millar {{wrote that the}} episode was a [...] "tour de force of writing, directing, and acting." [...] Allison Mack called the entry [...] "thrilling and exciting". Producer Rob Maier was particularly proud of the final cut, noting, [...] "The highlight of season five was the hundredth episode [...] It was a remarkable show." [...] Welling, however, found that Schneider's departure from the series was [...] "bittersweet".|$|E

He {{was included in the}} film's plot only when a fitting opportunity to involve him arose, and Spotnitz and Carter <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> to write Skinner into the story. The scenes of The X-Files: I Want to Believe that include Skinner were filmed very late in the movie's filming schedule, and the particular scene that acts as the character's introduction in the movie was filmed, for reasons of time, in two different locations.|$|E

500|$|While seeking {{funding for}} the film, Six pitched {{the idea of a}} surgeon who sewed people together. [...] He did not {{initially}} reveal that the victims would be joined mouth-to-anus, as he believed this idea would stand no chance of receiving investments. His backers felt that the idea of a surgeon sewing people together was original and Six received funding. However, they did not learn the exact details of the film until it had been completed. Six claimed that they <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with the finished film. Before signing on, the actors were given an outline of the storyboard rather than a complete script. They were also shown sketches of how the centipede would be formed.|$|E
500|$|Pemberton knew McShera {{through his}} friend Siobhan Finneran, who co-starred with McShera in Downton Abbey.

The writers found the role of [...] "Blue Demon Dwarf" [...] difficult to cast, but <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with the performance of Starkey, who kept some of his character's props. The writers also praised Lowe, who they felt was able {{to make a lot of}} a comparatively small part. The character of Amanda, they said, was to seem bored and aloof, attempting to get away with doing as little work as possible, while also favouring people seen as more important.|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] began a four-week {{break for}} the series, though the {{producers}} initially thought this gap would commence with the following episode.

We <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> this ended up being one before we went on a little break. I think the fans are going to be well satisfied to come back and watch the next one as well." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scheduling}} problems {{meant that}} the show {{did not get the}} momentum to achieve high viewing figures. Moffat jokes that [...] "the eight people who saw it <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> indeed". However, as Bathurst observes, [...] "there's an underground of people who like it". The show rated highly on the Appreciation Index, meaning that viewers thought very highly of the programme. Bathurst says that drunks on the London Underground tell him in detail the plot of their favourite episode. The cast claim that the programme has a timeless, universal appeal as there are no time-specific references apart from the typewriter {{and the size of the}} mobile telephones. Gillies says that her accountant watches it to cheer himself up, while Bathurst recalls that a friend cheered so loudly when Mark pushes avocado into Trevor's face in the third episode that he woke his son.|$|E

[...] "We brought in a guy the results we <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with. The team started {{to look like a}} real team again.
