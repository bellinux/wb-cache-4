500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

2500|$|During a {{break in}} filming of The Late Late Show with James Corden carpool karaoke segment which aired on June 14, 2016 and {{featured}} the band singing karaoke to their music with the host while driving through Los Angeles, Kiedis performed emergency CPR on a baby. [...] "a woman {{came out of her}} house, holding a child saying, 'My baby, my baby, my baby can't breathe!'" [...] Kiedis said. [...] "the woman thrust the baby into my arms, the baby was not breathing and I thought, 'I'm gonna try and do a little baby CPR real quick, see if I can get some air in this kid. So I started rubbing the belly, bubbles came out of the mouth, the eyes rolled back into place, the ambulance showed up and I handed the baby over, who was now breathing and fine, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Carpool Karaoke." ...|$|E

There was so much dust we could not see much, but the Indians rode around and yelled the war-whoop and shot into the soldiers {{as fast as they}} could until they were all dead. One soldier was running away to the east but Crazy Horse saw him and jumped on his pony and went after him. He got him about half a mile from the place where the other soldiers were lying dead. The smoke was lifted so we could see a little. We got off our horses and went and took the rings and money and watches from the soldiers. We took some clothes off too, and all the guns and pistols. We got seven hundred guns and pistols. Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the women and children and got them together that were not killed or hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 10 July 1972, while moored at Pier 12, Norfolk, Forrestal {{was once}} again {{the scene of a}} catastrophic fire. This fire, which was set by a crewmember, was in an O-3 level {{computer}} room (just under the flight deck). A hole was cut in the flight deck to reach the fire from above and hundreds of gallons of water were pumped into the space. This ruined all of the computer equipment and the ship took on an exaggerated list, prompting concern that she might capsize. The ship returned to the yards at Portsmouth and three months later was at last able to relieve , which had to serve an extended Mediterranean deployment while the Forrestal was being repaired. Electrician's Mate Robert Horan, who was aboard at the time, recalls in a memoir [...] " [...] over seven million dollars in damage. The news videos...show the flight deck glowing red. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Portsmouth for repairs and I believe we got most of the CIC and electronics equipment that was supposed to go on board the , then under construction." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lowe {{improved}} {{his upper body}} strength {{as a result of}} an exercise regimen that included 400 chin-ups and hundreds of dips. [...] In an article for , Gordon Wiltsie, a photographer who climbed with Lowe in Antarctica and Canada's Baffin Island, said, [...] "he'd hog the pull-up bar to knock out 400 pull-ups in sets of 40 and 45. He disliked downtime and knew where to do pull-ups in many airports. Even on expeditions, when rest is hard to come by and much appreciated, Lowe was an oddball. He'd cop pull-ups on a ship's rigging en route to Antarctica, or do dips in a snow pit he dug at base camp." [...] In that article, Wiltsie said, [...] "At Baffin Island, after hauling supplies to a high point on a climb, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp beat and tired, but Alex proceeded to do pull-up after pull-up. He even brought an exercise device on climbs." [...] He was known jokingly as [...] "Lungs With Legs" [...] for his incredible strength and stamina.|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Gamasutra, Twisted Pixel CEO Michael Wilford {{revealed}} that though the developers had plans for downloadable content from the beginning, decisions {{on what would}} be included in that content were not made until after the game was released. [...] " [...] didn't work on {{them in any way}} until after the main game was wrapped," [...] stated Wilford. [...] "Once the game was out of our hands, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the drawing board to design everything from scratch, but we obviously had a lot of half-finished pieces on the cutting room floor that we could leverage." [...] Wilford further explained that due to the way The Maw ends extending past the ending would not be possible. [...] Therefore, plans were made for the downloadable content to be dubbed [...] "Deleted Scenes"; levels that take place inside the story of the main game. Wilford was quick to note that these levels were not simply unlock codes that provided the player with access to things already in the game. [...] "I think some people took it to mean that we intentionally stripped out levels that were 100 percent complete only to sell them as DLC," [...] he said, adding that it was [...] "not the case." ...|$|E
