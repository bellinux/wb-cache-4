25|$|Stating the {{efficiency}} of <b>wind</b> <b>noise</b> reduction is an inexact science, since the effect varies enormously with frequency, and hence with the bandwidth of the microphone and audio channel. At very low frequencies (10–100Hz) where massive wind energy exists, reductions are important to avoid overloading of the audio chain – particularly the early stages. This can produce the typical “wumping” sound associated with wind, which is often syllabic muting of the audio due to LF peak limiting. At higher frequencies – 200Hz to ~3kHz – the aural sensitivity curve allows us to hear the effect of wind as an addition to the normal noise floor, {{even though it has}} a far lower energy content. Simple shields may allow the <b>wind</b> <b>noise</b> to be 10dB less apparent; better ones can achieve nearer to a 50dB reduction. However the acoustic transparency, particularly at HF, should also be indicated, since a very high level of wind attenuation could be associated with very muffled audio.|$|E
25|$|Windscreens (or {{windshields}} – {{the terms}} are interchangeable) {{provide a method}} of reducing the effect of wind on microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam “hats” shield wind into the grille from all directions, and blimps / zeppelins / baskets entirely enclose the microphone and protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low frequency content of <b>wind</b> <b>noise,</b> vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.|$|E
25|$|Since all <b>wind</b> <b>noise</b> is {{generated}} {{at the first}} surface the air hits, the greater the spacing between shield periphery and microphone capsule, the greater the noise attenuation. For an approximately spherical shield, attenuation increases by (approximately) the cube of that distance. Thus larger shields are always much more efficient than smaller ones. With full basket windshields there is an additional pressure chamber effect, first explained by Joerg Wuttke, which, for two-port (pressure gradient) microphones, allows the shield/microphone combination {{to act as a}} high-pass acoustic filter.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> {{exposure}} and suspected health-related effects thereof have attracted substantial attention. Various {{symptoms such as}} sleep-related problems, headache, tinnitus and vertigo have been described by subjects suspected of having been exposed to <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise.</b> OBJECTIVE: This review was conducted systematically {{with the purpose of}} identifying any reported associations between <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> {{exposure and}} suspected health-related effects. DATA SOURCES: A search of the scientific literature concerning the health-related effects of <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and various other Internet sources. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All studies investigating suspected health-related outcomes associated with <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> exposure were included. RESULTS: <b>Wind</b> turbines emit <b>noise,</b> including low-frequency noise, which decreases incrementally with increases in distance from the wind turbines. Likewise, evidence of a dose-response relationship between <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> linked to noise annoyance, sleep disturbance and possibly even psychological distress was present in the literature. Currently, there is no further existing statistically-significant evidence indicating any association between <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> exposure and tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo or headache. LIMITATIONS: Selection bias and information bias of differing magnitudes were found to be present in all current studies investigating <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> exposure and adverse health effects. Only articles published in English, German or Scandinavian languages were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to wind turbines does seem to increase the risk of annoyance and self-reported sleep disturbance in a dose-response relationship. There appears, though, to be a tolerable level of around LAeq of 35 dB. Of the many other claimed health effects of <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> exposure reported in the literature, however, no conclusive evidence could be found.

If not matted by wind and rain, the fur fibres are very transparent acoustically, but the woven or knitted backing can give significant attenuation. As a material it suffers from being difficult to manufacture with consistency, and to keep in pristine condition on location.

Up to now, not all aspects of the generation, propagation and perception of <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> are well understood.

The audibility of wind turbine sound {{is influenced by}} ambient sound. This thesis deals with some aspects of <b>noise</b> from <b>wind</b> turbines. Ambient sounds influence the audibility of <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise.</b> Models for assessing two commonly occurring natural ambient sounds namely vegetation sound and sound from breaking waves are presented in paper A and B. A sound propagation algorithm {{has been compared to}} long range measurementsof sound propagation in paper C. Psycho-acoustic tests evaluating the threshold and partial loudness of <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> when mixed with natural ambient sounds have been performed. These are accounted for in paper D. The main scientific contributions are the following. Paper A: A semi-empiric prediction model for vegetation sound is proposed. This model uses up-to-date simulations of wind profiles and turbulent wind fields to estimate sound from vegetation. The fluctuations due to turbulence are satisfactory estimated by the model. Predictions of vegetation sound also show good agreement to measured spectra. Paper B: A set of measurements of air-borne sound from breaking waves are reported. From these measurements a prediction method of sound from breaking waves is proposed. Third octave spectra from breaking waves are shown to depend on breaker type. Satisfactory agreement between predictions and measurements has been achieved. Paper C: Long range sound propagation over a sea surface was investigated. Measurements of sound transmission were coordinated with local meteorological measurements. A sound propagation algorithm has been compared to the measured sound transmission. Satisfactory agreement between measurements and predictions were achieved when turbulence were taken into consideration in the computations.

I studied 14 leks located in the area surrounding a 36 -turbine wind energy facility. I used two main approaches in this study. First, I recorded Greater Prairie-Chicken boom, cackle, whine, and whoop vocalizations {{at each of the}} study leks and measured the duration, sound pressure level, peak frequency, dominant frequency, fundamental frequency, bandwidth and nonlinearities of each vocalization. I used linear models to determine whether the vocalizations at leks near the wind energy facility differed from vocalizations at leks farther away. I found that within 1000 meters of the wind energy facility, boom and whoop sound pressure levels were higher, boom duration was shorter, whine fundamental frequency was higher, and cackle biphonations occurred less often. These differences suggest that male Greater Prairie-Chickens are adjusting aspects of their vocalizations in response to <b>wind</b> turbine <b>noise.</b> In the second approach, I placed audio recorders along transects extending from leks to record the sound of the Greater Prairie-Chicken chorus. I also placed audio recorders at locations in a grid formation overlaid on the wind energy facility.

Measurements were conducted at four wind speeds according to a design of experiments at incremental distances and angles. <b>Wind</b> turbine <b>noise</b> is shown to be highly directional, while downwind sound propagation is spherical with limited ground absorption. The noise is {{found to have a}} significant low frequency component that is largely independent of wind speed over the 20 - 250 Hz range. The generated low frequency noise is shown to be audible above 40 Hz at the MOE setback distance of 550 m. Infrasound levels exhibit higher dependency on wind speed, but remain below audible levels up to 15 m/s...|$|R
