5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will <b>wander</b> into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to <b>wander</b> outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
40|$|Mind <b>wandering</b> {{seems to}} be a prototypical feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD). However, an important emerging distinction of mind-wandering types hinges on whether a given episode of mind <b>wandering</b> reflects a failure of executive control (spontaneous mind <b>wandering)</b> or the engagement of controlled processes for internal processing (deliberate mind <b>wandering).</b> Here we distinguish between spontaneous and deliberate mind <b>wandering</b> and test the hypothesis that symptoms of ADHD are associated with the former but not the latter. We assessed ADHD symptomatology and everyday levels of deliberate and spontaneous mind <b>wandering</b> in two large non-clinical samples (Ns = 1, 354). In addition, to provide converging evidence, we examined rates of deliberate and spontaneous mind <b>wandering</b> in a clinically diagnosed ADHD sample.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between feelings and opinions, non-wandering patterns, and types of <b>wandering</b> in wanderers with Alzheimer's Disease, with the ultimate aim of exploring methods of nursing care appropriate to their feelings while <b>wandering.</b> There were basically two types of <b>wandering,</b> purposeful and non-purposeful. The former could be categorized into four types, work, going home, interaction, and physiological. Regardless {{of the degree of}} impaired cognitive function, two or more <b>wandering</b> types were exhibited by all participants, and the combination of types differed from individual to individual. Feelings were broadly classified into positive and negative in investigating the relationship between feelings during <b>wandering</b> and types of <b>wandering.</b> In three purposeful types of <b>wandering</b> (except for going home) - work, interaction, physiological - feelings were positive in the case of accomplishing their purposes but negative in the reverse case, and were also negative in the non-purposeful type. Four patterns in the non-wandering situations - concentrating, peace of mind, relating to others, and physiological needs - were identified. The best pattern for discontinuing <b>wandering</b> was peace of mind, which was effective for all five <b>wandering</b> types. In particular, for the going home <b>wandering</b> type, this {{was the only way to}} discontinue <b>wandering.</b> On the other hand, work and physiological types were available in all four patterns as an effective way to discontinue <b>wandering.</b> 本研究では,認知症高齢者の徘徊時の気持ちや徘徊中断について聴取,および観察を行なった。認知症高齢者の徘徊の目的および理由と徘徊時の気持ちや徘徊を中断するときの関連から,徘徊者の気持ちを踏まえたより効果的な援助方法を探ることが目的である。徘徊には大きく分けて,有目的と無目的の二つのパターンがあり,前者は,さらに「勤勉性」「帰宅願望性」「親密性」「生理的要因性」の四つのタイプに分類された。個人を主体とした徘徊行動では,全ての対象者のタイプは単一ではなく,認知レベルにかかわらず,二ないし五タイプであり,個人における組み合わせも異なっていた。また,徘徊時には,肯定的及び否定的な感情があり,非徘徊時のパターンには,「集中する」「精神的安寧が得られる」「他者と関わる」「生理的欲求がある」があった。そして,「精神的安寧が得られる」ことは全ての徘徊行動パターンに有効な徘徊中断への対応方法であった。原著Original Article国立情報学研究所で電子...|$|R

40|$|Mind <b>wandering</b> is a {{pervasive}} aspect of mental life. <b>Wandering</b> minds {{often lead to}} performance decrements during demanding tasks that require concentration, highlighting the need for devising strategies to ward off mind <b>wandering</b> and to mitigate its deleterious effects on task performance. Accordingly, this dissertation investigated whether a brief mindfulness intervention could reduce mind <b>wandering.</b> Experiment 1 examined {{the influence of the}} brief mindfulness intervention on mind <b>wandering</b> during an ecologically valid sustained attention task, i. e., learning from a lecture video, and on the disruptive effects of mind <b>wandering</b> on lecture comprehension. Experiment 1 provided no supporting evidence for the beneficial influence of the brief intervention on the occurrence of mind <b>wandering</b> during the lecture video, nor on the disruptive effects of mind <b>wandering</b> on lecture comprehension. Experiment 2 examined whether the brief mindfulness intervention could reduce behavioral indices of mind <b>wandering</b> during a widely-used sustained attention to response task (the SART). Experiment 2 produced no evidence for the beneficial influence of the brief intervention on mind <b>wandering</b> during the SART either. Taken together, the current experiments indicate that the brief mindfulness intervention employed in this dissertation exerted no beneficial effects on attentional control and mind <b>wandering</b> during demanding tasks, underscoring the importance of examining more robust mindfulness interventions in future investigations. The dissertation also examined the mediating role of self-reported trait mindfulness in the relationship between self-reported media multitasking frequency and mind <b>wandering</b> tendency. The mediation analysis revealed that trait mindfulness partially mediated the relationship between media multitasking frequency and mind <b>wandering</b> tendency. This partial mediation model suggests that habitual media multitasking is associated with an increased proclivity for mind <b>wandering</b> and that increased frequency of media multitasking is associated with lower levels of mindfulness, which is in turn associated with greater propensity for mind <b>wandering.</b> Therefore, it is plausible that habitual media multitaskers may find it onerous to prevent their minds from <b>wandering</b> because they compromise top-down attentional control while frequently and consistently switching attention among multiple forms of media, diminishing their ability to stay focused on a single task...|$|R
40|$|Mind <b>wandering</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as a possible cause for stress-related working memory (WM) task impairments following laboratory stressors. The current study attempted to induce mind <b>wandering</b> regarding negative, positive, or neutral events using an expressive writing task and examined the impact on WM task performance. We examined the role of mind <b>wandering</b> in understanding the impact of life stress on WM. Additionally, we explored the role of thought suppression on the relationship between mind <b>wandering</b> and WM. One hundred and fifty participants completed WM measures before (Time 1) and after (Time 2) the writing manipulation. The writing manipulation did not alter mind <b>wandering</b> or WM task performance. Time 1 WM predicted mind <b>wandering</b> during the Time 2 WM task, which subsequently predicted poorer Time 2 WM task performance. The impact of daily life stress on WM was mediated by mind <b>wandering.</b> Trait levels of thought suppression moderated the impact of mind <b>wandering</b> on WM.

40|$|Although mind <b>wandering</b> as a {{cognitive}} distraction is universal {{in our daily}} driving, very few {{studies have focused on}} the impact of mind <b>wandering</b> on driving behavior. In this study, the relationship between mind <b>wandering</b> during everyday life and dangerous driving behavior was investigated. 295 drivers completed the Mind <b>Wandering</b> scale (MW), the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI), and Demographic questionnaire. The results showed that the frequency of mind <b>wandering</b> was positively correlated with risky driving, aggressive driving, negative cognitive/emotional driving and drunk driving as measured by the DDDI. In addition, drivers&# 39; mind <b>wandering</b> was also positively correlated with self-reported traffic accidents, penalty points and fines. Moreover, the interaction effects of mind <b>wandering</b> and gender on dangerous driving behavior were also explored. In the high mind <b>wandering</b> group, male drivers reported more risky and negative emotional driving behaviors than did female drivers, but {{there were no significant differences}} in the middle and low mind <b>wandering</b> groups. Also, male drivers reported more penalty points and fines, but were involved in fewer accidents than were female drivers. These results present considerable implications for road safety and strategies for self-regulation of mind <b>wandering.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The ‘aggressive wandering’ {{behaviour}} of male fiddler crabs is {{well documented}} in several species and is usually described as an apparently random movement through a population, punctuated by threats and combat directed at displaying males, and superficial burrow explorations.
