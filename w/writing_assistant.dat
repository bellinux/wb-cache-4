500|$|Chartwell {{was mostly}} unused during the Second World War. Its exposed {{position}} in a county so near to German occupied France, meant that it was vulnerable to a German airstrike or commando raid. As a precaution the lakes were covered with brushwood to make the house less identifiable from the air.

At dinner at Chequers, in December 1940, John Colville, Churchill's assistant private secretary recorded his master's post-war plans, [...] "He would retire to Chartwell and write a book on the war, which he had already mapped out in his mind chapter by chapter".|$|E
