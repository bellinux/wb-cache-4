40|$|Scientific and {{technological}} issues and considerations regarding {{the integration of}} miniaturized microphotonic devices, circuits and systems in micron, submicron, and quantum scale, are presented. First, <b>we</b> examine <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> regarding <b>the</b> miniaturization of photonic devices including the size effect, proximity effect, energy confinement effect, microcavity effect, optical and quantum interference effect, high field effect, nonlinear effect, noise effect, quantum optical effect, and chaotic effect. Secondly, <b>we</b> examine <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> regarding <b>the</b> interconnection including the optical alignment, minimizing the interconnection losses, and maintaining optical modes. Thirdly, <b>we</b> address <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> regarding <b>the</b> two-dimensional or three-dimensional integration either in a hybrid format or in a monolithic format between active devices and passive devices of varying functions. <b>We</b> find that <b>the</b> concept of optical printed circuit board (O-PCB) that we propose is highly attractive as a platform for micro/nano/quantum-scale photonic integration. <b>We</b> examine <b>the</b> technological <b>issues</b> {{to be addressed in}} the process of fabrication, characterization, and packaging for actual implementation of the miniaturization, interconnection and integration. Devices that we have used for our study include: mode conversion schemes, micro-ring and micro-racetrack resonator devices, multimode interference devices, lasers, vertical cavity surface emitting microlasers, and their arrays.

" <b>We</b> also consider <b>the</b> regional distribution of costs and benefits under alternative burden sharing schemes. Although <b>the</b> climate <b>issue</b> is often viewed from a global perspective, international negotiators will be acutely interested in how damages and mitigation costs might be distributed among individual regions. Finally, <b>we</b> address <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of decision making under uncertainty.

40|$|Abstract. Past work on {{the active}} network {{architectural}} framework {{has focused on the}} NodeOS and Execution Environment (EE), which offer rather standard programming environments.
