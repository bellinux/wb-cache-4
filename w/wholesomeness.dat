5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification as an indication of <b>wholesomeness.</b> Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the <b>wholesomeness</b> of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, {{and the difficulty of}} maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002, American film critic Roger Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history, praising the depth and artistry of his films.|$|E

25|$|The {{album was}} one of the most {{anticipated}} releases of 2011 due to the sharp rise in Cole's popularity and mainstream fan base. Cole's lyrics perhaps most strikingly deal with issues such as abortion and the consequences of growing up in a fatherless household. However, these themes are incorporated alongside more introspective issues such as relationships, family problems, fame and attempting to be successful – an area which very much links in with the subtitle of the album 'The Sideline Story'. Upon its release, the album was generally well received by critics, who praised the <b>wholesomeness</b> of the album.|$|E
25|$|Howard White's friend Kenny Raught, who {{had worked}} in Howard's Bake Shop in Scranton, had a talent for words and {{a great sense of}} humor. He joined the group in New York and became their writer. He later married their sister Mildred. The trio moved their parents and sister to New York, and soon older sister Edith and her husband {{followed}} to be near them. The family remained very close, living either in the same house or within a few blocks of each other throughout most of their career. The family's closeness was reflected in the style of their performance, which was always family-friendly and had a certain <b>wholesomeness</b> that was appealing to much of their audience.|$|E

[...] Wang is also unhappy, despite the club's success, {{and it is no}} consolation the crowd is having a good time – after all, in the old country, no crowd ever came to his theater expecting to enjoy themselves. [...] Outraged at Harvard's poor acting skills, Wang takes the stage in his place, his stage instincts take over ("Gliding Through My Memories"), and he is soon an enthusiastic supporter of the change, taking the stage name Sammy Fong. [...] Linda advises Mei-li to put on one of her old stripper dresses to attract Ta, but the stratagem backfires, since Ta is attracted to Mei-li because of her <b>wholesomeness.</b> [...] Ta and Mei-li quarrel; she takes her flower drum and leaves Club Chop Suey.|$|E
500|$|Calling {{the song}} [...] "a decidedly {{lubricious}} duet", Alex Needham of New Musical Express said that [...] "She sings about boys, he sings about girls. A simple concept, but an effective one, resulting in Britney’s best single [...] ages." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that The Neptunes' productions on the album, [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] "swaddle her in writhing, kick-the-can beats, but {{never have a}} groove and a verse been so betrayed by a limp chorus." [...] Nicki Tranter of PopMatters said that {{the remainder of the}} album was [...] "tried and tested" [...] dance-pop, noting [...] "Boys" [...] and [...] "Cinderella" [...] revisiting [...] "old Britney territory exploring predictable issues including her love being irreplaceable, her use of the dance floor as an appropriate courting place, and her much-loved girl-ness." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "popping, Janet-esque groove." [...] Yale Daily News writer Catherine Halaby considered the song [...] "an envelope-pushing (when you consider her claims of <b>wholesomeness)</b> smutfest." ...|$|E
500|$|Variety Brian Lowry {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review. He opined that the Lynette storyline looked [...] "extremely promising" [...] {{and enjoyed the}} addition of Joely Fisher to the cast as Lynette's [...] "tight-assed new boss." [...] He identified the Bree storyline as [...] "the real water-cooler sequence" [...] and complimented Marcia Cross' performance. However, Lowry criticized the Gabrielle and Susan storylines, opining that they are [...] "exhibiting signs of wear and tear." [...] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly noted that the episode had [...] "a particularly sleepy opening 20 minutes" [...] while its exciting plot points all occurred {{in the second half}} of the episode. He praised the scene in which Bree changes the tie on Rex's corpse and called Cross' performance throughout the episode [...] "pitch-perfect." [...] Slezak also complimented Huffman's performance, but wondered if Fisher was [...] "a steely enough an actress to go Manolo-a-Manolo with Huffman every week." [...] Though he criticized the repetitive nature of the Susan and Gabrielle storylines, Slezak thought that the Applewhite mystery would help reduce the show's chances of falling into a sophomore slump. He praised Woodward's acting as well as her character's storyline, opining, [...] "there's something so inherently warm and maternal in Woodard's performance, such apple-pie <b>wholesomeness,</b> that it makes her touches of menace all the more chilling." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{considered}} the first South Park musical episode, and included such songs as [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" [...] and [...] "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". Parker and Stone were initially concerned about making a musical because, Parker said, [...] "The general rule was people hated musicals". For the Mr. Hankey character, Parker and Stone adapted most of the elements from the Mr. Hankey short film they planned in college, except that Mr. Hankey {{would prove to be}} real, not a figment of Kyle's imagination. Parker said this was decided because of his frustration with the character Mr. Snuffleupagus in the children's show Sesame Street; for his first 14 years on the show, Mr. Snuffleupagus was an imaginary character seen only by Big Bird, which Parker said [...] "really bummed me out". Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should embody the <b>wholesomeness</b> and morals of cartoons from the 1930s, so they designed him to resemble the version of Mickey Mouse in the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie, particularly in his eyes. For the scenes in which Mr. Hankey smears feces wherever he walks, the animators scanned images of spread out chocolate and fudge and inserted those images into the episode. Parker and Stone had trouble deciding on a voice for Mr. Hankey, but Stone said it came to him while eating a Sausage McMuffin at a McDonald's in New York City, while taking a break from promoting South Park to the press.|$|E
500|$|The 13th season also {{featured}} or spoofed real-life songs and bands. The episode [...] "Fishsticks", which prominently featured rapper Kanye West, includes a two-and-a-half minute song, [...] "Gay Fish", that parodies West's [...] "Heartless". [...] "Gay Fish" [...] satirizes the rapper's tendency {{to rely on}} audio processing to correct his mistakes in pitch. After [...] "Fishsticks" [...] aired, the full song was made available for download on South Park Studios. Several fake Jonas Brothers songs, with lyrics about the band members' physical attractiveness, were written for [...] "The Ring". Some songs also emphasize the band's belief in sexual abstinence, with lyrics like, [...] "Who needs sex and drugs and partying when we can cook a meal and sit around and watch Netflix?" [...] The strongly erotic reactions of the young girls at their concert parody the frenzied female fan reactions the Jonas Brothers tend to elicit, even though their image projects <b>wholesomeness</b> and chastity. In the episode [...] "Whale Wars", Cartman plays the video game Rock Band and performs a rendition, praised by critics, of the Lady Gaga song [...] "Poker Face". [...] On March 16, 2010, Rock Band developer Harmonix released {{this version of the}} song (along with the original version) as downloadable content for the game. In [...] "W.T.F.", during an audition for the boys' professional wrestling league, one of the participants sings a Broadway-style number—parodying the song [...] "Nothing" [...] from A Chorus Line—about why {{he wants to be a}} wrestler. The episode [...] "Fatbeard" [...] received considerable press attention after Ike stated in a letter he would [...] "vomit his balls out through his mouth" [...] if he had to hear anything more about Susan Boyle, the Scottish amateur singer who had recently gained worldwide attention for her performance of [...] "I Dreamed a Dream" [...] on Britain's Got Talent.|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 stars out of 4, {{saying that there}} was [...] "a lot of craft and slyness lurking beneath the circa-1960s goofiness," [...] also stating that [...] "The point, however, is not the plot but the energy. Without {{somebody}} like Nikki Blonsky {{at the heart of}} the movie, it might fall flat, but everybody works at her level of happiness..." [...] Ebert also noted that this film is [...] "a little more innocent than Waters would have made it..." [...] Krishna Shenoi, of the Shenoi Chronicle, called the movie [...] "Shankman's masterpiece," [...] saying that it moved away from his previous works into a different direction, making a light comedy that deals with serious issues maturely. Shenoi also said that the film was everything he wanted Grease to be. Lou Lumenick of The New York Post hailed Hairspray as [...] "The best and most entertaining movie adaptation of a stage musical so far this century— and yes, I’m including the Oscar-winning Chicago," [...] calling it [...] "one of the best-cast movies in recent memory..." [...] New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews called the film [...] "A great big sloppy kiss of entertainment for audiences weary of explosions, CGI effects and sequels, sequels, sequels." [...] The Baltimore Sun review offered Michael Sragow's opinion that [...] "in its entirety, Hairspray has the funny tilt that only a director-choreographer like Shankman can give to a movie," [...] pointing out that Shankman skillfully [...] "puts a new-millennial zing behind exact re-creations of delirious period dances like the Mashed Potato." [...] Dana Stevens from Slate called Hairspray [...] "intermittently tasty, if a little too frantically eager to please." [...] Stevens noted that [...] "Despite its <b>wholesomeness,</b> this version stays remarkably true to the spirit of the original, with one size-60 exception: John Travolta as Edna Turnblad," [...] saying [...] "How you feel about Hairspray will depend entirely on your reaction to this performance..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pancakes are {{associated}} with the day preceding Lent because they were a way to use up rich foods such as eggs, milk, and sugar, before the fasting season of the 40 days of Lent. In addition, pancakes, in Christianity, symbolize [...] "four pillars of the Christian faith—eggs for creation, flour as the mainstay of the human diet, salt for <b>wholesomeness</b> and milk for purity." [...] The liturgical fasting emphasized eating plainer food and refraining from food that would give pleasure: in many cultures, this means no meat, dairy products, or eggs.|$|E
2500|$|The 1910 Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909 {{garnered}} good reviews; Bunin called Gippius's poetry 'electric', {{pointing at}} the peculiar use of oxymoron as an electrifying force in the author's hermetic, impassive world. Some contemporaries found Gippius's works curiously unfeminine. Vladislav Khodasevich spoke of the conflict between her [...] "poetic soul and non-poetic mind." [...] "Everything is strong and spatial in her verse, there is little room for details. Her lively, sharp thought, dressed in emotional complexity, sort of rushes out of her poems, looking for spiritual <b>wholesomeness</b> and ideal harmony," [...] modern scholar Vitaly Orlov said.|$|E
2500|$|According to Fr. Perrella, {{the local}} bishop usually manages the investigatory process, {{working with the}} help of a {{commission}} of experts such as theologians and medical doctors.

Upon completing the investigation, the bishop can either declare the apparition is [...] "true and worthy of belief", declare that it is not true, or seek additional help from the national bishops' conference. If the bishops' conference cannot reach a conclusion, the matter is referred to the Pope, who then calls on the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to either advise or conduct its own investigation.|$|E
2500|$|She graced every {{printed cover}} of Good Housekeeping from December 1917 through April 1933, {{becoming}} the artist with the longest run of illustrated magazine covers. She created {{a total of}} 184 illustrations of family scenes for the magazine. The magazine said of her, [...] "Certainly no other artist is so fitted to understand us, and to make for us pictures so truly an index to what {{we are as a}} magazine are striving for. The holding up to our readers of the highest ideals of the American home, the home with that certain sweet <b>wholesomeness</b> one associates with a sunny living-room—and children." [...] She was one of the highest paid illustrators of the time, earning over $1,500 per cover. Smith also created illustrations for Kodak and Procter & Gamble's Ivory soap over the course of her career. She made illustrations for Collier's magazines and of Charles Dickens' works, like Tiny Tim, Dickens' Children - Ten Children, and David Copperfield.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>wholesomeness</b> of Bunin's {{character}} {{allowed him}} to avoid crises to become virtually the only author of {{the first decades of}} the 20th century to develop gradually and logically. [...] "Bunin is the only one who remains true to himself", Gorky wrote in a letter to Chirikov in 1907. Yet, an outsider to all the contemporary trends and literary movements, Bunin was never truly famous in Russia. Becoming an Academician in 1909 alienated him even more from the critics, the majority of whom saw the Academy's decision to expel Gorky several years earlier as a disgrace. The closest Bunin came to fame was in 1911–1912 when The Village and Dry Valley came out. The former, according to the author, [...] "sketched with sharp cruelty the most striking lines of the Russian soul, its light and dark sides, and its often tragic foundations"; it caused passionate, and occasionally very hostile reactions. [...] "Nobody has ever drawn the [...] village in such a deep historical context before," [...] Maxim Gorky wrote. After this uncompromising book it became impossible to continue to paint the Russian peasantry life in the idealised, narodnik-style way, Bunin single-handedly closed this long chapter in Russian literature. He maintained the truly classic traditions of realism in Russian literature at the very time when they were in the gravest danger, under attack by modernists and decadents. Yet he was far from [...] "traditional" [...] in many ways, introducing to Russian literature a completely new set of characters and a quite novel, laconic way of saying things.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the series {{suffered}} a sophomore slump and that the second season {{failed to live up}} to the first. Henry Goldblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the new season a [...] "B", blaming the deteriorating quality on the fact that it [...] "morphed into four series," [...] with [...] "the actresses wandering through their separate scenes." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today suggested that the series' weakness was due to Marc Cherry leaving the episodic screenwriting to other writing staff members. Variety Brian Lowry gave the season premiere a positive review, opining that the Lynette storyline looked [...] "extremely promising" [...] and enjoyed the addition of Joely Fisher to the cast as Lynette's [...] "tight-assed new boss."

[...] Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC complimented that Applewhite storyline, writing: [...] "Forget Lynette's career stress, Gabrielle's baby daddy drama, and even Bree's new widowhood: This story has legs, and apparently arms." [...] She found it strange that the Bree, Andrew, and Danielle characters showed little emotion in regards to Rex's death. Additionally, she noted that the Lynette and Gabrielle storylines provided comic relief while Susan, a character [...] "so often saddled with the comic relief of the show, had a sad and serious premiere." [...] Sarah Gilbert of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, stating the episode delivered [...] "lots of juicy resolution, several power suits, and, you guessed it, lots of tears and shouting." [...] Aaron Wallace of Ultimate Disney notes Susan's decreasing importance throughout the season, pointing out Bree, who [...] "comfortably moves into position as the show's lead". Also in response to Susan's storyline, many critics saw the character suffer as a result of the declining quality of the second season. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that the writers were making her look [...] "too stupid".|$|E
