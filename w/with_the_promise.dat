5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as {{an adaptive}} skill. It {{has been shown}} that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities. To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|During an {{inspection}} by Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner lures Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph and Nelson into a utility basement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of free mountain bikes and locks the door. Bart escapes through a ventilation shaft and takes Groundskeeper Willie's tractor for a joyride, crashing into Superintendent Chalmers. Rather than giving him detention, Principal Skinner instead expels Bart. After Bart is quickly expelled {{from a new}} private Christian school, Marge decides to homeschool Bart.|$|E
5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always fertile and prosperous. When they left they gave the stones to the locals <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> {{that as long as}} the stones were put out to look over the glen at Bealltainn and put back into the shelter and made secure for the winter at Samhainn then the glen would continue to be fertile.|$|E

5|$|Although Busoni {{met with}} many other artistic personalities who were also basing {{themselves}} in Switzerland during the war (including Stephan Zweig and James Joyce– the former noting Busoni's extensive drinking) he soon found his circumstances limiting. After {{the end of the}} war, he again undertook concert tours in England, Paris and Italy. In London he met with the composer Kaikhosru Sorabji who played to him his Second Piano Sonata (which he dedicated to Busoni); Busoni was sufficiently impressed to write for Sorabji a letter of recommendation. When Busoni's former pupil Leo Kestenberg, now an official at the Ministry of Culture in the German Weimar Republic, invited him to return to Germany, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of a teaching post and productions of his operas, he was very glad to take the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{attempts}} to romance Rain Turner, a gorgeous young woman auditioning {{for a role}} in his new film, leading her on <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of being cast, all the while knowing she is too old for the part. His narration reveals he has done this {{with a number of}} men and women in the past, and yet often comes out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself. Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew. Clay disinterestedly watches a snuff film of the murder—later attributed to Rip—on his iPhone.|$|E
5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E

5|$|In 1451, {{the very}} {{powerful}} Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vukčić Kosača attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, {{and an annual}} income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. Stjepan was so scared by the threat that he finally raised the siege.|$|E
5|$|In August, Judy met Leading Aircraftman Frank Williams, who adopted her {{and shared}} his daily handful of rice. In the camp Judy would {{intervene}} by distracting the guards {{when they were}} administering punishment. She was the only animal to have been officially registered as {{a prisoner of war}} during the Second World War, after Frank William's intervention to protect the dog from the guards, who would often threaten to shoot Judy as the dog growled and barked at them. Williams managed to convince the camp Commandant, who was drunk on sake, to sign the registration papers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of one of Judy's future puppies. Judy's official prisoner-of-war name was '81A Gloergoer Medan'.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic (c. 600 c. 900), {{alliance}} with Calakmul frequently was associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of military support. The fact that Copán, {{a much more}} powerful city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was {{far enough away from}} Quiriguá that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage, Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence.|$|E

50|$|Christopher Snedden {{says that}} the Azad Kashmir {{government}} and the Muslim Conference accepted the agreement because they wanted Azad Kashmir to join Pakistan, which they expected to happen soon <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promised</b> plebiscite.

The disaster for Copán had long-lasting consequences; major construction ceased and no new monuments were raised for the next 17years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{the winners of}} the {{competition}} were granted automatic qualification to the UEFA Cup. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of potential European football, First Division clubs entered the competition, and all 92 Football League clubs entered the League Cup {{for the first time in}} 1969–70. Meanwhile, the final of the competition had also been altered; it would now be played over a single leg at Wembley Stadium. The final went to a replay for the first time in 1977, with Aston Villa requiring two replays to overcome Everton; the first was held at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, and the second at Old Trafford in Manchester.|$|E

5|$|On May 4, 1925, Rossi sent {{a letter}} to Mint Director Robert J. Grant. Rossi noted that there had been some delay in the {{preparation}} of the design for the new half dollar, and that California Senator Samuel M. Shortridge had urged Rossi's committee to move forward without delay. Rossi enclosed sketches by California sculptor Joseph (Jo) Mora, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> that a finished design, and a model, would follow. Citizens' Committee members had selected Mora unanimously, feeling he was the one artist who could capture the spirit of what was being commemorated.|$|E
5|$|Prince Frederick campaigned {{actively}} for {{the opposition}} in the British general election, 1741, and Walpole was unable to secure a stable majority. Walpole attempted to buy off the prince <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of an increased allowance and offered to pay off his debts, but Frederick refused. With his support eroded, Walpole retired in 1742 after over 20 years in office. He was replaced by Spencer Compton, Lord Wilmington, whom George had originally considered for the premiership in 1727. Lord Wilmington, however, was a figurehead; actual power was held by others, such as Lord Carteret, George's favourite minister after Walpole. When Wilmington died in 1743, Henry Pelham took his place {{at the head of}} the government.|$|E
5|$|Substantial combat {{had ended}} {{but the war}} had not, and a formal treaty of peace was months away. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, and had a {{powerful}} fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. Money matters fed the anxiety; the treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive {{almost to the point}} of mutiny. At one point, they forced an adjournment of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton. Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783, and Congress came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of a five-year bonus.|$|E

2500|$|The {{use of the}} {{definite}} article {{before the}} word [...] "Christ" [...] and its gradual development into a proper name show that the Christians identified Jesus <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promised</b> messiah of <b>the</b> Jews who fulfilled all the Messianic predictions in a fuller and a higher sense than had been given them by the rabbis.|$|R
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season began}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24million), Robinho (€30million) and Sergio Ramos (€27million). However, Real Madrid {{suffered}} from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss {{at the hands}} of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005. Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro. A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after losing the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinal, 6–1 to Real Zaragoza. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time {{at the hands of}} Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.|$|E
5|$|The Intel 8080 did {{not have}} {{dedicated}} circuitry to support dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) because in 1975, this type of memory was still a new technology. MITS wanted to use DRAM because it consumed less power than static RAM. However, they had several design and component problems {{that led to a}} high failure rate with their 4K Dynamic RAM board. By July, new companies such as Processor Technology were selling 4K Static RAM boards <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of reliable operation. MITS released its own 4K Static RAM board in January 1976.|$|E
