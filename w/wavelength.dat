5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} <b>wavelength</b> of {{electromagnetic}} radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the <b>wavelength</b> of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E
5|$|Since an {{electron}} behaves as a wave, {{at a given}} velocity it has a characteristic de Broglie <b>wavelength.</b> This is given by λe=h/p where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum. For the 51GeV electron above, the <b>wavelength</b> is about , small enough to explore structures well below {{the size of an}} atomic nucleus.|$|E
2500|$|Rydberg's formula {{accounts}} for the four visible <b>wavelengths</b> of hydrogen by setting [...] and [...] It also predicts additional <b>wavelengths</b> in the emission spectrum: for [...] and for , the emission spectrum should contain certain ultraviolet <b>wavelengths,</b> and for [...] and , it should also contain certain infrared <b>wavelengths.</b> Experimental observation of these <b>wavelengths</b> came two decades later: in 1908 Louis Paschen found some of the predicted infrared <b>wavelengths,</b> and in 1914 Theodore Lyman found some of the predicted ultraviolet <b>wavelengths.</b>|$|R
50|$|In clear open waters, {{visible light}} is absorbed at the longest <b>wavelengths</b> first. Thus, red, orange, and yellow <b>wavelengths</b> are absorbed at higher water depths, {{and blue and}} violet <b>wavelengths</b> reach the deepest in the water column. Because the blue and violet <b>wavelengths</b> are absorbed last {{compared}} to the other <b>wavelengths,</b> open ocean waters appear deep-blue to the eye.|$|R
2500|$|For long <b>wavelengths,</b> Rayleigh's 1900 {{heuristic}} formula approximately {{meant that}} energy was proportional to temperature, [...] It {{is known that}} [...] and this leads to [...] and thence to [...] for long <b>wavelengths.</b> But for short <b>wavelengths,</b> the Wien formula leads to [...] and thence to [...] for short <b>wavelengths.</b> Planck perhaps patched together these two heuristic formulas, for long and for short <b>wavelengths,</b> to produce a formula ...|$|R
5|$|The {{spectral}} range of PL is rather wide. Emission <b>wavelength</b> can vary between 0.8 and 2.1 micrometers {{depending on the}} nanotube structure.|$|E
5|$|X-ray powder {{diffraction}} {{has also}} been used to analyse coal balls. The X-rays of a predetermined <b>wavelength</b> are sent through a sample to examine its structure. This reveals information about the crystallographic structure, chemical composition, and physical properties of the examined material. The scattered intensity of the X-ray pattern is observed and analysed, with the measurements consisting of incident and scattered angle, polarisation, and <b>wavelength</b> or energy.|$|E
5|$|An inelastic {{collision}} between a photon (light) and a solitary (free) electron is called Compton scattering. This collision {{results in a}} transfer of momentum and energy between the particles, which modifies the <b>wavelength</b> of the photon by an amount called the Compton shift.|$|E
5000|$|The {{composition}} of {{a mixture of}} N attenuating species can be found by measuring the absorbance at N <b>wavelengths</b> (the values of the molar coefficient of attenuation for each species at these <b>wavelengths</b> must also be known). The <b>wavelengths</b> chosen are usually the <b>wavelengths</b> of maximum absorption (absorbance maxima) for the individual species. None of the <b>wavelengths</b> must be an isosbestic point {{for a pair of}} species. The set of the following simultaneous equations can be solved to find the concentrations of each attenuating species: ...|$|R
50|$|Varying the <b>wavelengths</b> of stimuli {{also affect}} the dark {{adaptation}} curve. Long <b>wavelengths,</b> such as extreme red, create {{the absence of}} a distinct rod/cone break as the rod and cone cells have similar sensitivities to light of long <b>wavelengths.</b> Conversely at short <b>wavelengths</b> the rod/cone break is more prominent, because the rod cells are much more sensitive than cones once the rods have dark adapted.|$|R
5000|$|These {{vertically}} propagating mixed Rossby-gravity waves {{were first}} {{observed in the}} stratosphere as westward-propagating mixed waves by M. Yanai. [...] They had the following characteristics: 4-5 days, horizontal wavenumbers of 4 (four waves circling the earth, corresponding to <b>wavelengths</b> of 10,000 km), vertical <b>wavelengths</b> of 4-8 km, and upward group velocity. [...] Similarly, westward-propagating mixed waves were {{also found in the}} Atlantic Ocean by Weisberg et al. (1979) with periods of 31 days, horizontal <b>wavelengths</b> of 1200 km, vertical <b>wavelengths</b> of 1 km, and downward group velocity. [...] Also, the vertically propagating gravity wave component was found in the stratosphere with periods of 35 hours, horizontal <b>wavelengths</b> of 2400 km, and vertical <b>wavelengths</b> of 5 km.|$|R
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and <b>wavelength</b> λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the <b>wavelength</b> of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the <b>wavelength</b> of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Decametric radio bursts (with a <b>wavelength</b> {{of tens of}} meters) {{vary with}} the {{rotation}} of Jupiter, and are influenced by interaction of Io with Jupiter's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one <b>wavelength</b> of light and observed in a different <b>wavelength,</b> so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.|$|E
50|$|First, the {{atmosphere}} may absorb {{part of the}} energy passing through it. This is bad enough for sensing if all <b>wavelengths</b> are affected evenly, but it becomes much more complex when the radiation is of multiple <b>wavelengths,</b> and the attenuation differs among <b>wavelengths.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Melanopsin photoreceptors are {{sensitive}} {{to a range of}} <b>wavelengths</b> and reach peak light absorption at blue light <b>wavelengths</b> around 480 nanometers. [...] Other <b>wavelengths</b> of light activate the melanopsin signaling system with decreasing efficiency as they move away from the optimum 480 nm. For example, shorter <b>wavelengths</b> around 445 nm (closer to violet in the visible spectrum) are half as effective for melanopsin photoreceptor stimulation as light at 480 nm.|$|R
5000|$|Ultraviolet {{astronomy}} is {{the observation}} of electromagnetic radiation at ultraviolet <b>wavelengths</b> between approximately 10 and 320 nanometres; shorter <b>wavelengths</b> - higher energy photons - are studied by X-ray astronomy and gamma ray astronomy. [...] An ultraviolet light is not visible to the human eye. Light at these <b>wavelengths</b> is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these <b>wavelengths</b> must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space.|$|R
5|$|For {{all above}} {{mentioned}} X-ray diffraction methods, the scattering is elastic; the scattered X-rays {{have the same}} <b>wavelength</b> as the incoming X-ray. By contrast, inelastic X-ray scattering methods are useful in studying excitations of the sample, rather than the distribution of its atoms.|$|E
5|$|Holographic {{interferometry}} is {{a technique}} which uses holography to monitor small deformations in single <b>wavelength</b> implementations. In multi-wavelength implementations, {{it is used to}} perform dimensional metrology of large parts and assemblies and to detect larger surface defects.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the <b>wavelength</b> of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the <b>wavelength</b> of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E
500|$|Scientists had {{observed}} that light traveling through a medium would be absorbed at different <b>wavelengths,</b> {{depending on the}} matter-composition of the medium involved. [...] A white light source would emit light at multiple <b>wavelengths</b> over a range of frequencies. [...] A prism {{could be used to}} separate a light source into specific <b>wavelengths.</b> Shining the light through a sample of a material would cause some <b>wavelengths</b> of light to be absorbed, while others would be unaffected and continue to be transmitted. [...] <b>Wavelengths</b> in the resulting absorption spectrum would differ depending upon the atomic and molecular [...] composition if the material involved.|$|R
40|$|Investigators have {{previously}} attempted {{to determine the}} optimal <b>wavelengths</b> to employ for Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) which yield the best separation between absorption and scatter and the least influence of noise. Although these are important criteria {{it is also important}} that the volume of tissue sampled at each of the <b>wavelengths</b> is the same. In our study we have generated spatial sensitivity profiles at multiple <b>wavelengths</b> for a suitable model of tissue optical properties, and studied the spatial sensitivity overlap for different combinations of <b>wavelengths.</b> It is found that including this condition significantly influences the range of optimal <b>wavelengths...</b>|$|R
50|$|Optical filters {{selectively}} transmit {{light in}} a particular range of <b>wavelengths,</b> that is, colours, while blocking the remainder. They can usually pass long <b>wavelengths</b> only (longpass), short <b>wavelengths</b> only (shortpass), or a band of <b>wavelengths,</b> blocking both longer and shorter <b>wavelengths</b> (bandpass). The passband may be narrower or wider; the transition or cutoff between maximal and minimal transmission can be sharp or gradual. There are filters with more complex transmission characteristic, for example with two peaks rather than a single band; these are more usually older designs traditionally used for photography; filters with more regular characteristics are used for scientific and technical work.|$|R

5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the <b>wavelength</b> of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the <b>wavelength</b> of red light. On the long <b>wavelength</b> end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
40|$|ST 25 {{is a key}} acupoint used in the {{treatment}} of ulcerative colitis by moxibustion stimulation, but the biophysical mechanism underlying its effects is still unknown. The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore the biophysical properties of ST 25 acupoint stimulated by moxibustion in a rat model of ulcerative colitis. The infrared radiation intensity of fourteen <b>wavelengths</b> of ST 25 showed significant differences between the normal and model control groups. The intensity of infrared radiation of forty <b>wavelengths</b> showed significant differences compared with the corresponding control points in normal rats. The intensity of infrared radiation of twenty-eight <b>wavelengths</b> showed significant differences compared with the corresponding control points in model rats. The intensity of infrared radiation of nine <b>wavelengths</b> in the herb-partition moxibustion group, eighteen <b>wavelengths</b> in the ginger-partition moxibustion group, seventeen <b>wavelengths</b> in the garlic-partition moxibustion group, and fourteen <b>wavelengths</b> in the warming moxibustion group of the left ST 25 showed significant differences compared with that of the model control group. For the right-hand-side ST 25, these values were 33, 33, 2, and 8 <b>wavelengths,</b> respectively. This indicated that one possible biophysical mechanism of moxibustion on ST 25 in ulcerative colitis model rats might involve changes in the intensity of infrared radiation of ST 25 at different <b>wavelengths...</b>|$|R
