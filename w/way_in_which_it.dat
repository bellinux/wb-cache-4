5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process and the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{correctly}} {{identifies the}} origin of amber as the fossilised resin of pine trees. Evidence cited includes {{the fact that some}} samples exhibit encapsulated insects, a feature readily explained by the presence of a viscous resin. Pliny refers to the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> exerts a charge when rubbed, a property well known to Theophrastus. He devotes considerable space to bees, which he admires for their industry, organisation, and honey, discussing the significance of the queen bee and the use of smoke by beekeepers at the hive to collect honeycomb. He praises the song of the nightingale.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the film had been growing since Noé's adolescence, when he first became {{interested}} in matters of death and existence. In his early twenties—while under influence of psilocybin mushrooms—he saw Robert Montgomery's Lady in the Lake, a 1947 film shot entirely in a first-person perspective. He then decided that, if he ever made a film about the afterlife, that was the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> would be filmed. Noé {{had been working on}} different versions of the screenplay for fifteen years before the film went into production. The story had initially been more linear, and the drafts were set in different locations, including the Andes, France, and New York City. Tokyo was chosen because it could provide colourful environments required for the film's hallucinogenic aspects, and because Japan's repressive drug laws add to the drama, explaining the intensity of the main character's fear of the police.|$|E

25|$|The band's {{name was}} chosen {{due to the}} <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> {{produced}} its songs. Due to conflicting schedules, Tamborello wrote and performed instrumental tracks and then sent the DATs to Gibbard through the United States Postal Service, who then edited the song as he saw fit (adding his vocals along the way) and sent them back to Tamborello.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe {{suffered}} {{their third}} {{loss of the}} series, and although the margin of defeat was smaller, the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was achieved suggested that Zimbabwean coach Kevin Curran still {{had a lot to}} work on. Admittedly, it started very well, as Streak got Vincent out with the third delivery of the match. Ireland continued his happy knack of getting wickets, getting the opposing skipper Stephen Fleming for 23 and Hamish Marshall for 7, as New Zealand struggled to 67 for 4.|$|E

25|$|In later years, this {{oversight}} role was vested in the Native Land Court under the Native Land Court Act of 1862, and later renamed the Māori Land Court. It was through this court that much Māori land was alienated, and the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> functioned is much criticised today. Over the longer term, the land purchase {{aspect of the}} Treaty declined in importance, while the clauses of the Treaty which deal with sovereignty and Māori rights took on greater importance.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the object can be {{increased}} by the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is given and several authors have pointed {{to the fact that}} organs given in altruistic manner acquire greater social worth. Organs given in altruistic manner are thought to say something about the moral character of the people who give them.

25|$|Although Our Southern Highlanders gives {{invaluable}} {{descriptions of}} {{several aspects of}} life in the Smokies in the early 1900s, the book has been criticized for focusing too much on the more sensational facets of mountain life, such as moonshining and those families living in extreme poverty. And while Kephart claimed he received positive feedback from the mountain people, former Hazel Creek resident Duane Oliver recalled that the book angered many of the creek's residents for the stereotypical <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> portrayed them.|$|E

25|$|Millikan's {{enthusiasm for}} {{education}} continued throughout his career, {{and he was}} the coauthor of a popular and influential series of introductory textbooks, which were ahead of their time in many ways. Compared to other books of the time, they treated the subject more in the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was thought about by physicists.

The house had two storeys, but there is almost nothing left of the upper storey. It stands {{in the south of}} the city, halfway up the hill. The house is particularly interesting because of the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is built to align with the lay of the land; the entrance hall slopes down to a courtyard around which the various rooms were arranged.|$|E
25|$|Sticking one's {{tongue out}} at someone is {{considered}} a childish gesture of rudeness and/or defiance in many countries; the act may also have sexual connotations, depending on the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is done. However, in Tibet it {{is considered a}} greeting. In 2009, a farmer from Fabriano, Italy was convicted and fined by the country's highest court for sticking his tongue out at a neighbor {{with whom he had}} been arguing. Proof of the affront had been captured with a cell phone camera. Blowing a raspberry can also be meant as a gesture of derision.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the strongest}} criticisms of the World Bank has been the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is governed. While the World Bank {{represents}} 188 countries, it {{is run by a}} small number of economically powerful countries. These countries (which also provide most of the institution's funding) choose the leadership and senior management of the World Bank, and their interests dominate the bank. Titus Alexander argues that the unequal voting power of western countries and the World Bank's role in developing countries makes it similar to the South African Development Bank under apartheid, and therefore a pillar of global apartheid.|$|E
25|$|Leo {{has begun}} his process of appeal. The trial {{has been noted}} by the press in the north, and the {{reaction}} is strongly disapproving of the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was conducted, but the African-American domestics wonder if the reaction would have been as strong if the victim had been black ("A Rumblin' and a Rollin'"). Lucille tries to help Leo with his appeal, but reveals crucial information to Craig, provoking a fight between Leo and Lucille ("Do it Alone"). Lucille then finds Governor Slaton at a party ("Pretty Music") and attempts to advocate for Leo. She accuses him of either being a fool or a coward if he accepts {{the outcome of the}} trial as is. Meanwhile, Tom Watson approaches Hugh Dorsey and tells him that he will support his bid for governor should he choose to make it.|$|E
25|$|The first {{spectrum}} of SN 2002cx was obtained with FLWO on 2002 May 17, 4 days before B-band max. At this point SN 2002cx {{is similar to}} SN 1997br as both have a blue continuum, with absorption lines from Fe III λ4404 and Fe III λ5129. Si II λ6355 though is not apparent in SN 2002cx at this point, and it has very weak Ca II H & K lines suggesting that SN 2002cx is similar to SN 1991T which also lacked such lines. This spectrum for SN 2002cx has a low expansion velocity measuring only ~6400km s−1. This marked one <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was different from SN 1997br, as SN 1997br's expansion velocity was ~10,400km s−1 {{at the same point}} relative to its own B-band maximum. At the time of measurement SN 2002cx's expansion velocity was the lowest measured for an early time type Ia, Another spectrum taken on 2002 May 20, 1 day before B-band maximum light, showed little evolution from the one taken on 2002 May 17.|$|E
40|$|Impact’ {{has become}} a {{standard}} way of conceptualising the contributions that research makes to policy-making and practice, this reflecting in large part the shift from a state patronage to an investment model of research funding. However, {{little attention has been}} given to the metaphor that underpins the term ‘impact’. Yet this is important because there are <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> can distort our understanding of the public contribution of academic research, and thereby create false expectations about it.

25|$|One {{characteristic}} of postmodern art is its conflation {{of high and}} low culture through the use of industrial materials and pop culture imagery. The use of low forms of art were a part of modernist experimentation as well, as documented in Kirk Varnedoe and Adam Gopnik's 1990–91 show High and Low: Popular Culture and Modern Art at New York's Museum of Modern Art, an exhibition that was universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn. Postmodern art is noted for the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> blurs the distinctions between what is perceived as fine or high art and what is generally seen as low or kitsch art. Whilst this concept of 'blurring' or 'fusing' high art with low art had been experimented during modernism, it only ever became fully endorsed after the advent of the postmodern era. Postmodernism introduced elements of commercialism, kitsch and a general camp aesthetic within its artistic context; postmodernism takes styles from past periods, such as Gothicism, the Renaissance and the Baroque, and mixes them so as to ignore their original use in their corresponding artistic movement. Such elements are common characteristics of what defines postmodern art.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{striking}} aspect of this film version is the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was immediately taken as a commentary on the present government of Venezuela.

[...] Antonio Blanco, who also worked on this adaptation, said that: [...] "We plan to market the film as a Guatemalan story to avoid any problems with authorities."
