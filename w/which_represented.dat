5|$|According to the church, its {{membership}} as of 2016 was 63,392, <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> approximately 60 percent of Tonga's population. The church also reported 166 congregations, one mission, and one temple. However, {{according to the}} 2011 Tongan census, 18,554 people self-identify as Mormon, making it the second-largest religion in the country, ahead of Catholicism and behind Methodism. LDS Church membership statistics are different from self-reported statistics, mainly because the LDS Church does not remove an individual's name from {{its membership}} rolls based on disengagement from the church.|$|E
5|$|After traffic issues {{during the}} 2008 {{reconstruction}} {{work on the}} Wheeling Tunnel, local politicians suggested closing the twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over Wheeling Hill instead. After opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> the affected Wheeling Hill residents, the suggestions were dropped. The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost of the tunnel reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7million, {{due in part to}} the work delays.|$|E
5|$|By early May, the Albanian authorities, {{being unable}} to {{suppress}} the revolt, became willing to start discussions with {{the intervention of the}} International Commission. Thus, Prince William of Wied of Albania asked the Commission, <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> the Albanian government, to initiate negotiations. Subsequently, on May 6, the members of the Commission informed Zografos that they were willing to discuss the demands of the Northern Epirote side.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea's first match {{after the}} final was against Portsmouth in the Premier League. A 2–0 win ensured they {{remained}} in contention for the league, though by May finished in second place. Chelsea did however beat Manchester United to win the 2007 FA Cup Final and complete a cup double. Arsenal played Blackburn Rovers a few days {{after the final}} in a FA Cup replay. They lost the match 1–0; it was Arsenal's third defeat in all competitions <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> their worst run of form in five years.|$|E
5|$|In July 1989 Bremner {{went back}} to Doncaster as manager, who had fallen back into the Fourth Division during his absence. He signed Lincoln City winger John McGinley and Leeds midfielder John Stiles, and led the club to a 20th-place finish in 1989–90, <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> a small {{improvement}} on the previous season. Greater success came in the Football League Trophy, Rovers reaching the area finals, where they were beaten by Third Division leaders Tranmere Rovers.|$|E
5|$|Solar deities play a {{major role}} in many world {{religions}} and mythologies. The ancient Sumerians believed that the sun was Utu, the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, who was identified as the planet Venus. Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash. Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress, and, in iconography, he is usually portrayed with a long beard and clutching a saw, <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> his role as the dispenser of justice.|$|E

5|$|The Griffins {{assigned}} spiritual {{values to}} Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover {{each of these}} in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary color <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition, as World War I slowed construction and planning disputes led to Griffin's dismissal by Prime Minister Billy Hughes after the war ended.|$|E
5|$|The Russian deputy defence minister, , had {{a secret}} meeting with the separatist {{authorities}} in Tskhinvali on 3 August. An evacuation of Ossetian women and children to Russia began on the same day.

5|$|The sixteen contestants were {{initially}} separated into two tribes, named Tagi and Pagong, <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> {{the names of}} their beaches. When ten players remained, the contestants merged into one tribe, named Rattana. While Tagi and Pagong's names and makeups were picked by the producers, Rattana was named by contestants Sean Kenniff and Jenna Lewis, because of a large amount of Rattan wood on the island. After 39 days of competition, corporate trainer Richard Hatch was named the Sole Survivor, defeating whitewater rafting guide Kelly Wiglesworth in a 4–3 jury vote.|$|E
5|$|The team, <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> Michigan Basketball for the ninety-sixth {{season in}} the Big Ten Conference, is {{sometimes}} referred to as Team 96 or Squad 96. Although this team represented Michigan for the ninety-sixth consecutive year, there was controversy as to whether the team should in fact be marketed as Team 96 because the 1908–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team was not properly accounted for among the prior teams. The subsequent team was marketed as Team 98.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E
500|$|The Commission {{was set up}} {{from the}} start {{to act as an}} {{independent}} supranational authority separate from governments; it has been described as [...] "the only body paid to think European".

This is in contrast to the Council, <b>which</b> <b>represents</b> governments, the Parliament, <b>which</b> <b>represents</b> citizens, the Economic and Social Committee, <b>which</b> <b>represents</b> organised civil society, and the Committee of the Regions, <b>which</b> <b>represents</b> local and regional authorities.|$|R

5|$|After the {{completion}} by the 2015 Group {{takeover of the}} club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the Stockport coat of arms, though the Animo et Fide motto was removed, along with a patch of green {{at the base of}} the badge; the flag of Cheshire, featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (<b>which</b> <b>represented</b> Cheshire and Lancashire, owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010–11 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% {{of men and women}} in Sub-Saharan countries were tested <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
5|$|By 2006, Oliver {{had held}} 18 solo {{exhibitions}} of her work, {{half of them}} at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, <b>which</b> <b>represented</b> her throughout {{her career as a}} sculptor.

However, Oliver was represented in numerous international group shows, including five during the period 1983 to 1984, around the time she completed her master's degree in London. Four of the group shows at that time were in the United Kingdom; the fifth was at the Museum of Traditional Industries in Kyoto. Subsequent international group shows included 'Five Australian Artists' at Brest's Centre Culturale in 1988, the year she undertook an artist's residency in that city. Later group shows of which Oliver was part included 'Prospect '93' at the Frankfurter Kunstverein, 'Systems End: Contemporary Art in Australia', which exhibited in several east Asian galleries in 1996, and the Beijing International Biennale in 2003.|$|E
