500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>it</b> be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E

"These two {{responses}} to Metzinger {{and the other}} Cubists at the 1911 Automne have one theme in common:" [...] writes Green et al., [...] "the absurdity of the gap between Cubist painting and appearance. Just as Louis Vauxcelles made the Cubists' repudiation of [...] "current vision" [...] (appearances in nature) the crux of his attacks, {{so most of the}} jokes in the press at the expense of Cubism centered on the question of likeness. If Metzinger's Tea-Time was not like its sitter, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>it</b> mean? Surely nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|At age 76, {{astronaut}} Buzz Aldrin said in {{a television}} documentary, [...] "There was something out there, close enough to be observed, and <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>it</b> be?... Now, obviously {{the three of us}} weren't going to blurt out, 'Hey, Houston, we've got something moving alongside of us and we don't know what it is', you know?... We knew that those transmissions would be heard by all sorts of people and somebody might have demanded we turn back because of aliens or whatever the reason is." [...] They may have seen the Luna 15 spacecraft which the Soviet Union had launched {{at about the same time}} as Apollo 11.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the nature}} of {{the world as a whole}} is altered by age. Everything must pass through {{successive}} phases. Nothing remains forever what it was. Everything is on the move. Everything is transformed by nature and forced into new paths ... The Earth passes through successive phases, so that it can no longer bear <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>it</b> can now <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not before.|$|R
