The wood {{can be worked}} and sawn in any direction and is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and parquetry. [...] Because it is non-staining, is used for kitchen utensils, wooden spoons, bowls, rolling pins and chopping boards. In Scotland it has traditionally been used for making fine boxes, sometimes in association with contrasting, dark-coloured laburnum wood. The reference to the [...] "white maple" [...] in the English Christmas carol, [...] "Wassail, Wassail All Over the Town", [...] in [...] "Our bowl, it is made of the <b>white</b> <b>maple</b> tree" [...] presumably refers not to the silver or <b>white</b> <b>maple</b> (A. saccharinum), which does not occur naturally in Europe, but to the white wood of the sycamore or the field maple, Acer campestre.|$|E

From the window of the room you looked through the bare <b>white</b> <b>maple</b> trees to the sweeping outline of the church shadowed against the night sky, and beyond that, though far off, was the new cemetery where the rector walked of a Sunday (I think I told you why): beyond that again, for the window faced the east, there lay, at no very great distance, the New Jerusalem. There were no better things that a man might look towards from his study window, nor anything that could serve as a better aid to writing.|$|E

The {{smallest}} Sugar-Maples in our streets make a great show as early as the fifth of October, more than any other trees there. As I look up the Main Street, they appear like painted screens standing before the houses; yet many are green. But now, or generally by the seventeenth of October, when almost all Red <b>Maples,</b> and some <b>White</b> <b>Maples,</b> are bare, the large Sugar-Maples also are in their glory, glowing with yellow and red, and show unexpectedly bright and delicate tints. They are remarkable for the contrast they often afford of deep blushing red on one half and green on the other. They become at length dense masses of rich yellow with a deep scarlet blush, or more than blush, on the exposed surfaces. They are the brightest trees now in the street.|$|R
