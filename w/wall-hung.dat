50|$|In the 1990s, {{he began}} a {{landmark}} series of performance events using clay to express and record a personal choreography of art in action. Watching Tetkowski work is like watching an actor prepare for a performance. He builds himself up to a highly charged physical and emotional level until he is fully focused and ready to create. The artist’s energy, movement and gestures are recorded as ‘footprints’ in massive organic disks and <b>wall-hung</b> forms. Embedded in these lush naturalistic forms are fragments of industrial urban culture: iron spikes, screws and hooks. For artist Neil Tetkowski, clay {{is a metaphor for}} the Earth. His art consists of transforming raw material into another state, imbuing it with a sense of soul and identity. What emerges from the kiln are objects the artist calls “ diary notations of actions or events”. It is this pervasive and powerful sense of ‘process’ that engages the viewer of these energetic and muscular works.|$|E
5000|$|The meticulous {{restoration}} {{that followed}} would last {{for over a}} year, nearly twice {{the duration of the}} original construction. In recalling the process Koenig later described the difficulty of “finding the parts.” The mosaic tile that covered the walls of the interior courtyard proved particularly challenging. Restoring the essence of the original kitchen with state-of-the-art appliances also prove difficult. The <b>wall-hung</b> refrigerator of the original design was no longer in production by General Electric so Koenig modified three under-counter Sub-Zero Refrigerators by inverting the motor locations to conform to the plan. Koenig also retrofitted the house with state-of-the-art mechanical and lighting elements including an updated water heater and furnace housed in the utility core. When the process was nearly complete Koenig reflected on the restoration acknowledging “a weird sense of déjà vu in working on the same building forty years after I built it the first time” but confessing “a wonderful feeling about getting it right, again.” ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{telephone}} device weighed {{about twelve}} ounces {{and could be}} held in one hand when mounted on a handle. It reproduced voices better that the large box telephones made earlier and worked well over long circuits but with less volume. It did, however, serve as both transmitter and receiver {{and had to be}} moved from the mouth to the ear depending on whether the caller was speaking or listening. The handle telephone was embraced by Alexander Graham Bell and in June 1878 the Bell Telephone Company began production of its standard handheld model, combined with a <b>wall-hung</b> pushbutton to signal the operator, to sell internationally. The developmental professors at Brown University were given little credit for coming up with this hand-held model. According to the Proceedings of the Rhode Island Historical Society it was Peirce who came up with name [...] "telephone". The wooden telephone set of a transmitter and receiver later became known as the [...] "butterstamp" [...] telephone, due to its resemblance to the wooden dairy butter stamps used at that time for impressing designs onto butter.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{installing}} a pocket door {{rather than a}} hinged door can add an average of ten square feet of floor space, according to building expert Tim Carter, who considers the pocket door [...] "one of the top ten most overlooked items when many architects and builders plan a home". The doors were particularly common in Victorian homes to close off such areas as sitting rooms or dens; however, as architectural tastes changed, many of the hardware manufacturers went out of business. With improvement in the hardware {{and the growth of}} the market for condominiums and town homes, there has been a resurgence of interest in this space-saving feature. Modern residential uses include bathrooms, closets, laundry or utility rooms, or home offices. A <b>wall-hung</b> variation called an [...] "open pocket door" [...] may be used where in-wall installation is impractical; this version is recommended for homes with disabled residents due to greater ease of opening compared to traditional hinged, pull-open doors. One downside to pocket doors is hidden parts and hardware, which can make them difficult to replace or repair when something goes wrong. Fixing the problem might require removing the door and trim and opening up the wall. [...] The 1953-'54 Kaiser Motors Darrin sports car used pocket doors.|$|E

The rest room area accommodates a toilet, cleaner's room, and a crying room (a room to retreat to with children during the service) which has double-glazed fixed window into the nave and acoustic sheeting to one wall. The office and the rest room contain built-in benches, cupboards, tables, chairs and fittings such as <b>wall-hung</b> speakers which are original elements.The vestibule opens to the nave through large, timber-framed glass sliding doors. The body of the church is a large space, brightly lit and uncluttered. The walls and flat ceiling are painted white complimenting the stained and varnished timber elements. The floor is plain concrete squares with a red and gold carpet running the length and width of the aisle. The pews are silky oak, carved with a version of Durer's [...] "Praying Hands" [...] at the aisle end; some have memorial plaques, e.g. Donated by Mr and Mrs A.T. Thompson in memory of Mr and Mrs Hermann Rehbein. The perimeter of the ceiling features a wide band of timber battens emphasising the length of the nave and drawing the eye to the sanctuary. Twelve large windows light the nave. They contain panels depicting scenes from the Gospel of St John in stained and painted glass including portions of older glass from the earlier church, some feature dedications, e.g., In Memory of Mr and Mrs H. Pressler from their children within the glass and on plaques. The nave is electrically lit by wall sconces with glass shades and by fluorescent lights recessed between the ceiling battens.

40|$|The BIOFLAM project {{intends to}} provide {{solutions}} to the problem of environmental impact of combustion of liquid fuels for heating purposes. Oil burners show up to date a very poor power modulation especially at low power outputs, as usually needed in domestic appliances. Liquid biofuels like FAME are also not compatible with conventional oil burner technologies. Furthermore, the integration of oil burners in <b>wall-hung</b> systems requires further burner size reductions. Within the EC-funded BIOFLAM project new liquid fuel fired condensing boilers are being developed showing such major features as a power modulation of at least 10 : 1, ultra low CO and NOx emissions over the entire power modulation range, significantly more compactness than conventional liquid fuel fired boilers and compatibility with renewable liquid fuels like FAME. In order to reach these goals new ceramic premixed liquid fuel burners were developed based on the combination of the innovative cool flame vaporization process and the novel porous medium burner concept. High temperature ceramics, condensing boiler technology with condense water neutralization and innovative burner controls with a power modulation were utilized, in order to realize all the principal advantages of the employed technologies...|$|E
40|$|For micro gas {{turbines}} (MGT) of around 1 kW or less, a commercially suitable recuperator {{must be used}} to produce a thermal efficiency suitable for use in UK Domestic Combined Heat and Power (DCHP). This paper uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate a recuperator design based on a helically coiled pipe-in-pipe heat exchanger which utilises industry standard stock materials and manufacturing techniques. A suitable mesh strategy was established by geometrically modelling separate boundary layer volumes to satisfy y + near wall conditions. A higher mesh density was then used to resolve the core flow. A coiled pipe-in-pipe recuperator solution for a 1 kW MGT DCHP unit was established within the volume envelope suitable for a domestic <b>wall-hung</b> boiler. Using a low MGT pressure ratio (necessitated by using a turbocharger oil cooled journal bearing platform) meant unit size was larger than anticipated. Raising MGT pressure ratio from 2. 15 to 2. 5 could significantly reduce recuperator volume. Dimensional reasoning confirmed the existence of optimum pipe diameter combinations for minimum pressure drop. Maximum heat exchanger effectiveness was achieved using an optimum or minimum pressure drop pipe combination with large pipe length {{as opposed to a}} large pressure drop pipe combination with shorter pipe length...|$|E
40|$|This {{exhibition}} {{included a}} series of 4 Reflective Editors, a smaller vertical-format reflective editor, {{a series of}} prints and a site-specific ‘Blind Screen’ piece. These works were designed to echo the two-column space of the gallery. They featured an aperture/frame-like geometry where the proportion of reflected image is greatly reduced {{in relation to the}} revealed wall. The Blind Screen was installed on site incorporating a continuous band of videotape looped around two apertures on the gallery wall, cutting (‘screening’) the space. This material is highly reflective – similar to the cast acrylic sheet – so the blind screens simultaneously intervened in space and reflected the space around the viewer. This installation was designed to work within the parameters of the exhibition space, which here allowed me to explore a series of ideas across three media: <b>wall-hung</b> reflective editor; the blind screen; and 8 framed screen prints. My main concerns were to further develop ideas of reflection, repetition and serial forms. The prints in particular allowed me to develop a formal ‘language’ underpinning the geometrical development across all media. The prints became for me a new way of exploring repetition and similarity as a core part of my research. The particular strategy for this show was to work out a way for combining different material approaches within a relatively small exhibition space. All my work demands a highly considered placing within each architectural environment and here I utilised the pillars of the room as a ready-made division...|$|E
