5|$|A weather ship, or Ocean Station Vessel, was a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their <b>weather</b> <b>reporting</b> function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science.|$|E
5|$|Isis first {{affected}} Baja California Sur on September 2 as {{a tropical}} storm. Shortly after making landfall, a <b>weather</b> <b>reporting</b> station at San José del Cabo recorded sustained winds of 26mph (42km/h), and gusts reaching up to 46mph (74km/h). A {{station on the}} Islas Marías also reported sustained winds of 54mph (87km/h). The winds left widespread areas without power or telephone. The storm produced heavy rainfall in the southern portion of the peninsula, including a 24‑hour total of 12.99inches (330mm) at Los Cabos and a peak rainfall total of 24.02inches (610mm) at Santiago. A married couple was killed after attempting to cross a flooded stream in Los Cabos. Initially, reports indicated a family was missing in La Paz, though they were later proven false. Flooding from the storm closed all roads {{to the north of}} Los Cabos and caused damage to the roads in the area. Mudslides from the rain buried at least 120cars in the area.|$|E

25|$|Weather {{systems in}} {{temperate}} climates predominantly move from west to east. This gave the Allies an important advantage. The Allied network of weather stations in North America, Greenland, and Iceland allowed the Allies {{to make more}} accurate weather forecasts than the Germans. German meteorologists had weather reports sent by U-boats and weather ships, such as Lauenburg, operating in the North Atlantic. They also had reports from clandestine weather stations in remote parts of the Arctic and readings collected over the Atlantic by specially equipped weather aircraft. However, the ships and clandestine stations were easily captured by the Allies during {{the early part of}} the war. Data from aircraft was incomplete as they were limited in range and susceptible to Allied attack. Regular <b>weather</b> <b>reporting</b> by U-boats put them at risk as it broke radio silence, allowing the Allies to locate them and track their movements by radio triangulation.|$|E
25|$|For the program's first 25 years, weather {{reports were}} {{delivered}} by the host or newsreader. Dave Garroway illustrated the day's forecast by drawing fronts and areas of precipitation on a big chalkboard map of the United States, based on information gathered earlier in the morning from the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. Subsequent hosts John Chancellor and Hugh Downs dropped the chalkboard weather map concept, and instead read a prepared weather summary over a still image of a weather map. When the show converted to all-color broadcasts in 1965, weather maps were prepared and projected on a screen behind Frank Blair, who delivered the forecast immediately after his news summaries. Following Blair's retirement on March 14, 1975, Lew Wood took over the newsreader and <b>weather</b> <b>reporting</b> duties. When Floyd Kalber was brought in as newsreader in 1976, Wood was relegated to weather, sports, roving reporter assignments, and presenting live on-air commercials until his departure in 1978.|$|E

25|$|During the 1930s, {{and up to}} 1938, the British {{government}} progressively {{implemented the}} recommendations of the Maybury Committee Report and related later reports, by organising and installing air traffic control, <b>weather</b> <b>reporting,</b> navigation and radio systems for civilian aviation. In 1938, the Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) was set up by the Air Navigation (Licensing of Public Transport) Order 1938, under the Air Navigation Act 1936 (S.5). Chaired by Trustam Eve, the ATLA issued provisional licences to airports and to air transport companies operating regular services, throughout 1938 and 1939. Licensing, and some subsidising of services, was conditional on agreements that commercial aircraft fleets would be made available to the government in a national emergency. In parallel, the Civil Air Guard scheme of 1938 provided subsidised pilot training in return for future military call-up commitments. At that time, the Air Ministry, headed by Secretary of State for Air, Sir Kingsley Wood, was responsible for both military and civil aviation, and the Director-General of Civil Aviation was Sir Francis Shelmerdine.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the ships}} proved {{versatile}} and durable, and had long second lives postwar. One became a specialized flagship late in her life. Some became oceanographic and hydrographic survey ships, either in U.S. Navy, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, or Greek service. Eighteen {{were transferred to}} the United States Coast Guard – where they became known as Casco-class cutters – between 1946 and 1949 for service mostly as <b>weather</b> <b>reporting</b> ships, a role they played until the late 1960s and early 1970s; some of the Coast Guard ships saw service in the Vietnam War, and one survived as a cutter until 1988. A number of the units of the class were transferred to foreign navies, including those of Ethiopia, Italy, Norway, the Philippines, and South Vietnam, for use as patrol vessels and training ships, and a few saw commercial service as cruise ships in Greece. The murky information available on a unit incorporated into the Vietnam People's Navy {{after the fall of}} South Vietnam in 1975 suggests that she remained active until at least 2000 and may remain active today; even if reports of her longevity are inaccurate, {{it should be noted that}} the last member of this large and long-lived class of ships did not leave service until 1993, when the ship transferred to Italy was decommissioned by the Italian Navy.|$|E
500|$|Midday on September 9, while {{tracking}} nearly due north, Edna's minimum central {{barometric pressure}} fell to , but {{is believed to}} have leveled off shortly thereafter. The radius of hurricane-force winds increased, and the storm may have become asymmetrical, with convection concentrated {{to the right of the}} center, although this was not confirmed due to a lack of data. An approaching weak frontal boundary spread overcast conditions over the Eastern Seaboard north of North Carolina. By September 10, Edna was located just south of Cape Hatteras, passing east of the Outer Banks early the next day. As the hurricane accelerated to the northeast, it began to deteriorate and weaken. Closely following the recent track of Hurricane Carol, Edna approached New England, but diverged from Carol's track upon skirting the eastern coast instead of moving inland. <b>Weather</b> <b>reporting</b> stations in the Mid-Atlantic States reported rapid clearing as the storm gained latitude, while heavy rain and gusty winds enveloped New England.

The storm continued northeastward into Atlantic Canada and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, although the exact time of this transition is unknown.
