5|$|By February 2001 the Workers' Communist Party {{proposed}} making Folkvord the {{new leader}} of the Red Electoral Alliance, since Myhre would resign if {{he was elected to}} parliament. While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was started to make him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's opposition was his close ties to the Workers' Communist Party. At the convention Myhre was re-elected the party's party leader, with Folkvord and Chris Hartmann stepping in as the party's new deputy leaders. Myhre did not become a member of parliament.|$|E

If the Earth's magnetic field <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.|$|E
5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E

5|$|Scientifically, the light-observation {{experiments}} were unsuccessful, as both target locations {{were covered by}} thick cloud cover. However, Schirra was able to view lightning near Woomera, and noted the lights of a city {{a few hundred miles}} from Durban. The filtered photography for the Weather Bureau worked as planned, with 15photographs taken; the conventional color photography was less successful, with several of the 14photographs unusable due to overexposure or excess cloud cover. In the end, the conventional photographs were not used for scientific examination due to these problems. Schirra noted that the sheer amount of cloud coverage, worldwide, could provide problems for future activity of this kind; however, Africa, and the south-western United States, <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> clear. Postflight medical examination of Schirra disclosed nothing significant other than a degree of orthostatic hypotension caused by sitting inside the cramped capsule for hours.|$|E
5|$|The record {{football}} {{attendance at}} the stadium not involving its host team Manchester City is 43,878, which was set at the 2008 UEFA Cup Final game between Zenit Saint Petersburg and Rangers on 14 May 2008. As is customary for such games, the then 47,715 maximum physical capacity of the stadium had been reduced by UEFA to around 44,000 for this final. However, neither limit {{would have been able}} to accommodate the vast number of supporters of the Scottish club, estimated to be in excess of 130,000, that travelled down from Glasgow to Manchester on the day of the game, despite the club's official ticket allocation being just 13,000 and police requests for fans without tickets to stay home. This order of magnitude mismatch between the numbers of traveling fans and those holding tickets ultimately led to a serious public disorder incident in the centre of the city now inextricably associated with this final, despite the fact that the 44,000 or so crowd who watched the game inside the stadium <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> well-behaved.|$|E

25|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose power depended on letters as well as arms, and she {{was familiar with the}} writing of Erasmus, among others, on the subject. She enjoyed and collected books, and moved the royal collection to the Louvre, her principal residence. She delighted in the company of learned men and women, and her court was highly literary. Her government officials, such as secretary-of-state Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy, whose wife translated the epistles of Ovid, <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> at home in literary circles. When she could find the time, Catherine occasionally wrote verses herself, which she would show to the court poets. Her reading was not entirely highbrow, however. A superstitious woman, she believed implicitly in astrology and soothsaying, and her reading matter included The Book of Sibyls and the almanacs of Nostradamus.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} between {{interior and exterior}} - and between structure and image - was to be developed very purposefully in the Renaissance and beyond, especially once the dome became reinstated in the Western tradition as {{a key element in}} church design. Michelangelo's dome for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, as redesigned between 1585 and 1590 by Giacomo della Porta, for example, consists of two domes of which, however, only the inner is structural. Baltasar Neumann, in his baroque churches, perfected light-weight plaster vaults supported by wooden frames. These vaults, which exerted no lateral pressures, <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> suited for elaborate ceiling frescoes. In St Paul's Cathedral in London there is a highly complex system of vaults and faux-vaults. The dome that one sees from the outside is not a vault, but a relatively light-weight wooden-framed structure resting on an invisible - and for its age highly original - catenary vault of brick, below which is another dome, (the dome that one sees from the inside), but of plaster supported by a wood frame. From the inside, one can easily assume that one is looking at the same vault that one sees from the outside.|$|E
25|$|Naval {{architects of}} the 1860s tended to {{increase}} the beam and reduce the length of their armored ships. This change of the proportions maximized the internal volume protected by {{the same amount of}} side armor. It was heralded by Sir Edward James Reed and taken to its extreme by Popov. Popov's coastal battleships Novgorod and Kiev <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> circular in plan. The design attempted to circumvent the limitations of the Treaty of Paris, although construction of the Novgorod and the Kiev began when the treaty had been effectively voided by the outcome of the Franco-Prussian War. Popov wrote that a circular shape results in minimal weight of armor belt for a given displacement. It also minimized the draft of the battleships, which was critical for their intended deployment in the estuary of the Dnieper and the Kerch Strait. Their seagoing capacities, on the contrary, were deemed unimportant. The Novgorod and the Kiev were commissioned in 1873 and 1875. The enormous drag of their wide hulls made their engines ineffective and they could make only 8 knots. Their steering was satisfactory against the stream, and entirely unmanageable downstream. Their rudders were ineffective while their outer propellers disturbed the steering yet had no influence on the speed (and were soon removed). And, finally, these ships were too wide to fit into any existing drydock.|$|E
