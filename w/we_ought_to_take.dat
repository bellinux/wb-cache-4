500|$|Catholic {{theology}} sees conscience as {{the last}} practical [...] "judgment of reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins [...] to do good and to avoid evil". The Second Vatican Council (1962-65) describes: [...] "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and {{to do what is}} good and to avoid evil, tells him inwardly at the right movement: do this, shun that. For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God. His dignity lies in observing this law, and by it he will be judged. His conscience is man’s most secret core, and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths." [...] Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like prudence, but [...] "the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of our relationship with Him, who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern, to understand the path <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>take,</b> and once the decision is made, to move forward, to remain faithful" [...] In terms of logic, conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied. Thus, Catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to revealed norms and norms derived therefrom, so as to form a correct conscience. [...] Catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and with special care before confession. Catholic teaching holds that, [...] "Man has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral decisions. He must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters". This right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with Church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with conscience. [...] A sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking moral truth from authentic sources, that is, seeking to conform oneself to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by Christ to teach it. Nevertheless, despite one's best effort, [...] "t can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed... This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility... In such cases, the person is culpable for the wrong he commits." [...] Some Catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent, not on the level of conscience properly understood, but on the level of the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience. [...] For example, some priests make {{on the use of the}} so-called internal forum solution (which is not sanctioned by the Magisterium) to justify actions or lifestyles incompatible with Church teaching, such as Christ's prohibition of remarriage after divorce or sexual activity outside marriage. The Catholic Church has warned that [...] "rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching... can be at the source of errors in judgment in moral conduct".|$|E
2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of March 1915, Harold Cox began to have reservations {{about some of the}} depositions and about the limited role the Committee was playing in the investigation. [...] He wanted the members to re-interview some of the witnesses, and threatened to resign if his request was not met. [...] Bryce agreed to rewrite the Report’s preface to more clearly explain that the Committee was simply evaluating statements submitted by others and he agreed to permit Cox to reject any deposition he found suspect. [...] Cox had written: [...] "...at the very least <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the precaution of examining the barristers and other persons who have taken depositions," [...] and this request Bryce also granted. [...] He convinced Cox, however, {{that it would not be}} practical to re-interview witnesses, and the editor and former M.P. remained on the Committee.|$|E
2500|$|At 10:00am, October 28, Kennedy {{first learned}} of Khrushchev's {{solution}} to the crisis to remove the 15 Jupiters in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement {{for the world to}} hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. [...] "This is a pretty good play of his," [...] Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March of the year, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. [...] "Most people will think this is a rather even trade and <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of it," [...] Kennedy said. Vice President Lyndon Johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. [...] "We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood," [...] Kennedy said, [...] "when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey. If that's part of the record, then you don't have a very good war." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{issue of}} Precedent is {{concerned}} with professional legal ethics. ln my view, professional ethics are rules about how you do your job, based on moral principles. By virtue {{of the nature of}} the work they do, the reputation of the institution through which they are admitted to practice (the court), and the consequences that can flow if they act inappropriately or incompetently, lawyers are under constant scrutiny in all aspects of their lives. Errors, omissions or misdeeds in both their professional and their personal lives have the potential to damage them, their clients, the profession itself and the court. <b>We</b> <b>ought</b> never <b>to</b> <b>take</b> for granted the trust the public places in us to preserve the integrity of the legal system itself, especially in times when that system may be under threat, either from without or from within...|$|R

40|$|In the Platonic Alcibiades, Socrates raises two central {{philosophical}} questions: Who are <b>we?</b> and: How <b>ought</b> <b>we</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of ourselves? He answers these questions, I argue, in {{his famous}} comparison between eyes and souls. Both answers hinge upon dialectic: self-care functions through dialectic because we are communicating beings. I adduce arguments for this from the set-up and language of the comparison passage. Another important indication is that Socrates expressly refers back to an earlier, aborted attempt to describe who we are {{in terms of using}} discourse. Rather than recommending to Alcibiades a life of contemplation apart from interpersonal exchange, Socrates presents such exchange as central to our self-improvement and identity. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis focuses upon recent Australian {{developments}} in the law of estoppel. It provides a justification and basis in principle {{for the doctrine of}} estoppel described in cases such as Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher (1987 - 1988) 164 C. L. R. 387 and Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen (1990) 170 C. L. R. 394. This basis is found in the principle that <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> all <b>to</b> <b>take</b> reasonable steps <b>to</b> ensure the reliability of the assumptions that we induce in others. Ensuring the "reliability" of an induced assumption means ensuring that a party who relies upon the assumption does not thereby suffer harm: harm {{in the sense that he}} is worse off because the assumption has proved unjustified than he would have been had it never been induced. The thesis suggests a pattern for the development of the Australian law of estoppel reflecting that basis in principle. It further demonstrates the potential usefulness of the doctrine with specific reference to (i) pre-contractual negotiations and letters of intent, (ii) firm offers to contract, (iii) variations of contract unsupported by consideration, and (iv) the "battle of forms". </p...|$|R
60|$|We {{agreed to}} that, but I said I thought <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> go and <b>take</b> one more {{look at our}} old queen before we left. Mrs. Chipperton, who was a really {{sensible}} woman {{when she had a}} chance, objected to this, because, she said, {{it would be better to}} let the old woman alone now. We couldn't do anything for her after we left, and it would be better to let her depend on her own exertions, now that she had got started again on that track. I didn't think that the word exertion was a very good one in Poqua-dilla's case, but I didn't argue the matter. I thought that if some of us dropped around there before we left, and gave her a couple of shillings, it would not interfere much with her mercantile success in the future.|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>taken</b> {{warning from}} the general {{skepticism}} we met with at Toyama, when we proposed the pass. But with the fatal faith {{of a man in}} his guidebook, we ignored the native forebodings. Besides, there were just people enough who knew nothing about it, and therefore thought it could be done, to encourage us in our delusion. Accordingly we left Toyama after lunch in the best of spirits, in jinrikisha, for Kamidaki, or Upper Fall, to which there professed to be a jinrikisha road. The distance was three ri, seven miles and a half. Before we had gone one of them the road gave out, and left us to tack on foot in paths through the rice-fields, which in one long inclination kept mounting before us. Just before reaching the village, a huge tree in full faint purple bloom showed up a little to the left. Under a sudden attack of botanical zeal, I struck across lots to investigate, and after much tacking among the paddy dykes found, to my surprise, on reaching it, that the flowers came from a huge wistaria that had coiled itself up the tree. The vine must have been at least six feet round at the base, and had a body horribly like an enormous boa that swung from branches high in air. The animal look of the vegetable parasite was so lifelike that one both longed and loathed to touch it at the same time.|$|R
40|$|In this {{presentation}} in which I explore {{the idea of}} the academic as public intellectual, I want to set myself up as something of a provocateur and as your self-designated provocateur, the last thing I want to do is define “public intellectual ” or provide a definitive answer to the question, “what constitutes the public intellectual? ” I’d rather put out some points and raise some questions that further complicate the question and, hopefully, generates some discussion. So, I’ll make 6 quick points and provide a decidedly inconclusive conclusion. In my very brief remarks I’ll concentrate on academics and our relationship to the term “public intellectual, ” and use cultural studies as a loose framework for my remarks. The fact that I have chosen to explore this question of academics as intellectuals is being implies that I am assuming that we, well established or budding academics, {{have something to do with}} it; that we might be or <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be, public intellectuals. So I want to start by saying <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> such suppositions for granted. There are academics who hold that being a public intellectual is not part of their job description. Some of them are adamant about pursuing knowledge for knowledge’s sake and quite resistant to calls for them to play the role of public intellectual. In terms of our topic, in their extreme form, such academics are what we might cal...|$|R

40|$|With the {{business}} environments no longer confined to geographical borders, {{the new wave}} of digital technologies has given organizations an enormous opportunity to bring together their distributed workforce and develop the ability to work together despite being apart (Prasad & Akhilesh, 2002). resupposing creativity to be a social process, the way that this phenomenon occurs when the configuration of the team is substantially modified will be questioned. Very {{little is known about the}} impact of interpersonal relationships in the creativity (Kurtzberg & Amabile, 2001). In order to analyse the ways in which the creative process may be developed, <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> into consideration the fact that participants are dealing with a quite an atypical situation. Firstly, in these cases socialization takes place amongst individuals belonging to a geographically dispersed workplace, where interpersonal relationships are mediated by the computer, and where trust must be developed among persons who have never met one another. Participants not only have multiple addresses and locations, but above all different nationalities, and different cultures, attitudes, thoughts, and working patterns, and languages. Therefore, the central research question of this thesis is as follows: “How does the creative process unfold in globally distributed teams?” With a qualitative approach, we used the case study of the Business Unit of Volvo 3 P, an arm of Volvo Group. Throughout this research, we interviewed seven teams engaged in the development of a new product in the chassis and cab areas, for the brands Volvo and Renault Trucks, teams that were geographically distributed in Brazil, Sweden, France and India. Our research suggests that corporate values, alongside with intrinsic motivation and task which lay down the necessary foundations for the development of the creative process in GDT...|$|R
40|$|The {{thoughts}} and observations contained {{in this paper}} were first presented in a preliminary form at the Staff Seminar that I gave at the University of Cape Town (UCT) - Department of Private Law, on Tuesday May 8 2012. The organizers generously offered me a free choice of subject. Such an offer always poses a problem to imaginative people like myself. I finally chose as my subject the role of good faith in contract law theory and practice and then entitled the Seminar “Good Faith & Contracts - Brothers in Arms”. The aim of the talk was to briefly describe what I see behind the doctrine of good faith (and, more broadly, behind the general course of the parties’ behavior {{before and after the}} conclusion of an agreement), to then explain the need of its protection and future reasonable developments by challenging the limitations of both traditional and current legal approaches to contract law theory and practice. By adopting a comparative modus investigandi, it emerged that especially in the area of contract law a new law-finding process is emerging in the European continent and it is leading to re-conceive the meta-national legislative interventions by challenging the limits of Hobbes’s Leviathan. As asserted, <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> not <b>take</b> this process for granted because although there are many forms of social organization, contract is the most pervasive and the law of contract still is the most important vehicle to support and supplement private arrangements. However, the point of departure for theorizing about private law is based on experience. Consequently, despite the growing emphasis on the convergence of national legal systems in Europe, conducting research on private law theory and practice requires that imagination and creativity be matched with prudence. Proficiency has to be aligned with what we have learned from history...|$|R
60|$|If indeed every {{phenomenon}} {{was generally}} {{the effect of}} no more than one cause, a knowledge of the law of that cause would, unless there was a logical error in our reasoning, enable us confidently to predict all the circumstances of the phenomenon. We might then, if we had carefully examined our premises and our reasoning, and found no flaw, venture to disbelieve the testimony which might be brought to show that matters had turned out differently from what we should have predicted. If the causes of erroneous conclusions were always patent {{on the face of the}} reasonings which lead to them, the human understanding would be a far more trustworthy instrument than it is. But the narrowest examination of the process itself will help us little towards discovering that we have omitted part of the premises which <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>taken</b> into our reasoning. Effects are commonly determined by a concurrence of causes. If we have overlooked any one cause, we may reason justly from all the others, and only be the further wrong. Our premises will be true, and our reasoning correct, and yet the result of no value in the particular case. There is, therefore, almost always room for a modest doubt as to our practical conclusions. Against false premises and unsound reasoning, a good mental discipline may effectually secure us; but against the danger of overlooking something, neither strength of understanding nor intellectual cultivation can be more than a very imperfect protection. A person may be warranted in feeling confident, that whatever he has carefully contemplated with his mind's eye he has seen correctly; but no one can be sure that there is not something in existence which he has not seen at all. He can do no more than satisfy himself that he has seen all that is visible to any other persons who have concerned themselves with the subject. For this purpose he must endeavour to place himself at their point of view, and strive earnestly to see the object as they see it; nor give up the attempt until he has either added the appearance which is floating before them to his own stock of realities, or made out clearly that it is an optical deception.|$|R
