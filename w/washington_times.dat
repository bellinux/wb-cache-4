25|$|In {{the days}} before the attack, a long 14-part message was sent to the embassy from the Foreign Office in Tokyo (encrypted with the Type 97 cypher machine, in a cipher named PURPLE by U.S. cryptanalysts), with {{instructions}} to deliver it to Secretary of State Cordell Hull at 1:00p.m. <b>Washington</b> <b>time.</b> The last part arrived late Saturday night (<b>Washington</b> <b>time),</b> but because of decryption and typing delays, as well as Tokyo's failure to stress the crucial necessity of the timing, embassy personnel did not deliver the message to Secretary Hull until several hours after the attack.|$|R

5|$|Smith drew {{praise from}} the Maryland {{coaching}} staff during summer workouts before the 2008 season, and The <b>Washington</b> <b>Times</b> predicted Smith, alongside receiver Ronnie Tyler, would earn significant playing time. He played in all 13games and {{started in the}} last six of the season. He also saw action on special teams as a kickoff returner. Smith recorded 24receptions for 336yards and twotouchdowns.

5|$|According to The <b>Washington</b> <b>Times</b> writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Mengele {{sightings}} {{were reported}} {{all over the}} world. Wiesenthal claimed to have information that placed Mengele on the Greek island of Kythnos in 1960, Cairo in 1961, in Spain in 1971, and in Paraguay in 1978, eighteen years after he had left. He insisted as late as 1985—six years after Mengele's death—that he was still alive, in 1982 offering a reward of $100,000 for his capture. Worldwide interest in the case was raised by a mock trial held in Jerusalem in February 1985 featuring the testimony of over a hundred victims of Mengele's experiments. Shortly afterwards, the governments of West Germany, Israel, and the United States launched a coordinated effort to determine Mengele's whereabouts. Rewards for his capture were offered by the Israeli and West German governments, The <b>Washington</b> <b>Times,</b> and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.|$|E

Freak weather effects on radar and overeager sonarmen may have accounted for many reports. No actual visual sightings by Maddox. Suggest complete evaluation before any further action taken".|$|R
