The site has not been excavated or been subject to in-depth archaeological investigation.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the park}} by {{tourists}} improved {{in the early years}} of the park, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable. Tourism significantly increased after the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, but the long horseback ride to reach the area was a deterrent. Three stagecoach roads <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1870s to provide better access for the growing number of visitors to Yosemite Valley.|$|E

5|$|Buena Vista {{features}} an early architectural style that {{differs from that}} at Motul de San José, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, with wide front stairways and probably without superstructures. They <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between Buena Vista and Motul probably results from differing epochs of construction.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in {{the acropolis}} {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} at least two superimposed platforms built with finely dressed stone blocks and covered with good quality stucco flooring. At a later date the platforms and courtyard were covered with unworked stones bound with mortar and covered with another stucco floor. The two platforms <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Late Classic and appear to have been covered over in the Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century until {{the early part of the}} 1970s, coal was mined in the eastern portion of the Catawissa Creek watershed. The coal was {{primarily}} mined in the Jeansville Coal Basin and the Green Mountain Coal Basin. The Catawissa Water Company once used water from Catawissa Creek. Five drainage tunnels <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed in the 1930s, and they still discharge acid mine drainage in the 21st century. Strip mining has occurred in parts of the watershed, mainly the Catawissa Creek headwaters and the Little Tomhicken Creek sub-watershed.|$|E

5|$|Further {{works were}} carried out to repair, rebuild and improve the defences around the Waterport Front, which {{incorporated}} the old Waterport Gate. New casemates, counterguards, tenailles and lunettes <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area and the Montagu and Orange Bastions were enlarged. The work was carried out amidst considerable controversy, as there were vigorous disagreements between the governors and senior engineers of the time over how the works should be carried out and indeed whether some of them should be pursued at all.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester's {{railway network}} {{historically}} suffered from poor north–south connections {{due to the}} fact that Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1840s on peripheral locations outside Manchester City Centre. The central commercial district had no rail links, and over the years, a number of unsuccessful schemes were proposed to connect Manchester's rail termini. In the 1960s, transport design studies were undertaken to address the problems of increasing traffic congestion. A number of urban public transport schemes were evaluated for Manchester, including several types of monorail systems and metro-style systems.|$|E
5|$|Historically part of Lancashire, Worsley has {{provided}} evidence of Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity, including two Roman roads.

Later expansion came after the First and Second World Wars, when large urban estates <b>were</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|E
