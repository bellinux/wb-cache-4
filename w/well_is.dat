5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a gravity <b>well</b> <b>is</b> blueshifted, whereas light sent {{in the opposite direction}} (i.e., climbing out of the gravity <b>well)</b> <b>is</b> redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E

5|$|An air well or aerial <b>well</b> <b>is</b> a {{structure}} or device that collects water by promoting the condensation of moisture from air.

50|$|Artificial {{recharge}} of floodwater using injection <b>wells</b> <b>was</b> {{first developed}} in the Federal District around 1953. Half of the <b>wells</b> <b>were</b> subsequently closed due to operational problems. In 1970, a series of approximately 56 <b>wells</b> <b>was</b> developed {{for the purposes of}} disposing of stormwater. These <b>wells</b> <b>were</b> capable of handling up to 35 m3/s of water collectively. Although the <b>wells</b> <b>were</b> not designed for recharge purposes, the storm water possibly reached the aquifer.|$|R

5|$|Legend has it {{that the}} Cailleach was tired from a long day herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan she fell asleep on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing <b>well</b> <b>is</b> a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - as seen in the goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E

5|$|Familial dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} systolic heart failure (prevalence 1:5000). A wider range of mutations (including some non-sarcomeric proteins as <b>well)</b> <b>is</b> associated with DCM. The cTnC mutations associated with DCM thus far are Y5H, Q50R, D75Y, M103I, D145E (also associated with HCM), I148V, and G159D. Of these, Q50R and G159D co-segregated with disease in affected family members, increasing confidence that they are clinically significant mutations. The biochemical consequences of thin filament DCM-associated mutations are less well established than for HCM, {{although there has been}} some suggestion that some of the mutations abolish the calcium desensitizing effect of cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/23. This may be because some mutations disrupt the precise positioning of cNTnC for triggering muscle contraction when cTnI is unphosphorylated.|$|E
5|$|Hal {{head to the}} wigmaker and is {{disguised}} as the father. So <b>well</b> <b>is</b> the disguise that the father's chauffeur is convinced and takes Hal to the boarding school. The father quickly exits {{in time to see}} his chauffeur drive away and hails a taxi. Hal arrives at the boarding school and the disguise works, claims Sue and drives away. Seconds later the father arrives and confronts the mistress, departing to pursue in a fit of anger. Hal and Sue go to the parson's house to be immediately wed. The father is delayed for a short time by car trouble, but quickly arrives before the two are wed. He bursts in and sees his double and both he and Hal laugh. The father relents and approves the marriage as Hal removes his disguise in front of the stunned Parson.|$|E

5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as 'Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn', the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on the first floor were officially opened by Lord Coleridge a descendant of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 2011 the National Trust undertook a major re-presentation project that also saw the opening of additional rooms. The oldest parts of the cottage are now presented as the Coleridge family might have known them, with the original inglenook fireplace in the parlour uncovered and working once more. The garden was opened to visitors for the first time, complete with an 18th-century vegetable plot, a wildflower area and representations of Coleridge's animals. It is possible to listen to poetry at audio posts around the garden and the <b>well</b> <b>is</b> operational once more and {{can be seen in the}} small courtyard behind the cottage. A number of mementos of Coleridge are on display including his inkstand, locks of his hair and correspondence in his handwriting.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Crabbaberry fishing station in West Voe was {{opened and the}} island had a {{population}} of 360 people or more. However, fuel shortages {{and a decline in}} fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on. At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour. Edwin Lindsay, an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres, was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one. He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835. Lindsay's <b>Well</b> <b>is</b> a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{water has}} been bottled and {{distributed}} in the UK and abroad from {{as early as the}} reign of James I, with water bottling at the Holy Well being recorded in 1622. Various local grocers have bottled and distributed Malvern water during the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was first bottled on a large commercial scale by Schweppes, who opened a bottling plant at Holywell in Malvern Wells in 1850. As official caterers to the Great Exhibition of 1851, Schweppes introduced the water as Malvern Soda, later renaming it Malvern Seltzer Water in 1856. In 1890 Schweppes moved away from Holywell, entered into a contract with a Colwall family, and built a bottling plant in the village in 1892. The Holywell was subsequently leased to John and Henry Cuff, who bottled there until the 1960s. The Holywell became derelict until 2009 when {{with the aid of a}} Lottery Heritage grant, production of 1200 bottles per day of Holywell Spring Water was recommenced by an independent family-owned company. The <b>well</b> <b>is</b> believed to be the oldest bottling plant in the world.|$|E

Linde designed the trefoil, which features a statue designed by Oliver Laurence Barrett. The sculpture, which was added to the fountain in 1928, depicts the biblical personage Rebecca. Shemanski Fountain includes two drinking platforms with three basins each, with one platform intended for use by dogs.|$|E
5|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was useful}} in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia. One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a <b>well</b> <b>is</b> contaminated {{it may not be}} used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing a certain number of buckets of water from the well will remove the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in the well (or the well walls) rendering the well impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use the well, and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.|$|E

50|$|EPA {{regulations}} define six {{classes of}} injection wells. Class I <b>wells</b> <b>are</b> {{used for the}} injection of municipal and industrial wastes beneath underground sources of drinking water. Class II <b>wells</b> <b>are</b> used for the injection of fluids associated with oil and gas production, including waste from hydraulic fracturing. Class III <b>wells</b> <b>are</b> used for the injection of fluids used in mineral solution mining beneath underground sources of drinking water. Class IV wells, like Class I <b>wells,</b> <b>were</b> used for the injection of hazardous wastes but inject waste into or above underground sources of drinking water instead of below. EPA banned the use of Class IV wells in 1984. Class V <b>wells</b> <b>are</b> those used for all non-hazardous injections that {{are not covered by}} Classes I through IV. Examples of Class V wells include stormwater drainage wells and septic system leach fields.
