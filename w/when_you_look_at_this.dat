We were in India then, in cantonments, at a place we'll call Bhurtee. Barclay, who died the other day, was {{sergeant}} in the same company as myself, and the belle of the regiment, ay, and the finest girl that ever had the breath of life between her lips, was Nancy Devoy, the daughter of the color-sergeant. There were two men that loved her, and one that she loved, and you'll smile <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> poor thing huddled before the fire, and hear me say that it was for my good looks that she loved me.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963 and 1964 Ruf {{built the}} house for the chancellor. It was to be a house to live in and also to be a {{representative}} building to welcome guests of state. In a park beside the river Rhine he built a flat-roofed house with large glass-windows, that should show the open democratic way, the new Germany was thinking. The bungalow is designed with two quadrates with two atriums and one part of the house is wide open to the park and the other private part into one atrium with a little swimming pool. When Ludwig Erhard got the keys he said: [...] "You can understand me better, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> house, as if you would listen to a political speech of mine".Ludwig Erhard and Helmut Schmidt liked the modern building, Willy Brandt, who had young children, stayed in the house he lived in before and used it for state visitors. Helmut Kohl lived there nearly 16 years, until Berlin became the new capital city. Today it is a museum and can be visited. Until today no representative in the world has had such an open residence, as the Chancellor's Bungalow was.|$|E

In the address, he advocated gay law reform, greater concern for the environment, more attention to Aboriginal and unemployed health, and greater co-operation between the medical profession and politicians of all sides to build a better health system. In November, he told a national Aboriginal conference in Sydney that he was ashamed of the medical profession's track record on Aboriginal health, arguing that [...] "doctors need to ask themselves how a person can be well when they've been denied their land, their hunting grounds, their citizenship and freedom and even their own children. Of course Aboriginal people's health has suffered <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> litany of misery". As president, while personally opposing euthanasia, he supported the right of doctors to withdraw treatment from consenting critically ill patients, and supported euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke's case against the Royal Darwin Hospital.|$|E

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} if people are {{motivated}} by a particular social preference, then choosing in accordance with this preference will lead to an identifiable pattern of eye movements. We track eye movements while subjects make choices in simple three-person distribution experiments. We characterize each choice in terms of three different types of social preferences: efficiency, maximin, and envy. For the characterization, we use either the choice data or the eye movement data. The evidence indicates that distributional choices are broadly consistent with the choice rule implied by eye movements. In other words, what subjects appear {{to be interested in}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> their choices corresponds to what they appear to be interested in <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> their eye movements. This correspondence lends credibility to the behavioral relevance of social preferences models...|$|R
