Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear safety glasses to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear safety glasses to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also safety glasses for welding, which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full sized <b>welding</b> <b>helmet</b> is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called [...] "flash goggles", because they provide protection from welding flash. Nylon frames are usually used for protection eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular glasses, safety glasses often include protection beside the eyes {{as well as in}} front of the eyes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Welding</b> <b>helmets</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} used with arc welding processes such as shielded metal arc welding, gas tungsten arc welding, and gas metal arc welding. They are necessary to prevent arc eye, a painful condition where the cornea is inflamed. <b>Welding</b> <b>helmets</b> can also prevent retina burns, {{which can lead to}} a loss of vision. Both conditions are caused by unprotected exposure to the highly concentrated ultraviolet and infrared rays emitted by the welding arc. Ultraviolet emissions from the welding arc can also damage uncovered skin, causing a sunburn-like condition in {{a relatively short period of}} welding. In addition to the radiation, gasses or splashes can also be a hazard to the skin and the eyes.|$|R

50|$|Welding {{and cutting}} processes, {{including}} arc welding and cutting, {{as well as}} brazing produce intense ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR) and visible light wavelengths. The UV and IR wavelengths cannot be seen and can produce eye injury without the victim realizing it immediately. Extremely dark filters of the proper sort are needed for the welder {{to be able to}} look at the intensely glowing metal being welded. An approved face shield or <b>welding</b> <b>helmet</b> can also have filters for optical radiation protection, and offer additional protection against debris and sparks. UV blocking protective spectacles with side shields or welding goggles are considered primary protection, with the face shield or <b>welding</b> <b>helmet</b> considered secondary protection. This way, the eyes are still protected even when the face shield or helmet is lifted up.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>welding</b> <b>helmets</b> {{include a}} window {{covered with a}} filter called a lens shade, through which the welder can see to work.

50|$|With such {{electronic}} auto-darkening helmets, the welder {{no longer}} has {{to get ready to}} weld and then nod their head to lower the helmet over their face. The advantage is that the welder does not need to adjust the position of <b>welding</b> <b>helmet</b> manually which not only saves time but also reduces the risk of exposure to the harmful light generated by the welding process.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} if radiation can infiltrate into <b>welding</b> <b>helmets,</b> a UV detector {{was placed in}} the eye socket of a headform which was then fitted with a range of <b>welding</b> <b>helmets.</b> The headform was exposed to a collimated beam of UV radiation from varioud orientations and the amount of infiltration determined. Radiation was found to be reflected off the filter plate and into the detector (eye) after entering though: (1) an opening between the edge of the shield and the side of the face, and (2) an opening between the top lip of the shield and the top of the head. Design features such as a cut-away in top lip of the shield and filter plate of larger surface area contributed to more radiation, from a grater range of angles reaching the eye the results have significance for welding performed in highly reflective and closed situations such as inside metal tanks...|$|R
50|$|All <b>welding</b> <b>helmets</b> are {{susceptible}} to damages such as cracks that can compromise the protection from ultraviolet and infrared rays. In addition to protecting the eyes, the helmet protects the face from hot metal sparks generated by the arc and from UV damage. When overhead welding, a leather skull cap and shoulder cover are used to prevent head and shoulder burns.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the {{industry}} standard for <b>welding</b> <b>helmets</b> is ANSI Z87.1+ which specifies performance {{of a wide variety}} of eye protection devices. The standard requires that auto-darkening helmets provide full protection against both UV and IR even when they are not in the darkened state.

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional <b>welding</b> <b>helmets</b> contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{developments}} in welding technology, {{in particular the}} high intensity pulsed welding arc, have sharpened the requirements on speed and adjustable attenuation for safe and ergonomic operations. With this advent the conventional <b>welding</b> <b>helmets</b> based on nematic liquid crystals are facing difficulties because the nematics are not responding fast enough to stroboscopically follow the changing intensity of the arc during pulsed welding. We propose here {{a new generation of}} welding shutters based on smectic ferroelectric or antiferroelectric) liquid crystals which are fast enough to be synchronized to follow pulsed arc regimes and hence permitting a better visibility of the object under work.

50|$|Any intense {{exposure}} to UV light {{can lead to}} photokeratitis. Common causes include welders who have failed to use adequate eye protection such as an appropriate <b>welding</b> <b>helmet</b> or welding goggles. This is termed arc eye, while photokeratitis caused by {{exposure to}} sunlight reflected from ice and snow, particularly at elevation, is commonly called snow blindness. It can also occur due to using tanning beds without proper eyewear. Natural sources include bright sunlight reflected from snow or ice or, less commonly, from sea or sand. Fresh snow reflects about 80% of the UV radiation compared to a dry, sandy beach (15%) or sea foam (25%). This is especially a problem in polar regions and at high altitudes, as with every thousand feet (approximately 305 meters) of elevation (above sea level), the intensity of UV rays increases by four percent.|$|E

40|$|The {{personal}} {{ultraviolet radiation}} exposure levels {{of a group}} of welders and nearby workers were estimated using a photosensitive polymer film, polysulphone. The polysulphone film was attached to the inner and outer surfaces of eye protection, the workers' clothing, and also placed throughout the work area. The estimated average ocular exposures (inside the helmets) for welders and boiler-makers were between four and five times the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limit, and the estimated exposures at the spectacles of nonwelders were around 9 times MPE. Body exposures (at the clothing surface) for welders were estimated to be around 3000 times MPE and for nonwelders around 13 times MPE. The ambient ultraviolet radiation levels in the factory were found to exceed the MPE by an average of 5. 5 times, even in nonwelding areas.
