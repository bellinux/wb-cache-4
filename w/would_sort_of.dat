5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that <b>would</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> logically project that.|$|E

Not just frizzled up a bit, but literally roasted to a crisp! Poor faithful creature, how she was cooked! I am but a poor woman, but even if I have to scrimp to do it, I will put up a tombstone over that lone sufferer's grave--and Mr. Riley if you would have the goodness to think up a little epitaph to put on it which <b>would</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> describe the awful way in which she met her--" ...|$|E

Roncal has said of her mother, “She was a doctor and she was always done. Like hair, makeup, heels, nail, clothes, Chanel, the whole thing. She was very particular and I literally remember sitting at her boudoir with her and watching her do her face and she <b>would</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> teach me as she was going along.” Roncal’s mother {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and died in March 1989. Roncal’s brand motto that looking good makes people feel good originated from her mother’s ordeal.|$|E
5000|$|Posner said {{country singer}} Jake Owen {{encouraged}} him to [...] "tell the truth" [...] in his songs" [...] and showed him artists like Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, which made Posner realize that [...] "you can just literally say the truth and it’s beautiful, and it’s heart-wrenching and it’s funny". The album is inspired by country music according to Posner: [...] "So, like, the way I was inspired by hip-hop when I first started and <b>would</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> sing hip-hop, this new (music) is kind of my take on country music. It doesn't sound country and no one uses the word country to describe it, but it's me trying to do country and it comes out weird and different." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{the limited}} {{release of the}} cassette, the band quickly {{expanded}} and continued to perform live periodically. According to Menuck, joining the group was quite simple: [...] "It was like if anyone knew anybody who played an instrument and seemed like an okay person, they <b>would</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> join up." [...] In short order, the group's numbers ebbed and flowed. Local musicians would often join the band {{for a handful of}} performances, then depart. The revolving door nature of the group's membership frequently caused it strain before the release of F♯ A♯ ∞. [...] After that release, the group stabilized around a nine-person lineup with Menuck, Moya and David Bryant on guitars, Pezzente and Thierry Amar on bass guitars, Aidan Girt and Bruce Cawdron on drums, and Sophie Trudeau and Norsola Johnson on violin and cello respectively. Moya would depart in 1998 to focus on HṚṢṬA, being replaced by Roger Tellier-Craig of Fly Pan Am.|$|E
5000|$|In his 1975 autobiography, Tennessee Williams: Memoirs, {{the writer}} told {{of his time}} (1941) as a night shift {{elevator}} operator at the old San Jacinto Hotel in Manhattan. Among the hotel’s guest {{at the time was}} Witherspoon who, according to Williams, would employ him or the hotel’s telephone operator, a budding poet, to pick up her morphine prescription from an all-night pharmacy. She used to rap with me and the poet till nearly day break in the San Jacinto lobby. Her “fix” would never wear itself out till first cock’s crow.

5000|$|Ryan Murphy, {{a fan of}} Davis {{since his}} childhood, interviewed the actress just months before her death in 1989. The {{agreed-upon}} 20-minute interview lasted four hours, and inspired his characterization of Davis in Feud. He said, [...] "When I would ask her about Joan Crawford ... She would just go on about how much she hated her. But then she <b>would</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> say ... 'She was a professional. And I admired that'." [...] Murphy first conceived Bette and Joan as a film years before the FX series, and approached both Sarandon and Lange about the lead roles. Sarandon said, [...] "It just felt like it didn't have a context, just being bitchy and kind of funny, but what else? In expanding it to eight hours, you could get more complexity {{and so many other}} characters." [...] Season 1 of Feud was being written {{at the same time that}} Murphy was forming his Half Foundation, which promotes an increased presence of women in film and television production positions. The season features 15 acting roles for women over 40, and half the episodes were directed by women, including Helen Hunt.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{the song}} was {{composed}} and performed as a sketch within the Tiswas programme. According to Sally James, [...] "John came in one day and he said ‘I’ve sort of got this idea’. It’s a march basically, and we all sing this song. And it’s another excuse to chuck buckets of water! So obviously we didn’t {{do it in the}} studio. We had this little area outside the back of the studio where a camera <b>would</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> poke out of the window, so we ended the show down there marching about, sploshing all this water from the buckets. And then the next week it was incredible, because the people were jamming the switchboard, ‘I’ve got to have this record!’. There was never any idea {{that it would be a}} record, but of course we did quickly make a record and it became a hit. It just all happened so left-of-field and so unplanned…but then that’s how a lot of things did happen in Tiswas. Things that you think would work, don’t, and things that you ‘Oh that’ll be good for a one-off’ end up being huge hits".|$|E
5000|$|Rosenbloom co-edited The Insider with William Goldenberg and Paul Rubell; {{the film}} was {{directed}} by Michael Mann. The three editors were interviewed by Scott Essman in 1999 about the making of The Insider. Rubell noted that, [...] "the camera work is kind of chaotic. It {{is the opposite of}} what you would call a controlled visual style. The camera is always moving and it is very jittery {{and when you look at}} the dailies, you see that the operators had great latitude in what they could physically do with the camera; they tried some wild things and Michael loved that. He <b>would</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> control the chaos and shape it, but he allowed the chaos to occur." [...] Rosenbloom added, [...] "I never worked with a director who gave such precise notes - the fact that the notes were precise and that there were so many of them made them imprecise because you couldn't possibly do everything that the note said to do. If you did, you would have 24 versions of the scene. The notes provided you with a road map and oftentimes the chaos in the editing was trying to figure out the one way that you could first put the scene together." ...|$|E
