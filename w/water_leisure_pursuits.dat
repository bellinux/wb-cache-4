40|$|<b>Leisure</b> <b>pursuits</b> {{are among}} the {{cultural}} practices which a Cultural Studies might examine. It is common to see <b>leisure</b> <b>pursuits</b> as meeting some more general human need, perhaps the need to experience and engage in the ‘ludic’ (Huizinga; 1938); these experiences of leisure relate to aesthetic experience and like aesthetic experience can be understood at least sometimes as complex. In this paper I ask whether the study of <b>leisure</b> <b>pursuits</b> can be integrated into a more general Cultural Studies by specifically exploring the complexities of both their form and their content, and I will pursue an approach to this based on linguistic pragmatics. In this paper I begin by looking at form and content in literary texts, and suggest an integrated approach to complexity in form and content, based on linguistic pragmatics; in this I draw on current work published as Fabb (2002 a,b). The {{second part of the}} paper is more speculative, and extends the account of literary form and literary content to everyday <b>leisure</b> <b>pursuits</b> such as birdwatching, going to the seaside, and so on...|$|R

Physiotherapists had relatively more active leisure patterns as adolescents and undergraduates. Occupational therapists had relatively passive leisure patterns that persisted after graduation. These findings support the spillover hypothesis of a work-leisure relationship. Following graduation physiotherapists adopted more passive <b>leisure</b> <b>pursuits</b> which supports the compensation theory of leisure. However, physiotherapy graduates felt deprived of sport and experienced less leisure satisfaction than occupational therapists...|$|R

40|$|Much of what {{is known}} about {{lifestyle}} factors and their contribution to mental wellness, and life satisfaction stems from studies investigating physical and social <b>leisure</b> <b>pursuits.</b> By comparison there is much less research examining the role of creative pursuits. This study examined the impact of daily, occasional or no participation in creative leisure activities on mental wellness, meaning in life and life satisfaction. Participants included a total of 70 adults (31 males and 39 females) aged between 26 - 55 years. They were assessed on their engagement in creative <b>leisure</b> <b>pursuits</b> and measures of depression, anxiety and stress (DASS 21), the Satisfaction with Life scale and the Meaning in Life questionnaire. The results were not significant, however, the study revealed that younger and lower SES groups were more likely to partake in creative <b>leisure</b> <b>pursuits.</b> In addition, an interesting connection between satisfaction in life and meaning in life revealed what may be a uniquely Australian perspective. The discussion explores possible explanations why this might be the case, limitations to the current study and suggestions for future research...|$|R
