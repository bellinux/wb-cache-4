It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is the least expensive anti-seizure medication at around $5USD a year in the developing <b>world.</b> <b>Access</b> however may be difficult as some countries label it as a controlled drug.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{universities}} went from being small and parochial institutions, largely for the training of clergy and lawyers, to major intellectual centres {{at the forefront of}} Scottish identity and life, seen as fundamental to democratic principles and the opportunity for social advancement for the talented. Chairs of medicine were founded at all the university towns. By the 1740s Edinburgh medical school was the major centre of medicine in Europe and was a leading centre in the Atlantic <b>world.</b> <b>Access</b> to Scottish universities was probably more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was less expensive and the student body more representative of society as a whole. The system was flexible and the curriculum became a modern philosophical and scientific one, in keeping with contemporary needs for improvement and progress. Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution to the European Enlightenment. Many of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment were university professors, who developed their ideas in university lectures.|$|E

500|$|The [...]hack {{games are}} set in an {{alternate}} timeline of Earth, in the year 2010.

500|$|To {{optimise}} women's {{control over}} pregnancy, {{it is essential}} that culturally appropriate contraceptive advice and means are widely, easily, and affordably available to anyone that is sexually active, including adolescents. In many parts of the <b>world</b> <b>access</b> to contraception and family planning services is very difficult or non existent and even in developed counties cultural and religious traditions can create barriers to access. Reported usage of adequate contraception by women has risen only slightly between 1990 and 2014, with considerable regional variability. Although global usage is around 55%, it may be as low as 25% in Africa. Worldwide 222 million women have no or limited access to contraception. Some caution is needed in interpreting available data, since contraceptive prevalence is often defined as [...] "the percentage of women currently using any method of contraception among all women of reproductive age (i.e., those aged 15 to 49 years, unless otherwise stated) who are married or in a union. The “in-union” group includes women living with their partner in the same household and who are not married according to the marriage laws or customs of a country." [...] This definition is more suited to the more restrictive concept of family planning, but omits the contraceptive needs of all other women and girls who are or are likely to be sexually active, are at risk of pregnancy and are not married or [...] "in-union".|$|E

50|$|One {{common use}} case for Split-horizon DNS {{is when a}} webserver has a private IP address on a local area network, but the <b>world</b> <b>accesses</b> it at a NAT'ed public address.

Passing through less network devices improves the network latency.|$|R
