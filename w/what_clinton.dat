40|$|Guam in the Mariana Islands today {{remains an}} unincorporated {{organized}} {{territory of the}} United States of America. Its ongoing colonial history illustrates {{the role of the}} Pacific island world in the formation of a European vision of globalization and the continuing hegemonic purchase of this vision in the twenty-first century in <b>what</b> Hillary <b>Clinton</b> has called the ‘Participation Age’. The power of this vision depends in part on its naturalization in a cartographic representation that reduces the world to which Guam belongs to tiny specks in an essentially empty ocean. This essay discusses how Chamorro poet Craig Santos Perez's ongoing project from Unincorporated Territory sets out to challenge this hegemony and to relocate Guam in an oceanic worldview that predates and outlasts its instrumentalization in the interests of free trade...|$|R

5000|$|The UNS-COM team faced {{resistance}} from Iraq, which blocked inspections and hid deadly germ agents and warheads. Clinton then threatened military action several times when Hussein, {{who turned out}} to be Iraq's President, tried stalling the UNS-COM inspections. To weaken Hussein's grip of power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of [...] "regime change" [...] against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces. Between December 16 and 19, 1998, Clinton ordered four-day period of concentrated air attacks against military installations in Iraq. This was in response to Saddam's refusal to cooperate with UN inspectors. After the bombing, Hussein blocked any further UN inspections and announced its attempt to shoot down Coalition aircraft in the no-fly zones over Iraq. For several years afterward, U.S. and Coalition aircraft routinely attacked hostile Iraqi defense installations in Iraq, in response to <b>what</b> the <b>Clinton</b> administration claimed were [...] "provocations" [...] by the Iraqi military, including antiaircraft fire and radar locks on U.S. and Coalition aircraft.|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{its status}} as unincorporated, Powell is {{considered}} to be more of an [...] "independent" [...] small town than a suburb. One of the reasons behind this is that it was established in 1789 (two years before the establishment of Knoxville) by settlers passing through East Tennessee into the frontier. Among these early settlers was Stockley Donelson (1753 - 1804), a brother-in-law of President Andrew Jackson. Donelson's home, now known as the Alexander Bishop House, still stands on Bishop Lane.
