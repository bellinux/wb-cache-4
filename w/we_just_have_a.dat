The album {{was recorded in}} January and March 1993 at the Skyhigh Studios in Newcastle; for the recording sessions they used Louis Burdett and Nick Cecire on drums, with Rob Taylor producing. The album features a mix of original and cover songs, including tracks written by Justin Hayes a.k.a. Stanley Claret (Plunder's brother). The album comprises three studio tracks, five live takes and two songs from their first demo, including a tribute song to the band's namesake, [...] "Gough", which was written by Freedman. The lead single, [...] "Woody", detailed Woody Allen's break up with Mia Farrow and was followed by their second single, [...] "Gough". Plunder described their sound to Naomi Mapstone of The Canberra Times, [...] "There'd been lots of rap and lots of thrash and that's all very good, but <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different style of music and I think people appreciated hearing something a bit different [...] sort of happy, sensitive, not that loud... much more accoustic." [...] The Canberra Times reporter, Nicole Leedham felt it was [...] "sublime and ridiculous, the band's bluesy, country, jazzy, punky, folky pop swings from bleeding sensitivity to drunken hilarity." [...] Oz Music Project described the album as being [...] "very different to later recordings, with the band sounding a little bit country {{and a little bit}} rock and roll. A far cry from the lush orchestration of recent recordings." ...|$|E

Harry agreed: [...] "Most recently, {{there were a couple}} of lines in a song that he came up with, and then there were two more lines that had to be written, and I had already written them. So I mean, it just sort of happens. It's easy for us." ...|$|E

As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing <b>a</b> cameo. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> really good time [...] While filming the video, we noticed that we were doing certain stuff that we used to do as kids. We kinda felt a little goofy for a second, so we stopped. But <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|R

5000|$|In Italian Vogue, a {{reviewer}} {{described their}} sound as [...] "soft and dreamy and evokes 60s French Pop and Folk Pops' Bohemian Gypsie atmosphere." [...] For the fall 2010 issue of Purple, Lennon and Kemp recreated the iconic picture of John Lennon and Yoko Ono taken by famous photographer Annie Leibovitz {{for the cover}} of Rolling Stone in 1981. The picture of Kemp and Lennon was taken by photographer Terry Richardson. In Rolling Stone magazine, Lennon told interviewer Austin Scaggs about the musical dynamics {{of his relationship with}} Kemp, juxtaposed with that of John Lennon and Yoko Ono: [...] "They were unified as a message and a movement, but she didn't want to write songs with my dad. ... and I love to collaborate. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chemistry." [...] They have also performed on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Conan.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{the episode}} airing, it was {{announced}} that musician Ed Sheeran would be making a cameo appearance {{at some point during the}} season. According to David Benioff, they had been trying for years to get him onto the show as a surprise for Maisie Williams, who portrays Arya Stark in the series and is a fan of Sheeran. Before the episode's official release, Sheeran stated about his appearance that [...] "Nothing exciting happens in this scene, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> conversation and that's kind of it." [...] In [...] "Dragonstone", Sheeran portrays a Lannister soldier, who Arya happens upon when she hears him singing a song that is unfamiliar to her. The song originates from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire book series, which the television series is adapted from, and is titled [...] "Hands of Gold". In the book series, it is sung by a character known as Symon Silver Tongue, a character unrelated to Sheeran's portrayal.|$|E
