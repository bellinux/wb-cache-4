40|$|A {{bacterial}} culture {{with the ability}} to degrade and utilize cyanide was isolated from gold tailing sample. The bacterial sample was subjected to staining, various biochemical and FAME-GC (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester- Gas Chromatography) method and characterized as Photorhabdus luminescens luminescens. Spectrophotometric analysis was carried out to measure the degradation of cyanide through quantification of the degradation products. Studies on the control of environmental factors show that an optimum temperature of 370 C and an alkaline pH 9. 0 are necessary for the degradation of cyanide by the above bacterium. The study shows that P. luminescens can be used to degrade cyanide in batch cultures. Biodegradation method offers lower operating costs and environmental friendly treatment of toxic cyanide compared to present chemical methods used in gold mines to treat cyanide. Further biodegradation offers a safe method to dispose gold mining and other industrial <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>cyanide...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present note refers {{the results}} about the {{isolation}} of an Aspergillus fumigatus strain able to grow on an industrial cyanide waste as nitrogen source. The fungus was selected from an alkaline unpolluted soil in enrichment cultures in 50 ml of Minimal Medium added with 20 mmol glucose and supplemented initially with 0. 1 mmol KCN and then with 70 ll of a waste solution from a jewelry industry containing free cyanide and cyanide complexes of heavy metal ions including copper, silver, nickel, and others. The cyanide content of the waste was 1, 500 ppm. The fungal growth was monitored determining dry weight, protein content and glucose consumption. The fungus efficiently utilized the cyanide {{as evidenced by the}} decrease in the inoculated medium of the compound under detection limits within 24 h and the concomitant growth within 15 days during which periodical additions of the waste to the cultures were made. The amount of the cyanide in the biomass of the fungus grown in presence of the waste was very scarce and comparable to that in absence of the pollutant. Furthermore the fungus was able to sequestrate metals such Ag, Cu, and Ni as a resistance mechanism against heavy metals. In conclusion our results are of interest for biodegradation plans of electroplating industrial <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>cyanide</b> based pollutants...|$|E
40|$|Cyanide is a toxic {{nitrogen}} compound for almost every living organism since it binds irreversibly to haem-proteins, (i. e. cytochromes {{involved in all}} known respiratory processes [1]). In the nature, there are bacteria, algae, fungi, and many plants, which are able to produce cyanide. However, the {{contamination of the environment}} with cyanide is mainly due to human activities. In this sense, mining, electroplating and jewellery industries generate effluents with a high concentration of cyanide. There are many possible methods for treating <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>cyanide.</b> The latest cyanide disposal method is cyanide biodegradation, which is an environmentally friendly and quite inexpensive treatment method [2]. Some microorganisms have been described to be able to degrade cyanide at a neutral pH, but under this condition a high concentration of cyanide evaporates as hydrocyanic acid (HCN), a weak acid with a pKa value of 9. 2. Thus, {{it is very important to}} isolate cyanotrophic microorganisms that work at alkaline pH. In this sense, our research group has isolated a native bacterium, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT 5344 from the Guadalquivir River in Córdoba, which is able to degrade free cyanide and cyano-metalic complexes under alkaline conditions (up to an initial pH of 10) [3, 4]. The aim of this work was to check if P. pseudoalcaligenes CECT 5344 is able to tolerate and degrade the cyanide present in the lixiviate from a gold mining industry located in Asturias, Spain...|$|E
40|$|Global {{climate warming}} causes an {{intensive}} melting and retreat of glaciers in the Tien Shan mountains. Melting water of glaciers causes overfilling of high mountain lakes. The {{increase of the}} surface and volume of the Petrov Lake accompanied with the decrease of stability of the dam represents an extremely dangerous situation that can produce a natural disaster. Failure can happen due to erosion, a buildup of water pressure, an earthquake or if a large enough portion of a glacier breaks off and massively displaces the waters in a glacial lake at its base. In case of the lake dam rupture, flooding of a disposal site of highly toxic tailing from the gold mine Kumtor is a threat. If this happens, the toxic <b>waste</b> <b>containing</b> <b>cyanides</b> would contaminate a large area in the Naryn (Syrdarya) river basin. Even if the flooding of the disposal site does not occur, the damage after lake dam fracture will be immense due to the glacial lake outburst flood may be a devastating mudslide. In order to prevent or {{reduce the risk of}} this event we recommend performing engineering surveys for {{the development and implementation of}} the project for the controlled reduction of water level in the Blue Bay of the Petrov Lake to a safe volume. </span...|$|R
40|$|In the {{bioethanol}} production process, {{as much as}} 90 % {{of waste}} was produced. The availability of waste production is very important since waste can be processed to become livestock feed. The solid bioethanol <b>waste</b> <b>contains</b> <b>cyanide</b> (HCN) 5. 8177 mg/kg, water 95, 21 %, ash 0, 39 %, protein 8, 16 %, crude fiber 5, 45 %, crude fat 2. 06 %, and carbohydrates 83, 94 %. Processing bioethanol solid waste into livestock feed {{can be done by}} utilizing the existing fungi on bioethanol solid waste. Crude fiber (cellulose) and carbohydrates are a source of cellulolytic fungi. Cellulolytic fungi can degrade the role of organic materials contained in bioethanol solid waste, {{so that it can be}} made as a source of highly nutritious livestock feed. This study aims to determine the types of cellulolytic fungal isolates contained in bioethanol solid waste which is potentially processed to become livestock woof. Descriptive analysis was employed as a method of the study. Furthermore, Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) was used as a medium for culturing and isolating the fungus. Dilution series and pour plate method were employed to isolate the fungus. And, Moist Chamber method was employed to identify it. In addition, Carboxy Methyl Cellulose (CMC) was used as medium to identify cellulolytic fungi. The process was carried out up to the level of genus based on macroscopic and microscopic characterization. 10 fungal isolates from the genus of Aspergillus sp 1, Aspergillus sp 2, Aspergillus sp 3, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp, Mucor sp, Penicillium sp 1, Penicillium sp 2, Rhizopus sp and Trichoderma viride were yielded in this study. The results of examining cellulose enzyme activity revealed that 9 of 10 isolates of the fungus were capable of degrading cellulose. Isolates yielding the largest cellulose enzyme were Trichoderma viride, Penicillium sp 1, Cladosporium sp and Aspergillus niger...|$|R
40|$|Several cyanide-tolerant {{microorganisms}} {{have been}} selected from alkaline wastes and soils contaminated with cyanide. Among them, a fungus identified as Fusarium solani IHEM 8026 shows a good potential for cyanide biodegradation under alkaline conditions (pH 9. 2 to 10. 7). Results of K(sup 14) CN biodegradation studies show that fungal metabolism seems to proceed by a two-step hydrolytic mechanism: (i) the first reaction involves the conversion of cyanide to formamide by a cyanide-hydrolyzing enzyme, cyanide hydratase (EC 4. 2. 1. 66); and (ii) the second reaction consists of the conversion of formamide to formate, which is associated with fungal growth. No growth occurred during {{the first step of}} cyanide degradation, suggesting that cyanide is toxic to some degree even in cyanide-degrading microorganisms, such as F. solani. The presence of organic nutrients in the medium has a major influence on the occurrence of the second step. Addition of small amounts of yeast extract led to fungal growth, whereas no growth was observed in media <b>containing</b> <b>cyanide</b> as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. The simple hydrolytic detoxification pathway identified in the present study could be used for the treatment of many industrial alkaline effluents and <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> free <b>cyanide</b> without a prior acidification step, thus limiting the risk of cyanhydric acid volatilization; this should be of great interest from an environmental and health point of view...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of non concentrating tubular {{receiver}} (NCTR) for solar photocatalytic applications is presented and the decontamination efficiency is compared with the well known CPC type technology. The NCTR receiver consists mainly of Borosilicate type glass tubes in a compact arrangement without any reflector material. Only cheap, rugged and simple parts are used {{for the construction of}} the NCTR receiver and the support structure to enhance the cost-effectiveness and weather resistance of the receiver system. Comparative detoxification tests are carried out with pre-pilot plant reactors of the CPC and the NCTR type using heterogeneous and homogenous photocatalysis for the detoxification of artificial <b>waste</b> water <b>containing</b> <b>cyanide</b> or hydrazine. Based on the results of the tests with the pre-pilot plant scale reactor a NCTR pilot plant has been installed for the treatment of <b>waste</b> water <b>containing</b> hydrazine from rocket test facilities at DLR site Lampoldshausen, Germany. The NCTR pilot plant consists of a 32 m² NCTR receiver and a pumping unit for batch processing of 1 m³ of the rocket test facility waste water.

The new NCTR type solar collector seems to be a promising design for solar water technology on the way to achieve an economically applicable solar photocatalytic waste water treatment system...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines is {{investigating}} methods to treat <b>waste</b> water that <b>contains</b> <b>cyanide.</b> This report describes a new method that removes heavy metals and {{all forms of}} cyanide. In the first step, hydrogen peroxide and sodium thiosulfate are added at pH 7 to 9 in a 1 : 2 molar ratio to convert free and weakly complexed cyanide to nontoxic thiocyanate. Then steryldimethylbenzylammonium chloride is added to precipitate ferro-cyanide, and finally, ferric sulfate is added as a sweep floc and sequestrant for heavy metals. After the suspended solids settle, the water is polished by filtering. The water initially contained 1 to 5 mg/L Fe, 1 to 5 mg/L Cu, and 10 to 30 mg/L total cyanide; the level {{of each of these}} constituents was reduced to less than 0. 02 mg/L...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis {{has been focused on}} the use of cobalt(II) -tetra (3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxy-phenyl) porphyrin [Co(II) TMHPP] modified electrodes, which have demonstrated to be effective electrocatalysts for dioxygen reduction in the application of cyanide determination. To prepare chemically modified electrodes, we have employed the sol-gel technique because sol-gel films are chemically inert, photo-stable and thermally stable supporting materials. The Co(II) TMHPP doped sol-gel based Pt electrode has been characterized electrochemically by rotating disk voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry, respectively. The results show that the charge transfer diffusion coefficient Dct within the modified layer is comparable to other chemically modified electrodes. The charge transfer rate constants ks, for the electron transfer between the electrode and the localized redox sites, and ko 2, for the oxygenated adduct formation have been calculated to study the catalytic power and mechanism of metalloporphyrins. Furthermore, we have worked out that the binding equilibrium constant of cyanide is much larger than oxygen and the mode of inhibition is non-competitive. The immobilization of metalloporphyrins with silica gel can avoid unwanted dimerization to μ-oxo-bridged dimers via peroxo intermediates and therefore the electrode has a storage stability of more than 10 days at room temperature. This electrode shows an extremely high stability towards dioxygen reduction after more than 1700 cyclic potential scans with a deviation of less than 9 %. For electrocatalytic processes involving an inner-sphere mechanism, strongly binding species such as CN poison the reaction by coordinating to the active electrocatalyst sites. This poisoning effect has been employed {{here for the first time}} in literature to analyze trace quantities of cyanide in aqueous solution. A linear relationship between the catalytic current decrease and the cyanide ion concentration is observed in the range of 10 nM to 100 nM, which is two orders of magnitude more sensitive than all other described methods, and correlates well to the standard method. Cyanide is determined amperometrically with a detection limit of 7 - 10 x 10 [to the power of negative 9]M at 0 mV vs. Ag/AgCl and a short response time of 10 minutes. Finally, this measurement method was tested on real samples, such as reef fish blood and wastewater samples, without the use of any toxic reagent. It is well-known that cyanide may gain access to freshwater and seawater mainly from artificial sources including slow continuous discharge of industrial <b>waste</b> <b>containing</b> <b>cyanide</b> or cyanogens. Less is known about the cyanide fishing in the South Asia region. The impact of cyanide, as a broad-spectrum poison, on marine life is irreversible and chronic. In order to combat cyanide fishing and to investigate the cyanide level in discharge, a simple and sensitive analytical tool would be ideal for the purpose of monitoring in the field. Chemically modified electrodes can be used as a fast, sensitive and reliable analytical tool to detect cyanide in our environment...|$|R

40|$|Environmental pollutions are in {{considerable}} attention in steel industries in Iran, where mostly are located around Isfahan. Therefore, an investigation was done {{mainly on the}} industrial pollution and waste related to the Isfahan Steel Complex. A plant was installed to collect the uncontrolled fumes, gases and particulates from blast furnace number II during tapping. This plant collects about 2 tons of dust each shift which previously were directed into the atmosphere. The efficiency {{of the system is}} going to be improved with some correction currently under way. Asbestos was used very widely for different purposes (about 124 tons per year) as powder, sheets, ropes and woven materials. In steel ladles, preheating furnaces of rolling mills and the power generating plant, asbestos is used as a heat insulator. The small amount of asbestos still being used is kept strictly under control and asbestos and waste is disposed of in a suitable manner. Blast furnace slag is used in the cement industry and construction works and in the slag wool plant especially built for this purpose close to the complex. Efforts have been made to replace dangerous solvents like carbon tetrachloride and other hazardous organic solvents with less toxic ones. The environmental management emphasizes the maintenance and repair of electrofilters, venture scrubbers, bag filter houses, mulicyclones and other means of pollution control which almost all are under way.
