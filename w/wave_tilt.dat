40|$|Summary Evidence is {{presented}} which indicates that, notwithstanding {{the change in}} sign made by Sommerfeld in his 1926 paper on radio wave propagation, the radiation field of a vertical electric dipole may be separated into space and surface wave components. Sommerfeld's original concepts as to the characteristics of two such waves in radio transmission are largely substantiated. It is shown that a space and a surface wave are generated by a simple vertical dipole antenna at {{the surface of the}} earth and that this surface wave has the same <b>wave</b> <b>tilt</b> as the Sommerfeld surface wave. Evidence is given which would indicate that this surface wave travels around the curve of the earth in much the same manner as a guided wire wave travels around a bend on a wire.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (EM) bias 'epsilon' is {{an error}} present in radar altimetry {{of the ocean}} due to the nonuniform reflection from wave troughs and crests. The EM bias {{is defined as the}} difference between the mean reflecting surface and the mean sea surface. A knowledge of the EM bias is necessary to permit error reduction in mean sea level measurements by satellite radar altimeters. Direct measurements of the EM bias were made from a Shell Offshore oil production platform in the Gulf of Mexico for a six month period during 1989 and 1990. Measurements of the EM bias were made at 5 and 14 Ghz. During the EM bias experiments by Melville et al., a wire wave gauge was used to obtain the modulation of the high frequency waves by the low frequency waves. It became apparent that the EM bias was primarily caused by the modulation of the short waves. This was reported by Arnold et al. The EM bias is explained using physical optics scattering and an empirical model for the short wave modulation. Measurements of the short wave modulation using a wire wave gauge demonstrated a linear dependence of the normalized bias on the short wave modulation strength, M. The theory accurately predicts this dependence by the relation epsilon = -alphaMH sub 1 / 3. The wind speed dependence of the normalized bias is explained by the dependence of the short wave modulation strength on the wind speed. While other effects such as long <b>wave</b> <b>tilt</b> and curvature will {{have an effect on the}} bias, the primary cause of the bias is shown to be due to the short wave modulation. This report will present a theory using physical optics scattering and an empirical model of the short wave modulation to estimate the EM bias.

40|$|Conventional medical {{ultrasound}} imaging uses focused beams {{to scan the}} imaging scene line-by-line, but recently however, plane-wave imaging, in which plane-waves are used to illuminate the entire imaging scene, has been gaining popularity due its ability to achieve high frame rates, thus allowing the capture of fast dynamic events and producing continuous Doppler data. In most implementations, multiple low-resolution images from different plane <b>wave</b> <b>tilt</b> angles are coherently averaged (compounded) to form a single high-resolution image, albeit with the undesirable side effect of reducing the frame rate, and attenuating signals with high Doppler shifts. This thesis introduces a spread-spectrum color Doppler imaging method that produces high-resolution images {{without the use of}} frame compounding, thereby eliminating the tradeoff between beam quality, frame rate and the unaliased Doppler frequency limit. The method uses a Doppler ensemble formed of a long random sequence of transmit tilt angles that randomize the phase of out-of-cell (clutter) echoes, thereby spreading the clutter power in the Doppler spectrum without compounding, while keeping the spectrum of in-cell echoes intact. The spread-spectrum method adequately suppresses out-of-cell blood echoes to achieve high spatial resolution, but spread-spectrum suppression is not adequate for wall clutter which may be 60 dB above blood echoes. We thus implemented a clutter filter that re-arranges the ensemble samples such that they follow a linear tilt angle order, thereby compacting the clutter spectrum and spreading that of the blood Doppler signal, and allowing clutter suppression with frequency domain filters. We later improved this filter with a redesign of the random sweep plan such that each tilt angle is repeated multiple times, allowing, after ensemble re-arrangement, the use of comb filters for improved clutter suppression. Experiments performed using a carotid artery phantom with constant flow demonstrate that the spread-spectrum method more accurately measures the parabolic flow profile of the vessel and outperforms conventional plane-wave Doppler in both contrast resolution and estimation of high flow velocities. To improve velocity estimation in pulsatile flow, we developed a method that uses the chirped Fourier transform to reduce stationarity broadening during the high acceleration phase of pulsatile flow waveforms. Experimental results showed lower standard deviations compared to conventional intensity-weighted-moving-average methods. The methods in this thesis are expected to be valuable for Doppler applications that require measurement of high velocities at high frame rates, with high spatial resolution...|$|E

40|$|An {{interpretation}} of the Gouy phase shift is proposed which relates the nite Gouy phase reduction of a Gaussian mode to the averaged phase retardation of the <b>tilted</b> <b>waves</b> in its Fourier spectrum compared to an on-axis plane wave. This provides a unied approach to resonance conditions in optical cavities with plane and curved mirrors. The possible relationship to pattern selection in nonlinear cavities is discussed.

Jf 1 Introduction It is very well known that Laguerre- or Hermite-Gaussian modes acquire a shift with respect to an on-axis plane wave if propagating along the optical axis (e. g. [1, 2]). This extra phase is usually called Gouy phase shift. It is a special case of the phase anomaly experienced by waves going through a focus ([3], cf. also [4] and Refs. therein). Recently a direct manifestation (sign reversal of the electri [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{modeling}} studies of nongeostrophic effects in baroclinic waves predict that baroclinic <b>waves</b> should <b>tilt</b> poleward with height, {{with a larger}} tilt in total meridional wind than in geostrophic quantities. Regression analysis of NCEP–NCAR reanalysis 6 -hourly data demonstrates that observed baroclinic <b>waves</b> do indeed <b>tilt</b> poleward with height, although the observed tilt is smaller than predicted by previous studies. The meridional ageostrophic wind enhances the poleward tilt of meridional wind perturbations, despite being smaller in amplitude than the meridional geostrophic wind {{by a factor of}} 5. An improved estimate {{of the structure of the}} meridional ageostrophic wind in baroclinic waves is calculated assuming force balance. Several important terms in this estimate have been left out of previous estimates of the meridional ageostrophic wind. Three terms in the improved estimate produce nearly all of the poleward tilt of the meridional wind: 1) the advection of geostrophic zonal wind perturbations by the mean zonal wind, 2) the convergence of the eddy momentum flux, and 3) the effect of friction. The poleward tilt with height of baroclinic waves explains why upper-level storm tracks tend to occur poleward of near-surface baroclinic regions, and may play a role in the midwinter suppression of the Pacific storm track. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGeneration of {{internal}} gravity {{waves in the}} boundary layer is investigated from observations. Simultaneous measurements from a 2 µm Doppler lidar and a 0. 5 µm backscatter lidar are combined to analyse the occurrence, or not, {{of internal}} gravity waves in the residual layer during the morning transition on two days, 10 and 14 June 2005. Three cases are studied for illustrating three different flow configurations in the residual layer: no wave, evanescent wave and propagating wave. Comparison of the three cases suggests two necessary conditions for the generation of gravity waves: a stably stratified residual layer and a convective boundary layer with mechanical forcing frequencies less than the Brunt-Vaïsala frequency. The horizontal wind shear probably {{plays a role in}} the dynamics of the waves, but, in the cases analysed, it is not sufficient alone to generate the observed waves through the obstacle effect. In the case of wave propagation, the <b>waves</b> <b>tilt</b> upstream and against the wind shear, with a typical horizontal wavelength and a line phase direction with respect to the vertical of 2. 4 km and 32 °, respectively. Unexpectedly, we found that measurements of the wave-associated vertical velocity and the displacement of tracers (0. 5 µm depolarization ratio or 2 µm backcatter, both indicative of relative humidity fluctuations) are in phase. Possible explanations include: (i) aerosol particles are not passive with respect to temperature or water vapour fluctuations; or (ii) a nonlinear wave-turbulence interaction is at work and needs further investigation. © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society...|$|R
40|$|Synchro-ballistic use of rotating-mirror streak cameras {{allows for}} {{detailed}} recording of high-speed events of known velocity and direction. After {{an introduction to}} the synchro-ballistic technique, this paper details two diverse applications of the technique as applied in the field of high-explosives research. In the first series of experiments detonation-front shape is recorded as the arriving detonation shock <b>wave</b> <b>tilts</b> an obliquely mounted mirror, causing reflected light to be deflected from the imaging lens. These tests were conducted for the purpose of calibrating and confirming the asymptotic Detonation Shock Dynamics (DSD) theory of Bdzil and Stewart. The phase velocities of the events range from ten to thirty millimeters per microsecond. Optical magnification is set for optimal use of the film`s spatial dimension and the phase velocity is adjusted to provide synchronization at the camera`s maximum writing speed. Initial calibration of the technique is undertaken using a cylindrical HE geometry over a range of charge diameters and of sufficient length-to-diameter ratio to insure a stable detonation wave. The final experiment utilizes an arc-shaped explosive charge, resulting in an asymmetric detonation-front record. The second series of experiments consists of photographing a shaped-charge jet having a velocity range of two to nine millimeters per microsecond. To accommodate the range of velocities it is necessary to fire several tests, each synchronized to a different section of the jet. The experimental apparatus consists of a vacuum chamber to preclude atmospheric ablation of the jet tip with shocked-argon back lighting to produce a shadow-graph image...|$|R
40|$|It is {{observed}} that Hartmann flow sustains wave propagation in its centre region for waves whose phase speed {{is less than}} the maximum flow speed. Similar to the previous observations it is found that viscous boundary layers around the critical level and at the wall replace the exponential regions and wave sinks required for over-reflection in the inviscid flow. The uniform magnetic field stabilizes the flow for small-wave-number disturbances along thez-direction. Over-reflection is confined to a few ranges of phase speeds for which the two boundary layers are close together rather than widely separated. These ranges correspond exactly to those for which unstable eigenmodes exist. Over-reflection is associated with a <b>wave</b> phase <b>tilt</b> opposite in direction to the shear...|$|R
