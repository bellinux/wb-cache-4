5|$|Currently, Indraloris is {{considered}} to be a valid genus <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Sivaladapidae, containing two named species: I.himalayensis from India and I.kamlialensis from Pakistan. A third species may be represented in the Pakistani material of Indraloris. However, Indraloris has had a complicated taxonomic history, and some of the known material was misidentified as members of other mammalian groups for decades.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{belongs in}} the {{subfamily}} Tyrannosaurinae <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Tyrannosauridae, along with Tarbosaurus, Tyrannosaurus and Alioramus. Animals in this subfamily are {{more closely related to}} Tyrannosaurus than to Albertosaurus and are known– with the exception of Alioramus– for their robust build with proportionally larger skulls and longer femora than in the other subfamily, the Albertosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Genera with closed fruitbodies <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> are form taxa {{instead of}} natural groups: Arcangeliella, Gastrolactarius, and Zelleromyces are phylogenetically part of Lactarius, while Cystangium, Elasmomyces, Gymnomyces, Macowanites, and Martellia belong to Russula. Nevertheless, {{some of these}} genus names are still in use, {{as many of the}} {{concerned}} species have not yet formally been synonymised with Lactarius or Russula.|$|E

40|$|How do {{parenting}} concepts vary <b>within</b> {{and between}} <b>the</b> <b>families?</b> <b>The</b> present study regards parenting {{as a complex}} family process by considering three concepts of parenting: styles, differential treatment and coparenting consistency. A main question was addressed: whether and how these parenting concepts vary <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> towards siblings or between the two parents, and between <b>the</b> <b>families</b> according to <b>the</b> child's, the parents and <b>the</b> <b>family's</b> characteristics? <b>The</b> parenting concepts were computed from the EPEP questionnaire (Meunier & Roskam, 2007) {{in a sample of}} 101 non-divorced families: 101 mothers and 101 fathers of two siblings from 6 - to 12 -years-old. The parenting concepts were found to vary <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> towards two siblings and between the mother and the father. They were also found to vary between <b>the</b> <b>families</b> according to <b>the</b> child's age and personality traits as well {{as a function of the}} parent's educational level and the number of siblings...|$|R

5|$|Its {{external}} morphology {{is similar}} to that of Holochilus brasiliensis, and over the course of its complex taxonomic history it has been confused with that species, but other features support its placement in a distinct genus, Lundomys. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Cricetidae and subfamily Sigmodontinae, it is a member of a group of specialized oryzomyine rodents that also includes Holochilus, Noronhomys, Carletonomys, and Pseudoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|Social persuasion {{appeals to}} one’s {{role in a}} group and {{corresponding}} expectations; it appeals to reference groups, social class, culture, and subculture.

5|$|Tarbosaurus is {{classified}} as a theropod in the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Tyrannosauridae. Other members include Tyrannosaurus and the earlier Daspletosaurus, both from North America, and possibly the Mongolian genus Alioramus.

5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} (Pezophaps solitaria) is an extinct, flightless {{bird that}} was endemic {{to the island}} of Rodrigues, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Genetically <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> of pigeons and doves, it was most {{closely related to the}} also extinct dodo of Mauritius, the two forming the subfamily Raphinae.

5|$|The {{bananaquit}} {{is a small}} passerine bird. It has a slender, curved bill, {{adapted to}} taking nectar from flowers. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Coereba (Vieillot, 1809) and is normally placed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Thraupidae.|$|E
5|$|The crust-like genera Boidinia, Gloeopeniophorella, and Pseudoxenasma, {{formerly}} {{placed in}} the Corticiaceae or Gloeocystidiellaceae, are now classified in the Russulaceae and basal to the clade of mushroom-forming species described above. Studies have so far failed to clearly circumscribe and place these genera <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> Boidinia in its current extent is polyphyletic, with some species not falling into the Russulaceae.|$|E

5|$|The more {{traditional}} taxonomy of the family, particularly the split into four groups, {{has been challenged}} by recent research. A 1998 study by Gary Nunn and Scott Stanley showed that the fulmarine petrels were indeed a discrete group <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> as were the gadfly petrels in the genus Pterodroma.|$|E
5|$|The ruffed lemurs of {{the genus}} Varecia are strepsirrhine {{primates}} and the largest extant lemurs <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Lemuridae. Like all living lemurs, they are found only {{on the island of}} Madagascar. Formerly considered to be a monotypic genus, two species are now recognized: the black-and-white ruffed lemur, with its three subspecies, and the red ruffed lemur.|$|E
5|$|Another {{increasing}} {{issue is}} the rise in conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America, such as the Oportunidades program in Mexico. Although this program is meant to provide poor families {{with an increase in}} income, the conditionalities has led to a time poverty for the family members who are in charge of fulfilling the conditions, most oftentimes the woman. This has increased the inequality of work burden <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Abelisauridae are confused. Several cladistic {{studies have indicated}} that Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies using}} morphology, immunology, {{repetitive}} DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), giant mouse lemurs are most {{closely related to}} mouse lemurs <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a clade with the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related, with fork-marked lemurs being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids, or {{more closely related to}} sportive lemurs (Lepilemur).|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the dodo and the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} {{were placed in}} a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was also placed in a monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was thought that they had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Columbidae.|$|E
