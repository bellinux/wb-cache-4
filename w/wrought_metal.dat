60|$|I {{accompanied}} Sola and Dejah Thoris in {{a search}} for new quarters, which we found in a building nearer the audience chamber and of far more pretentious architecture than our former habitation. We also found in this building real sleeping apartments with ancient beds of highly <b>wrought</b> <b>metal</b> swinging from enormous gold chains depending from the marble ceilings. The decoration of the walls was most elaborate, and, unlike the frescoes in the other buildings I had examined, portrayed many human figures in the compositions. These were of people like myself, and of a much lighter color than Dejah Thoris. They were clad in graceful, flowing robes, highly ornamented with metal and jewels, and their luxuriant hair was of a beautiful golden and reddish bronze. The men were beardless and only a few wore arms. The scenes depicted for the most part, a fair-skinned, fair-haired people at play.|$|E
6000|$|Francesca {{carried the}} {{cablegram}} unopened into the drawing-room {{and sat down}} {{for a moment to}} think. There was no need to read it yet, for she knew what she would find written there. For a few pitiful moments Comus would seem less hopelessly lost to her if she put off the reading of that last terrible message. She rose and crossed over to the windows and pulled down the blinds, shutting out the waning December day, and then reseated herself. Perhaps in the shadowy half-light her boy would come and sit with her again for awhile and let her look her last upon his loved face; she could never touch him again or hear his laughing, petulant voice, but surely she might look on her dead. And her starving eyes saw only the hateful soulless things of bronze and silver and porcelain that she had set up and worshipped as gods; look where she would they were there around her, the cold ruling deities of the home that held no place for her dead boy. He had moved in and out among them, the warm, living, breathing thing that had been hers to love, and she had turned her eyes from that youthful comely figure to adore a few feet of painted canvas, a musty relic of a long departed craftsman. And now he was gone from her sight, from her touch, from her hearing for ever, without even a thought to flash between them for all the dreary years that she should live, and these things of canvas and pigment and <b>wrought</b> <b>metal</b> would stay with her. They were her soul. And what shall it profit a man if he save his soul and slay his heart in torment? ...|$|E
60|$|Fifteen {{years of}} {{adventure}} had hardened into <b>wrought</b> <b>metal</b> a character never very ductile. Tom was now, {{in his own}} way, an altogether accomplished man of the world, who knew (at least in all companies and places where he was likely to find himself) exactly what to say, to do, to make, to seek, and to avoid. Shifty and thrifty as old Greek, or modern Scot, there were few things he could not invent, and perhaps nothing he could not endure. He had watched human nature under every disguise, from the pomp of the ambassador to the war-paint of the savage, and formed his own clear, hard, shallow, practical estimate thereof. He looked on it as his raw material, which {{he had to work}} up into subsistence and comfort for himself. He did not wish to live on men, but live by them he must; and for that purpose he must study them, and especially their weaknesses. He would not cheat them; for there was in him an innate vein of honesty, so surly and explosive, at times, as to give him much trouble. The severest part of his self-education had been the repression of his dangerous inclination to call a sham a sham on the spot, and to answer fools according to their folly. That youthful rashness, however, was now well-nigh subdued, and Tom could flatter and bully also, when it served his turn--as who cannot? Let him that is without sin among my readers, cast the first stone. Self-conscious he was, therefore, in every word and action; not from morbid vanity, but a necessary consequence of his mode of life. He had to use men, and therefore to watch how he used them; to watch every word, gesture, tone of voice, and, in all times and places, do the fitting thing. It was hard work: but necessary for a man who stood alone and self-poised {{in the midst of the}} universe; fashioning for himself everywhere, just as far as his arm could reach, some not intolerable condition; depending on nothing but himself, and caring for little but himself and the father whom, to do him justice, he never forgot. If I wished to define Tom Thurnall by one epithet, I should call him specially an ungodly man--were it not that scriptural epithets have, now-a-days, such altogether conventional and official meanings, that one fears to convey, in using them, some notion quite foreign to the truth. Tom was certainly not one of those ungodly whom David had to deal with of old, who robbed the widow, and put the fatherless to death. His morality was as high as that of the average; his sense of honour far higher. He was generous and kind-hearted. No one ever heard him tell a lie; and he had a blunt honesty about him, half real, because he liked to be honest, and yet half affected too, because he found it pay in the long run, and because it threw off their guard the people whom he intended to make his tools. But of godliness in its true sense--of belief that any Being above cared for him, and was helping him in the daily business of life--that it was worth while asking that Being's advice, or that any advice would be given if asked for; of any practical notion of a Heavenly Father, or a Divine education--Tom was as ignorant as thousands of respectable people who go to church every Sunday, and read good books, and believe firmly that the Pope is Antichrist. He ought to have learnt it, no doubt; for his father was a religious man: but he had not learnt it--any more than thousands learn it, who have likewise religious parents. He had been taught, of course, the common doctrines and duties of religion; but early remembrances had been rubbed out, as off a schoolboy's slate, by the mere current of new thoughts and objects, in his continual wanderings. Disappointments he had had, and dangers in plenty; but only such as rouse a brave and cheerful spirit to bolder self-reliance and invention; not those deep sorrows of the heart which leave a man helpless in the lowest pit, crying for help from without, for there is none within. He had seen men of all creeds, and had found in all alike (so he held) the many rogues, and the few honest men. All religions were, in his eyes, equally true and equally false. Superior morality was owing principally to the influences of race and climate; and devotional experiences (to judge, at least, from American camp-meetings and popish-cities) the results of a diseased nervous system.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{relationships}} among processing parameters, microstructure, and material properties are of considerable {{interest in the}} context of development of robust processing routes that optimize the required material properties. As a result, the scientific literature contains a large number of experimental and theoretical studies on microstructure-properties relationships. Fracture sensitive mechanical properties such as ductility, ultimate tensile strength, fatigue life, and fracture toughness depend on the average microstructural parameters as well as the distributions of microstructural parameters and their extrema. Development of quantitative relationships between such material properties and microstructural distributions and extrema has received considerably less attention, particularly in the <b>wrought</b> <b>metals</b> and alloys. Accordingly, an important objective of this research is to perform a systematic investigation in this direction. The dependence of the fracture-sensitive mechanical properties on the microstructural distributions and extrema often leads to substantial variability in these properties: a set of specimens having the same average chemistry, the same average processing history, and the same average microstructural parameters such as volume fractions of different constituents can exhibit substantially different material properties. The present research (i) is concerned with high strength (~ 1000 MPa) high martensite (> 50 %) dual phase steel where the martensite is a topologically continuous phase (matrix) containing a dispersion of islands of ferrite, and (ii) focuses on understanding the microstructural origins of the variability in fracture sensitive mechanical properties, in particular variability in the room temperature uniaxial tensile ductility. The research involves quantitative microstructure characterization using stereology and digital image processing and quantitative fractography using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fracture profilometry. The analysis of the quantitative fractographic and microstructural data obtained in this research leads to useful guidelines for reducing the variability in the tensile ductility of the dual phase steel under investigation.
