5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over <b>what</b> <b>any</b> of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E

The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the Condon Committee (1966–68), led by physicist Edward Condon, and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of <b>what</b> <b>any</b> of them actually were, did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security.|$|E
25|$|In Absentia is {{the seventh}} studio album by British {{progressive}} rock band Porcupine Tree, first released on 24 September 2002.

Additionally, it was their first release on a major record label, Lava Records. It was very well received critically and commercially, with it often being considered the band's crowning achievement, and selling over triple <b>what</b> <b>any</b> of the band's prior albums had in the past.|$|E

25|$|In 1844 the tax {{receipts}} were in, and Sherif Pasha, {{the head of}} the diwan al-maliyya (financial ministry), was too fearful for his life to tell the Wāli the news that Egyptian debt now stood at 80million francs (£2,400,000). Tax arrears came to 14,081,500 piastres out of a total estimated tax of 75,227,500 pts. Timidly he approached Ibrahim Pasha with these facts, and together came up with a report and a plan. Anticipating his father's initial reaction, İbrahim arranged for Muhammad Ali's favourite daughter to break the news. It did little, if any, good. The resulting rage was far beyond <b>what</b> <b>any</b> had been expected, and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold.|$|E

The spire was also approved by the Department of Transport and Communications, which said the spire would cause no air traffic problems, and the spire was added to {{the building}} upon completion.|$|E

VFX artist Kirk Balden said of production, [...] "On many projects, you start off with storyboards and everyone has {{a good idea of}} what it's going to look like when it's completed.

500|$|The brickwall {{mastering}} technique utilised {{during the}} recording of the album has led to some journalists claiming that it was responsible for initiating the loudness war, as its heavy use of compression, first widely used by Morris on Definitely Maybe, was leaps and bounds beyond <b>what</b> <b>any</b> other album up until then had attempted. Music journalist Nick Southall, {{who has written extensively}} on the loudness war, commented, [...] "If there's a jump-the-shark moment as far as CD mastering goes then it's probably Oasis." [...] In Britpop and the English Music Tradition Andy Bennet and John Stratton noted {{that as a result of}} this technique [...] "the songs were especially loud. [...] Gallagher's voice is foregrounded to the point that it appears to grow out of the mixes of the songs, exposing itself to execute a pseudo-live quality." ...|$|E
500|$|Zicree {{explained}} {{that he did not}} consider [...] "World Enough and Time" [...] to be a fan-film, comparing it to the episodes of Sliders he was a producer on. He said that they sought to do it the same way as a network show, but added that [...] "the level of production is way beyond <b>what</b> <b>any</b> network show would be, because you would never have 700 visual effects shots in a single hour on any network show." [...] However, Cawley said that Zicree treated many of the New Voyages crew poorly, and he was removed from the set after they faced a staff walkout. He {{explained that}} after he spoke to Zicree, the director had a [...] "meltdown" [...] and was unable to complete the shoot. So Cawley asked his friend Carlos Pedraza to complete the episode uncredited.|$|E

He met with Nixon several days after the election in Key Biscayne, Florida. Nixon, vice president himself for eight years under Eisenhower, wanted to spare Agnew the boredom and lack of a role he had sometimes experienced in that office. Nixon gave Agnew {{an office in the}} West Wing of the White House, a first for a vice president. When they stood before the press after the meeting, Nixon pledged that Agnew would not have to undertake the ceremonial roles usually undertaken by the holders of the vice presidency, but would have [...] "new duties beyond <b>what</b> <b>any</b> vice president has previously assumed". Nixon told the press that he planned to make full use of Agnew's experience as county executive and as governor in dealing with matters of federal-state relations and in urban affairs.|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} days of 2002, when an {{invasion}} of Iraq was still a hypothetical question, Daniels told the New York Times that the cost of war with Iraq “could be” in the range of $50 to $60 billion. [...] It was not clear whether Daniels was referring to the cost of a short invasion or a longer war, but he did indicate the administration was budgeting for both. [...] He also described the “back-of-the-envelope” estimate by Bush Economic Advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey that it would cost $100 to $200 billion as much too high. Two days later, after the New Years Holiday, an OMB spokesperson clarified Daniels’ remarks, adding that the $50 to $60 billion figure was not a hard White House estimate and “it is impossible to know <b>what</b> <b>any</b> military campaign would ultimately cost. [...] The only cost estimate we know of in this arena is the Persian Gulf War and that was a $60 billion event".|$|E
500|$|On a $25 million budget, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} over three months between June and August 1993. Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. Freeman described filming as tense, saying, [...] "Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those." [...] Freeman referred to Darabont's requiring multiple takes of scenes which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film. The scene featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, [...] "A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure <b>what</b> <b>any</b> given actor needs." [...] He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing {{the outside of the}} prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.|$|E

[...] He graded the episode A-, praising the [...] "No on Infinity" [...] ad parody and reappearances of George Takei and Hedonismbot in particular. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote: [...] "I’d {{like to see them}} lay off the contemporary commentary episodes for a bit, but other than that it was exactly <b>what</b> <b>any</b> fan of the show would hope for." [...] Danny Gallagher of TVSquad stated that the episode's [...] "robotic take on the needless hysteria and blatant hypocricy [...] of gay marriage was not only steeped in satiric goodness, but it was downright hilarious." [...] He felt that the episode's writing was an improvement over the previous episodes in the season and that it [...] "really used the storied and rich history of the characters to its advantage." [...] In particular, Gallagher praised Takei's cameo as one of the episode's funniest, even stating it {{to be one of the}} series' best. [...] Alasdair Wilkins of io9 also praised the episode, calling it [...] "a triumph for the new Futurama, and just the sort of episode that leaves me convinced that the show's revival was completely worthwhile." [...] Michelle Castillo of Television on Today enjoyed the attack on California Proposition 8, stating that the episode [...] "poked fun at the issues in the unique way that only 'Futurama' can pull off." ...|$|E
