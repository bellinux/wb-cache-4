25|$|The {{decision}} to create The King of Fighters XIV was made when SNK Playmore's CEO Eikichi Kawasaki decided the company {{should return to}} producing appealing fighting games rather than Pachinko-Slot Machines and Mobile Apps. While it took some time, the game began full production when more staff from Esaka joined the team in April 2014. The staff wanted the game {{to be easy to}} play and as popular as The King of Fighters '98 and KOF 2002. While KOF XIII was a success, it was noted by the staff to be challenging to newcomers. Accordingly, they intended to combine the simplicity of KOF '98 with the Quick Max features of KOF 2002 and the way meters were managed in KOF XIII. The game was first announced at the Sony Computer Entertainment Press Conference for the 2015 Tokyo Game Show and was present at the PlayStation Experience 2015. SNK Playmore chose the PlayStation 4 as its console due to high worldwide sales. While SNK Playmore did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a new system to the game, some changes were made in response to The King of Fighters XIII. Whether the game will be given updates (like Street Fighter IV) or be a single release followed by sequels was yet to be decided. In August 2016, the staff decided to advance the new plot through a sequel.|$|E

The exact amount of freeze-dried culture varies by manufacturer and strain of yeast but it is often around 1gram per gallon (or 25grams per 100 liters). Wines that could have potentially problematic fermentation (such as high sugar level late harvest or botryized wines) may have more yeast added.|$|E
2500|$|The opera glove {{has enjoyed}} varying {{popularity}} in the decades since World War I, being most prevalent as a fashion accessory in the 1940s through the early 1960s (long gloves were an important accessory of Christian Dior's [...] "New Look" [...] designs), but {{continues to this day}} to be popular with women who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a particularly elegant touch to their formal outfits, and have enjoyed minor revivals in fashion design on several occasions in recent years (they were very prominent, for example, in haute couture collections for the fall/winter 2007 season). Opera gloves continue to be popular accessories for bridal, prom, debutante, and quinceañera gowns and at very formal ballroom dances (to this day, for example, it is mandatory for female participants at the Vienna Opera Ball to wear white opera gloves) and are often worn by entertainers such as can-can dancers and burlesque performers (particularly to perform a gown-and-glove dance). In popular culture, probably the two best-known images incorporating opera gloves are those of Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946) and Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953). (Actress Audrey Hepburn was also known for glove-wearing on- and off-screen, but the style of glove she popularized is a type of coat-sleeve-length or three-quarters-length glove, rather than true opera-length.) ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the third}} Infinity Blade title was {{completed}} in September 2013, Chair was looking to return to Shadow Complex but a new opportunity came about as Apple had introduced Chair to Bad Robot, the production company of film and television director J.J.

During 2015 as Spyjinxs development continued, Mustard recognized that Chair had grow large and mature enough to handle a second project. He opted to have part of his team create Shadow Complex Remastered, using the help of a friendly third-party studio to help port the game to the Unreal Engine 4, giving the game more realistic rendering capabilities enabled {{by the nature of the}} original game assets being developed at high resolution. Chair included keyboard and mouse controls for personal computer users and added in new melee takedown maneuvers, as these were already featured developed for the anticipated sequel. The Remastered version also includes new achievements and Master challenges.

But {{in doing}} this, {{we have found}} out that the main problem is getting finance at {{affordable}} interest rates. The Federal Government talks about this and the banks also talk about it. But I want to state here that the banks have not been helpful. They always say money is available. Where is the money? There is no small scale industrialist who walks into a bank and gets a loan. It is difficult for SMEs to get loans from banks because they always demand for collaterals. The collateral they ask for is over and above the worth of the loan. So, the banks are not keen on lending to small scale businesses at all. They say this sub-sector is risk infested. They may claim that they have given some amount of money as loans to the SMEs; but you will find out that this is not true. For instance, what can a loan that is given to 2,000 people in a nation of about 167 million people do? The last statistics conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that there were about 17 million small scale industrialists in Nigeria and you are talking about empowering 2,000 people with loans. What is that? So, the banks are paying lip service to funding SMEs." ...|$|E
