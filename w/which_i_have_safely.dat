60|$|With my {{recognition}} of the place to <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> now wandered, came remembrance of the dangers <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left behind me on the rock-track that led from the mainland to the promontory--dangers of narrow ledges and treacherous precipices, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> passed <b>safely,</b> while unconscious {{of them in the}} mist, but <b>which</b> <b>I</b> shrank from tempting again, now that I recollected them, until the sky <b>had</b> cleared, and <b>I</b> could see my way well before me. The atmosphere was still brightening slowly over the tossing, distant waves: I determined to wait until it had lost all its obscurity, before I ventured to retrace my steps.|$|R
6000|$|... ...<b>I</b> seem to <b>have</b> {{followed}} {{your summer}} rather well and intimately and rejoicingly, thanks to Bill's impartings {{up to the}} time he left me, and to the beautiful direct and copious news aforesaid from yourself and from Alice, and I make out that I may deem things well with you when I see you so mobile and mobilizable (so emancipated and unchained for being so,) as well as so fecund and so still overflowing. Your annual go at Keene Valley (which I'm never to have so much as beheld) and the nature of your references to it--as this one to-night--fill me with pangs and yearnings--I mean the bitterness, almost, of envy: there is so little of the Keene Valley side of things in my life. But I went up to Scotland a month ago, for five days at John Cadwalader's (of N.Y.) vast [...] "shooting" [...] in Forfarshire (let to him out of Lord Dalhousie's real principality,) and there, in absolutely exquisite weather, had a brief but deep draught of the glory of moor and mountain, as that air, and ten-mile trudges through the heather and by the brae-side (to lunch with the shooters) delightfully give it. It was an exquisite experience. But those things are over, and I am [...] "settled in" [...] here, D.V., for a good quiet time of urgent work (during the season here that on the whole I love best, for it makes for concentration--and il n'y a que ça--for me!) which will float me, I trust, till the end of February; when I shall simply go up to London till the mid-May. No more [...] "abroad" [...] for me within any calculable time, heaven grant! Why the devil I didn't write to you after reading your Pragmatism--how I kept from it--I can't now explain save by the very fact of the spell itself (of interest and enthralment) that the book cast upon me; I simply sank down, under it, into such depths of submission and assimilation that any reaction, very nearly, even that of acknowledgment, would have had almost the taint of dissent or escape. Then I was lost in the wonder {{of the extent to which}} all my life <b>I</b> <b>have</b> (like M. Jourdain) unconsciously pragmatised. You are immensely and universally right, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been absorbing a number more of your followings-up of the matter in the American (Journal of Psychology?) which your devouring devotee Manton Marble ... plied, and always on invitation does ply, me with. I feel the reading of the book, at all events to have been really the event of my summer. In which connection (that of [...] "books"), I am infinitely touched by your speaking of having read parts of my American Scene (of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> hope Bill <b>has</b> <b>safely</b> delivered you the copy of the English edition) to Mrs. Bryce--paying them the tribute of that test of their value. Indeed the tribute of your calling the whole thing [...] "köstlich stuff" [...] and saying it will remain to be read so and really gauged, gives me more pleasure than I can say, and quickens my regret and pain at the way the fates have been all against (all finally and definitely now) my having been able to carry out my plan and do a second instalment, embodying more and complementary impressions. Of course <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a plan--and the second vol. would have attacked the subject (and my general mass of impression) at various other angles, thrown off various other pictures, in short contributed much more. But the thing was not to be....|$|R
60|$|The {{excitement}} had now burned itself out: she {{had dropped}} her head wearily on my shoulder, and bade me take her back. When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>safely</b> deposited {{her on the}} couch again, she remained for some minutes with her face covered, silently weeping.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>safely</b> {{received}} your cheque this morning, {{and will}} {{hand it over}} forthwith to the honorary secretary of the hospital. <b>I</b> hope you <b>have</b> read the little speech in the hospital's publication of it. They had it taken by their own shorthand-writer, and it is done verbatim.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>safely</b> arrived here, {{just in time}} to add a line to that effect, and {{get this}} off by to-morrow's English mail from New York. Catarrh rather better. Everything triumphant last night, except no sleep again. I suppose Dolby to be now {{on his way back to}} join me here. I am much mistaken if the {{political}} crisis do not damage the farewells by almost one half.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{fact remains}} as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> stated it," [...] Lord Chelsford said slowly. [...] "My {{information}} is positive. When {{you came to}} me and suggested that you should make two copies of everything, one correct, one a mass of incorrectness, I must admit that I thought the idea farfetched and unworkable. Events, however, <b>have</b> proved otherwise. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>safely</b> received everything <b>which</b> you sent me, and up to the present, with the exception of that first plan of the Winchester forts, our secrets are unknown. But now we have come to a deadlock." ...|$|R
6000|$|SECTION XCIV. Eighth side. God {{creating}} Man. Represented as a throned figure, with a glory {{round the}} head, laying {{his left hand}} {{on the head of}} a naked youth, and sustaining him with his right hand. The inscription puzzled me for a long time; but except the lost r and m of [...] "formavit," [...] and a letter quite undefaced, but to me unintelligble, before the word Eva, {{in the shape of a}} figure of 7, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>safely</b> ascertained the rest.|$|R
5000|$|I greatly joyed that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>safely</b> found {{a certain}} token of their safe being at Croatoan, {{which is the}} place where Manteo was born, and the savages of the island our friends. [...] White had {{instructed}} them that if anything happened to them, they should carve a Maltese cross on a tree nearby, indicating that their disappearance had been forced. As there was no cross, White took this to mean they had moved to [...] "Croatoan Island" [...] (now known as Hatteras Island). Upon finding the message of CROATOAN carved on the palisade, White also wrote: ...|$|R
6000|$|Still, those horrible {{memories}} <b>had,</b> <b>I</b> am {{bound to}} say, a useful part in my {{preparation for the}} ordeal. They were of fact <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen, of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> myself been in part a sharer, and <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> survived. With such experiences behind me, could there be aught before me more dreadful? [...] .|$|R
60|$|Thus far the {{information}} <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> received from Mrs. Clements--though it established facts of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not previously been aware--was of a preliminary character only.|$|R
5000|$|... "all my {{interest}} terms titles and possession <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in and upon one watter whele called Potar Whele <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> of the grant of the said Lord".|$|R
6000|$|... 'To <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{reason to}} know,' said Pott, looking towards Mr. Perker for corroboration--'to <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> reason {{to know that}} my article of last Saturday in some degree contributed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{makes me}} say that {{everything}} <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done {{was done by the}} counsel of Our Lord. I did not say that, <b>I</b> said 'all <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> well done.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear me, father," [...] said Catharine; [...] "there {{is still}} one mode of safety held out: it is one <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> often proposed, and for <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in vain supplicated your permission." ...|$|R
60|$|Her face brightened; {{she came}} a step nearer to me. Her fingers trifled nervously with a flower <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> picked in the garden, and <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{put into the}} button-hole of my coat.|$|R
5000|$|A Book in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> Summarized the Science of Optics {{from the}} Two Books of Euclid and Ptolemy, to <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> added the Notions of the First Discourse which is Missing from Ptolemy's Book ...|$|R
6000|$|I owe much also to {{previous}} books by {{and about the}} Shelleys. Those to <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> referred {{more than once in}} the introduction and notes are here given with the abbreviated form <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> used: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, George, I drank beer {{in those}} days; {{it is one}} of things of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lived to see the folly. In fact, there are not many things of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not lived to see the folly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{investigation}} {{amongst them}} led to reflection's <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just now hinted," [...] said Maxwell; [...] "and I {{think they are}} pretty strongly exemplified by a story <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been endeavouring to arrange from some of your family manuscripts." ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{pushed the door}} open and walked into the room. ‘Your highness,’ said I, ‘this is no time for moralising; with a little {{promptness}} we may save this creature’s life; and as for the other, he need cause you no concern, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> him <b>safely</b> under lock and key.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the Soul <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{lost and}} on the Conscience <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> killed, <b>I</b> tell you that I cannot feel! I am as the Gods, knowing good and evil, but {{untouched}} by either. Is this enviable or is it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, marry, is it!" [...] said Woodcock; [...] "but I wish I could hood thee {{as they do}} the hawks, for thou starest as wildly as if you sought another fray {{or another}} fanfarona. <b>I</b> would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thee <b>safely</b> housed, for thou lookest wild as a goss-hawk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The plan {{might be}} as good as another, though I own that it had not {{occurred}} to me; but it would certainly necessitate my having him held prisoner until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got <b>safely</b> out of France, otherwise my fate would assuredly be to be broken on the wheel." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the spring}} of the year {{eighteen}} hundred and forty-nine I was wandering in the East, and had then recently altered the travelling plans <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> laid out some months before, and <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> communicated to my lawyer and my banker in London.|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{pushed the door}} open and walked into the room. [...] "Your highness," [...] said I, [...] "this is no time for moralising; with a little {{promptness}} we may save this creature's life; and as for the other, he need cause you no concern, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> him <b>safely</b> under lock and key." ...|$|R
60|$|First of all, I must beg {{forgiveness}} {{of my body}} for the vileness through <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> dragged it, and {{forgiveness of}} my stomach for the vileness <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> thrust into it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been to the spike, and slept in the spike, and eaten in the spike; also, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> run away from the spike.|$|R
60|$|The moments {{passed in}} silence, {{save for the}} hissing of the rain-drops as they mingled with {{the water of the}} river, and I was saying to myself that of a verity we must <b>have</b> drifted <b>safely</b> through the fleet without {{touching}} a ship, when that came <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been fearing.|$|R
2500|$|... "I speak that <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen, and <b>which</b> <b>I</b> {{know to be}} true." ...|$|R
60|$|Such {{had been}} the nature of my {{thoughts}} whenever <b>I</b> <b>had</b> directed them upon the melancholy and gloomy state of our affairs. Yet had the most sinister forebodings <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> entertained at those times been fulfilled, our misfortunes could not have equalled those which in truth fell upon us, the history of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> immediately to tell.|$|R
60|$|And when, in my excited {{frame of}} mind, {{it seemed as}} if the escape was but just begun, I found myself in the thicket amid those lads who had been my playmates since I could remember, while each strove to show in silence how delighted he was that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come <b>safely.</b>|$|R
60|$|P.S.--H.'s book is out at last; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> my copy, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lent already.|$|R
5000|$|His dying {{words were}} {{reported}} as: [...] "I {{wish to be}} buried in Ireland, the country of my adoption a country <b>which</b> <b>I</b> loved, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> faithfully served, and for <b>which</b> <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sacrificed my life." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{handed him}} the typewritten {{communication}} <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> received.|$|R
6000|$|II. The second {{proposition}} to <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> committed myself, in {{the paper}} to <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been obliged to refer so often, is, that the [...] "Positive Philosophy" [...] contains [...] "a great deal which is as thoroughly antagonistic to {{the very essence of}} science as is anything in ultramontane Catholicism." ...|$|R
60|$|Her Will! I {{thought of}} the drops <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen in her work-box. I {{thought of the}} bluish tinge <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> noticed in her complexion. A light which was not of this world--a light shining prophetically from an unmade grave--dawned on my mind. My aunt's secret was a secret no longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my good friend," [...] said Colonel Everard; [...] "the part <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{taken in}} these unhappy broils, perhaps also {{the mode of}} worship in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been educated, have so prejudiced me in mine uncle's opinion, that I must be for some time a {{stranger}} to his house and family." ...|$|R
