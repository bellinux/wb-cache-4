40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The {{objective of}} this work {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of head only waterbath stunning as a means of generating immediate and long lasting unconsciousness while preventing <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> and avoiding carcass damage. This paper reports on the unconsciousness and <b>wing</b> <b>flapping,</b> while carcass quality results are reported elsewhere. 2. EEG measurements showed that immersion of broilers heads' for one second in a waterbath containing water of conductivity 2. 5 mS/cm and a 50 Hz electric field of 10 V/cm resulted in a immediate unconsciousness, and that increasing the electric field strength extended the duration of unconsciousness. 3. Observations showed that the passage of a 25 - 30 mA alternating current of frequency 2000 Hz through the broilers' bodies suppressed the <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> which follows a stun. 4. When the body current and electric field were applied simultaneously, <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> was prevented and EEG signals were suppressed for over 30 seconds indicating that the immediate unconsciousness was long lasting enough to facilitate humane slaughter...|$|R

25|$|The Mirage IV has two pylons {{under each}} wing, with the inboard pylons being {{normally}} used for large drop tanks of 2,500 litre (660 gal (US)) capacity. The outer pylons typically carried ECM and chaff/flare dispenser pods {{to supplement the}} internal jamming and countermeasures systems. On later aircraft, this equipment typically included a Barax NG jammer pod under the port wing and a Boz expendables dispenser under the starboard wing. No cannon armament was ever fitted aboard the type. The early Mirage IVA had a fuselage recess under the engines which could hold a single AN-11 or AN-22 nuclear weapon of 60kt yield. The Mirage IV can carry 12 solid-fuel rockets diagonally down below the <b>wing</b> <b>flaps,</b> for rocket-assisted take off (RATO).|$|E

Power to each wing can be controlled separately by varying the amplitude of the <b>wing</b> <b>flapping,</b> {{the frequency of the}} <b>wing</b> <b>flapping,</b> or both. The flapping frequency can be controlled such that it is at or near the natural frequency of the wings for improved energy efficiency. The wings can be controlled by a gear train, coil-magnet arrangement or many other actuation systems that enable variable frequency flapping, variable amplitude flapping, or a combination of both. The gear train mechanism provides gyroscopic stability during flight. The <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> can include a rotation, or feathering motion, for improved efficiency.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Numerous tudies on the {{aerodynamics}} {{of insect}} <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> {{were carried out}} on different approaches of flight investigations, model experiments, and numerical simulations, but the theoretical modeling remains to be explored. In the present paper, an analytic approach is presented to model the flow interactions of <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> in air for small insects with the surrounding flow fields being highly unsteady and highly viscous. The model of <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> is a 2 -D flat plate, which makes plunging and pitching oscillations as well as quick rotations reversing its positions of {{leading and trailing edges}}, respectively, during stroke reversals. It contains three simplified aerodynamic assumptions: (i) unsteady potential flow; (ii) discrete vortices shed from both leading and trailing edges of the wing; (iii) Kutta conditions applied at both edges. Then the problem is reduced to the solution of the unsteady Laplace equation, by using distributed singularities, i. e., sources/sinks, and vortices in the field. To validate the present physical model and analytic method proposed via benchmark examples, two elemental motions in <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> and a case of whole flapping cycles are analyzed, and the predicted results agree well with available xperimental nd numerical data. This verifies that the present analytical approach may give qualitatively correct and quantitatively reasonable results. Furthermore, the total fluid-dynamic force in the present method can be decomposed into three parts...|$|R

He further specified that the landing gear remain deployed in the takeoff/landing position, the <b>wing</b> <b>flaps</b> be lowered 15degrees, and the cabin remain unpressurized. Copilot William Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft's range was limited to approximately [...] under the specified flight configuration, which meant that a second refueling would be necessary before entering Mexico. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on Reno, Nevada, as the refueling stop. Finally, Cooper directed that the plane take off with the rear exit door open and its staircase extended. Northwest's home office objected, on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase deployed. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, {{but he would not}} argue the point; he would lower it himself once they were airborne.|$|E
500|$|KAL007 {{had four}} {{redundant}} hydraulic systems of which systems one, two, and three were damaged or destroyed. There {{was no evidence}} of damage to system four. The hydraulics provided actuation for all the primary flight controls; all secondary flight controls except leading edge slats; and landing gear retraction, extension, gear steering, and wheel braking. Each primary flight control axis received power from all four hydraulic systems. Upon missile detonation, the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations (yawing) as the dual channel yaw damper was damaged. Yawing would not have occurred if hydraulic systems one or two were fully operational. The result is that the control column did not thrust forward upon impact (it should have done so as the plane was on autopilot) to bring down the plane to its former altitude of [...] This failure of the autopilot to correct the rise in altitude indicates that hydraulic system number three, which operates the autopilot actuator, a system controlling the plane's elevators, was damaged or out. KAL007's airspeed and acceleration rate both began to decrease as the plane began to climb. At twenty seconds after missile detonation a click was heard in the cabin, which is identified as the [...] "automatic pilot disconnect warning" [...] sound. Either the pilot or co-pilot had disconnected the autopilot and was manually thrusting the control column forward in order to bring the plane lower. Though the autopilot had been turned off, manual mode did not begin functioning for another twenty seconds. This failure of the manual system to engage upon command indicates failure in hydraulic systems one and two.
