It was rejected {{for the time}} being, but a committee to work <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> was named in 1923. When {{it became clear that}} the Labour Party might be split in two, the board Østerdalens Arbeiderblad sympathized with the communist opposition, prompting Stubberud to resign and be replaced by acting editor Evald O. Solbakken. On 10 November 1923, after the Communist Party of Norway was founded and Arbeideren (the new name of Demokraten) aligned with that, a conference was held where most people agreed that Østerdalens Arbeiderblad should be discontinued and Arbeideren take over as organ for Østerdalen. On 11 November the tide turned completely as the supervisory council decided that Østerdalens Arbeiderblad should side with the Labour Party. Elverum Labour Party also decided to stay in the party instead of following the communists. Solbakken was fired, and Sæter returned. He remained so until 1932. Other acting editors during the newspaper's existence were Gerhard Iversen, Georg Svendsen and Johs. Borchgrevink.|$|E

2500|$|Another reason Tillich criticized {{theological}} theism {{was because}} it placed God into the subject-object dichotomy. This is the basic distinction made in Epistemology, that branch of Philosophy which deals with human knowledge, how it is possible, what it is, and its limits. Epistemologically, God cannot be made into an object, that is, an object of the knowing subject. Tillich deals <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> {{under the rubric of}} the relationality of God. The question is [...] "whether there are external relations between God and the creature". Traditionally Christian theology has always understood the doctrine of creation to mean precisely this external relationality between God, the Creator, and the creature as separate and not identical realities. Tillich reminds us of the point, which can be found in Luther, that [...] "there is no place to which man can withdraw from the divine thou, because it includes the ego and is nearer to the ego than the ego to itself".|$|E
