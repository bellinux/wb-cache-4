5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> cool, fried-out sound.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> way to starve; she suggested {{that there would be}} a lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
5|$|Charles B. Pierce {{was born}} in Hammond, Indiana on June 16, 1938, one of three boys born to Mack McKenny Pierce and Mayven Bryant Pierce. His family moved to the southwestern Arkansas city of Hampton when he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few months old. There he was a {{childhood}} friend and neighbor of future film and television director Harry Thomason, and the two made home movies together in their backyards using an old 8 mm camera. His first professional foray into media entertainment was in the mid-1960s as an art director at KTAL-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana. He later became a weatherman and hosted a children's cartoon show for that channel.|$|E

5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the Central American squirrel monkey <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American squirrel monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Maggie's baby monitor {{receives}} transmissions {{from the}} cellular tower. Rather than report this to Omnitouch, Marge becomes obsessed with eavesdropping on private calls. Eventually Bart and Milhouse play a prank on Marge by making her think that an escaped convict {{was attempting to}} break into the house. When Milhouse opens the front door and tries to tell Marge that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> prank, Marge smashes the baby monitor on Milhouse's head and knocks him out and Bart rebukes that it was a fair punishment for eavesdropping, to which Marge reluctantly agrees.|$|E

The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> rumor.|$|E

Ordered to leave by the King and Queen of Hearts, Alice argues with them, eventually claiming that they are just a pack of cards. As they swarm her, Alice awakens {{on the riverbank}} and realizes that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> dream.|$|E
5|$|Terraforming is {{a natural}} {{outgrowth}} of colonizing an alien world. The first playable prototype <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> map generator that tested climate changes during the game. This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and melt ice caps.|$|E

5|$|The Foch Line was {{negotiated}} with the Polish war mission, led by General Tadeusz Jordan-Rozwadowski in Paris, while Lithuanian representatives were not invited. The Foch Line had two major modifications compared to the June 18 line: first, the entire line was moved west to give extra protection to the strategic Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway and second, the Suwałki Region, including the towns of Sejny, Suwałki, Puńsk, was assigned to Poland. Despite assurances {{at the time that}} the line <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> temporary measure to normalize the situation before full negotiations could take place, the southern Foch Line has been regarded since then as the border between Lithuania and Poland.|$|E
5|$|The {{passage of}} the Mayflower across the North Atlantic lasted more than two months, with 102 {{passengers}} crowded onto the cargo ship's gun deck and about 30 crew members. The seas were not severe during {{the first month of}} the voyage but, by the second month, the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales, causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage. There were two deaths, but this <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> precursor to what happened after their Cape Cod arrival, when almost half the company died in the first winter.|$|E

Subsequently, she played the Ghost of Christmas Past in several productions at the theater, and she later starred as Helen Keller alongside her mother (who played Anne Sullivan) in a production of The Miracle Worker, under her father's direction. Wood's parents separated in 1996, and later divorced, and Wood moved with her mother to her mother's native Los Angeles County, California.|$|E

5|$|All four {{ships were}} laid down on 16 June 1909, but this <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> {{ceremonial}} event as actual work {{did not begin}} until September–October. One major complication was that the design for the turrets and their magazines was not completed when construction began so their weights and dimensions had to be estimated. The machinery for these ships was built by either the Baltic Works or the Franco-Russian Works as the New Admiralty Shipyard lacked its own engine shop. Construction was initially very slow because the Duma did not allocate any money for these ships until May 1911. Initial funding was taken from other budget items or the emperor's discretionary fund and the shipyards had {{to use their own}} money to keep the work going. They were enormously expensive with their cost estimated at 29.4 million rubles each, including armament. By way of comparison the preceding class of pre-dreadnoughts had only cost 11 million rubles each. Once the Duma provided the funding the pace of work accelerated and the ships were launched later that year, although delays in the delivery of engines and turrets hindered their completion. All of the ships completed abbreviated trials by the end of 1914 and reached the fleet in December 1914 – January 1915.|$|E
5|$|Annoyed {{that none}} of his {{co-workers}} {{paid attention to the}} fire safety seminar he gave last week, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> drill, but Stanley (Leslie David Baker) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), and Michael (Steve Carell) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a CPR training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital {{as a staff}} nurse on the general surgery ward, making a poor first {{impression}} by being disorganised and insolent. Mistakenly believing that living with her superior will ensure her an easy time at work, Donna invites herself {{to move in with}} nurse Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White). The two have a strained relationship: within weeks, Donna is evicted for falling behind on her rent, and when she is later allowed to move back in, she lets bailiffs take Lisa's possessions after failing to keep up her own loan repayments. Forced to run a shift in charge of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit as recompense, Donna struggles to manage and learns a new respect for Lisa. During this period, Donna has a friendship with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Mickie is questioning her sexuality, and the two have sex while drunk. Mickie is disappointed when Donna states that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> one-night stand, but they are able to reconcile their friendship. When the general surgery ward is downsized, Donna is forced to reapply for her job. Although she gives a good interview and impresses Lisa, other candidates have more experience, so she is unable to retain her position and has to work as a bank nurse.|$|E
