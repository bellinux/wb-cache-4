40|$|In {{the present}} study, foam-forming and -stabilizing {{properties}} of potato proteins were studied using <b>whipping</b> and sparging <b>tests.</b> The soluble potato proteins {{are mainly composed of}} patatin and protease inhibitors. The <b>whipping</b> <b>tests</b> showed that less foam was formed from untreated patatin {{than from the}} protease inhibitors, but patatin foam was much more stable. The foam-forming properties of patatin could be strongly improved by partial unfolding of the protein. <b>Whipping</b> <b>tests,</b> at both low (0. 5 mg/mL) and high (10 mg/mL) protein concentration, also indicated that foams made with an ethanol-precipitated protein isolate were more stable than those made with β-casein and β-lactoglobulin. More generally, it can be concluded that when proteins are used as a foaming agent, a high concentration is required, because the protein available is inefficiently used. Also, there are several variables that may all, in different ways, affect both foam formation (amount of foam, bubbles size distribution) and foam stability. These variables include the type and concentration of protein, solvent conditions (pH, I), and the method used to make the foam.

5000|$|Ellen reveals two empty vodka bottles were {{discovered}} {{on the flight}} - {{despite the fact that}} no beverages were served to passengers onboard, and that Whip has also suspended in flight service prior to take off. With the exclusion of <b>Whip's</b> <b>test,</b> Ellen reveals that Katerina's toxicology report came back positive. Ellen asks Whip if he believes that Katerina had drank onboard the flight. Rather than allow Katerina's reputation to be destroyed for his own actions, Whip reluctantly, but finally admits to having drank on board the flight and in the three {{days leading up to the}} flight, and confessing he is an alcoholic. A year later, Whip, now imprisoned tells his story to a support group of his fellow inmates. Whip tells them that the FAA revoked his license for good, and that he will most likely spend the next 4 to 5 years behind bars for his actions - both consequences of which he firmly agrees are deserved and fair. Whip also relates that he is proud to be sober, and does not regret doing the right thing. Whip is seen looking at pictures of Nicole, family, and friends on the wall of his cell, along with greeting cards congratulating him on being sober for a year. He is working to rebuild his relationship with his son, who visits to talk with him about a college application essay on [...] "the most fascinating person that I've never met." [...] His son begins by asking, [...] "Who are you?" [...] As a plane flies overhead, Whip replies, [...] "That's a good question." ...|$|R

Although the whip chain showed killing {{potential}} and precision (destroying five glass orbs in two strikes), the shark tooth club was able {{not only to}} cut a leg of beef, but to keep cutting even {{when some of the}} teeth broke off inside the target. The shark tooth club was given the edge.|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} {{much interest in}} breads containing non-wheat cereals because of their nutritional profile. However, partial replacement of wheat flour by non-wheat alternatives reduces the gas-holding capacity of dough, which has a detrimental effect on bread loaf volume and crumb structure. In the initial steps of the classical wheat bread making process, the viscoelastic gluten network stabilizes the gas cells. The gas cells remain discrete until discontinuities develop in the gluten-starch matrix, leaving areas surrounded with only an aqueous film. This film is believed to originate from the dough aqueous phase and mainly consists of surface-active and viscosifying constituents. Today, the composition and functional properties of the aqueous phase of non-wheat cereal doughs are still very poorly understood. In this work, the aqueous phase (further referred to as dough liquor [DL]) of fermented dough from wheat, rye, barley, and oat flour was isolated using ultracentrifugation. DL composition showed high protein levels for wheat and rye, while lipid levels were unexpectedly high in oat DL. The non-starch polysaccharide fractions of wheat and rye DL were rich in arabinoxylan (AX), whereas β-glucans were the major polysaccharides of barley and oat DL. Surface tension and dilatational interfacial rheology measurements were performed at constant DL protein levels using a pendant drop tensiometer and foaming experiments also conducted at constant protein level using a standardized <b>whipping</b> <b>test.</b> Enzymes specifically targeting non-starch polysaccharides were used to study how AX and β-glucan affect DL surface-active and foaming properties. Overall, the data indicated that the interface in fermenting wheat dough is composed of a mixture of proteins and lipids without any associative interactions between AX and the adsorbed interfacial layer. In contrast, the interfacial region in fermenting rye dough seems {{to be dominated by}} proteins with AX acting as secondary stabilizing layer. The interface in fermenting barley dough presumably consists of proteins. Barley β-glucans did not seem to interact with the primary adsorbed protein layer. The interfacial layer in fermenting oat dough appears to be dominated by both proteins and lipids. In contrast to what was observed with wheat, the mixed interface was remarkably resistant to dilatation already at high dilution. Oat β-glucans determined the stability of the interfacial region, but to a lower extent than with rye AX. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|In bread making, proper {{gas cell}} {{stabilization}} results in high loaf volume and homogeneous fine-grained crumb. In wheat bread making, gluten proteins form a viscoelastic network that initially stabilizes the gas cell nuclei incorporated during dough mixing. However, {{at a certain}} point during fermentation, an aqueous film takes over gas cell stabilization. This film is made up by the dough aqueous phase and contains surface-active (proteins and polar lipids) and viscosifying (carbohydrates) constituents. Today’s consumers are increasingly aware of the potential health benefits of the consumption of multigrain breads. Indeed, non-wheat cereals are superior to wheat in terms of dietary fiber and essential amino acid(s) levels. In non-wheat cereal dough systems, liquid films stabilizing gas cells during late fermentation and early baking are presumably more important than in wheat dough due to the inferior protein networks in these systems. Regretfully, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no studies on gas cell stabilization by liquid films in non-wheat cereal bread systems have been executed. This work aims at unraveling the mechanism(s) of gas cell stabilization in cereal bread systems by studying the composition and functional (air/water interfacial and foaming) properties of their aqueous phases. The aqueous phases of fermented dough prepared from cereal only systems (i. e. wheat, rye, oat, or barley flour) were isolated as dough liquor (DL) by making use of ultracentrifugation. Surface tension and dilatational interfacial rheology measurements were performed at constant DL protein levels using a pendant drop tensiometer. Foaming experiments (also conducted at constant protein levels) were executed using a standardized <b>whipping</b> <b>test.</b> Enzymes targeting specific non-starch polysaccharides were used to study how arabinoxylan (AX) and/or β-glucan affect the functionality of DL. Analysis of DL composition revealed high protein levels for wheat and rye, while lipid levels were surprisingly high in oat DL. As expected, the non-starch polysaccharide fractions of wheat and rye DL were rich in AX, whereas β-glucans were the major polysaccharides of barley and oat DL. Overall, the data indicated that the interface in fermenting wheat dough is composed of a mixture of proteins and lipids without any associative interactions between AX and the adsorbed interfacial layer.

40|$|A 2. 5 m hydroelastic {{segmented}} catamaran {{model was}} developed {{based on the}} 112 m INCAT wave-piercer catamaran to simulate the vibration response for the measurement of dynamic slam loads during head sea tests at the Australian Maritime College towing tank. Numerical computations and results of dynamic finite element methods were used {{as a basis for}} predicting the motions and loads acting on the hydroelastic catamaran model. A load measurement system and data acquisition system was developed to measure the dynamic wave loads and motions of the catamaran model. A two degree of freedom spring-mass theoretical model was developed to predict the first longitudinal modal frequency response of an NPL 6 A hydroelastic model and was applied {{to the development of a}} three degree of freedom spring-mass system used to predict the wet and dry whipping frequency response of the catamaran model. Vibration tests were performed on the catamaran model in air and still water to investigate the effects of stiffness and mass on the first longitudinal modal frequency response. The whipping frequency of the catamaran model was validated using full-scale slamming and whipping accelerations obtained on a 112 m INCAT catamaran vessel during a delivery voyage to Japan. Towing tank tests were performed in regular seas to measure the dynamic slam loads acting on the centre bow and vertical bending moments acting in the demihulls of the catamaran model as a function of speed, wave frequency and wave height to establish the operational loads acting on the full-scale 112 m INCAT catamaran vessel. An analysis was performed on the catamaran model slamming kinematics in regular seas to form a basis for developing numerical techniques used to predict slam occurrence and slam severity. The effects of variations of wave height, model test speed and wave encounter frequency were combined so as to express slam severity in terms of the maximum relative bow velocity. Peak slam forces measured on the bow of the model were found to approach the weight of the model this being similar to the findings of full-scale vessel trials. Slam impulses when scaled found greater slam durations at full-scale while scaling of the peak strain energy showed that the hydroelastic model provides a good basis for simulating the energy imparted by the slam into <b>whipping.</b> Thorough <b>testing</b> over a range of encounter frequencies and wave heights exposed the catamaran model to extremely severe slamming without evidence of complete bow immersion indicating that the INCAT 112 m wave piercer design is inherently seaworthy and relatively immune from deck diving in seas up to 5. 4 m...|$|R
5000|$|Stas is on {{a mission}} to {{investigate}} the suspicious activity on New Kuwait of agents from the planet Iney ("frost" [...] in Russian). Iney has already [...] "peacefully" [...] allied with several other Imperial worlds and is gaining in strength, threatening the stability of the Empire. Before Stas or Tikkirey can do anything, most of the population of New Kuwait suddenly falls asleep. Tikkirey and Stas {{are one of the few}} still awake. Stas takes the boy and, at Tikkirey's request, the unconscious Lion with him on his ship. They are able to launch before the population awakes and announces its allegiance with Iney. With some quick thinking, Tikkirey connects Lion's brain to the datastream of the ship, temporarily turning him into a calculation module. The plan works, and Lion awakes shortly after. However, his free will is gone. Stas takes the boys to his homeplanet of Avalon, where the phages' headquarters are located. Tikkirey is hired by the phages to work in support role, while he takes care of Lion. Basically, Tikkirey is forced to tell Lion to do almost everything, hoping that he may one day get better. He also makes friends with his neighbors, a brother and a sister of a slightly younger age. One day, Tikkirey is asked by his supervisor to destroy a faulty plasma whip, which refuses to bond with any phage. To Tikkirey's surprise, the whip bonds to him, and he refuses to destroy the semi-living device. That same day, his neighbors invite him and Lion to go camping at a nearby lake. Since it is wintertime in that part of Avalon, the lake is frozen over. The teenagers (except for Lion) begin to ice skate, but ice cracks under Tikkirey, and he falls into the water. He attempts to get out by using the whip but to no avail. Surprisingly, Lion snaps out of his daze and saves Tikkirey. Stas arrives with paramedics and explains that the <b>whip</b> was a <b>test</b> of loyalty, which Tikkirey has failed. Tikkirey shows that the whip bonded to him, which surprises the phage, as this has never happened before. Tikkirey and Lion are taken to the phage headquarters, where Lion is given a clean bill of health by a psychiatrist. Lion explains that, during the time he was asleep, he has lived an entire lifetime as a citizen of Iney. The boys find out that the phages are planning on sending them back to New Kuwait to conduct an investigation as to how Iney is controlling the population.|$|R
