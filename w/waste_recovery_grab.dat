40|$|Ph. D. (Chemistry) South Africa has a {{background}} in which the regulatory system has major limitations, especially with reference to an integrated approach to waste and pollution. The situation has been rectified with the promulgation of new legislation that will approach pollution and waste in an integrated and holistic manner. This new approach also emphasizes that waste should be minimised at all levels, including the household level. The {{aim of this study}} has been to determine the influence of <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and organic recycling, at household level, on the waste stream within an urban area in South Africa. The following research aims set for this study were: • To discuss the development of waste minimisation, with specific reference to the South African situation and legislative framework. • To investigate <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and organic recycling as a waste management strategy by reviewing literature. • To investigate a <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and organic recycling strategy within a local transitional council by making use of an empirical study. The most important conclusions gained from reviewing the literature are the following: • South Africa has adopted the Integrated Waste Management Approach, which includes recovery and recycling at source as well as organic recycling. • International case studies, incorporating both developed and developing countries, indicate that organic recycling and <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> programmes could be implemented successfully in South Africa with resulting benefits for the communities, service providers and the environment. The aim of the empirical component was to determine the following: • The effect of implementation of organic recycling and <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> measures on the waste stream at households level. • The comparative effect of organic recycling and <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> rates between a training and non-training group. • The respondent's experiences of the organic recycling...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} {{effective}} construction waste management {{is growing in}} importance, due to the increasing generation of construction waste and to its adverse impacts on the environment. However, despite the numerous studies on construction <b>waste</b> management, <b>recovery</b> of construction <b>waste</b> through Industrial Symbiosis and the adoption of other inter-firm practices, comprised within Industrial Ecology field of study, have not been fully explored. The present research aims to investigate Industrial Ecology contributions to waste management in industrial construction. The waste management strategies adopted in two industrial construction projects in Brazil are analyzed. The main waste streams generated are identified, recycling and landfilling diversion rates are presented and <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> through Industrial Symbiosis is discussed. A SWOT analysis was carried out. Results demonstrate that 9 % of the waste produced {{in one of the}} projects was recovered through Industrial Symbiosis, while in the other project, <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> through Industrial Symbiosis achieved the rate of 30 %. These data reveal Industrial Symbiosis’ potential to reduce landfilling of industrial construction wastes, contributing to <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> in construction. In addition, results show that industrial construction projects can benefit from the following synergies common in Industrial Ecology place-based approaches: centralized waste management service, shared waste management infrastructure and administrative simplification...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} keep focus on the {{important}} agenda of sustainability which has lately become an issue of priority, the maritime industry must implement technologies on existing vessels and on those under construction so as to reduce their emissions into the environment. This study examines three potential sources of emission and also identifies a set of emission control measures that are available and could, if fully applied, reduce emission by 19. 058 %. With the <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> system, about 2500 kW of energy are saved, thereby increasing the efficiency to 59. 11 % having about 10. 13 % gain compared to engines without a <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> system.

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen the {{development}} of considerable interest in activities involving the recovery of materials and byproducts from the waste streams of industrial firms and their utilisation, by either the waste-producing firms themselves or other firms, as raw material inputs into production processes. This interest derives, of course, from community concern in the developed nations regarding the problem of environmental pollution. The use of <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and re-use techniques actually reduces the volume of industrial wastes requiring discharge, {{in one form or}} another, into the environment and thus avoids the environmental pollution problems which tend to accompany the waste disposal activities of industrial firms. It would appear however, that <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and re-use techniques have not yet received wide application, with economic considerations apparently playing an important role. This study focusses on the Illawarra region {{as an example of a}} region in which <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and re-use activities have not yet received wide application and investigates the treatment given in the economics literature to these activities, with this investigation being carried out with a view to assessing the contribution that has been made by economists to both the understanding of the particular nature of <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and re-use activities and the stock of policy prescriptions appropriate as a means of inducing an increase in the level and extent of those activities and thus achieving a significant and sustained improvement in environmental quality. A subsidiary aim involved in carrying out this literature review is that of outlining and assessing the current state-of-theart in respect of the treatment of recovery and re-use activities by economists. The thesis is divided into six chapters. Chapter I introduces the study by briefly outlining some of the background of, and justification for, the literature review carried out. Chapter II expands on this brief introduction by considering, and explaining, both the interest which has been expressed in <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and re-use activities in the Illawarra region in recent years and the observation that these activities appear to be 2 ̆ 7 restricted and fragmented 2 ̆ 7. Chapters III and IV present a detailed examination of the economics literature concerned with the analysis of <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and re-use activities. The first of these chapters considers the literature concerned with the inclusion of these activities in analyses relating to the problem of environmental pollution. These analyses have been carried out within the theoretical framework provided by modern welfare economics. The economy-wide perspective of the static and dynamic general equilibrium analysis carried out within this framework reveals that the factors underlying the restricted and fragmented nature of <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and re-use activities basically relate to the existence of a defective system of economic incentives arising out of deficiencies in the operation of market processes. The second chapter referred to above examines the work of those economists who have analysed <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> activities by including them within a framework which deals explicitly with that entity known as 2 ̆ 7 the firm 2 ̆ 7. The theoretical and quantitative analysis carried out within this framework indicates that economic factors are seen by economists as playing an extremely important role in the behaviour of firms in relation to waste generation, abatement and discharge activities. The emphasis placed on economic factors in the literature is accompanied by the prescription of policies, particularly the effluent charge strategy, which seek to induce an increase in the amount of materials and by-product recovery carried on through market related means. In view of this Chapter V considers, and evaluates the importance of, problems and difficulties likely to be encountered in any practical implementation of the effluent charge strategy. It is concluded (Chapter VI) that the economics literature has made an important contribution to the understanding of <b>waste</b> <b>recovery</b> and re-use activities as they are carried on in the Illawarra region. The factors making for the particular nature of these activities, however, operate on an economy-wide scale, so that the policies advanced by the literature represent an approach that might be taken by governments at a state or national, rather than regional, level...|$|R

40|$|In this Master's thesis was {{studied the}} {{feasibility}} of <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> in data centres. The aim was {{to address the problem}} with the continuously increasing electricity consumption in data centres, to explore the <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> opportunities in them and to find out which is the preferred alternative for <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> in the Finnish data centres. Also, to observe the role of management in influencing the <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> policies. The study was conducted through a mixed method research, using the concurrent embedded design type and consisting of a main part, and a complementary part. The main part was of a qualitative nature and was implemented through literature review, media review, observations, interviews and participation in social groups. The complementary part was in a supportive role and focused on revealing the choices of Finnish data centres through an online questionnaire. The latter part necessitated a mixed type of research with a prevailing qualitative aspect and some minor quantitative elements. According to the study, the <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> in data centres is a sensible thing to do, there are many ways for its implementation, it has a big potential and the number of data centres, having a <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery,</b> is growing. Being a low temperature heat, the waste heat from data centres has its drawbacks, but with some upgrading technologies, it can be economically feasible. Based on the questionnaire, it was found that <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> in Finnish data centres is done mainly through a new technology adoption. Though, the difference between this option and the change process one was not big. Moreover, location and management of data centres were considered the most important factors for undertaking a <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery.</b> Ownership was not found to have a great impact on waste heat recovery-related decisions. In Finland, the tendencies of reusing waste heat from data centres are following the international trends and the number of successful cases is growing. Despite of that, <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> is not yet a business in the country as it needs more motivation and change in the way of thinking.
