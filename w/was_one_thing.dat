There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn. War <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> the offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was quite another. Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was no coincidence. The concentration of the PAVN effort on South Vietnam allowed the Khmer Rouge to apply their doctrine and policies without restraint for the first time.|$|E

500|$|Shawn Roberts was {{originally}} going {{to audition for}} Chris Redfield before Miller accepted the role. He went to audition {{for the role of}} Albert Wesker, a role previously played by Jason O'Mara. Describing the character Roberts said, [...] " [...] Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation. He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance. It's a whole process: I get to set and wardrobe gives me this big, long black jacket, and props comes over and gives me the dark glasses and the gloves. By the time you are all dressed you stand a little straighter, you walk a little differently. He's got everything going for him—he's super fast, super strong, has the ability to regenerate—it's all the elements from the game.

Although {{she had lost her}} {{abilities}} to read or to write during her illness, drawing <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> she still remained able to do, and she found a real passion for it. She had always been very private about her artwork, {{but for the first time}} she exhibited a collection of her drawings in a gallery show titled [...] "After The Change." [...] The vernissage at the Doktor Glas gallery in Kungsträdgården featured 24 of her charcoal drawings and ran from 21–30 October 2005. Later she released a book, After the Change, which featured reprints of all 24 sketches.|$|E
2500|$|As war {{correspondent}} Ernie Pyle, who {{was later}} killed in action, would write, [...] "Major General Terry Allen {{was one of}} my favorite people. Partly because he didn't give a damn for hell or high water; partly because he was more colorful than most; and partly because he was the only general outside the Air Forces I could call by his first name. If there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in the world Allen lived and breathed for, it was to fight. He had been all shot up in the last war, and he seemed not the least averse to getting shot up again. This was no intellectual war with him. He hated Germans and Italians like vermin." ...|$|E

2500|$|There were {{numerous}} misconceptions about Lokhvitskaya, according to Vengerov {{who refused to}} see in her a 'decadent' poet. [...] "Totally devoid of sickly feebleness and vain extravagance" [...] (generally associated with the Russian decadent movement), she was, [...] "eager to enjoy life, declaring her right to put forth her feelings with all the mighty fullness of her soul," [...] he maintained. In fact, [...] "the poetess's agility was very much akin {{to the challenges of}} Marxism," [...] opined the critic (a Marxist himself), while her [...] "views on the meaning and reason of life belonged to the Oriental tradition," [...] even if [...] "channeled through a narrow love theme." [...] If there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in Lokhvitskaya's poetry that riled most of her contemporaries, that was her almost demonstrative lack of social awareness.|$|E
2500|$|Banjee. That was the {{identity}} I was given {{back in the}} summer of 1991, when I, half out/half in approached the colored museum of the Christopher Street piers. I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what people were talking about, but I soon gathered that [...] "banjee" [...] meant that I wasn't a [...] "queen." [...] Whatever the terms of identification, all I knew was that there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.|$|E
2500|$|... "Will I?", a song {{which takes}} place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was {{inspired}} by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or have died from AIDS.|$|E

2500|$|To permit Lee's suit, Gray argued, {{would open}} the United States to a {{multitude}} of suits over title to land it held. The cases cited by the majority (such as United States v. Peters, Osborn v. Bank of United States, Meigs v. M'Clung, and Davis v. Gray) were improperly cited, Gray argued, as in each case [...] "either the money was in the personal possession of the defendants {{and not in the}} possession of the State, or the suit was to restrain the defendants by injunction from doing acts in violation of the Constitution of the United States." [...] It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for the Court to eject or dispossess officers or agents of the United States from land or funds; such actions, Gray concluded, continued to immunize the United States government from suits. Carr v. United States reaffirmed this principle, he concluded. To blur the distinction between officer and state or to assume or imply it without the state's consent, as the majority does, Gray said, would leave the sovereign immunity right in shambles.|$|E
2500|$|On May 10, 1940, Germany {{launched}} the blitzkrieg offensive against France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, {{and millions of}} refugees took to the roads. [...] On May 15, Sousa Mendes issued transit visas to Maria Tavares, a Luxembourg citizen of Portuguese origin, and to her husband Paul Miny, also a Luxembourger. Two weeks later, the couple returned to the Bordeaux Consulate asking Sousa Mendes to issue them false papers. Sousa Mendes agreed to their request, and on May 30, 1940, he issued a Portuguese passport listing Paul Miny as Maria's brother, therefore as having Portuguese citizenship. This time Sousa Mendes risked himself {{a great deal more}} than he had before; disobeying Dispatch 14 <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> but issuing a passport with a false identity, for someone of military age was a crime. Sousa Mendes later provided the following explanation: “This couple asked me for a Portuguese passport, where they would figure as brother and sister, for fear that the husband, who was still of military age, would be detained on passing the French border, and incorporated in the Luxembourg army then being organized in France." [...] Under the terms imposed by the German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II, that army was under Nazi control.|$|E
2500|$|Flavius Josephus in Jewish Antiquities , chapter 2 {{recorded}} {{the story of}} King Izates of Adiabene who decided to follow the Law of Moses at {{the advice of a}} Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it {{on the grounds that the}} subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such [...] "strange and foreign rites". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision (Robert Eisenman in James the Brother of Jesus claims that Ananias is Paul of Tarsus who held similar views) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, [...] "a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.|$|E
