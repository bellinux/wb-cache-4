5|$|The {{build-up}} to {{the final}} had focused upon many Manchester United fans' discontent at their takeover by American businessman and sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer, and large demonstrations were planned {{inside and outside the}} Millennium Stadium. Despite this, the final was played in the rain and only a small group of around 100 supporters held protests and sang anti-Glazer songs. The police <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> force but did not have any trouble to deal with.|$|E
5|$|Cambridge {{elected to}} bat and wickets fell regularly. No player made over 33 and the hosts <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> {{the second session}} {{of the first day}} for 167. Miller was {{prominent}} with the ball and in the field, taking 5/46 and two catches for his fellow bowlers. In reply, Australia were already 184/1 at stumps, with Brown heading for a consecutive century. He put on 176 for the second wicket with Hamence, who made 92. Brown reached 200 and was out immediately thereafter, prompting stand-in skipper Hassett to declare midway through the second day at 414/4, having reached 61 not out himself. In their second innings Cambridge failed to cope with the leg-spin of McCool, who took 7/78 as the match ended early on the third morning. Attendance over the three days was nearly 25,000.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the fifth}} inning saw no more hits, and after a Keltner double, three Indians <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> {{the top of the}} sixth inning. The Red Sox began to fight back {{in the bottom of the}} sixth inning. After getting Pesky out, Ted Williams reached first base on an error by Gordon. Stephens struck out, and with two outs in the inning, Bobby Doerr hit his 27th home run of the season to make the score 6–3. No runs were scored in the seventh inning, though Bearden and Mitchell both reached base. The Indians were able to score another run in the eighth inning after Jim Hegan was {{intentionally}} walked. Bearden then hit a fly ball to Williams, who dropped it, allowing Hegan to score and making it 7–3 in the Indians' favor. The Indians were able to score one more run in the ninth when Robinson scored after Keltner grounded into a bases-loaded double play. Bearden got the final three Red Sox out in the bottom of the ninth, finishing the game with an 8–3 Indians victory and giving Bearden a complete game.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} against New Zealand, Blackwell elected to bat, but New Zealand started more effectively. Nitschke and Villani <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> {{consecutive}} overs and Blackwell {{came in at}} 2/14 in the fourth over. After being unable to score from her first six balls, Blackwell was then dismissed for a duck from her seventh delivery, cutting Nicola Browne {{into the hands of}} Sophie Devine in the gully, leaving the score at 3/20 in the sixth over. The Australians eventually reached 8/106 from their 20 overs.|$|E
25|$|The Copenhagen Pride {{festival is}} held {{every year in}} August. A {{colourful}} and festive occasion, it combines political issues with concerts, films and a parade. The focal point is the City Hall Square in the city centre. It usually opens on the Wednesday of Pride Week, culminating on the Saturday with a parade and Denmark's Mr Gay contest. In 2017, some 25,000 people {{took part in the}} parade with floats and flags, and about 300,000 <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the streets to experience it.|$|E
25|$|Watson scored 74 {{runs from}} just 42 balls {{on the fourth}} morning before he was comically run out for 103. Bailey hit 28 off one over from Anderson– the equal record in Test cricket for most runs in one over– {{following}} which Clarke declared with the total on 6/369, setting England 504 to win. Harris bowled Cook with the first ball of the innings, but Carberry and Root were able to steady with a 62-run partnership. Both <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> quick succession, and when Pietersen fell for 45, the score was 4/121. However, Bell and Stokes added 99 before Bell was caught behind on DRS review for 60. England reached 5/251 by the close, requiring 252 runs to keep the Ashes alive.|$|E

25|$|The {{third day}} {{started with the}} clement weather {{of the last few}} days overshadowed by clouds and the {{forecast}} of rain. With Mahmood unable to add to his tally from yesterday, conceding 41 runs on the day. Sri Lanka batted through ten overs, but Farveez Maharoof gave a return catch to Hoggard, and two overs later Flintoff makes a breakthrough, getting Jayawardene out with a catch by wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. However, the ninth-wicket stand between Vaas and Nuwan Kulasekara gave the most runs of the entire innings, as the two add 62 in just over an hour. After lunch, however, they <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the space of three deliveries, and Sri Lanka were all out for 192.|$|E
25|$|Faced with an {{impossible}} 469 runs to win Australia {{had no choice}} but to try to bat out almost 9 hours of play. Lawry (21) added 65 for the first wicket with Stackpole who made 136 with 16 fours. It would have been 17 boundaries but the ball was stopped in the outfield when it hit a seagull, which survived the experience and flew away. He added 202 for the second wicket with Ian Chappell (104), who was dropped by Colin Cowdrey off John Snow early in his innings. When they <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the final session Ian Redpath (21 not out) and Doug Walters (36 not out) saw out the day for 328/3.|$|E
25|$|Rain damaged {{both the}} first and the second day at The County Ground, Hove, and only 93 overs were {{possible}} in two days. Yet, 18 wickets fell on those two days, 14 of which on the second day. Sussex resumed play on the second day with an overnight score of 97 for 4, and immediately lost two wickets to swing bowler Jon Lewis, who ended with four for 62. However, a quick blast of four fours, one six and one single from Jason Lewry lifted Sussex to 191 all out. The Gloucestershire reply never got off the mark, as seven batsmen <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> single figures and the highest partnership was 33. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan got good output with the ball, however, taking four for 26 as Gloucestershire ended on 142.|$|E

25|$|The first – {{and only}} – tie of the National League season was played out at The County Ground, Derby between Derbyshire Phantoms and Scottish Saltires. The hosts won the toss and batted, {{and with the}} help of a century from Australian import Michael di Venuto they ended up with a final total of 220 for 8 – along with 33 not out from Andre Botha. Five batsmen <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> single figures, however. Kevin Dean took three early wickets to reduce the Scots to 31 for 3, but Douglas Lockhart made his highest career score with 88 not out to set Scotland back on track. On the last ball, Scotland needed two runs to win with South African-born number 11 Dewald Nel on strike – he could only scamper a single, and the teams shared the spoils.|$|E
25|$|In addition, many aristocratic Viking women {{wanted to}} serve Freyja and {{represent}} her in Midgard. They married Viking warlords who had Odin {{as a role}} model, and they settled in great halls that were earthly representations of Valhalla. In these halls there were magnificent feasts with ritualized meals, and the visiting chieftains can be likened with the einherjar, the fallen warriors who fought bravely and were served drinks by Valkyries. However, {{the duties of the}} mistresses were not limited to serving mead to visiting guests, but they were also expected to take part in warfare by manipulating weaving tools magically when their spouses <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> battle. Scholars no longer believe that these women waited passively at home, and there is evidence for their magic activities both in archaeological finds and in Old Norse sources, such as the Darraðarljóð.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} mercenaries was {{unknown to the}} Seychellois, as was the fact of whether the attack at the airport was {{supposed}} to coincide with a seaborne invasion. They subsequently set up a roadblock on {{the north end of}} the airport and mounted an unsuccessful attack on the Pointe La Rue Barracks in which one mercenary was wounded. Seychellois forces, with two armoured vehicles, occupied the airstrip, confining the putschists to the airport's buildings. They also fired upon the chartered aircraft, disabling it. One of the armoured vehicles made its way to the terminal forecourt, but the lights <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the building and the driver had difficulty spotting the mercenaries. The vehicle's tires were quickly shot out and it was set ablaze by a Molotov cocktail. 2nd Lieutenant David Antat, the vehicle's commander, emerged from the top and engaged the mercenaries. They surrounded the vehicle and shot Antat several times in the chest, killing him.|$|E

25|$|A {{great team}} effort, despite Martin Bicknell {{being out of}} form, {{resulted}} in Surrey winning their third {{game of the season}} and sharing third place in the table with Hampshire. A healthy opening partnership between Scott Newman and Richard Clinton worth 100 was to be the highest of the entire match, and despite Chris Tremlett taking wickets regularly, he also conceded a lot of runs, as he ended with four for 106 off twenty overs. Newman eventually finished with 111 and Australian David Thornely made 73 to see Surrey to a final score of 361 - in just 81.4 overs. The first two days at The Rose Bowl were hampered by rain, but amid the showers, Indian bowler Harbhajan Singh took six for 36 as Hampshire crumbled in a rather unimpressive heap for 146. Only two batsmen passed 20, and seven <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> single figures. Hampshire's second innings began with the first ball of the third day, and Jason Ormond ripped out two wickets quickly, Mohammad Akram got a five-for, and only John Crawley's 67 - off 62 balls with thirteen boundaries, slightly out of place in the situation - passed 25. Thus, the two teams were tied on 100 points in the Championship, allowing Warwickshire and Kent to run away further on the table.|$|E
25|$|In his {{original}} 1972/73 deep ecology paper, Arne Næss claims the deep ecology movement arose from scientists – ecologists who <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also {{doing the work}} of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three {{of the most influential}} ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were Rachel Carson, David Brower, and Paul R. Ehrlich. Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range deep ecology movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for conservation of land and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because they clearly showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. Silent Spring helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.|$|E
25|$|As Perth did {{not have}} a Test match, players from the eastern states were sent to {{strengthen}} Western Australia for a second game against the tourists. On this occasion only the veteran batsman Peter Burge of Queensland and the young Bob Cowper of Victoria were flown over. Barry Shepherd won the toss and put the MCC in to bat on a day interrupted by four showers. After an opening stand of 74 between Bob Barber (34) and John Edrich (92), Laurie Mayne (3/98) reduced them to 199/6. M.J.K. Smith (112 not out) and Fred Titmus (69) restored the situation with a seventh wicket stand of 139 before Smith declared at 379/7 during a shower in the second afternoon 'to get out of the wet'. Murray Vernon and Pat Kelly added 47 runs in ten overs before they <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> successive balls. Cowper (89) and Burge (52) top-scored in the Combined XI's slow 231/5, Shepherd again declaring after the follow on had been avoided. In reply Bob Barber (113) reached 100 in 89 minutes and helped by Peter Parfitt, Colin Cowdrey and Smith, who all made 24, the MCC made 205/4 to leave the hosts 354 runs to win in 273 minutes. Vernon (44) and Kelly (33) added 71 for the first wicket and Cowper made 122 not out, adding 87 with Burge (50) and 84 with Shepherd (39 not out), but they fell 32 runs short with 4 wickets in hand and the game was a draw.|$|E
