As a halakhic movement we look to precedent to find the tools with which to shape the Torah. For the most part, we rely on the strategies of old. At the same time, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes on moral grounds.|$|E

If I'm against abortion and I don't find a way to love the woman who got the abortion and even her doctor, then I don't understand the gospel." [...] Yancey recounts Jesus's Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, concluding that God is only willing to forgive us if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> forgive those who have wronged us. In a similar vein, he quotes William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice: [...] "How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?" ...|$|E

The possibility remained that, {{with respect to}} our actual configuration of knowledge, which {{is very different from}} Good's example, Nicod's criterion might still be true and so we could still reach the paradoxical conclusion. Hempel, on the other hand, insists that it is our background knowledge itself which is the red herring, and that we should consider induction with respect to a condition of perfect ignorance.|$|E

I therefore make this proposal: <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive....

2500|$|But the [...] "Days of Rage" [...] were a failure. Jacobs {{told the}} Black Panthers {{there would be}} 25,000 protesters in Chicago for the event, {{but no more than}} 200 showed up on the evening of Wednesday, October 8, 1969, in Chicago's Lincoln Park, and perhaps half of them were members of Weatherman collectives from around the country. The crowd milled about for several hours, cold and uncertain. Late in the evening, Jacobs stood on the {{pedestal}} of the bombed Haymarket policemen's statue and declared: [...] "We'll probably lose people today... We don't really have to win here ... just the fact that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> fight the police is a political victory."
