5|$|Because the {{hurricane}} remained near the coastline, Hurricane David failed to cause extreme damage in Florida. The storm's winds shattered windows in stores near {{the coast and}} caused property damage, including blowing {{the frame of the}} Palm Beach Jai Alai fronton and downing the 186-foot (57-m) WJNO AM radio tower in West Palm Beach into the Intracoastal Waterway. A few roofs were torn off, and numerous buildings were flooded from over six inches (150 mm) of rainfall. A 450-foot (140-m) crane was even snapped in two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. The hurricane spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state, though none caused deaths or injuries. Total damages in Florida amounted to $95 million ($270 million in 2005 USD), of which $30 million occurred in Palm Beach County, mostly from crop damage. Two journalists <b>with</b> <b>TODAY</b> newspaper from Brevard County followed {{the hurricane}} path from South Florida to Cocoa, FL and experienced extremely high winds as they reported on the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|During the Ice Age a vast, {{cold and}} dry mammoth steppe {{stretched}} from the Arctic islands southwards to China, and from Spain eastwards across Eurasia {{and over the}} Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon, where it was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. The land bridge existed because sea levels were lower due to more of the planet's water being locked up in glaciers compared <b>with</b> <b>today.</b> Therefore, {{the flora and fauna}} of Beringia were more related to those of Eurasia rather than to those of North America. In eastern Beringia from 35,000 YBP the northern Arctic areas experienced temperatures 1.5°C (2.7°F) warmer than today, but the southern sub-Arctic regions were 2°C (3.5°F) cooler. In 22,000YBP, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the average summer temperature was 3-5°C (5.4-9°F) cooler than today, with variations of 2.9°C (5.2°F) cooler on the Seward Peninsula to 7.5°C (13.5°F) cooler in the Yukon.|$|E

25|$|When {{chimpanzees}} {{appear in}} other TV shows, they generally {{do so as}} comic relief sidekicks to humans. In that role, for instance, J. Fred Muggs appeared <b>with</b> <b>Today</b> Show host Dave Garroway in the 1950s, Judy on Daktari in the 1960s and Darwin on The Wild Thornberrys in the 1990s. In contrast to the fictional depictions of other animals, such as dogs (as in Lassie), dolphins (Flipper), horses (The Black Stallion) or even other great apes (King Kong), chimpanzee characters and actions are rarely relevant to the plot.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{commercial}} current affairs programs.

The following year, a number of new programmes premiered, from the United States network ABC, including Desperate Housewives and Lost. At the same time, Seven's news and public affairs ratings began to increase in viewers, <b>with</b> <b>Today</b> Tonight beginning to challenge rival A Current Affair, with the new format of Sunrise leading to increased competition with its rival, the Nine Network's Today.

25|$|In July 2009, Georgie Gardner was {{appointed}} Nine News Sydney presenter on Friday and Saturday nights, she juggled her commitments <b>with</b> <b>Today</b> news presenter. This {{meant that she}} was only able to commit to her role on Today 4 days of the week. Therefore, the Weekend Today news presenter would present news on the Monday edition of Today as well. The Monday morning news presenters have included Amber Sherlock (2009-2010), Alicia Loxley (2010-2011) and Deborah Knight (2011-2014). In 2014, Sylvia Jeffreys took over from Gardner as news presenter on Today. Given that Sylvia would {{not be required to}} balance her role with any additional roles within the network, she was able to commit to the program 5 days per week, meaning the specialised Monday morning news presenting role was no longer needed.|$|E

500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal <b>with</b> <b>today</b> in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now."

500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars. Evans said his improved performance encouraged everyone working for the team and it gave Jaguar more confidence: [...] "If you look at the bigger picture, I’ve got to be satisfied <b>with</b> <b>today.</b> Qualifying was great, to be honest, I topped the group. If you ask me or the whole team if this would have happened after Marrakesh, we would have taken it with both hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E
500|$|Punk rock had {{a direct}} {{influence}} in the birth of New wave and new wave of British heavy metal and that music was still popular when the band was formed. Moreover, both Denise Dufort and Gil Weston had played in punk bands before joining Girlschool. [...] "We're both too heavy to be New Wave and too punk to be a heavy metal band", McAuliffe explained to Robbi Millar of Sounds in 1980. The raw and almost live recording sound of their first two Vic Maile produced albums represents perfectly the core music of the band in the years from 1979 to 1982, which were the most successful for Girlschool. The combination of metal and punk was {{a large part of}} the sound which also propelled Motörhead to notoriety and chart success in the early 80s in the United Kingdom. This sound, the tours and recordings made together with Lemmy’s band, the girls’ denim and leather look, as much as their rowdy and alcohol driven off-stage behaviour soon gained Girlschool the moniker of 'sisters of Motörhead', which they are often still identified <b>with</b> <b>today.</b> Their close association with Motörhead at the beginning of Girlschool's career helped achieve their early success.|$|E
500|$|Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell {{writes that}} it was Ditko who noted the {{similarities}} to the Fly. Ditko recalled that, [...] "Stan called Jack about the Fly", adding that [...] "ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis". It {{was at this point}} that the nature of the strip changed. [...] "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained". Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as [...] "the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko states, [...] "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man". Kirby noted in a 1971 interview {{that it was}} Ditko who [...] "got Spider-Man to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did". Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, has acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, [...] "If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [...] ". He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character. Writer Al Nickerson believes [...] "that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created the Spider-Man that we are familiar <b>with</b> <b>today</b> [...] ultimately, Spider-Man came into existence, and prospered, through the efforts of not just one or two, but many, comic book creators".|$|E
