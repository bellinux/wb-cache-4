40|$|The <b>whirling</b> <b>of</b> {{a string}} {{is a problem}} of some antiquity, the linearized {{solutions}} to a number of such problems having been derived by D. Bernoulli (1700 - 1782) and L. Euler (1707 - 1783). The nonlinear theory <b>of</b> <b>whirling</b> <b>of</b> inextensible strings has been discussed by Kolodner [1] and Caughey [2], [3]. Carrier [4], [5] has discussed the theory of nonlinear vibration of an elastic string using perturbation methods. In the present paper exact solutions will be presented for the <b>whirling</b> <b>of</b> an elastic string with fixed ends, and it will be shown that the modes <b>of</b> free <b>whirling</b> are orbitally stable...|$|R
