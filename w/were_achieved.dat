5|$|Wilt Chamberlain {{holds the}} all-time records for total points scored (4,029) and {{points per game}} (50.4) in a season; both records <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> in the 1961–62 season. He also holds the rookie records for points per game when he {{averaged}} 37.6 points in the 1959–60 season. Among active players, Kevin Durant has the highest point total (2,593) and the highest scoring average (32.0) in a season; both <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> in the 2013–14 season.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2016–17 season, Porto {{have won}} a total of 74 titles (regional {{competitions}} not considered), of which 67 <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> domestically and seven were obtained in international competitions. The club's most recent honour is the 2013 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira.|$|E
5|$|During the {{four-year}} program, many firsts in spaceflight <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> {{by the two}} nations, including the first American astronaut to launch aboard a Soyuz spacecraft, the largest spacecraft ever to have been assembled {{at that time in}} history, and the first American spacewalk using a Russian Orlan spacesuit.|$|E

5|$|At {{his death}} he had {{achieved}} 57 aerial victories, placing him seventh {{on the list}} of the war's most successful aces. Just under two-thirds of his victims can be identified by name. This is possible since, unlike other Allied aces, a substantial proportion of McCudden's claims were made over Allied-held territory. The majority of his successes <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> with 56 Squadron RFC and all but five fell while flying the S.E.5a.|$|E
5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces than at {{the other}} gates, so that Khalid {{would be unable to}} move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector. Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> in any sector other than the Gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited by sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough. Thomas ordered Khalid to be taken alive.|$|E
5|$|Attendances {{have gone}} down since all-seater stadia were introduced, with many records set at the terraced grounds they replaced. In several cases records <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> at a former ground rather than the club's current location. For example, Wigan Athletic's record was set at Springfield Park, not their current home, the DW Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E
5|$|Following the government's {{closure of}} most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater {{awareness}} by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement. These gains <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> through the persistent organizing and advocacy by Indigenous communities {{to draw attention to the}} residential school system's legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.|$|E
5|$|Four {{players have}} scored two hat-tricks in World Cup matches: Sándor Kocsis (both 1954); Just Fontaine (both 1958); Gerd Müller (both 1970); and Gabriel Batistuta (1994 and 1998). Batistuta is thus {{the only person}} to score hat-tricks in two World Cups. He has another unique record of scoring hat-tricks, both <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> on 21 June of the year, against World Cup finals debutants (Greece and Jamaica), and each time the third goal was a penalty. Kocsis and Müller scored their hat-tricks in {{consecutive}} matches.|$|E

50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to be the first player to achieve 100% success, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by {{reaching}} the top of four goals. The goals are wealth, happiness, education and career. Wealth <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by having a certain level of money in the bank, shares and cash in the hand, the player normally would earn this money by going to work. Happiness <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by achieving other goals, acquiring goods and taking time off work. Education <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by completing the available university qualifications, the number of qualifications the player must complete will be dependent on how high the goal level is set. Career <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by climbing the career ladder into a management position in a particular job.|$|R
5|$|Hermann Graf (24 October 1912 – 4 November 1988) was a German Luftwaffe World War II fighter ace. He {{served on}} both the Eastern and Western Fronts. He became the first pilot in {{aviation}} history to claim 200 aerial victories—that is, 200 aerial combat encounters resulting {{in the destruction of}} the enemy aircraft. In about 830 combat missions, he claimed a total of 212 aerial victories, almost all of which <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> on the Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the club}} marked their 100th anniversary with many celebratory {{events at the}} {{beginning}} of the season. On the day of the club's 100th anniversary in 2010, the Swedish football magazine Offside declared Malmö FF to be the greatest football club in Swedish history. The season became a great success as the club won Allsvenskan for the nineteenth time and became Swedish champions for the sixteenth time. Unlike in 2004, these successes <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> without any major transfers before the season, and with a squad consisting mostly of younger players.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} how much impact Zeppelin had on German {{response}} in the region, though {{the aims of the}} deception <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond D-Day). Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command did not come to expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{competed in}} his {{preliminary}} round matchup against Aaron Wilkinson {{in the third}} episode. After some early striking exchanges in the first round, Wilkinson {{was able to take}} Johnson down and utilise ground-and-pound punches and elbows. In the second round, Johnson landed an early superman punch, as well as a takedown. After takedowns <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> by both men, Johnson stuffed a final attempt and took the second round on the judges scorecards. In the sudden victory round, Johnson attacked quickly, which allowed him to end the fight via a rear naked choke.|$|E
5|$|Letellier {{describes}} Meyerbeer's mature life as 'a {{tale of two}} cities...His artistic {{triumph and}} legendary status <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> in Paris...but he never abandoned Prussia, especially his home city of Berlin'. His wife Minna was based in Berlin (she did not enjoy Paris) as was his beloved mother; {{and he had a}} series of Royal duties from the Prussian court, stemming from his appointment as Court Kapellmeister in 1832. For these reasons his life from 1830 onwards is characterised by travel between these two centres.|$|E
5|$|Lützow was {{credited}} with 110 enemy aircraft shot down in 310 combat missions. He claimed five victories in Spain, and 105 during World War II. The majority of his World War II victories were claimed over the Eastern Front, although 20 were claimed over the Western Front, two of which <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> while flying the Me262 jet fighter. These included one four-engined bomber.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the visual}} effects on Labyrinth <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> in-camera, with several notable exceptions. The most {{prominent}} of these post-production effects was the computer-generated owl that appears {{at the opening of}} the film. The sequence was created by animators Larry Yaeger and Bill Kroyer, and marked the first use of a realistic CGI animal in a film. The owl head maquette had to be rescued from a skip (dumpster) when Omnibus, the animation company, went bankrupt in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image filters and their theory of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel coined the term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new forms were impedance matching into the end terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> {{at the cost of}} an increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E
