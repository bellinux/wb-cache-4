5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met {{their need for}} a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December, {{he claimed}} two {{victories}} (nos 7–8). In the Gjirokastër area, Pattle shot down an IMAM Ro.37bis from 42a Squadriglia, 72o Gruppo, and Sergente Luigi Del Manno and his observer, Tenente Michele Milano, were both killed. In the afternoon, Pattle shot down another Ro.37bis from 72oGruppo near Permet, killing Capitano Fuchs and Sergente Vescia. On 4 December 1940, the RAF claimed nine Fiat CR.42s destroyed and two probables. Pattle — whose own aircraft {{was hit in}} the main fuel tank and a <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> — claimed three CR.42s plus another and a Fiat CR.42 as probable victories — he had seen two of his victims bail out. According to Italian combat records, 150° Gruppo, involved in that combat, lost just two CR.42s. Tenente Alberto Triolo and Sottotenente Paolo Penna were killed in action.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 1973, {{during a}} test flight at Camarillo, the right <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> again {{detached}} from the Pinto. With Janisse not available for this test flight, Mizar creator Smolinski was at the controls. Although some reports say the Pinto separated from the airframe, an air traffic controller, watching through binoculars, said the right wing folded. According to Janisse, the wing folded because the pilot tried to turn the aircraft when the <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> support failed. Smolinski and the Vice President of AVE, Harold Blake, {{were killed in the}} resulting fiery crash.|$|E
5000|$|Improved model, with double-tapered {{wings and}} single <b>wing</b> <b>struts.</b> About four built.|$|R

50|$|Utilising the <b>wings,</b> <b>struts</b> {{and tail}} {{unit of the}} T.8 Kirby Tutor, the T.29 Motor Tutor had a new {{fuselage}} incorporating a wheeled undercarriage and the cockpit under the wing centre section. Early trials revealed resonance of the front <b>wing</b> <b>struts,</b> which was rectified by adding a vertical bracing strut vertically up to the mainspar. This modification was introduced for all Kirby Tutors to allow aero-tow launching.|$|R
25|$|In 1930 a SM-1FS {{with a crew}} {{of three}} reached Bermuda from New York City, the first flight ever to the islands. Getting there the {{aircraft}} had to land twice, once because of darkness and later after running out of fuel. With a <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> damaged, it was shipped back to New York.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Pinto {{was a light}} car, the total {{aircraft}} without passengers or fuel was already slightly over the certified gross weight of a Skymaster. However, in addition to poor design and loose parts, the National Transportation Safety Board reported that bad welds were {{partly responsible for the}} crash, with the right <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> attachment failing at a body panel of the Pinto.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, {{several hundred}} German {{prisoners of war}} were held in St. Louis, along with {{thousands}} of Italians were held in Weingarten, Missouri. The prisoners were used as emergency labor during spring flooding of the Mississippi in May 1943 to fill and lay sandbags, although the flooding required the intervention of local military forces. In spite of this, flooding overtopped levees and created problems in north St. Louis along the riverfront. It was also during 1943 that St. Louis Mayor William D. Becker and ten others {{were killed in a}} glider accident that resulted from a <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> support failure. Becker's replacement, Aloys Kaufmann, was the last Republican elected mayor through the reelection of Francis G. Slay in 2009.|$|E
50|$|The Longster is a {{conventional}} landing gear-equipped, single engine, mid-wing aircraft with lower <b>wing</b> <b>struts.</b> The rudder is balanced without a fixed vertical stabilizer.|$|R
5000|$|For {{considerations}} in aerodynamics, fillets are employed to reduce interference drag where aircraft components such as <b>wings,</b> <b>struts,</b> and other surfaces meet one another.|$|R
50|$|Mg 9a: Deepened forward fuselage, lowered pylon. Revised canopy, <b>wing</b> <b>struts</b> and ailerons. Landing wheel. Ten were {{produced}} in one run, plus some later examples.|$|R
25|$|The {{airframe}} of the P.8 continued Pulawski's {{theme of}} semi-monocoque stressed skin Aluminium alloy structure with fabric covered control surfaces. The wings were built up around two I-section Aluminium alloy spars with alloy ribs and finely corrugated sheet Duralumin. High set gull style wings {{were attached to}} the upper fuselage with about 5 degrees dihedral out to the joint between centre-section and outer wings which had zero dihedral. Support for the wings came from pairs of struts attached to the lower fuselage and at the thickest section of the outer wings at about 1/3span. A fixed tail-wheel undercarriage consisted of strut mounted mainwheels attached to the fuselage at the <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> attachment points and a steel shod tail-skid. Cooling for the engine was achieved by a large radiator bath under the rear fuselage on the P.8/I and by special surface heat exchangers under the rear fuselage of the P.8/II. The special heat exchangers caused cooling difficulties and were replaced by small radiators {{either side of the}} rear fuselage aft of the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The Latécoère 350, or 35-0 as it {{was first}} called, was a direct {{development}} of the successful single-engined passenger carrying Latécoère 28. To increase cruising speed and, in particular to provide reliability for night flying, the new design had three engines. Apart from the immediate changes this involved and a modest increase in wingspan, the 350 and the 28 had much in common, both in structural detail and in general appearance. Both were high <b>wing,</b> <b>strut</b> braced monoplanes with enclosed cockpits and fixed undercarriages. The two extra engines of the 350 were mounted {{at the ends of}} stub wings, more streamlined support structures than lifting surfaces, which extended horizontally from the lower fuselage longerons. Each was further stabilised by a pair of struts from {{the upper part of the}} engine mounting to the wing roots. The outer engines were mounted as close together as possible, to minimize the couple resulting from the loss of power of one of them. They were housed in long, well streamlined cowlings that reached back as far as the wing trailing edge. The third engine was in the nose, as in the Latécoère 28. All the engines were 400hp (298kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Jb V-12 twelve water-cooled units. Three separate radiators for them were fixed under the stub wing.|$|E
2500|$|On a {{test flight}} from Camarillo Airport in California on August 26, 1973, {{according}} to test pilot Charles [...] "Red" [...] Janisse, the right <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> base mounting attachment failed soon after takeoff. Because turning the aircraft would {{put too much}} stress on the unsupported wing, Janisse put the aircraft down in a bean field. After the roadway was closed to traffic, Janisse drove the otherwise undamaged aircraft back to the airport.|$|E
5000|$|LGL.33 - Similar to LGL.32 {{but with}} Lorraine 12Eb engine, and revised <b>wing</b> <b>struts,</b> landing gear, and tail (one built). Also {{known as the}} LGL.33C.1.|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{version for}} US production. Early {{versions}} have dual <b>wing</b> <b>struts,</b> while later models {{have just one}} strut. Engines used include the Zenoah G-25B of [...] and the Yamaha KT-100S of [...]|$|R
50|$|Bellanca {{started the}} CF design in 1921. The Bellanca CF had a {{mahogany}} plywood wooden fuselage and fabric covered tail, <b>wing</b> and <b>strut</b> surfaces. The aircraft featured a fully enclosed cabin, with small windows. The fuselage was reinforced with steel wires. The landing gear was Ash word laminate with birch veneer. The <b>wing</b> <b>struts</b> made of Port Orford cedar had functional airfoil shapes {{to assist with}} lift.|$|R
2500|$|The G.M.G. II {{was a high}} <b>wing,</b> <b>strut</b> braced {{monoplane}} {{of wooden}} construction. Its wing had a single spar and was plywood covered from the spar forward to form a torsion resistant D-box. Behind the spar the wing was fabric covered. [...] It was braced on each side with a single, short, airfoil section strut to the lower fuselage longeron and mounted centrally on an arched continuation of the upper fuselage structure from the engine installation, over the tandem cockpits, to behind the seating.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{prototype}} Arava {{made its}} maiden flight on November 27, 1969. The second prototype was destroyed when a <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> experienced flutter and failed during flight testing on November 19, 1970. The third prototype flew {{for the first}} time on May 8, 1971. Three aircraft were commandeered for use by Squadron 122 in the Yom Kippur War, but were returned afterwards. The Israeli Air Force did not purchase the aircraft until 1983, when nine aircraft were bought. Production ended in 1988. [...] 103 aircraft were produced, including 70 for the military market. [...] The IAF decided in 2004 to retire the aircraft. It is still in operation in some countries.|$|E
2500|$|Like a fixed wing aircraft, the A-4 was {{controlled}} with ailerons and elevators {{connected to a}} control column and the rudder to pedals. To the pilot's right there was a lever which enabled the rotor {{to be connected to}} the engine via reducing gears for jump starts and to ease heavy landings. The drive shaft followed the single forward rotor pylon strut, enclosed within a streamlined fairing. [...] The A-4's fixed undercarriage had wheels on pairs of hinged V struts from the lower fuselage longerons with vertical legs, fitted with faired rubber shock absorbers, to the forward wing spar immediately below the <b>wing</b> <b>strut.</b> The tailskid also included a shock absorber.|$|E
5000|$|The Potez 31 was {{powered by}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12G, a W-12 engine, driving a two-blade propeller. A {{partially}} retractable honeycomb radiator was mounted under the fuselage {{at the rear of}} the engine and fuel tanks were in the fuselage over the centre of gravity. It had a tail wheel undercarriage with main wheels on a split axle, centrally supported by a lateral V-strut from the fuselage lower longerons at the base of the forward <b>wing</b> <b>struts.</b> The outer ends were hinged on longitudinally mounted V-struts, the forward member rubber sprung, from the lower fuselage longerons at the bases of the two <b>wing</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{designed}} the Christmas Bullet in 1918; the airplane had no <b>wing</b> <b>struts</b> and crashed on its maiden flight, killing the pilot. He then built a second aircraft {{with the same}} unstable design which also crashed on its maiden flight, killing the pilot.|$|R
50|$|Designed in {{response}} to a Swiss Air Force requirement for an indigenous fighter design, the MA-7 was a biplane of fabric-covered wood construction with N-shaped <b>wing</b> <b>struts</b> like the Fokker D.VI of 1918. The aircraft was built in 1925 and handed over for trials in February 1926.|$|R
2500|$|... 1 August 1943: CG-4A-RO 42-78839, {{built by}} {{contractor}} Robertson Aircraft Corporation, lost its right wing and plummeted to earth immediately after release by a tow airplane over Lambert Field, St. Louis, Missouri, USA. Several thousand spectators had {{gathered for the}} first public demonstration of the St. Louis-built glider, which was flown by 2 USAAF crewmen and carried St. Louis mayor William D. Becker, Robertson Aircraft co-founder Maj. William B. Robertson, and 6 other VIP passengers; all 10 occupants perished in the crash. The accident was attributed {{to the failure of}} a defective <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> fitting that had been provided by a subcontractor; the post-crash investigation indicted Robertson Aircraft for lax quality control; several inspectors were relieved of duty.|$|E
2500|$|Like some Zöglings, the Hols der Teufel had a light nacelle, ending {{under the}} wing at a forward leaning {{vertical}} knife edge around the aft central <b>wing</b> <b>strut,</b> enclosing both the pilot's seat {{and the other}} supporting struts. [...] Aft, the cross braced girder had a horizontal upper beam onto which the tailplane was mounted, strut braced from below. Its leading edge was straight and strongly swept; the cropped, parallel chord elevators had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final vertical frame member. The Hols der Teufel landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts.|$|E
2500|$|The Doppelraab first flew on 5 August 1951. As well as {{the early}} cockpit and undercarriage, the V-0 first {{prototype}} had unusual airbrakes, formed by rotating the <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> fairings through 90°. [...] This system, introduced to expedite rigging, was found unsatisfactory and was abandoned in favour of spoilers. [...] The second prototype, the V-1, initially had a two-wheel undercarriage, later altered by {{the replacement of the}} front wheel by an extended noseskid (V-1a). The V-2 and V-3 introduced the rear bench seat. [...] The V-3 acted as the prototype for the first production version, the Doppelraab III, though only a few of them were built. [...] The most numerous variant was the Doppelraab IV. Though detail improvements were introduced in the Doppelraab V, no major changes came before the final versions VI and VII. [...] These had wings of 640mm (25.2in) greater span and correspondingly increased wing area. [...] The empty weight of the version VI was increased by only 7kg (15.4b) but by flying with a higher wing loading this model could provide a 25kg (55lb) increase in useful load.|$|E
50|$|Since early 2009, Belite Aircraft, a {{new company}} based in Wichita, Kansas has {{produced}} the Belite Aircraft Superlite derivative of the Kitfox Lite single-seat ultralight design. Belite extensively redesigned the aircraft to incorporate carbon fibre <b>wings,</b> <b>struts,</b> spars and ribs, lowering the empty weight to 245 lb.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} further {{developed}} {{to produce the}} more powerful and heavier SM-7 and SM-8 models which were full four-seaters and these were also used by commercial firms. The Junior R of 1932 had a deeper fuselage and a low-set stub wing to mount the undercarriage and <b>wing</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two prototypes were built. The {{first was}} a {{cantilever}} wing design with the engines - 214 hp Armstrong-Siddeley Lynx - {{on the leading edge}} of the wing. However initial trials showed that the wing was too flexible and so <b>wing</b> <b>struts</b> were added fixed between the bottom of the fuselage and the engine installations. However this added weight and drag with a commensurate effect on performance. The second prototype had the engines suspended from the <b>wings</b> on the <b>struts.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Prefect, {{like the}} Grunau Baby, was a single-seat fabric-covered wooden glider. It had {{high-mounted}} semi-cantilever straight-tapered wings, {{with a single}} wing bracing strut on each side, {{from the base of}} the fuselage to the wing spar. The span was 150mm (6in) greater than that of the Grunau Baby, and the tips enclosed the outer ends of the ailerons. Mid-chord airbrakes were fitted just outboard of the <b>wing</b> <b>strut</b> ends, extending above and below the wing. The fuselage was flat sided, and tapered from the trailing edge of the wing to a very small fin bearing a large, aerodynamically-balanced and slightly reshaped rudder that extended down to the keel. The straight-tipped tailplane, mounted on the top of the fuselage and braced from below, had a strongly swept leading edge and was placed with its trailing edge at the fin's leading edge, so that the elevators lacked the large cut out for rudder movement seen on the earlier glider. The open cockpit was better enclosed at the sides and had a small windscreen; for access, the cockpit sides and windscreen were removed as a single piece. [...] Slingsby also added a [...] single-wheel undercarriage in addition to the earlier nose skid, placed below mid-chord.|$|E
5000|$|The Aviméta had conventional, fixed {{landing gear}} {{with a wide}} track. Each wheel was on a bent axle from the {{fuselage}} {{at the base of}} the forward <b>wing</b> <b>strut,</b> with a near-vertical leg fitted with a rubber shock absorber mounted on that same strut at a higher point which was reinforced with an inward-leaning strut to the upper fuselage and another rearwards to the base of the rear <b>wing</b> <b>strut.</b> The axles were stabilised with drag struts, again to the bottom of the rear <b>wing</b> <b>strut.</b> Aft, the tailskid was sprung steel.|$|E

25|$|Canada's first {{licensed}} amateur-built {{aircraft was}} a highly modified Playboy that was built by Keith S. Hopkinson. Hopkinson used the basic Playboy design and incorporated a Piper J-3 cowling, a Cessna 170 propeller spinner, de Havilland Tiger Moth <b>wing</b> <b>struts,</b> Cessna 140 conventional landing gear and Stinson 108 wheel pants.|$|R
50|$|The Potez 51 had fixed landing gear, with mainwheels on cranked axles {{and drag}} struts {{from the lower}} fuselage; near {{vertical}} shock absorbing legs were attached to the forward <b>wing</b> <b>struts,</b> reinforced at their tops by struts inwards to the upper fuselage. The wheels were enclosed in semi-circular fairings. There was a short tailskid.|$|R
