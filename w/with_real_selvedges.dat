40|$|We {{prove that}} if the {{discrete}} Wronskian with step 1 {{of a set of}} quasi-exponentials <b>with</b> <b>real</b> exponents has real simple roots only, and the roots of the Wronskian differ by at least 1, then the complex span of this set of quasi-exponentials has a basis consisting of quasi-exponentials <b>with</b> <b>real</b> coefficients.

25|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of algebra can {{be stated}} as: Every polynomial of degree n with complex number coefficients splits completely into n linear factors. The terms in these factors, {{which are the}} roots of the polynomial, may be real or complex. Since complex roots of polynomials <b>with</b> <b>real</b> coefficients come in complex conjugate pairs, this result implies that every polynomial <b>with</b> <b>real</b> coefficients splits into linear and/or irreducible quadratic factors <b>with</b> <b>real</b> coefficients (because when two linear factors with complex conjugate terms are multiplied together, the result is a quadratic <b>with</b> <b>real</b> coefficients). Even though the structure of the factorization is known in these cases, finding the actual factors can be computationally challenging, and by the Abel-Ruffini theorem the coefficients and additive terms in the factors may not be expressible in terms of radicals.|$|R
