5|$|For {{reasons that}} USAF {{officers}} {{were unable to}} explain, two versions of each day's ATO were published, one for the USAF units at Incirlik, and another for the Eagle Flight unit at Pirinclik. The ATO version sent to Eagle Flight, for unknown reasons, gave a <b>wrong</b> IFF Mode I code for the TAOR. Although army Black Hawks had been operating {{for almost two years}} in the TAOR while squawking a <b>wrong</b> code and observed doing so by numerous AWACS crews, no one ever told them that they were using a <b>wrong</b> code. On the day of the shootdown, the F-15s had interrogated the Black Hawks on two different IFF Modes (Mode I and Mode IV). The first responded negatively because the Black Hawks were squawking the <b>wrong</b> code. The second mode responded negatively for technical reasons that the investigation was unable to conclusively determine.|$|E

[...] "Two <b>wrongs</b> make a right" [...] {{has been considered}} as a fallacy of relevance, in which an allegation of wrongdoing is countered with a similar allegation. Its antithesis, [...] "two <b>wrongs</b> don't make a right", is a proverb used to rebuke or renounce wrongful conduct {{as a response to}} another's transgression.|$|R

500|$|At {{the end of}} the Rights of Woman Wollstonecraft {{promised her}} readers a second part to the work. Rather than giving them another {{philosophical}} treatise, however, she offered them a novel tinged with autobiography, appropriately titled The <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman. In her [...] "Preface", she writes that the novel should be considered the story of [...] "woman" [...] and not the story of an [...] "individual". Wollstonecraft attempts to detail, as the scholar Anne K. Mellor has phrased it, [...] "the <b>wrongs</b> done to women and the <b>wrongs</b> done by women" [...] (emphasis Mellor's). The <b>wrongs</b> done to women include stifling and sexually repressed marriages, which Wollstonecraft describes using the language of slavery, while the <b>wrongs</b> done by women include a false sense of self-worth generated through the language of sensibility. Unlike Wollstonecraft's first novel, [...] (1788), The <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman offers solutions to these problems, namely an empowering female sexuality, a purpose-filled maternal role, and the possibility of a feminism that crosses class boundaries.|$|R
