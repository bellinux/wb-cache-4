5|$|Illinois's 1st congressional {{district}} is a minority-majority district. At {{the time of}} the election, 65percent of its constituents <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b> In redistricting after the 1990 United States Census, the district was extended into the suburbs {{for the first time in}} 90 years, but a majority of the districts' residents (70%) lived in Chicago. A strongly Democratic district, only twice since 1966 has a Republican candidate for United States Congress received over 20% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{politics}} {{had long}} {{played a role}} in Baltimore. As the state of Maryland did not attempt to prevent African Americans from voting through Jim Crow laws, political coalitions often involved African American community leaders. Theodore McKeldin, who served as mayor from 1943 through 1947 and from 1963 through 1967, {{was one of the first}} political leaders to work with African American community leaders. By 1999, 63% of Baltimore's registered voters <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American,</b> and 90% were registered to the Democratic Party. Baltimore had not elected a Republican mayor since 1963.|$|E
5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b> The police successfully held them off.|$|E

25|$|While African American {{graduation}} rates at UC Berkeley increased by 6.5 percent, the enrollment rates dropped significantly. Criticism {{was made of}} the fact that of the 4,422 students in UCLA's freshman class of 2006, only 100 (2.26%) <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b>|$|E

50|$|The flow of <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> to Ohio, {{particularly}} to Cleveland, changed {{the demographics of}} the state and its primary industrial city. Before the Great Migration, an estimated 1.1% to 1.6% of Cleveland's population <b>was</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b> By 1920, 4.3% of Cleveland's population <b>was</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b> The number of <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> in Cleveland continued to rise over the next 20 years of the Great Migration.|$|R
25|$|The {{emphasis}} {{given to}} eastern areas in Rockford have rendered their western counterparts with blighted neighborhoods. In 2002, Rockford's {{public school system}} was court-ordered to spend $250 million on upgrades to western schools after it was found culpable for discrimination against residents served by them, many of whom <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Union Land Association went {{bankrupt}} in the Panic of 1873, and Van Hook {{was forced to}} sell Cedar Hill.

There has been much discussion regarding the Racial Academic Achievement Gap in the school district, and the tracking is often cited as the most glaring example of a racial disparity.|$|E

Many soldiers trained at Camp Randall, which currently houses the University of Wisconsin's athletic stadium.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the school}} {{district}} had 185,000 students. 65% of these students <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students.

25|$|From 1947 to the 1970s, African American {{participation}} in baseball rose steadily. By 1974, 27% of baseball players <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b> As {{a result of}} this on-field experience, minorities began to experience long-delayed gains in managerial positions within baseball. In 1975, Frank Robinson (who had been the 1956 Rookie of the Year with the Cincinnati Reds) was named player-manager of the Cleveland Indians, making him the first African American manager in the major leagues.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b> Many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the {{difficult}} years of the late 19th century. Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, however, numerous African-American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by personal labor.|$|E

25|$|In Union-Miles Park, the {{population}} actually rose by 0.9 percent from 1960 to 1970, and dropped just 16.9 percent from 1970 to 1980. During the same period, Cleveland {{as a whole}} lost 14.3 percent and 23.6 percent of its population, respectively. The total population figures for Union-Miles Park mask the underlying racial shift, which was already apparent by 1972. The markedly lower population losses in Union-Miles Park were due to a large influx of African American residents, and by 1980 90 percent of all residents in the neighborhood <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b>|$|E

The union also {{expanded}} out of office buildings, and represented workers in bowling alleys, supermarkets, hotels, apartment buildings, gymnasiums, clubs, public schools, and hospitals. Hardy expanded the union's racial and ethnic diversity as well. By 1950, half of the members in Local 399 (the largest in Los Angeles) <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American,</b> and 9 percent were Mexican American. Overall, 38 percent of BSEIU members in Los Angeles were black.|$|E
25|$|After the Revolutionary War {{ended in}} 1784, patriot Thomas Paine {{was given a}} farm in New Rochelle for his service {{to the cause of}} independence. The farm, totaling about 300 acres (1.2km2), had been confiscated from its owners by state of New York due to their Tory activities. Now located on a small street in New Rochelle, the Thomas Paine Cottage is a small museum where many Revolutionary War re-enactments occur. Six years after the Revolutionary War had ended, the first {{national}} census of 1790 shows New Rochelle with 692 residents, 136 of whom <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b>|$|E
25|$|The textile industry, once {{concentrated}} in New England with outposts in New Jersey and Philadelphia, had started moving South in the 1880s. By 1933 Southern mills {{produced more than}} seventy percent of cotton and woolen textiles in more modern mills, drawing on the pool of dispossessed farmers and laborers {{willing to work for}} roughly forty percent less than their Northern counterparts. As was the rest of economic life, the textile industry was strictly segregated and drew only from white workers in the Piedmont. Until 1965, when passage of the Civil Rights Act broke the color line in hiring, less than 2% of textile workers <b>were</b> <b>African</b> <b>American.</b>|$|E
