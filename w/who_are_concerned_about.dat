25|$|Ultimately, the {{cultural}} gap matters {{only if it}} endangers civilian {{control of the military}} or if it reduces the ability of the country to maintain an effective military force. Those who concentrate {{on the nature of the}} gap tend not to be concerned about dangerous trends. However, those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the lack of understanding between the civilian and military worlds are uniformly convinced that the civil-military relationship in the United States is unhealthy. Specifically, they have voiced concerns about a military that may become openly contemptuous of civilian norms and values and may then feel free to openly question the value of defending such a society. Others worry whether an inexperienced civilian government will undermine the military by ineffective or inappropriate policies, thus threatening U.S. national security.|$|E

Geoffrey Gorer concluded, [...] "Politically and as literature it {{is a work of}} first-class importance." [...] Philip Mairet observed, [...] "It shows us the heart of innocence that lies in revolution; also the miasma of lying that, far more than the cruelty, takes the heart out of it." [...] Hostile notices came from the Tablet, where a Catholic critic wondered why Orwell had not troubled to get to know Fascist fighters and enquire about their motivations, and from the Times Literary Supplement and The Listener, [...] "the first misrepresenting what Orwell had said and the latter attacking the POUM, but never mentioning the book." [...] John Langdon-Davies wrote in the Communist Party's Daily Worker that [...] "the value of the book is that it gives an honest picture of the sort of mentality that toys with revolutionary romanticism but shies violently at revolutionary discipline. It should be read as a warning." [...] Some Conservative and Catholic opponents of the Spanish Republic felt vindicated by Orwell's attack {{on the role of the}} Communists in Spain; The Spectators review concluded that this [...] "dismal record of intrigue, injustice, incompetence, quarrelling, lying communist propaganda, police spying, illegal imprisonment, filth and disorder," [...] was evidence that the Republic deserved to fall. A mixed review was supplied by V.S. Pritchett who called Orwell naïve about Spain but added that [...] "no one excels him in bringing to the eyes, ears and nostrils the nasty ingredients of fevered situations; and I would recommend him warmly to all <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the realities of personal experience in a muddled cause." [...] Franz Borkenau, in a letter to Orwell of June 1938, called the book, together with his own The Spanish Cockpit, a complete [...] "picture of the revolutionary phase of the Spanish War." ...|$|E
