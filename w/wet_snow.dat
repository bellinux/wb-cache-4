5|$|Due to its unusual nature, both heavy {{snowfall}} {{and strong}} winds caused {{a swath of}} devastation stretching from the Mid-Atlantic states to northern New England. In the Middle-Atlantic region, moderate damage occurred at sea but little was noted inland. In New England, strong gusts inflicted significant damage to numerous churches. Widespread residential damage, in contrast, was mostly negligible and had no lasting consequences. Thousands of trees were knocked over, obstructing roads and fiscally damaging the timber industry throughout the region. Cold temperatures, <b>wet</b> <b>snow,</b> and high winds downed numerous branches in fruit orchards, froze potato crops, flattened dozens of barns, and killed over a hundred cattle. In general, the agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock trades suffered most acutely following {{the passage of the}} snow hurricane, while structural damage was widespread but generally inconsequential.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the area}} {{experiences}} heavy <b>wet</b> <b>snows</b> every several years; on rare occasions snowfall has exceeded a foot in depth. The National Weather Service does not maintain a station in the area (there are cooperative stations in Ben Lomond, California and Woodside, California), but normal annual rainfall has been estimated to exceed 50 in. Heavy fog is very common in the area, especially in the summer months, and usually clears back to the coast from the late morning to early evening. Normal temperatures in January range from the lower fifties to upper thirties, and in July from upper seventies to lower fifties.|$|R

25|$|In {{contrast}} to powder snow avalanches, <b>wet</b> <b>snow</b> avalanches are a low velocity suspension {{of snow and}} water, with the flow confined to the track surface (McClung, first edition 1999, page 108). The low speed of travel {{is due to the}} friction between the sliding surface of the track and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~10–40km/h), <b>wet</b> <b>snow</b> avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density. The body of the flow of a <b>wet</b> <b>snow</b> avalanche can plough through soft snow, and can scour boulders, earth, trees, and other vegetation; leaving exposed, and often scored, ground in the avalanche track. <b>Wet</b> <b>snow</b> avalanches can be initiated from either loose snow releases, or slab releases, and only occur in snow packs that are water saturated and isothermally equilibrated to the melting point of water. The isothermal characteristic of <b>wet</b> <b>snow</b> avalanches has led to the secondary term of isothermal slides found in the literature (for example in Daffern, 1999, page 93). At temperate latitudes <b>wet</b> <b>snow</b> avalanches are frequently associated with climatic avalanche cycles {{at the end of the}} winter season, when there is significant daytime warming.|$|E
25|$|The <b>wet</b> <b>snow</b> zone is {{the region}} where all of the snow {{deposited}} {{since the end of}} the previous summer has been raised to 0°C.|$|E
25|$|Avalanche {{initiation}} {{can start}} {{at a point}} with {{only a small amount}} of snow moving initially; this is typical of <b>wet</b> <b>snow</b> avalanches or avalanches in dry unconsolidated snow. However, if the snow has sintered into a stiff slab overlying a weak layer then fractures can propagate very rapidly, so that a large volume of snow, that may be thousands of cubic meters, can start moving almost simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Annaba has a Mediterranean climate with long, hot, dry summers, {{especially}} from mid-July to mid-August, and mild, <b>wet</b> winters. <b>Snow</b> is rare but not unknown. Rain is abundant by North African standards {{and can be}} torrential.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to obtain the basic data on the interaction between microwaves and natural snowpack in the melting season using 9. 37 GHz and 31. 5 GHz microwaves. The diurnal variations of the back scatter from snowpack were measured through microwave sensors placed above the surface. The obtained results indicated periodic changes in the daytime and relatively monotonous changes in the nighttime. These results suggest that the interference occurred between the reflective wave from snowpack and the original transmitting wave. In order to confirm these periodic changes of the back scatter, laboratory experiments were carried out by the use of artificially <b>wetted</b> <b>snow...</b>|$|R

25|$|The April or Spring Nor’easter of 2007 was a nor'easter that {{affected}} mainly the eastern parts of North America during its four-day course, from April 14 to April 17, 2007. The combined effects of high winds, heavy rainfall, and high tides led to flooding, storm damages, power outages, and evacuations, and disrupted traffic and commerce. In the north, heavy <b>wet</b> <b>snow</b> caused {{the loss of}} power for several thousands of homes in Ontario and Quebec. The storm caused at least 18 fatalities.|$|E

500|$|In {{areas with}} trees, utility {{distribution}} lines on poles are {{less susceptible to}} snow loads than {{they are subject to}} damage from trees falling on them, felled by heavy, <b>wet</b> <b>snow.</b> Elsewhere, snow can accrete on power lines as [...] "sleeves" [...] of rime ice. Engineers design for such loads, which are measured in kg/m (lb/ft) and power companies have forecasting systems that anticipate types of weather that may cause such accretions. Rime ice may be removed manually or by creating a sufficient short circuit in the affected segment of power lines to melt the accretions.|$|E

500|$|Although winds in New Hampshire, {{along the}} hurricane's {{northern}} edge, were less severe, higher snowfall totals were recorded. In Portsmouth, damage was minimal and mainly confined to fences.

Though the average snowfall amount in the Connecticut River Valley {{was estimated to be}} near , much of it quickly melted, leaving only [...] left by the snowstorm's departure. Still, the heavy weight of the unusually early <b>wet</b> <b>snow</b> snapped many tree branches still in full bloom, ruining fruit orchards and sugar groves. As a result, production of cider, already in low supply, was reduced even further; damages to one orchard alone reached $300 (1804USD). Due to snow-obstructed roads, post was delivered on horseback, and at Gilsum, the hurricane was so intense that a group of men traveling toward Keene were forced to return due to blocked roads smothered with over [...] of snow.
