5|$|These {{monitors}} {{will rise}} {{up on their}} hind legs to check their surroundings, a behavior that has also been documented in Gould's monitors (V.gouldii). They are known to exhibit a warning posture, in which they carry their tails rolled up behind them. According to native belief, they will give a <b>warning</b> <b>call</b> if they see crocodiles. In general V.salvadorii avoids human contact, but its bite is capable of causing infection, like the Komodo dragon's. One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection.|$|E
5|$|On August 9, {{the same}} day ETA claimed {{responsibility}} for the July 30 attack, four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma. The bombs, which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from ETA. At 11:16 am local time, a man speaking on behalf of ETA called the firefighters of Calvià, warning that three bombs would go off in Palma. Half an hour later, another person also speaking on behalf of ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode. Finally, another <b>warning</b> <b>call</b> was mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|Vocal {{communication}} among superb fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds {{in a social}} group and for advertising and mobbing, or defending a territory. The basic, or Type I, song is a 1–4 second high-pitched reel consisting of 10–20 short elements per second; it is sung by both males and females. Males also possess a peculiar song-like Type II vocalization, which is given {{in response to the}} calls of predatory birds, commonly grey butcherbirds (Cracticus torquatus). The purpose of this behaviour, which does not elicit a response from other nearby wrens, remains unknown. It is not a <b>warning</b> <b>call,</b> but in fact gives away the location of the vocalizing male to the predator. It may serve to announce male fitness, but this is far from certain. Superb fairywrens' alarm call is a series of brief sharp chits, universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators. Females also emit a purr while incubating. The bird appears to also use vocalisations as a password for its chicks to give it a chance to avoid cuckoo parasites.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{explanation}} for <b>warning</b> <b>calls</b> {{is that these}} are not <b>warning</b> <b>calls</b> at all:A bird, once it has detected a bird of prey, calls to signal to the bird of prey that it was detected, and that there is no use trying to attack the calling bird. Two facts support this hypothesis: ...|$|R

50|$|RN's time {{bombs were}} small. To avoid casualties, a prior <b>warning</b> was <b>called</b> into a newspaper. However, the April 1999 bomb placed outside the Athenaeum Intercontinental, {{aimed at a}} {{globalization}} conference sponsored by The Economist group, killed a company employee because police and hotel staff failed to coordinate the timely evacuation of the building despite two <b>warning</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a <b>warning</b> <b>call</b> and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{voice is}} a loud {{drawn-out}} and ascending honking aang. As a <b>warning</b> <b>call,</b> a similar but more barking honk is given {{two or three times}} in short succession.|$|E
25|$|Predation can be {{high for}} pinyon jays; however, flocking, colonial nesting, and mobbing may deter predators. In {{a study by}} Balda and Bateman, near Flagstaff, Arizona, 4–12 pinyon jays of a flock acted as sentinels, {{positioned}} at a high vantage point in a tree, waiting silently for an intruder while the flock was feeding. If an intruder approached, a <b>warning</b> <b>call</b> caused the flock to cease feeding and hide in the trees.|$|E
5000|$|McDonald and Jenkins {{said that}} no such <b>warning</b> <b>calls</b> were made, adding {{that even if they}} had, [...] "this does not absolve those who planted the bomb from {{responsibility}} for the deaths." ...|$|R
5000|$|The clear whistle [...] "bob-WHITE" [...] or [...] "bob-bob-WHITE" [...] call is very recognizable. The syllables {{are slow}} and widely spaced, rising in pitch a full octave from {{beginning}} to end. Other calls include lisps, peeps, and more rapidly whistled <b>warning</b> <b>calls.</b> Another phrase to used mimic {{the call of the}} bobwhite is [...] "Bobwhite, your (bob) peas (bob) ripe (white)?".|$|R
2500|$|His {{first two}} bombs drew little attention, but {{the string of}} random bombings that began in 1951 frayed the city's nerves and taxed the {{resources}} of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). [...] Metesky often placed <b>warning</b> <b>calls</b> to the buildings where he had planted bombs, but would not specify the bomb's exact location; he wrote to newspapers warning that he planned to plant more.|$|R
25|$|American author Thurston Clarke's {{analysis}} of the bombing gave timings for calls and for the explosion, which he said took place at 12:37. He stated {{that as part of}} the Irgun plan, a sixteen-year-old recruit, Adina Hay (alias Tehia), was to make three warning calls before the attack. At 12:22 the first call was made, in both Hebrew and English, to a telephone operator on the hotel's switchboard (the Secretariat and the military each had their own, separate, telephone exchanges). It was ignored. At 12:27, the second <b>warning</b> <b>call</b> was made to the French Consulate adjacent to the hotel to the north-east. This second call was taken seriously, and staff went through the building opening windows and closing curtains to lessen the impact of the blast. At 12:31 a third and final <b>warning</b> <b>call</b> to the Palestine Post newspaper was made. The telephone operator called the Palestine Police CID to report the message. She then called the hotel switchboard. The hotel operator reported the threat to one of the hotel managers. This warning resulted in the discovery of the milk cans in the basement, but by then it was too late.|$|E
500|$|In biology, {{signals are}} traits, {{including}} structures and behaviours, that have evolved specifically because they change the behaviour of receivers {{in ways that}} benefit the signaller. Traits or actions that benefit the receiver exclusively are called cues. [...] When an alert bird deliberately gives a <b>warning</b> <b>call</b> to a stalking predator and the predator gives up the hunt, the sound is a signal. [...] When a foraging bird inadvertently makes a rustling sound in the leaves that attracts predators and {{increases the risk of}} predation, the sound is a 'cue'.|$|E
500|$|Because {{there are}} both mutual and {{conflicting}} interests in most animal signalling systems, a central problem in signalling theory is dishonesty or cheating. [...] For example, if foraging birds are safer when {{they give a}} <b>warning</b> <b>call,</b> cheats could give false alarms at random, just in case a predator is nearby. [...] But too much cheating could cause the signalling system to collapse. Every dishonest signal weakens {{the integrity of the}} signalling system, and so reduces the fitness of the group. An example of dishonest signalling comes from Fiddler crabs such as Uca lactea mjoebergi, which have been shown to bluff (no conscious intention being implied) about their fighting ability. When a claw is lost, a crab occasionally regrows a weaker claw that nevertheless intimidates crabs with smaller but stronger claws. The proportion of dishonest signals is low enough for it not to be worthwhile for crabs to test the honesty of every signal through combat.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, on 30 December 2006 ETA detonated a van bomb {{after three}} {{confusing}} <b>warning</b> <b>calls,</b> {{in a parking}} building at the Madrid Barajas international airport.

500|$|The adult red-throated loon has {{a number}} of vocalisations, which are used in {{different}} circumstances. In flight, when passing conspecifics or circling its own pond, it gives a series of rapid yet rhythmic goose-like cackles—kaa-kaa-kaa or kak-kak-kak, at roughly five calls per second. Its <b>warning</b> <b>call,</b> if disturbed by humans or onshore predators, is a short croaking bark. A low-pitched moaning call, used primarily as a contact call between mates and between parents and young, but also during copulation, is made with the bill closed. The species also has a short wailing call—aarOOao...aarOOao...—which descends slightly in pitch and lasts about a second; due to strong harmonics surrounding the primary pitch, this meowing call is more musical than its other calls. Another call—a harsh, pulsed cooing that rises and falls in pitch, and is typically repeated up to 10times in a row—is used in territorial encounters and pair-bonding, and by parent birds encouraging their young to move on land between bodies of water. Known as the [...] "long call", it is often given in duet, which is unusual among the loons; the female's contribution is longer and softer than her mate's.|$|E
500|$|Social {{interactions}} such as greetings, grooming, {{and group}} howling {{are common in}} jackals. Howling is more frequent between December and April when pair bonds are being formed and breeding occurs, which suggests howling has {{a role in the}} delineation of territory and for defense. Adult jackals howl standing and the young or subordinate jackals howl sitting. Jackals are easily induced to howl and a single howl may solicit replies from several jackals in the vicinity. Howling begins with 2–3 low-pitched calls that rise to high-pitched calls. The howl consists of a wail repeated 3–4 times on an ascending scale, followed by three short yelps that have been described as sounding similar to [...] "Dead hindoo, where, where, where". Jackals typically howl at dawn and in the evening, and sometimes at midday. Adults may howl to accompany the ringing of church bells, with their young responding to sirens or the whistles of steam engines and boats. When there is a change in the weather they will produce a long and continuous chorus. Golden jackals give a <b>warning</b> <b>call</b> that is very different from their normal howling when they detect the presence of large carnivores such as wolves and tigers. This howl is described as sounding similar to [...] "pheal", [...] "phion" [...] or [...] "phnew". When hunting in a pack, the dominant jackal initiates an attack by repeatedly emitting a sound similar to [...] "okkay!".|$|E
2500|$|Prairie {{dogs are}} named for their habitat and <b>warning</b> <b>call,</b> which sounds {{similar to a}} dog's bark. The name was in use at least as early as 1774. The 1804 {{journals}} of the Lewis and Clark Expedition note that in September 1804, they [...] "discovered a Village of an animal the French Call the Prairie Dog". Its genus, Cynomys, derives from the Greek for [...] "dog mouse".|$|E
50|$|Illegitimate {{receivers}} {{can experience}} fitness costs if {{they respond to}} signals given off by illegitimate signalers, which are organisms that utilize deceptive signals to reduce receiver fitness, typically by preying on or parasitizing the organism that responds. Illegitimate receivers may also experience fitness costs if intercepting signals not intended for them reduces their likelihood of receiving signals that are directed at them, such as the mating calls of {{members of their own}} species or the <b>warning</b> <b>calls</b> of rivals.|$|R
5000|$|The bark is a {{combination}} of one or two high-pitched audible syllables, with the second syllable lower and deeper. Prairie dogs have a unique sound to identify each of various predators. They also have different barks for warning and [...] "all-clear" [...] signals. Researchers and experts have been able to classify up to 11 distinct <b>warning</b> <b>calls</b> the prairie dog uses to communicate. Also, females with offspring are more likely to give off a warning bark than males.|$|R

2500|$|Sgt Horton {{stated that}} he saw an {{occurrence}} pad entry that showed the <b>warning</b> <b>call</b> was received at 12:32, 8 minutes before the bomb exploded. It was not relayed instantly to the police out front. At the inquest four other versions of this pad were shown, each timing the call at 12:40. (It {{may not have been}} relayed because police already knew about the bomb and the call was merely a pretext to call the waiting bomb squad.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Tactical {{deception}} (also {{referred to}} as functional deception) {{is the use of}} signals or displays from an animal's normal repertoire mislead or deceive another individual. Some researchers limit the use of this term to an intraspecific [...] behaviour, meaning that it occurs between members of the same species. Most other kinds of deception are meant to fool members of a different species. Tactical deception can also be achieved when the deceiver withholds information by failing to perform an expected action, such as giving a <b>warning</b> <b>call</b> when danger is observed.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian {{state is}} said to have been {{organized}} in the 9th century AD at Novgorod by Rurik, supposedly coming from Sweden. In the 13th century, Stockholm was founded to stop foreign navies from invading lake Mälaren. Both events are signs that hostile naval missions across the Baltic Sea go a long way back, temporarily ending with the peace treaty of Nöteborg 1323 between Sweden and the Novgorod Republic (which later became Russia), soon to be broken by another Catholic Swedish crusade into Greek-orthodox Novgorod. Russia has been described as Sweden's [...] "archenemy" [...] (a title also given to Denmark). The two countries have often been at war, most intensively during the Great Northern War (1700–1721) and the Finnish War (1808–1809), when Sweden lost that third of its territory to Russia that now is Finland. Sweden defeated a Russian army in the Battle of Narva (1700), but was defeated by Russia in the Battle of Poltava 1709. In 1719 Russian troops burnt most Swedish cities and industrial communities along the Baltic sea coast to the ground (from Norrköping up to Piteå in the north) in what came to be called [...] "Rysshärjningarna" [...] (the Russian ravages, a term first recorded in 1730). [...] "The Russians are coming" [...] (ryssen kommer) is a traditional Swedish <b>warning</b> <b>call.</b> After the death of king Charles XII in 1718 and the peace in 1721, Swedish politics was dominated by a peace-minded parliament, with a more aggressive opposition (Hats and Caps). When Swedish officer Malcolm Sinclair was murdered in 1739 by two Russian officers, the anti-Russian ballad Sinclairsvisan by Anders Odel became very popular.|$|E

It would seem that interest in the result had kept the natives on the opposite shores in breathless suspense, while the quick evolutions and swift changes in the position of the combatants, effectually prevented a fire that might prove dangerous alike to friend and enemy. But the moment the struggle was decided, a yell arose as fierce and savage as wild and revengful passions could throw into the air. It was followed by the swift flashes of the rifles, which sent their leaden messengers across the rock in volleys, as though the assailants would pour out their impotent fury on the insensible scene of the fatal contest.|$|E

5000|$|If a {{predator}} is near, alarm calls, {{which have been}} observed to last from 1.2 to 88 minutes, will be sounded by an initial saki and then continually echoed by others to spread the warning. They will then puff their bodies up and stomp their {{feet on the ground}} or trees in an attempt to intimidate the threat. 12 They are small primates and dwell in the branches of trees, so one of their biggest predator threats are large birds such as hawks, vultures, and the harpy eagle. In the face of danger, white faced sakis will emit <b>warning</b> <b>calls</b> to others or freeze if in the canopy in an attempt to move down where they are out of sight. The predator response of the sakis are due to what type of threat they are facing: if a smaller, easily overpowered threat, the group will participate in a behavior called [...] "mobbing" [...] to scare the predator away, but if the threat is larger, such as an eagle, they will refrain from <b>warning</b> <b>calls</b> and descend out of sight into the lower canopy. Other terrestrial and aquatic predators include the tayra, jaguars, green anacondas, ocelots, red-tailed boa, and even large mustelids, which are usually threats to the young and elderly.|$|R
