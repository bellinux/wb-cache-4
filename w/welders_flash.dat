Method: This prospective study included 32 patients with bilateral UV photo keratitis, due to <b>welder’s</b> <b>flash</b> with equal severity. After primary evaluation BCL is placed for one eye and patching is done for another one. Reexamination performed after 12 to 24 hours and severity of pain, Superficial Punctate Keratopathy (SPK) and duration of symptom improvement compared in both eyes. Results: Our findings revealed that SPK and duration of improvement were not different statistically significant but were more satisfied and comfortable with BCL. Conclusion: According to this study, BCL can use in patients with photo keratitis instead of eye patchin...|$|R
