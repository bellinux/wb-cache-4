Skaði is described as having taken a venomous snake and fastening it above the bound Loki, so that the venom may drip on to Loki's face. Loki's wife Sigyn sat by his side and held a bowl out. The bowl catches the venom, but when the bowl becomes full Loki writhes in extreme pain, causing the earth to shake and resulting in what <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> an earthquake.|$|E

25|$|The Kiev Pechersk Lavra caverns are a {{very complex}} system of narrow {{underground}} corridors (about 1-1½ metres wide and 2-2½ metres high), along with numerous living quarters and underground chapels. In 1051, the monk Anthony settled in an old cave in a hill near the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. This cave received additions including corridors and a church, and is now what <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> the Far Caves. In 1057, Anthony moved to a cave near the Upper Lavra, now called the Near Caves.|$|E

It is worth remembering however that although Northumberland, like many administrative areas in England, has been shorn of its geographical regional centre, that centre – Newcastle upon Tyne – remains an essential element within the entity <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> Northumberland. Newcastle's newspapers are as widely read in its Northumbrian hinterland as any of those of the wider county: the Northumberland Gazette, Morpeth Herald, Berwick Advertiser, Hexham Courant and the News Post Leader.|$|E

25|$|Northern Guatemala has {{particularly}} high densities of Late Pre-classic sites, including Naachtun, Xulnal, El Mirador, Porvenir, Pacaya, La Muralla, Nakbé, El Tintal, Wakná (formerly Güiro), Uaxactún, and Tikal. Of these, El Mirador, Tikal, Nakbé, Tintal, Xulnal and Wakná {{are the largest}} in the Maya world, Such size was manifested not only in the extent of the site, but also in the volume or monumentality, especially in the construction of immense platforms to support large temples. Many sites of this era display monumental masks for the first time (Uaxactún, El Mirador, Cival, Tikal and Nakbé). Hansen's dating has been called into question by many other Maya archaeologists, and developments leading to probably extra-regional power by the Late Preclassic of Kaminaljuyu, in the Southern Maya Area, suggest that Maya civilization developed in different ways in the Lowlands and the SMA to produce what <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> the Classic Maya.|$|E

Oddr Snorrason says further that the battle is [...] "memorialized for the fallen men on the Third or Fourth Ides of September", (10 or 11 September). Mesta states that the battle occurred on 9 September, and other sources agree with either date.

500|$|During the World War I era, Southard {{conducted}} {{early studies}} of shell shock. He believed that shell shock {{resulted from the}} mind's inability to align the sensory experiences of war with other life events. Southard said that this process, which could also have physical causes, resulted in disorientation and transformed the events of war into a mental condition. In Shell Shock and Other Neuropsychiatric Problems, he called the term [...] "shell shock" [...] advantageous because it [...] "compared with the more acutely terrible and life-in-the-balance thing <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> traumatic or surgical shock." [...] The condition initially captured public interest, {{at least in part}} because it was thought to result from a traumatic force to the head. When shell shock became known as not resulting from physical injuries, patients were stigmatized and arguments over its cause interfered with effective treatment.|$|E
500|$|In the Old Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, {{the goddess}} Ishtar sends Taurus, the Bull of Heaven, to kill Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. Enkidu tears off the bull's hind part and hurls the {{quarters}} {{into the sky}} where they become the stars <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. Some locate Gilgamesh as the neighboring constellation of Orion, facing Taurus as if in combat, while others identify him with the sun whose rising on the equinox vanquishes the constellation. In early Mesopotamian art, the Bull of Heaven was closely associated with Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. One of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess' standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back (the cuneiform sign for [...] "star-constellation"), {{there is good reason}} to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth David asks why [...] "this {{peerless}} writer" [...] was {{eclipsed by}} [...] "imitators so limited in experience, and in capacity of expression so inferior?" [...] She answers her own question {{with the suggestion}} that Acton, born in 1799, was [...] "in taste and in spirit, {{a child of the}} eighteenth century." [...] David notes that the year after Modern Cookery was first published, Bird's Custard Powder was launched: [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> modern cookery, and it {{had little to do with}} Eliza Acton's version, was on its way." [...] And she points out that manuals like Mrs Beeton's, which in later editions were edited and re-written by other hands, existed to allow cooks to look up recipes, rather than to read cookery books. She concludes that [...] "A book such as Miss Acton's, written as a coherent whole, is essentially one to be read, as it is written, with intelligence and understanding and application." ...|$|E

500|$|Following [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] on the Sgt. Pepper album (as first {{released}} on LP in the UK and years later worldwide on CD) is a high-frequency 15-kilohertz tone and some randomly spliced Beatles studio chatter. The frequency is {{best understood as}} what <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> a dog whistle as the frequency is {{picked up by a}} dog's ear and was part of their humour. They joked about picturing barking dogs should they be present when the album would finish. [...] Recorded two months after the mono and stereo masters for [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] had been finalised, the studio chatter (titled in the session notes [...] "Edit for LP End") was added to the run-out groove of the initial British pressing. There are even a few variations of the chatter, though the best known one is them saying during the laughter and chatter [...] "never could see any other way." [...] The Anthology 2 album includes an early, pre-orchestral version of the song and Anthology 3 includes a version of [...] "The End" [...] that concludes by having the last note fade into the final chord of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (reversed, then played forwards). The Love version has the song starting with Lennon's intro of [...] "sugar plum fairy", with the strings being more prominent during the crescendos.|$|E
500|$|A love poem, [...] "The Good-Morrow" [...] is thematically {{centred on}} several concepts. The poem is {{primarily}} {{to do with}} evolving love; the movement from pure lust, in the first stanza, to a nascent and evolving spirituality which liberates the lovers because they no longer [...] "watch each other out of fear" [...] but can instead see clearly. The lovers' faith in each other allows them to be brave, unlike the Seven Sleepers, who were forced out of fear to hide their beliefs; with love, the lovers can allow others to pursue their own dreams, accepting that [...] "Let us possess one world; each hath one, and is one" [...] – with each other, {{there is no need}} to search further for adventure. Harold Bloom notes the intertwining of both sensual and spiritual love, arguing that Donne is suggesting that it is impossible for those buried in sensual love, [...] "busying themselves in mundane matters", to experience true love. Donne's emphasis on the importance of spiritual love can be seen from the biblical allusions; Achsah Guibbory states that the tone and wording of the poem is an intentional reference to Paul the Apostle's description of divine, agapic love; [...] "At moments like these...eros merges with agape. Walls collapse, the veil parts, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> we are known; our deepest, truest selves exposed". Alfred W. Satterthwaite, writing in The Explicator, argues that the story of the Seven Sleepers itself contains this theme; in the story, the Sleepers awoke to find themselves [...] "thunderstruck" [...] in their new environment, something analogous to [...] "the radiant revelation love grants to the lovers in the poem".|$|E
