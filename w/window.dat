5|$|During the 1920s, {{competitors}} developed new <b>window</b> glass {{production processes}} that eclipsed the American <b>Window</b> Glass technology, {{and the company}} lost its advantage. By the time the Great Depression struck, the Hartford City plant had closed.|$|E
5|$|Every <b>window</b> in {{the church}} {{contains}} coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The windows are mostly narrow single lancets, and {{at the ends of}} the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only <b>window.</b> There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east <b>window</b> with the relieving arch of an older <b>window</b> well above.|$|E
5|$|Examination of {{the radar}} array also allowed British {{scientists}} {{to conclude that}} they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named <b>Window.</b> Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict; thus <b>Window</b> would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of <b>Window</b> against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised <b>Window,</b> all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between the radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of <b>Window</b> giving off a similar signature.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a <b>window.</b> The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false <b>window</b> was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass <b>window</b> beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second <b>window</b> breaking.|$|E
5|$|Fixtures {{include a}} marble font which is {{contemporary}} with the church. There is much stained glass: the oldest, {{in the form}} of heraldic emblems in cartouches, dates from 1562 and is visible in the Diocletian <b>window</b> in the east wall and in another <b>window</b> on the southwest side. The east <b>window</b> was erected in memory of Sir Frank Stapleton, rector of Mereworth 1832–74. Other similar glass dates from the 17th and 18th centuries. Another, depicting the Raising of Lazarus, was designed by Frederic Shields for the Heaton, Butler and Bayne firm in 1889.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the windows}} contain clear leaded glass, but some have stained glass. In 2010, a two-panel stained glass <b>window</b> {{depicting}} {{the work of the}} RAF Search and Rescue units at RAF Valley was dedicated by the RAF's Chaplain-in-Chief, Ray Pentland. The <b>window,</b> which also commemorates the work of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute and the RAF Mountain Rescue Service, was created by Karen Newby– wife of a former RAF Valley station commander– and Lindsey Abbott. Karen Newby also designed a <b>window</b> dedicated in 2001 to mark the work of 208 Squadron at RAF Valley. Another stained glass <b>window</b> was added in 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of 4Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Mulder, still {{restrained}} {{in his bed}} at the hospital, {{sees the}} silhouette of the monster at the <b>window.</b> He screams for the nurse, but she has already been bitten and opens the <b>window</b> to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open <b>window,</b> breaking the glass and wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second <b>window</b> (the oval <b>window)</b> which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval <b>window.</b> Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval <b>window</b> causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E

5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high <b>window</b> with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The <b>window</b> overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the <b>window,</b> while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room.

5|$|The gatehouse's eastwards-facing tower {{contains}} the chapel, an unusual arrangement {{driven by a}} lack of space, with a recently restored east <b>window</b> of reset 15th-century glass designed by Nicola Hopwood, which illuminates the priest's seat, or sedile. The 15th-century <b>window</b> frame itself replaced an even taller, earlier 13th-century <b>window.</b> The chapel's west <b>window</b> is modern, and commemorates British servicemen who died between 1936–76 in radar development.
