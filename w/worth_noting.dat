5|$|Generally, Republicans are {{strongest in}} the suburbs of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, as well as the Panhandle. Democrats are strongest {{in the eastern part of}} the state and Little Dixie, as well as the most heavily African American and inner parts of Oklahoma City and Tulsa. With a {{population}} of 8.6% Native American in the state, it is also <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> most Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by African Americans.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probably}} <b>worth</b> <b>noting,</b> {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
5|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} {{whether the}} source test or nature test {{ought to be}} the determining test. It appears, though, that the impact of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be the determining factor. It is also <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E

50|$|Quebec passing mark is 60% and not 50% as {{compared}} to some other provinces. Note that it is common practice for students to pass with grades {{in the range of}} 55% to 59% at the teacher's discretion. Also <b>worth</b> <b>note</b> the military pass mark is also generally 60%.|$|R
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{especially}} {{due to the}} vernacular language used, this work was largely neglected among the Greek scholars, especially by Adamantios Korais and Dimitrios Katartzis, and was never used as an academic work, or even as a school textbook. It was also negatively received by the Church hierarchy, as well as conservative Greek scholars, due to the vernacular language it used and the liberal views it expressed. It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that the work’s linguistic form disappointed even Dimitrios Katartzis, the intellectual mentor of the two authors, while Philippidis himself, never used such vernacular style language again in his future works. However, Geographia Neoteriki inspired a number of similar geographical works published in Greece during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that JCR and MCR are terms {{that are used to}} refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E

Some original oak pews and the pulpit have survived the restoration though demoted to the West end.

5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{that it is not}} Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} surviving mathematical treatises of ancient China is the Book on Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu), part of the Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts dated 202 to 186 BCE and found in Jiangling County, Hubei. Another mathematical text compiled during the Han was The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing), dated no earlier than the 1st century BCE (from perhaps multiple authors) and contained materials similar to those described by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, yet the zhoubi school of mathematics was not explicitly mentioned until Cai Yong's (132–192 CE) commentary of 180 CE. A preface {{was added to the}} text by Zhao Shuang 趙爽 in the 3rd century CE. There was also the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu); its full title was found on two bronze standard measurers dated 179 CE (with speculation that its material existed in earlier books under different titles) and was provided with detailed commentary by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century CE) in 263 CE. It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> in this context that many of the documents excavated from Qin and Han sites contain evidence of the practical mathematics used by administrators for inventories and taxes, as well as for calculating labor needed for public works projects, just as described in the mathematical treatises.|$|E

60|$|When, {{some months}} later, the story appeared, its effect was {{immediate}} {{on both sides}} the Atlantic. It is <b>worth</b> <b>note</b> that during his French visit Cooper met Sir Walter Scott. Cooper was born at Burlington, New Jersey, 15th Sept., 1789, and died at Cooperstown, New York (which took its name from his father), 14th Sept., 1851.|$|R
50|$|Even still, <b>Worth</b> <b>notes</b> the {{regional}} Yustaga chiefdom {{would have been}} much less integrated than certain eastern Timucua chiefdoms such as the Saturiwa and (eastern) Utina. Ceramic dating may vary from community to community, suggesting a level of regional disunity, and no large-scale monuments such as platform mounds, often signs of integrated regional chiefdoms, have been discovered in Yustaga territory.|$|R
50|$|Aperlae (or Aperlæ) (Ἄπερλαι) {{was a city}} on the {{southern}} coast of ancient Lycia and former notable bishopric, now a Latin Catholic titular see. It did not play any significant role in history or politics, yet its lifespan of 1,300 years is <b>worth</b> <b>note.</b> Harsh terrain {{made it difficult to}} survive, but like other towns along the coast, it thrived on the production of Tyrian dye.|$|R
