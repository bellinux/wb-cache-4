500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Second Intifada, the Palestinian {{uprising}} against Israeli occupation that began in 2000, the show became dominated by the conflict, which Qandil generally regarded as a campaign of Israeli aggression. He frequently broadcast the Israeli military's actions during the Intifada and called for viewers to support the uprising and boycott Israeli products. Qandil responded to a query regarding his extensive coverage of the Intifada by saying, [...] "How are news shows expected to react to events such as the Intifada? Are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> keep silent?" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{he saw the}} {{completed}} episode, James L. Brooks called the writers and suggested that the Kamp Krusty script {{be used as a}} plotline for a film. However, the episode ran very short, and to make it barely fit the minimum time the Kamp Krusty song had to be lengthened by a number of verses. The episode was also chosen to be the first episode of the season, further complicating matters. As Jean told Brooks, [...] "First of all, if we make it into the movie then we don't have a premiere, and second, if we can't make 18 minutes out of this episode how are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> make 80?" ...|$|E
500|$|Krauss was {{apprehensive}} at first, noting drastic {{differences between}} her personal acoustic style {{and that of}} Twain. She stated, [...] "It's so {{different from what we}} do, we didn't know what liberties we were supposed to take. Were <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> learn it off the record? Were <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> learn the themes?" [...] She found aid in Twain's then-husband and producer Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who told Krauss to perform the songs as if they were her own. While preparing for the show, Krauss said she found the songs very simple to learn because of their catchy melodies that could function in any musical style. While traveling on the Up! Tour, Twain decided to cover of AC/DC's [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long" [...] (1980) for the television special. However, she edited the song's lyrics to void them of the crudeness she was not fond of singing along to as a teenager. Krauss later expressed her opposing views, saying she would have personally kept the original lyrics. The show was modeled after Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black, leather jumpsuit. The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville, Tennessee to a crowd of 300 attendants. Up! Close and Personal was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, who also directed Up! Live in Chicago, and was produced by a team that consisted of Dan Braun, Cliff Burnstein, Carol Donovan, McCarthy-Miller, Peter Mensch, and Marc Reiter.|$|E

500|$|... "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] and [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] were holdovers {{from the}} {{previous}} season and so were {{the last of the}} Klasky Csupo produced episodes to air. Brooks suggested that the script for [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] be expanded and produced as a feature-length theatrically released film. However, the episode ran very short, barely reaching the minimum length allowed, with the episode's musical number having to be lengthened by a number of verses. The episode had also been selected to be the season's premiere. As Jean told Brooks, [...] "First of all, if we make it into the movie then we don't have a premiere, and second if we can't make 18 minutes out of this episode how are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> make 80?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dinosaur" [...] {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} most music critics. Ian Gittins of The Guardian {{called it a}} [...] "bitchy put-down of ageing suitors". Doug Rule of Metro Weekly criticized the song's chorus, which according to him is [...] "spelt out like a [...] "modern-day Toni Basil", saying: [...] "Are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> think that's cute, even clever? It's neither." [...] The UrbanWire's Cheryl Chia was critical of the song, saying that it [...] "has {{the potential to be}} very annoying after a few rounds." [...] Billboards Monica Herrera also gave a negative review. She used the song as an example of one of the album's [...] "missteps", stating that it could [...] "only appeal to the most heartless of teens". Ailbhe Malone of NME stated that [...] "Dinosaur" [...] contains the pay-off [...] "Honey, your toupee is falling to the left side/Get up and go bro/Oh wait, you’re fossilized".|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B–" [...] and {{concluded}} that, [...] "I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays {{a little too much}} like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, we've been there before". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it [...] "lethargically lifeless" [...] and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, [...] "Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's just no replacing Englund". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be scared?

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the first episode was not favourable; in The Independent, Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen. He wrote of the six main characters, [...] "Are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> care about these people? The theory, I think, {{is that we should}} relate to them, because their lives are as prosaic as our own, and because Cold Feet is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties. This is another way of saying the writer hasn't bothered with research or imagination." [...] He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes. On The Late Review, Germaine Greer and Tony Parsons singled out Nesbitt's acting; Greer called him [...] "especially awful" [...] and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the scissor lift Adam appears on {{at the beginning of the}} episode. General reaction improved as the first year went on. At the conclusion of the first series, Andrew Billen compared it with Vanity Fair in the Evening Standard and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the [...] "forgotten" [...] twentysomethings. Paul Hoggart for The Times wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing and looked forward to how Rachel's pregnancy plot would be resolved in the second series.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2008, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin {{told reporters}} that Russia {{had no choice but}} to attack Georgia as Russia had been encircled on all sides. He said that Georgia [...] "attacked South Ossetia with missiles, tanks, heavy {{artillery}} and ground troops. What were <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do?" [...] He claimed that if his country had not invaded, it would have been like Russia [...] "getting a bloody nose and hanging its head down", and there would be a [...] "second blow" [...] into the North Caucasus.

2500|$|Ruth Deller of {{entertainment}} website lowculture.co.uk criticised Sam's return in 2009 branding it as unsuccessful, also stating: [...] "Danniella Westbrook is doing her best but the scriptwriters don’t {{seem to know}} who Sam is any more.

Scott Shaw, a co-founder of the Oklahoma Volunteer Militia, said the militia was {{prepared}} to use deadly force, but that its members would not fire unless fired upon. When an interviewer asked about {{a situation in which}} the government might use rubber bullets, which are designed to incapacitate and not kill, Shaw responded, [...] "How are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> know that they're firing rubber bullets when it has been fired?” During an appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, host Bill O'Reilly asked Shaw what made Cliven Bundy different from Occupy Wall Street supporters.

2500|$|The {{novel that}} made its author [...] "the true lion of the Russian literature" [...] (according to Ivan Goncharov) enjoyed great {{success with the}} reading public upon its {{publication}} and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (by Dmitry Pisarev, Pavel Annenkov, Dragomirov and Strakhov) {{formed the basis for}} the research of later Tolstoy scholars. Yet the Russian press's initial response to the novel was muted, most critics unable to decide how to classify it. The liberal newspaper Golos (The Voice, April 3, #93, 1865) {{was one of the first}} to react. Its anonymous reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others: [...] "What could this possibly be? What kind of genre are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> file it to?..
