2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Massimo Pigliucci on the Rationally Thinking podcast, Baggott stated that science is a human endeavor with a [...] "fuzziness around the edges". He {{went on to say}} that there are no rules and, when training to be a scientist, no one gives you an instruction book on how to do science. [...] "We kinda make it up as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along...</b> and it is perfectly reasonable for the scientific community to want to change those rules." [...] Science writer Philip Ball, in a review of Farewell in The Guardian, stated that Baggott was right [...] "although his target is as much the way this science is marketed as what it contains." [...] Ball cautioned Baggott about criticising scientists that speculate because [...] "conjecture injects vitality into science." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, Melissa Rosenberg was {{developing}} AKA Jessica Jones, {{based on the}} comic book series Alias. Centered on the character Jessica Jones, the series was developed for ABC under Rosenberg's new production banner Tall Girls Productions, along with ABC Studios and Marvel Television. The series was intended to air in 2011 of the 2011–12 television season, with Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb, Joe Quesada, Alan Fine, and Howard Klein as executive producers, and Alias writer Brian Michael Bendis as a consultant. At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, Loeb said the series was [...] "about a failed superhero who is rebuilding {{her life as a}} private detective in New York City,” and would include the characters Carol Danvers and Luke Cage. In November, Rosenberg said the show was now [...] "hoping to get on the schedule for" [...] 2012 of the 2012–13 television season, and added, [...] "I love this character. That is an incredibly damaged, dark, complex female character that kicks ass... a former superhero with PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder." [...] She also stated that, while Cage {{was a part of the}} series, the couple's daughter Danielle would appear [...] "way down the road." [...] Rosenberg said later in the month that the series would acknowledge the existence of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with references to Tony Stark and Stark Industries in the pilot script, but admitted that [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> things will alter in terms of what is made available to us, but we're definitely in that universe. We are in no way denying that that universe exists. And as much as I can I'm going to pull everything in from there that I can use". She also confirmed that Danvers would be a principal character in the series.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} year came {{responses}} to the ode by two Romantic writers. Leigh Hunt, a second-generation Romantic poet, added notes to his poem Feast of the Poets that respond to the ideas suggested in Wordsworth's poetry. These ideas include Wordsworth's promotion of a simple mental state without cravings for knowledge, and it is such an ideas that Hunt wanted to mock in his poem. However, Hunt did not disagree completely with Wordsworth's sentiments. After quoting the final lines of the Ode: Intimations of Immortality, those that [...] "Wordsworth has beautifully told us, that to him '--the meanest flow'r that blows can give/ Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears", Hunt claims, [...] "I have no doubt of it; and far be it from me to cast stones into the well in which they lie,-- to disturb those reposing waters,-- that freshness {{at the bottom of}} warm hearts,-- those thoughts, which if they are too deep for tears, are also, in their best mood, too tranquil even for smiles. Far be it also from me to hinder the communication of such thoughts to mankind, when they are not sunk beyond their proper depth, so as to make one dizzy in looking down to them." [...] Following Hunt, William Hazlitt, a critic and Romantic writer, wrote a series of essays called [...] "Character of Mr. Wordsworth's New Poems" [...] in three parts, starting in the 21 August 1814 Examiner. Although Hazlitt treated Wordsworth's poetry fairly, he was critical of Wordsworth himself and he removed any positive statements about Wordsworth's person from a reprint of the essays. The 2 October 1814 essay examined poetry as either of imagination or of sentiment, and quotes the final lines of the poem as an example of [...] "The extreme simplicity which some persons have objected to in Mr. Wordsworth's poetry is to be found only in the subject and style: the sentiments are subtle and profound. In the latter respect, his poetry is as much above the common standard or capacity, as in the other it is below it... <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> with him, while he is the subject of his own narrative, but we take leave of him when he makes pedlars and ploughmen his heroes and the interpreters of his sentiments." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> {{in silence}} I noticed that Peterkin sighed {{once or twice}} very heavily, and I {{asked him if he}} was quite well.|$|R
60|$|I {{was obliged}} to admit the truth of these remarks. After the first {{ebullition}} of joy at the meeting was over, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> the street together.|$|R
5000|$|Hooper {{stated that}} [...] "Placing John Williams's themes became obvious as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b> The {{beginning}} of the film has {{to have at least}} a hint of 'Hedwig's Theme'." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} inside, please?" [...] she insisted. [...] "There are {{one or two}} {{questions}} which I might ask you as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b> Please direct the chauffeur." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{missed the}} Fair it is true, but I {{picked up some}} {{diplomatic}} tricks which I and the reader may find handy and useful as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b>|$|E
60|$|He had {{improved}} his own spirits, {{no less than}} Mrs. Gummidge's, for they were again at their usual flow, and {{he was full of}} vivacious conversation as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b>|$|R
60|$|I turned back, and inquired of my conductor, as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> how Mrs. Steerforth was. She {{said her}} lady was but poorly, {{and kept her}} own room a good deal.|$|R
5000|$|Harry Mills {{recalled}} {{that he and}} his brother Herbert did not initially like the song, although his brother Donald did. However, he said, [...] "as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> rehearsing it, <b>we</b> got to feeling it".|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't {{so sure of}} that. You see, we wasn't lookin' for one, an' now if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> {{with our}} eyes open there's no tellin' but what we may run----" ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} girl {{spoke in the}} native tongue, which was quite incomprehensible to our travellers, {{but if we are}} to {{enlighten}} our readers we must needs translate as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us be off at once," [...] Dr. Wade {{said to his}} companion; [...] "we {{can talk}} as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b> I have got two rifles with me; I can lend you one." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently he came forth full-dressed, booted, and armed, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> the {{corridor}} and out upon the gallery. As side by side we were descending the steps, we caught sight of a singular group in the courtyard.|$|R
6000|$|So, drat him, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> but I didn't like it much. When {{we got in}} we couldn't {{hardly see}} anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out: ...|$|R
60|$|Of course I {{was only}} too glad to follow him. He {{conducted}} {{me to an}} elegant mansion in Bayswater, and chatted pleasantly as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> in somewhat nautical tones, for {{he had been a}} man-of-war's man. His name was Flaxmore.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, old fellow. I {{can tell}} you how to find the place as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> in the gig. By-the-by, there's one thing that's rather important. I'd better mention it while I think of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, we {{can take}} it easily, Wilcox, and we will stop at the first cocoa-nut tree we come to. Now, Tom, as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> you shall tell us about yesterday, we have not heard a word yet.” ...|$|E
60|$|Isa. You must guide him, by back ways, to my uncle's house, {{and so to}} my cousin's chamber, that he may {{not know}} where he is when he comes there. The rest I'll tell you as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b>|$|E
60|$|What {{his wife}} {{mentioned}} {{of his being}} a tale-teller, {{as well as a}} musician, now occurred to me; and as you know I like tales of superstition, I begged to have a specimen of his talent as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{comes back}} the {{youngest}} takes my hand, {{and the oldest}} holds by my jacket, and <b>we</b> <b>goes</b> up into High Street, and across to the other cliff. <b>We</b> <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> till <b>we</b> comes to a pretty little cottage looking over the sea.

60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> {{partly to}} hold him in conversation, and partly to satisfy myself, I asked him about Ham. He said, almost in the same words as formerly, that Ham was just the same, 'wearing away his life with kiender no care nohow for 't; but never murmuring, and liked by all'.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} will cover you up altogether," [...] the doctor said, [...] "as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> through the streets. The morning air {{is a good deal}} keener than the {{atmosphere}} of this room, and you won't want to look about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Through here," [...] said Mr. Pogram, {{coming to}} a side door in the garden wall, [...] "we can make a short cut to the police station. As <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> I shall ask you one or two blunt questions." [...] And he thrust out his under lip: ...|$|E

60|$|We soon {{reached the}} edge of the plain where Jack had been {{separated}} from his companion, and here we proceeded to make a careful search. Being certain that the savages were now out of earshot, we began to halloo occasionally as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b> But monkeys and parrots alone replied to us.|$|R
60|$|At last {{we passed}} a distant steeple and large castle, which we were told belonged to Ryswyk, the castle of the Prince of Orange; then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> through long rows of trees, and {{suddenly}} emerging from them we beheld a vast plain, a great wood, and a city crowned with towers and windmills.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, I did once--but I {{never did}} it again. I caught one, a kitten, {{and set off}} {{with a number of}} boys to kill it; but as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> it began to play with my neck-tie and to purr! Our hearts were softened, so <b>we</b> let it <b>go.</b> Ah! Corrie, my boy, never go hunting cats," [...] said Montague, earnestly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{it not be}} well, general, if I were to {{tell off}} a dozen parties of twenty men, each {{under the command of}} a steady non-commissioned officer, to enter the houses {{on each side of the}} road as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along,</b> and to clear out any {{soldiers}} they may find there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{anyone should}} come along," [...] Jim said, [...] "it is too dark {{for them to}} see those fellows lying in the boat.

6000|$|... "I understand, sir. I {{will take}} Pat Hogan with me; he {{has plenty of}} the brogue, and can talk the {{language}} too.

60|$|The bell of the {{old church}} was ringing as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> and many respectable-looking people and cleanly dressed {{children}} were moving towards the sound. Soon we reached the church, and I have seen nothing yet in England that so completely answered my idea of what such a thing was, as this old village church of Bebbington.|$|R
60|$|Of course, I {{was as much}} delighted as Guert {{could very}} well be, and left my party to proceed at once to the contractor's office, with the {{greatest}} alacrity; Dirck accompanying me. As <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> our new friend advised us not to be very backward {{in the way of}} price, since the king paid, in the long run.|$|R
5000|$|Monday morning <b>we</b> <b>went</b> down to {{the port}} and did not find the ships. We saw their buoys in the water, from which we {{realized}} {{that they had been}} lost, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> the coast {{to see if we could}} find signs of them. Since we found nothing, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into the woods, and a quarter of a league into them we found one of the ship's boats in some trees. Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca.|$|R
