50|$|These tumors, {{papillary}} {{tumors in}} this case, have no known predisposing genetic characteristics, {{as stated by}} Dr. Janss <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>interviewed</b> her. She said {{that there is nothing}} that links the likelihood of getting this tumor type to genetics, meaning nothing is inherited. However, technically speaking, there is genetics involved, just not in the sense of inheritability. The tumor cells may differ in their structure and function, but they all have normal function, which is directed by the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. There are meant to be certain cells in a specific area, for the pineal region these are ependymal cells, and the cells divide into millions. As these cells divide, their genetic material is being copied. In a tumor, there is a collection of mutations that are typos in the genetic material, which disrupts the function of the normal cell. Therefore, the cells differentiate from what they were meant to be. If the abnormal cells continue to grow, divide, and produce more abnormal cells, the mass of abnormal cells may eventually become a tumor.|$|E

I am a forensic psychologist and criminologist, and I am attracted to the definitions given by others with a similar background such as Professor Roy Baumeister... He defines evil person as one who intentionally inflicts serious physical harm on another person or persons, in pursuit of a personal, ideological or religious goal, and who experiences intense psychological pleasure in doing so"... People who fall into my definition of evil include the two soldiers Reid and Luckman...

One participant pushed further—what about now, after the remediation work that has been done? In the discussion that followed, the general consensus was that more testing needed to be done on local fish populations to determine current contaminant levels.

He told her to sit down at a table with her friends while he himself served her some food and drinks from the buffet. This behaviour was shunned by his Christian brothers, who told him they could not understand why he did not behave as a ‘proper African’, i. e., sit down himself and wait for his wife to serve him instead.

Movement sustainability is seldom discussed in the social movement literature, but it’s a question that should intrigue scholars, particularly those who employ an assumption of rational actors, since they might want to investigate why people continue to participate when they could easily take that proverbial “free ride ” and reap the benefits of others ’ work.

40|$|Of all the {{countries}} studied in the large-scale WHO Multi-country Study on Women´s Health and Domestic Violence against Women (2005), Ethiopian women had the highest numbers of acceptance of intimate partner violence. And according to previous research on the subject, Ethiopian women have a high tolerance for and acceptance of the violence they endure. Yet <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>interviewed</b> women in Ethiopia (all {{of whom had been}} victims of violence) I discovered multiple forms of resistance to - rather than acceptance of - violence. Rather than confirming how women come to accept violence, my study uncovers many ways in which women resist violence, even in contexts where the available means of resistance are extremely limited. The aim of my inductive study is to begin to do justice to these forms of resistance, which are easily overlooked. First, as I argue in the analyses of my interviews with the women, our ability to discern forms of resistance in situations of intimate partner violence requires a more capacious notion of resistance than the one usually employed. Second, as I argue through my engagement with the previous research and the analyses of my interviews with women’s organizations in Ethiopia, the inability to discern multiple and varied forms of resistance leads one to underestimate the degree of non-acceptance and active resistance in situations of intimate partner violence. Thus, while my limited study does not permit general conclusions about violence against women in Ethiopia, I conclude by suggesting that my findings have two important implications for social work, one theoretical and one practical...|$|E
