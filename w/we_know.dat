5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering {{the universe as}} a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of galaxy types and their distribution suggests that life as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for life as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Solar System as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support life as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it. But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.|$|E

5|$|Morrison {{was known}} for his {{numerous}} books and television programs. He produced 68 popular science articles between 1949 and 1976, ten in issues of Scientific American. He provided the narration and script for Powers of Ten in 1977. With his wife, Phylis, they turned the same material into a coffee table book in 1982. He also appeared as himself in the science documentary film Target...Earth? in 1980. In 1987, PBS aired his six part miniseries, The Ring of Truth: An Inquiry into How <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> What <b>We</b> <b>Know,</b> which he also hosted. In addition, he was a columnist and reviewer of books on science for Scientific American starting in 1965.|$|E

Here's an example of changing. <b>We</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> were going {{to fall in love}} with Ruth Negga the way we did as Raina. She came in for episode five but we thought 'She's cool' and so we brought her back. So what would have been {{somebody}} else became her, and as we fell in love with her character, we wrote more and more to that. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> J. Richards was going to be Deathlok but <b>we</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> were going to care about him as much as <b>we</b> did ... <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> the kind of person we wanted to bring in as The Clairvoyant and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> wanted a mislead so we brought in Victoria Hand. The fact that Bill Paxtonworked out was fantastic. You're going to write that character in a certain way because of who the actor is, so that changes, but <b>we</b> did <b>know</b> <b>we</b> were going to introduce The Clairvoyant, that we were going to introduce he was Hydra and then use that to reveal Ward.

5|$|The American {{rock band}} Paramore has {{released}} five studio albums, three extended plays, two live albums, eighteen singles, one video album, and nineteen music videos. The band {{was formed in}} Franklin, Tennessee, in 2004 by lead vocalist Hayley Williams with guitarists Josh Farro and Taylor York, bassist Jeremy Davis, and drummer Zac Farro. In 2005, Paramore signed with the New York City-based Fueled by Ramen and released their debut album entitled All <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling. Three singles were released from the album, {{but none of them}} charted. The album did not chart in the Billboard 200 either, although it peaked at number thirty in the Billboard Top Heatseekers. All <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling received Gold certification in the United Kingdom and in July 2014 the RIAA certified the album Gold in the United States.|$|E

It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by Franciscus Junius, from whose library it came to the Bodleian as part of the Junius donation (Holt 1878, pp. liv–lvi).|$|E
5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System is one such star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of life as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it.|$|E
5|$|As far as <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> the {{earliest}} cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.|$|E
