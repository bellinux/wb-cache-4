50|$|A radome (which is a {{portmanteau}} of {{radar and}} dome) is a structural, <b>weatherproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> that protects a microwave (e.g. radar) antenna. The radome is constructed {{of material that}} minimally attenuates the electromagnetic signal transmitted or received by the antenna. In other words, the radome is transparent to radar or radio waves. Radomes protect the antenna surfaces from weather and conceal antenna electronic equipment from public view. They also protect nearby personnel from being accidentally struck by quickly rotating antennas.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{low voltage}} of an {{individual}} solar cell (typically ca. 0.5V), several cells are wired (also see copper used in PV systems) in series {{in the manufacture of}} a [...] "laminate". The laminate is assembled into a protective <b>weatherproof</b> <b>enclosure,</b> thus making a photovoltaic module or solar panel. Modules may then be strung together into a photovoltaic array. In 2012, solar panels available for consumers can have an efficiency of up to about 17%, while commercially available panels can go as far as 27%. It has been recorded that a group from The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems have created a cell that can reach 44.7% efficiency, which makes scientists' hopes of reaching the 50% efficiency threshold a lot more feasible.|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{the needs}} of precise forest {{inventory}} and realtime surveillance for ecosystem management, {{in this paper we}} present GreenOrbs [1], a wireless sensor network system and its application for canopy closure estimates. Both the hardware and software designs of GreenOrbs are tailored for sensing in wild environments without human supervision, including a firm <b>weatherproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> of sensor motes and a light-weight mechanism for node state monitoring and data collection. By incorporating a pre-deployment training process as well as a distributed calibration method, the estimates of canopy closure stay accurate and consistent against uncertain sensory data and dynamic environments. We have implemented a prototype system of GreenOrbs and carried out multiple rounds of deployments. The evaluation results demonstrate that GreenOrbs outperforms the conventional approaches for canopy closure estimates. Some early experiences are reported in this paper...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} wireless data-acquisition {{system has}} been developed as a potential replacement for a wired data-acquisition system heretofore used in testing rocket engines. The traditional use of wires to connect sensors, signal-conditioning circuits, and data acquisition circuitry is time-consuming and prone to error, especially when, {{as is often the}} case, many sensors are used in a test. The system includes one master and multiple slave nodes. The master node communicates with a computer via an Ethernet connection. The slave nodes are powered by rechargeable batteries and are packaged in <b>weatherproof</b> <b>enclosures.</b> The master unit and each of the slave units are equipped with a time-modulated ultra-wide-band (TMUWB) radio transceiver, which spreads its RF energy over several gigahertz by transmitting extremely low-power and super-narrow pulses. In this prototype system, each slave node can be connected to as many as six sensors: two sensors can be connected directly to analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in the slave node and four sensors can be connected indirectly to the ADCs via signal conditioners. The maximum sampling rate for streaming data from any given sensor is about 5 kHz. The bandwidth of one channel of the TM-UWB radio communication system is sufficient to accommodate streaming of data from five slave nodes when they are fully loaded with data collected through all possible sensor connections. TM-UWB radios have a much higher spatial capacity than traditional sinusoidal wave-based radios. Hence, this TM-UWB wireless data-acquisition can be scaled to cover denser sensor setups for rocket engine test stands. Another advantage of TM-UWB radios is that it will not interfere with existing wireless transmission. The maximum radio-communication range between the master node and a slave node for this prototype system is about 50 ft (15 m) when the master and slave transceivers are equipped with small dipole antennas. The range can be increased by changing to larger antennas and/or greater transmission power. The battery life of a slave node ranges from about six hours during operation at full capacity to as long as three days when the system is in a "sleep" mode used to conserve battery charge during times between setup and rocket-engine testing. Batteries can be added to prolong operational lifetimes. The radio transceiver dominates the power consumption...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a low-cost, automatic and continuous Herd Activity and Welfare Kit (HAWK). The operational goal for the GPS HAWK was to collect GPS positions and analog sensor data at a user-specified sampling frequency and store it in a secure format. The GPS HAWK uses a Garmin 12 -channel, WAAS corrected, low-power GPS receiver with(0 - 5 V single-ended, 10 -bit resolution) analog to digital (A/D) conversion channels as well as 16 general purpose I/O pins that can be configured for digital operations or serial communication. Data is stored to an EEPROM device and offloaded daily to a 32 MB Compact Flash memory card. Power is supplied using a 6 VDC, 7. 2 Ah sealed lead acid battery. The GPS HAWK was enclosed in a <b>weatherproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> and mounted above the shoulders to provide better satellite visibility to the receiver and to prevent contact with concrete feed bunks in confined animal feeding studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{the realm}} of global climate modeling, {{numerous}} variables affect {{the state of the}} atmosphere and climate. One important area is soil moisture and temperature. The ARM Program uses several types of instruments to gather soil moisture information. An example is the soil water and temperature system (SWATS). A SWATS is located at each of 21 extended facility sites within the CART site boundary. Each system is configured to measure soil moisture and temperature at eight distinct subsurface levels. A special set of probes used in the SWATS measures soil temperature, soil-water potential, and volumetric water content. Sensors are placed at eight different depths below the soil surface, starting at approximately 5 cm (2 in.) below the surface and ending as deep as 175 cm (69 in.). Each site has two identical sets of probes buried 1 m (3. 3 ft) apart, to yield duplicate measurements as a quality control measure. At some sites, impenetrable soil or rock layers prevented installation of probes at the deeper levels. The sensors are connected to an electronic data logger that collects and stores the data. Communication equipment transfers data from the site. All of the electronic equipment is housed in a <b>weatherproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> mounted on a concrete slab...|$|E
40|$|A small, {{battery-powered}} {{ultraviolet radiation}} detector was developed using three spectrally distinct photodiodes {{housed in a}} <b>weatherproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> (cylinder with r= 16 mm, h= 15 mm) under an acrylic window. Each induced photocurrent (plus a temperature reading) was amplified and conditioned electronically, converted to a digital number and stored in a non-volatile memory space, contained in another small enclosure (cuboid, 100 x 70 x 30 mm). Each reading was time-stamped. The detector was characterised in the laboratory to determine its spectral sensitivity, angular response, linear response, temperature dependency and dark current. It was calibrated in natural sunlight, at a range of solar zenith angles, ozone column amounts and cloud conditions, against a Bentham DTM 300 spectroradiometer. The results showed it to approximate the irradiance weighted by four distinct biological action spectra with an overall accuracy of 20 %. It was tested {{in a number of}} field settings and shown to operate in a range of environmental conditions and provide data that had scientific relevance. A number of the detectors were used in two personal dosimetry experiments. The data revealed distinct exposure patterns between occupational and recreational days, and highlighted the strong influence of behavior on both ultraviolet exposure rates and integrated doses. Further, it was shown that the relative balance of previtamin D photosynthesis and erythemally weighted irradiance is not dependent on solar zenith angle when one considers a population with varying behaviors in a variable climate.

40|$|Landslides {{are often}} the result of complex, {{multi-phase}} processes where gradual deterioration of shear strength within the sub-surface precedes the appearance of surface features and slope failure. Moisture content increases and the build-up of associated pore water pressures are invariably associated {{with a loss of}} strength, and thus are a precursor to failure. Consequently, hydraulic processes typically {{play a major role in}} the development of landslides. Geoelectrical techniques, such as resistivity and self-potential are being increasingly applied to study landslide structure and the hydraulics of landslide processes. The great strengths of these techniques are that they provide spatial or volumetric information at the site scale, which, when calibrated with appropriate geotechnical and hydrogeological data, can be used to characterise lithological variability and monitor hydraulic changes in the subsurface. In this study we describe the development of an automated time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ALERT) and geotechnical monitoring system on an active inland landslide near Malton, North Yorkshire, UK. The overarching objective of the research is to develop a 4 D landslide monitoring system that can characterise the subsurface structure of the landslide, and reveal the hydraulic precursors to movement. The site is a particularly import research facility as it is representative of many lowland UK situations in which weak mudrocks have failed on valley sides. Significant research efforts have already been expended at the site, and a number of baseline data sets have been collected, including ground and airborne LIDAR, geomorphologic and geological maps, and geophysical models. The monitoring network comprises an ALERT monitoring station connected to a 3 D monitoring electrode array installed across an area of 5, 500 m 2, extending from above the back scarp to beyond the toe of the landslide. The ALERT instrument uses wireless telemetry (in this case GPRS) to communicate with an office based server, which runs control software and a database management system. The control software is used to schedule data acquisition, whilst the database management system stores, processes and inverts the remotely streamed ERT data. Once installed and configured, the system operates autonomously without manual intervention. Modifications to the ALERT system at this site have included the addition of environmental and geotechnical sensors to monitor rainfall, ground movement, ground and air temperature, and pore pressure changes within the landslide. The system is housed in a <b>weatherproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> and is powered by batteries charged by a wind turbine & solar panels. 3 D ERT images generated from the landslide have been calibrated against resistivity information derived from laboratory testing of borehole core recovered from the landslide. The calibrated images revealed key aspects of the 3 D landslide structure, including the lateral extent of slipped material and zones of depletion and accumulation; the surface of separation and the thickness of individual earth flow lobes; and the dipping in situ geological boundary between the bedrock formations. Time-lapse analysis of resistivity signatures has revealed artefacts within the images that are diagnostic of electrode movement. Analytical models have been developed to simulate the observed artefacts, from which predictions of electrode movement have been derived. This information has been used to correct the ERT data sets, and has provided a means of using ERT to monitor landslide movement across the entire ALERT imaging area. Initial assessment of seasonal changes in the resistivity signature has indicated that the system is sensitive to moisture content changes in the body of the landslide, thereby providing a basis for further development of the system with the aim of monitoring hydraulic precursors to failure...|$|E
