40|$|In Ukraine, <b>wolf</b> <b>numbers</b> {{have been}} {{controlled}} periodically {{in an effort}} to reduce predation on game and domestic livestock. The Kinburn protected area, where several hunting districts and farms are located, in this respect, has been no exception. The reduction of <b>wolf</b> <b>numbers</b> was primarily the responsibility of these districts, however, most of them, as state enterprises, have come to an economic standstill and/or are in the state of being reorganised in one way or another. Due to the economic slowdown they are nowadays hard pushed to cope with only a fraction of their previous responsibilities, including the control of <b>wolf</b> <b>numbers.</b> This has become a cause of concern for the Kinburnska Kosa authority, because locals are perceiving wolves as an increasing threat to domestic livestock and are demanding eradication measures. The Kinburnska Kosa authority, however, is not considering the situation to be so alarming, but realises that a sound decision in this case can be made only if numbers or data reflecting the relative abundance of wolves in the area are available. The purpose of this survey was to gather such data and set a quantitative baseline for monitoring wolf abundance in the area in the coming years...|$|R

50|$|Solar cycle 9 {{began in}} 1843, {{the year that}} Heinrich Schwabe {{discovered}} the sunspot cycle.

50|$|Sunspot {{activity}} has been measured using the <b>Wolf</b> <b>number</b> for about 300 years.

50|$|Wolf {{was greatly}} {{impressed}} by {{the discovery of the}} sunspot cycle by Heinrich Schwabe and he not only carried out his own observations, but he collected all the available data on sunspot activity back as far as 1610 and calculated a period for the cycle of 11.1 years. In 1848 he devised a way of quantifying sunspot activity. The <b>Wolf</b> <b>number,</b> as it is now called, remains in use. In 1852 Wolf was one of four people who discovered the link between the cycle and geomagnetic activity on Earth.|$|E

The primary {{argument}} for delisting is that <b>wolf</b> population <b>numbers</b> are well above recovery levels.

Several groups believe that high <b>wolf</b> <b>numbers</b> are detrimental to elk and moose populations sharing the same habitat.

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} a dependency between the annual average daily air temperature course (cycle) in Warsaw and {{the profile of}} annual solar activity linked to rotation (with a period of 25 – 31 days). Waves of cold (ΔT < 0) or heat (ΔT ≥ 0) were defined as ΔT deviations of daily average temperature (T) using a regression sinusoid f (t) with a period of 365 days. Cold waves were found to generally occur at times of low daily average solar activity (relative to 60 -year average), while hot waves tended to coincide with high <b>Wolf</b> <b>numbers.</b> The cycles of the variables were derived using the sinusoid regression method (Boryczka 1998). The maximum sinusoid regression of the annual air-temperature cycle T is delayed by nearly one month vis-à-vis the maximum declination of the Sun. The maximum of the regression sinusoid of daily average <b>Wolf</b> <b>numbers</b> (W) was delayed from the maximum declination by more than two months...|$|R

An analysis, using the alternating conditional expectations (ACE) algorithm, of the predictive power of the <b>Wolf</b> <b>number</b> is compared to that of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) – which describes a global variable known to influence rainfall in the eastern states of Australia.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} solar activity using a nonlinear one-dimensional dynamo model and a phenomenological equation {{for the evolution of}} Wolf numbers. This system of equations is solved numerically. We take into account the algebraic and dynamic nonlinearities of the alpha effect. The dynamic nonlinearity is related to the evolution of a small-scale magnetic helicity, and it leads to a complicated behavior of solar activity. The evolution equation for the <b>Wolf</b> <b>number</b> is based on a mechanism of formation of magnetic spots {{as a result of the}} negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI). This phenomenon was predicted 25 years ago and has been investigated intensively in recent years through direct numerical simulations and mean-field simulations. The evolution equation for the <b>Wolf</b> <b>number</b> includes the production and decay of sunspots. Comparison between the results of numerical simulations and observational data of Wolf numbers shows a 70 % correlation over all intervals of observation (about 270 years). We determine the dependence of the maximum value of the <b>Wolf</b> <b>number</b> versus the period of the cycle and the asymmetry of the solar cycles versus the amplitude of the cycle. These dependencies are in good agreement with observations. Comment: 9 pages, 13 figures, final revised paper for MNRA...|$|E

40|$|Early this century, the Fortymile caribou herd was {{the largest}} in Alaska {{and one of the}} largest in the world. Since the 1940 s the herd has {{remained}} relatively small, fluctuating between 6, 000 - 8, 000 and about 50, 000. To determine possible limiting factors, we reviewed historical fluctuations in herd since and harvest, historical data on <b>wolf</b> <b>numbers</b> and summer and winter weather. The major decline in herd size from 1963 to 1973 was accompanied by high <b>wolf</b> <b>numbers,</b> some years of unfavorable winter and summer weather, and some years of high harvests. From 1974 to 1990 the Fortymile herd failed to recover as well as the adjacent Nelchi-na herd and provided less than one-fourth the harvest despite favorable winter conditions in both areas. Two notable differences between these herds were that (1) wolves were less strongly limited within the range of the Fortymile herd, and (2) moose as alternate prey for wolves remained more abundant within the range of the Nelchina herd.

40|$|An {{examination}} of the maximum yearly values of the conventional sunspot number Rz of all cycles revealed fluctuations of various intervals in the high periodicity region (exceeding 11 years), namely 2 cycles (Hale, 22 years), 3 cycles (TRC, three-cycle) and longer intervals. The 2 -cycle spacings had the smallest amplitudes. According to the G-O (Gnevyshev-Ohl) rule (Gnevyshev and Ohl, 1948), the even-numbered series of the maxima of annual mean <b>Wolf</b> sunspot <b>numbers</b> Rz are followed by higher amplitude odd-numbered series.
