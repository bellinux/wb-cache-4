40|$|Abstract- As we {{know that}} the {{conventional}} filter synthesis procedure is adequate only for the relatively narrow band filters and is not suitable for the Wideband and Ultra wideband filters. Therefore <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> design a Ultra Wideband filter. In this study a compact Ultra Wide Band pass filter consisting of quarter wave resonant conductor like micro strip lines is proposed to design. We have to increase the Bandwidth by using suitable techniques also have to improve the stop band performance. A microwave filter is frequency selective two-port network used to control the frequency response at a certain point in a microwave system by providing transmission at frequencies within the pass band of the filter and attenuation in stop band of the filter. Microwave filters specifically band pass filters have found large number of application in varying fields such as satellite communication, GSM networks, Bluetooth, remote sensing, navigation etc...|$|E

In this paper, the focus on inter-firm networks as ties of integration mechanism encircle all the levels of organizational devices to inter-firm network relations which creates, delivers, and captures value with respect to economic, social, cultural, or other forms. The model of this study is based on the questions of how network modalities resulting from inter-organizational relations affect the value creation of firms embedded in network (franchising). This model also shapes the boundaries of network characteristics that provide a better understanding of strategic issues and the inter-relations between strategies and business model...|$|E
