500|$|In {{an issue}} of Catalyst, the Catholic League responded to Rosenberg's article. They argued that Rosenberg was biased against Catholics, in that he was content with the series lampooning Catholicism, but not other religions. They wrote, [...] "all along <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> by Fox that none of our {{complaints}} were valid because none of the material was truly offensive. But {{now we have a}} Fox executive producer disingenuously giving away his hand by protesting why it should be okay to offend another group of people with the same material he initially said wasn't offensive to Catholics! And isn't it striking that Rosenberg is upset {{with the fact that the}} double standard—which now, for the first time works positively for Catholics—is a real problem. Never do we remember Rosenberg protesting the double standard that allows 'artists' to dump on Catholics while protecting most other segments of society from their assaults." [...] The League also complimented the members' participation, writing, [...] "It only goes to prove what can be done when Catholics get actively involved." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{people of}} Tamai were {{nominally}} Christians; but being so remote from ecclesiastical jurisdiction, their religion sat lightly upon them. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told,</b> even, that many heathenish games and dances still secretly lingered in their valley.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that it cost {{five dollars}} for a night's lodging at the hotel, but I entertained some vague notion that other and cheaper places offered. Perhaps I thought that a little village on the summit {{presented}} boarding houses.|$|R
2500|$|The twins {{entered the}} house of the Sun before [...] had {{completed}} his journey across the sky. [...] They saw a woman sitting against the western wall, and they saw two handsome young men, , Black Thunder, and , Blue Thunder. No one spoke to them. [...] "We are from ," [...] the twins said. [...] "Our mother is , Changing Woman, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that , the Sun, is our father. [...] We have followed the Holy Trail to seek his help." [...] The woman remained silent. [...] Black Thunder and Blue Thunder approached the twins, and wrapped four blankets around them. [...] They wrapped them in the blanket of red dawn, and the blanket of blue daylight, and the blanket of yellow evening, and the blanket of black darkness. [...] Then Black Thunder and Blue Thunder lifted the bundled twins and lay them high on a shelf.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the words}} of Rachel's parents: [...] "The act, while we may {{disagree}} with it, must be put into context. Rachel was partaking in a demonstration in Gaza opposing the War on Iraq. She was working with children who drew two pictures, one of the American flag, {{and one of the}} Israeli flag, for burning. Rachel said that she could not bring herself to burn the picture of the Israeli flag with the Star of David on it, but under such circumstances, in protest over a drive towards war and her government's foreign policy that was responsible for much of the devastation that she was witness to in Gaza, she felt it OK to burn the picture of her own flag. We have seen photographs of memorials held in Gaza after Rachel's death in which Palestinian children and adults honor our daughter by carrying a mock coffin draped with the American flag. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that our flag has never been treated so respectfully in Gaza in recent years. We believe Rachel brought a different face of the United States to the Palestinian people, a face of compassion. It is this image of Rachel with the American flag that we hope will be remembered most." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joel Fineman treats Sonnet 65 as epideictic. [...] He injects cynicism {{into the}} Fair Youth sonnets, {{claiming}} that the speaker does not believe fully in the immortalizing power of his verse; that it is merely literary and ultimately unreal. [...] He treats the [...] "still" [...] in line 14 as wordplay, reading it to mean [...] "dead, unmoving" [...] rather than [...] "perpetual, eternal". [...] There is some scholarly debate over this point, though. [...] Carl Atkins, for example, writes that the reader is [...] "not to take the couplet's 'unless' seriously. [...] We {{are not expected to}} have any doubt that the 'miracle' of making the beloved shine brightly in black ink has might. [...] Of course it does - <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> so before. [...] 'Who can hold back time?' the speaker asks. [...] 'No one, except me,' is the answer". Philip Martin tends toward agreement with Atkins, but refutes the suggestion that the reader is [...] "not to take the couplet's 'unless' seriously," [...] asserting instead that, [...] "the poem's ending is...deliberately and properly tentative". Murray Krieger agrees with Martin's point that, [...] "the end of 65 is stronger precisely because it is so tentative". [...] "The soft, almost non-consonantal 'how shall summer's honey breath hold out' [...] " [...] offers no resistance to Time's 'wrackful siege of batt'ring days'. Krieger suggests that while the sonnet does not resist Time through an assertion of strength, the concession of weakness by the placement of hope solely on a 'miracle,' offers an appeal against Time: [...] "May there not be a strength that arises precisely from the avoidance of it?".|$|E
5000|$|John Szarkowski: [...] "It {{seems to}} me that the subject of Bill Dane’s {{pictures}} is the discovery of lyric beauty in Oakland, or the discovery of surprise and delight in what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>was</b> a wasteland of boredom, the discovery of classical measure in the heart of God’s own junkyard, the discovery of a kind of optimism, still available at least to the eye." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{dawned on}} me when I was being fitted for my {{traveling}} uniform that I was about to represent my country. When that hit home {{it was a very}} proud moment in my life. Even though it was not a real representative tour it felt like it to me ... It wasn't until we all gathered at the airport that I got the real rush of excitement because there I was, this sixteen year-old kid about to take off and play cricket in a strange country, and from what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> it would <b>be</b> in conditions like <b>we</b> <b>had</b> never experienced before. We were all excited with the prospect of taking on the South Africans and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> about the wickets being bouncy and fast, similar to the WACA strip in Perth.|$|R
2500|$|Atherton added: [...] "The 'kid' in {{question}} was Mohammad Aamer, the young, good-looking and prodigiously-talented Pakistan bowler who had blown England away on the second morning at Lord's with a mesmeric spell of left-arm bowling and who now, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told,</b> <b>had</b> overstepped the front line twice for a few dollars more." ...|$|R

5000|$|She {{therefore}} {{had a real}} [...] "scoop"! Together {{with her}} we agreed that {{if she were to}} publish what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> by Gen Diya, the likelihood was that not only would the Nigerians deny the story, but this would also inevitably condemn Ken Saro-Wiwa and others and Generals Obasanjo and Yar’Adua to death.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not an}} easy {{matter to}} get Marble into the vehicle; but this was no sooner effected, than I trotted him off, down the road, taking the {{direction}} of the house where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> to seek Kitty Huguenin, old Mrs. Wetmore's grand-daughter, who would be waiting the appearance of the chaise, in order to return home.|$|R
60|$|Rectus was {{worked up}} about the Indians. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that, while {{a great many of}} the chiefs and braves imprisoned here were men known to have {{committed}} crimes, still there <b>were</b> others who <b>had</b> done nothing wrong, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> captured and brought here as prisoners, simply because, in this way, the government would have a good hold on their tribes.|$|R

60|$|We were hospitably entertained in Concord, New Hampshire, {{which we}} persisted in calling New Concord, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wont, to {{distinguish}} it from our native town, from which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that it <b>was</b> named and in part originally settled.

60|$|That <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{repeated}} the words correctly was {{shown by the}} opening of the door, and although no one could be seen, we four stepped inside hurriedly, after which the door was closed and barred, when the screen was thrown from a lantern which set on a rude table.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> by {{a person}} well acquainted with the country that it is {{sometimes}} necessary to travel fifty and sixty miles to get round one of these tremendous ravines. Considerable streams, like that of Godin's River, that run with a bold, free current, lose themselves in this plain; some of them end in swamps, others suddenly disappear, finding, no doubt, subterranean outlets.|$|E
60|$|The next dam {{was about}} fifteen miles farther north down the Allegash. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> in Bangor {{of a man}} who lived alone, a sort of hermit, at that dam, to take care of it, who spent his time tossing a bullet from one hand to the other, for want of employment. This sort of tit-for-tat {{intercourse}} between his two hands, bandying to and fro a leaden subject, seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> his symbol for society.|$|R

This date was fixed because the Sultan had announced that so soon as that festivity, which coincided with the conclusion of the harvest, was ended, he meant to deliver his attack on Mur.|$|R
2500|$|Of the jury, {{two members}} {{held out the}} first vote we took, but 10 of us were sure Ryan was guilty.

60|$|This is Mr. Hastings's own {{narrative}} {{of the effects of}} his own settlement.

60|$|Also <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that, in {{the case}} we are discussing, some Members of the Subject are in Class (1).

60|$|Perhaps {{the best}} thing of the little <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> about heaven, is that in it {{there will be no}} sex. If there were, it is {{doubtful}} whether it could remain heaven, as we define that state, since then must come desires, and jealousies, and selfishness, and disappointment; also births and deaths, since we cannot conceive sex-love without an object, or a beginning without an end. From all of which troubles we learn that the angels are relieved.|$|E

60|$|In {{five minutes}} or less we reached the foot of it, and, breathless and perspiring though we were, began to search amongst the reeds and bushes growing {{at the edge of}} the lake for the canoe of which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> by the Kalubi.

Presently Hans, who, {{following}} certain indications which caught his practised eye, had cast away to the left, held up his hand and whistled. We ran to him.|$|R
