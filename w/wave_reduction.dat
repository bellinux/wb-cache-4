Red colored l: l and orange colored 2 : l creatinine-picrate complexes readily formed along with orange colored 1 : 1 : 1 creatinine-picrate-hydroxide complexes. The red and orange colored complexes were easily identified by their corresponding absorption maxima near 490 nanometers and 390 nanometers, respectively. Alkaline picrate polarograms showed three well-defined nitro group <b>reduction</b> <b>waves</b> with approximate half-wave potentials of- 0. 60 volts,- 0. 77 volts, and- 0. 91 volts. Increased concentrations of hydroxide and/ or creatinine resulted in a decreased diffusion current for <b>reduction</b> <b>waves</b> l — 3 {{and the appearance of}} a fourth <b>reduction</b> <b>wave,</b> with an approximate half-wave potential of — 1. 24 volts.
