5|$|Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: A {{reporter}} at the Daily Planet, who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a very specific concept for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, <b>witty</b> <b>and</b> attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of her strong interaction with Christopher Reeve. Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Lesley Ann Warren, Deborah Raffin and Stockard Channing screen tested from March through May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.|$|E
5|$|The series {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with particular}} praise going towards its <b>witty</b> <b>and</b> satirical humor. Its second season holds {{a score of}} 84 out of 100 on Metacritic. However, despite such positive feedback, the show's debut only drew in 5.64 million viewers and continued to have extremely low ratings. Although many expressed skepticism that it would return, it was renewed for a second season. On May 13, 2010, ABC officially canceled the series due to low viewing figures. Two episodes were unaired in the United States, but are available to view on Netflix, Amazon Video on Demand, Xbox Live Marketplace, and iTunes.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} highlighted its comedic achievement. Game Informer said it {{is frequently}} hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released. IGN praised The Stick of Truth for its <b>witty</b> <b>and</b> intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while others said {{that as well as}} being consistently funny, the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire to offend. Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was more appealing to South Park fans; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes to be funny regardless of players' familiarity with the source material. IGN said that it is the game South Park fans have always wanted, but some reviewers said that without the South Park license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.|$|E

5|$|Stańczyk, {{the male}} figure {{depicted}} in the painting, was the court jester when Poland was {{at the height of}} its political, economic and cultural power during the era of the Renaissance in Poland, during the reign of King SigismundI the Old (reigned 1506–1548). He was a popular figure; besides his fame as a jester he has been described as an eloquent, <b>witty,</b> <b>and</b> intelligent man, using satire to comment on the nation's past, present, and future. Unlike jesters of other European courts, Stańczyk has always been considered as much more than a mere entertainer. Stańczyk's fame and legend were strong in his own time and enjoyed a resurgence in the 19th century, and he remains well-known to this day.|$|E
5|$|Though Manekshaw {{initially}} {{thought of}} pursuing {{a career as}} a medical doctor, he later joined the first intake of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) when it was established in 1932. Right from his days at IMA, he proved to be <b>witty</b> <b>and</b> humorous in nature. He was first attached to the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Scots, and later posted to the 4th Battalion of the 12th Frontier Force Regiment, commonly known as the 54th Sikhs. During action in World War II, he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. Following the partition of India in 1947, he was reassigned to the 16th Punjab Regiment. Manekshaw was seconded to a planning role during the 1947 Indo-Pakistani War and the Hyderabad crisis, and as a result he never commanded an infantry battalion. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier while serving at the Military Operations Directorate.|$|E

25|$|David Kronke, The Daily News of Los Angeles (April 22, 2001) — Nero Wolfe, alas, is {{undone by}} uneven {{performances}} {{and a sense}} that it's more <b>witty</b> <b>and</b> urbane than it really is. Hutton is too antic — {{he seems to be}} playing the sassy newsroom copy boy in a '30s B-picture — and his narration tries far too hard to push jokes that just aren't funny.
