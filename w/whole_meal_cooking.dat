40|$|AbstractConsumption {{of plant}} foods {{are known to}} reduce the risk of {{developing}} non-communicable diseases. However, many foods are not consumed in their natural state being processed and cooked before ingestion. The objective of this work was to analyze bioactive compounds (phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, proanthocyanins, and anthocyanins), as for individual phenolic acids present in the main ingredients of feijoada <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> from their uncooked state until the ensemble of the <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> and evaluate the impact of cooking on antioxidant activity. Analysis of Feijoada <b>whole</b> <b>meal,</b> composed by black beans, rice, kale, cassava flour, and orange showed that black beans are the main provider of phytochemicals and antioxidant activity, with the highest values for phenolics, tannins, and anthocyanins. For flavonoids, kale was the main source. Phenolic acids were mainly observed in black beans and were identified as mainly protocatechuic, chlorogenic, caffeic and ferulic acids. The antioxidant activity, as for the bioactive compounds analyzed, was progressively reduced during processing. For the other ingredients, on the other hand, no significant difference was observed after cooking. As expected, the hydrolyzable fractions showed significantly higher amounts of phenolics and antioxidant activity than soluble fractions. Altogether, feijoada <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> provides a variety of beneficial health compounds due to its rich composition of distinct food groups such as cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruits suggesting that the evaluation of meal as traditionally consumed can be important to identify phytochemicals in the dietary pattern of a population...|$|R
40|$|Free radical {{scavenging}} {{properties and}} phenolic content of extracts from a novel Chinese black-grained wheat were evaluated for comparison with selected wheat controls. Extracts of bran and <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> were compared for their scavenging activities against the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. The total phenolic content and phenolic acid levels were determined using colorimetric and {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) methods, respectively. There were significant differences in radical scavenging activities and phenolic contents among bran or <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> samples of Chinese black-grained wheat and selected wheat controls. Chinese black-grained wheat had the strongest scavenging activity and the highest total phenolic content among the wheat samples. The scavenging activity and total phenolic content of wheat bran was generally {{twice as high as}} that of <b>whole</b> <b>meal.</b> A positive correlation was found between DPPH radical scavenging activity and total phenolic content of bran (R = 0. 86) and <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> (R = 0. 96). In addition, HPLC analysis detected the presence of gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric, vanillic, gentisic, o-coumaric acid, and ferulic acids in wheat bran. Ferulic acid content was highest among the phenolic acids. Chinese black-grained wheat may be considered as a potential source of natural antioxidants given its high free radical scavenging ability and phenolic content. Additional research is needed to further investigate other phenolic compounds and evaluate their contribution to the antioxidant activity {{in order to understand the}} nutraceutical value of the novel black-grained wheat genotype. © 2005 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Protein concentrates, {{mainly of}} marine origin, {{were tested in}} {{nitrogen}} balance experiments with young rats. Commercial herring meals produced by several methods showed only small differences in protein utilization values. In most cases when differences in nitrogen balance values were found they were mainly due to corresponding differences in the protein digestibility. Press cake meals were slightly better utilized than <b>whole</b> <b>meals,</b> this difference was not accounted for by a corresponding difference in digestibility. Steam drying did not produce meals of better protein value than flame drying. No effect on the protein quality of herring meals was found of the preservatives sodium nitrite or formalin used during the storage of the raw material. Extraction of a <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> with light petrol did not improve the protein quality wheras extraction of another <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> with ethyl alcohol, ethyl ether and acetone improved the quality. Four foreign fish meals were of about the same protein value as Norwegian herring meal, whereas one was decidedly better. A sand-eel press cake meal was better than a <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> produced from this raw material. The <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> was of about the same protein quality as the herring meals. A flash dried whale meat meal was of about equal protein value as herring meals, but decidedly better than a slowly dried whale meal. A squid meal, a spray dried herring solubles meal and two fish off-fall meals were of decidedly poorer protein quality than the herring meals. Rennet casein was of about the same protein value as the herring meals, whereas the reference protein source, spray dried egg albumin, was better {{than all the other}} protein sources tested. Acetone dried samples of herring fillets and whole herring were of moderately better protein value than commercial herring meals.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of endogenous wheat grain fructans, oligosaccharides with possible health-promoting potential, during wheat <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> bread making was investigated, and several strategies {{to prevent their}} degradation were evaluated. Up to 78. 4 ± 5. 2 % of the fructans initially present in wheat <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> were degraded during bread making {{by the action of}} yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) invertase. The addition of sucrose to dough delayed fructan degradation but had no effect on final fructan concentrations. However, yeast growth conditions and yeast genotype did have a clear impact. A 3 -fold reduction of fructan degradation could be achieved when the commercial bread yeast strain was replaced by yeast strains with lower sucrose degradation activity. Finally, fructan degradation during bread making could be prevented completely by the use of a yeast strain lacking invertase. These results show that the nutritional profile of bread can be enhanced through appropriate yeast technology. status: publishe...|$|R

Gluten index of BGW flour (69. 74) was generally low compared to controls. Mid-line peak times determined using mixograph were significantly longer (p < 0. 05) for most controls (5. 41 - 6. 27 min) in comparison to BGW flour (< 3. 00 min). Dough stickiness (223. 76 g) of BGW was somewhat stronger than that of Klasic and CES flours.
