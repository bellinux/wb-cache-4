50|$|Advanced {{silicon etching}} (ASE) {{is a deep}} {{reactive}} ion etching (DRIE) technique to rapidly etch deep and high aspect ratio structures in silicon.ASE was pioneered by Surface Technology Systems Plc. (STS) in 1994 in the UK. STS has continued to develop this process with even greater etch rates while maintaining side <b>wall</b> <b>roughness</b> and selectivity.STS developed the switched process originally invented by Dr. Larmer at Bosch, Stuttgart.ASE consists in combining the fast etch rates achieved in an isotropic Si etch (usually making use of an SF6 plasma) with a deposition or passivation process (usually utilising a C4F8 plasma condensation process) by alternating the two process steps. This approach achieves the fastest etch rates while maintaining the ability to etch anisotropically, typically vertically in Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) applications.The ASE HRM is an evolution of the previous generations of ICP design, now incorporating a decoupled plasma source (patent pending). This decoupled source generates very high density plasma which is allowed to diffuse into a separate process chamber. Through careful chamber design, the excess ions that are detrimental to process control are reduced, leaving a uniform distribution of fluorine free-radicals at a higher density than that available from the conventional ICP sources. The higher fluorine free-radical density facilitates increased etch rates, typically over three times the etch rates achieved with the original Bosch process. Also, {{as a result of}} the reduction in the effect of localised depletion of these species, improved uniformity for many applications can be achieved.|$|E
50|$|Up until now, {{the focus}} has been mostly on the {{structure}} of the ice itself; the particles are almost an afterthought to the templating process but in fact, the particles can and do play a significant role during freeze-casting. It turns out that particle arrangement also changes {{as a function of the}} freezing conditions. For example, researchers have shown that freezing velocity has a marked effect on <b>wall</b> <b>roughness.</b> Faster freezing rates produce rougher walls since particles are given insufficient time to rearrange. This could be of use when developing permeable gas transfer membranes where tortuosity and roughness could impede gas flow. It also turns out that z- and r-crystals do not interact with ceramic particles in the same way. The z-crystals pack particles in the x-y plane while r-crystals pack particles primarily in the z-direction. R-crystals actually pack particles more efficiently than z-crystals and because of this, the area fraction of the particle-rich phase (1 - area fraction of ice crystals) changes as the crystal population shifts from a mixture of z- and r-crystals to only z-crystals. Starting from where ice crystals first begin to exclude particles, marking the beginning of the transition zone, we have a majority of r-crystals and a high value for the particle- rich phase fraction. We can assume that because the solidification speed is still rapid that the particles will not be packed efficiently. As the solidification rate slows down, however, the area fraction of the particle-rich phase drops indicating an increase in packing efficiency. At the same time, the competitive growth process is taking place, replacing r-crystals with z-crystals. At a certain point nearing the end of the transition zone, the particle-rich phase fraction rises sharply since z-crystals are less efficient at packing particles than r-crystals. The apex of this curve marks the point where only z-crystals are present (SSZ). During steady-state growth, after the maximum particle-rich phase fraction is reached, the efficiency of packing increases as steady-state is achieved. In 2011, researchers at Yale University set out to probe the actual spatial packing of particles within the walls. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) they characterized the particle size, shape and interparticle spacing of nominally 32 nm silica suspensions that had been freeze-cast at different speeds. Computer simulations indicated that for this system, the particles within the walls should not be touching but rather separated from one another by thin films of ice. Testing however revealed that the particles were, in fact, touching and more than that, they attained a packed morphology that cannot be explained by typical equilibrium densification processes.|$|E

A modified kinetic model {{which includes the}} frictional energy loss effects is used, and the boundary conditions for a bumpy wall with small friction are derived by ensuring the balance of momentum and energy.

40|$|International audienceRoughness {{effects on}} {{lubricant}} flows are investigated via 2 D lattice Boltzmann simulations. At a Reynolds numbers of order 1000 {{a transition from}} laminar to unsteady flow is observed by an increase of the roughness height from about 10 % to about 25 % of the channel width. At lower Reynolds numbers (where the flow is laminar in both channels), the transition is observed when increasing the <b>wall</b> <b>roughness</b> further. In other words, the critical Reynolds number for the transition from laminar toward unsteady flow decreases at higher <b>wall</b> <b>roughness.</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>roughness</b> may, therefore, qualitatively change the flow properties in confined geometry. Due to the ubiquitous presence of the <b>wall</b> <b>roughness,</b> the phenomenon is relevant in all cases where relatively high Reynolds number flow occur in strongly confined channels such as lubricant flow during the deformation of solid surfaces. For a fixed Reynolds number and channel geometry, time and spatial dependence of the velocity field and fluctuating quantities obey the scaling behavior as expected from {{the structure of the}} Navier-Stokes (NS) equations.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of spherical solid {{particles in}} a horizontal channel flow is analysed using numerical calculations {{based on the}} Lagrangian approach. Recent developments in modelling particle motion, wall collisions, <b>wall</b> <b>roughness,</b> and inter-particle collisions are accounted for. The <b>wall</b> <b>roughness</b> model relies {{on the assumption that}} the impact angle is composed of the particle trajectory angle and a stochastic component due to <b>wall</b> <b>roughness.</b> A stochastic approach is used to describe inter-particle collisions be-tween the considered particle and a fictitious collision partner which is a representative of the local particle phase. Then the collision probability is calculated on the basis of kinetic theory of gases, but accounting for the velocity correlation of colliding particles in turbulent flows. In order to allow an analysis of wall col-lisions and inter-particle collisions independent of the effect of particles on the flow, two-way coupling was neglected and flow and turbulence were prescribed.

Therefore, research of micro machining and smart material {{is an important step}} to develop the future manufacturing process. Layered manufacturing is one of the propective process of it. Research of powder deposition is a key of developing multi material micro fabrication. This research was implemented in four steps including materials preparation and characterization, design and manufacturing experiment apparatus, wall friction-flow ability test and design-manufacturing MMMF machine including the mechanical, electronics and software system. The research was initiated by study observation to find information about characteristic of fine powder and method of reducing the cohesiveness. By sieving process, powder was separated into 4 particle sizes including - 34, 34 - 60, 60 - 74, 74 - 104 micron. Particle shapes were observed using optical microscope. Wall friction test was performed to observe the effect of <b>wall</b> surface <b>roughness,</b> particle size and material powder on mass flow characteristic, by Jenike method. Flow ability test was carried out to yield the powder flow consistency by varying the particle sizes, models of screw feeder geometry, installing blender mechanism, reducing the particle cohesiveness and the wall friction test parameters (powder quantity in hopper and <b>wall</b> surface <b>roughness).</b> For these experiments, rotation of the screw feeder was fixed at 236 rpm. By plotting the experimental data, the optimum parameter of powder mass flow can be determined and it was tested by varying rotation of the screw feeder. The experimental results show that the mass flow characteristic is affected by <b>wall</b> surface <b>roughness</b> and particle size. Effect of powder quantity in hopper can be eliminated by installing blender mechanism; it can also reduce the compaction of the powder around nozzle orifice so that the mass flow can be increase. Mass flow characteristic is also affected by hopper angle, in which the optimal angle is achieved at 25. 67 o (by variation of 20. 6 o, 22. 62 o and 25. 67 o). Powder mass flow was caused dominantly by stimulating rotation of the screw feeder, it is not by helicoidal surface of the screw feeder. Powders trapped in helicoidal slot drive around particle caused by geometric interlocking. However, increasing screw feeder diameter is an effective way to increase the mass flow of smaller particle size (in this chase smaller than 60 micron). Preheating process gives the effective method to increase the mass flow, particularly for small particle (smaller than 60 micron). By considering these parameters, mass flow capacity can be arranged effectively by controlling rotation of the screw feeder. ...|$|R
