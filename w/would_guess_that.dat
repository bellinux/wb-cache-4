In her analysis of the course, she states, [...] "While the consensus of informed opinion, based on summaries of research findings, is that interventions similar to the est training have only modestly positive effects, I think that the existing research provides us with an underestimate of the effect of the est training. [...] This training represents a distillation {{of some of the most}} powerful techniques and central precepts for attitude and behavior change … I <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> the effects of the est training are substantial for a large proportion of people.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon the film's American {{release in}} 1967, both Philip French and Bosley Crowther were unimpressed {{with the film}} itself. Critic Philip French of The Observer stated: [...] "The {{calculated}} sadism of the film would be offensive {{were it not for}} the neutralising laughter aroused by the ludicrousness of the whole exercise. If one didn't know the actual provenance of the film, one <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> it was a private movie made by a group of rich European Western fans at a dude ranch... A Fistful of Dollars looks awful, has a flat dead soundtrack, and is totally devoid of human feeling." [...] Bosley Crowther of The New York Times treated the film not as pastiche, but as camp-parody, stating that nearly every Western cliche could be found in this [...] "egregiously synthetic but engrossingly morbid, violent film". He went on to patronise Eastwood's performance, stating: [...] "He is simply another fabrication of a personality, half cowboy and half gangster, going through the ritualistic postures and exercises of each... He is a morbid, amusing, campy fraud".|$|E
2500|$|Music {{channels}} {{owned by}} Viacom, including MTV and VH1, refused to air Jackson's videos or only aired them in minor rotation following the incident, stated to be [...] "a major catalyst" [...] in the album's performance. The Associated Press stated [...] "MTV's [...] "Spanking New" [...] videos in heavy rotation include a gyrating, cleavage-baring Beyoncé [...] and a bleeped-out Eminem with his group D12 [...] Yet the sedate new video from Janet Jackson—a fixture {{on the cable}} channel {{for almost two decades}} and its first [...] "MTV Icon"—has been absent from its playlist. Meanwhile, Jackson's name had barely been mentioned on MTV—unusual for a superstar whose previous projects have typically gotten heavy promotion." [...] Jackson's collaborator Jimmy Jam commented [...] "You can probably read between the lines with MTV." [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> if MTV wanted to play it, they would, but this is just speculation on my part. It certainly could raise a few questions if you have an investigative mind." [...] Jam also commented, [...] "It's tough to click with audiences when you don't get support from the major media outlets." [...] "It's interesting because the video was sent to Viacom" [...] – [...] "but somehow MTV didn't ?" [...] Roger Friedman of Fox News ridiculed the decision; stating [...] "One thing is certain, however: Janet is being scapegoated for her Super Bowl [...] "wardrobe malfunction." [...] Imagine that MTV, where illiteracy and lewdness thrive most of the day, would banish Janet's new video because of her [...] "reputation." [...] Who are they trying to kid? Of course, MTV is a corporate cousin of CBS, where the original snafu happened. But that's just a coincidence!" ...|$|E

Naught remained but to lay the matter before the Chevalier de Canaples. Already I had informed him of my fracas with St. Auban, and of the duel that was to be fought that night, and he, in his turn, had given me the details of his stormy interview with the Marquis, which had culminated in St. Auban's dismissal from Canaples. I had not hitherto deemed it necessary to alarm him with the news imparted to me by Malpertuis, imagining that did I inform Mademoiselle that would suffice.|$|E

There can be no doubt that, if we open a free port here, it will do great damage to them, and divert a large portion of the eastern trade here; being so much more handy for all the country craft trading with Siam and China, besides having the advantage of avoiding the heavy dues demanded by the Dutch." ...|$|E

60|$|So Ithiel {{led her to}} the cistern, {{and from}} the cistern up a flight of steps to a little vaulted chamber, into which they entered through a stone trap-door, made of the same {{substance}} as the paving of the chamber, so that, when it was closed, none <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> there was a passage beneath. From this old store-room, for such it doubtless was, ran more steps, ending, to all appearance, in a blank wall. Coming to it, Ithiel thrust a piece of flat iron, a foot or more in length, into a crack in this wall, lifted some stone latch within, and pushed, whereon a block of masonry of something more than the height and width of a man, and quite a yard in thickness, swung outwards. Nehushta passed through the aperture, followed by Ithiel.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is a kind}} of rejoicing naïveté in all of James’s {{references}} to the Gowrie affair, which seems to me hardly consistent with his disbelief in his own prowess on that occasion. If one may conjecture, one <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> the Privy Council and the four preachers managed to persuade themselves, Sprot being the liar whom we know, that he lied when he called his Logan papers forgeries. The real facts may have been concealed from the King. Mr. Gunton, the Librarian at Hatfield, informs me that, had he not seen Letter IV (which he is sure was written by Sprot), he does not think he should have suspected the genuineness of Letters II and III, after comparing them with the undoubted letters of Logan in the Cecil manuscripts. The Government and the four preachers, with such documents in their hands, documents still apt to delude, may easily have brought themselves to disbelieve Sprot’s assertion that they were all forgeries. Let us hope that they did! ...|$|E

He thought it probable that they <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> such was his intention, and would have given a description of him at the recruiting offices. It was for this reason that he determined to live {{as long as he could}} upon his money before trying to enlist, as if some time elapsed he would be less likely to be recognized as answering the description that might be given by Captain Clinton than if he made the attempt at once. From Vauxhall he often crossed to West minster, and soon struck up an acquaintance with some of the recruiting sergeants.|$|E
