25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E
500|$|The {{black-and-white}} {{music video}} was noted to have predominantly dark, brooding, hazy, mysterious and sun-stroked imagery, and portrays Del Rey evoking her distinguished personality. Using a minimalist and melancholy approach, it features several artistic shots of California scenery and cameo appearances {{by two men}} portrayed as bad boy archetypes. Del Rey engages in 1960s apparition, numerous swaying and twirling actions, and sings <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> throughout the music video. CBS Corporation writer Courtney E. Smith described the clip as [...] "the yin and yang of youthful hope, the kind Hollywood lives by attracting, and cynical industry, the kind Hollywood thrives on but hides".|$|E
500|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, a {{group of}} identically dressed masked men, each handcuffed to a briefcase, are {{attacked}} in a subway. They are all killed, with one also having his hand cut off, and his briefcase taken. The attacker opens the briefcase and removes the box of diamonds it contains. Investigating the attack, Agent Phil Coulson discovers that the briefcases were randomly assigned, so no one knew which contained the diamonds, and that the attacker carried it out <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> Civilian recruit and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee Skye believes that extrasensory perception may be involved, but Coulson and Agent Melinda May doubt that such abilities exist. Using social media, the team discovers that the thief, who has been behind several other similar crimes, is former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Akela Amador. Coulson had trained Amador, and until now had believed her dead.|$|E

5000|$|<b>With</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{constantly}} <b>closed</b> {{and dressed}} in a revealing sari, Milam was a mysterious Shikabane who is graceful and terrifying at the same time, being very well mannered like the [...] "Kumari" [...] she was treated back in her cult.|$|R
500|$|After {{the success}} of Fanaa, Kajol worked {{intermittently}} {{through the rest of}} the decade. She next starred in her husband's directorial debut, the drama U Me Aur Hum (2008) as Piya, a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Devgn described Kajol's participation in the project by saying, [...] "She is always thorough with the nitty-gritties of her character before she begins shooting. Since the screenplay work happened at home, Kajol was present for all the sittings and even gave her inputs." [...] Upon release, the film performed moderately well at the box office and earned positive critical reviews for her performance. Udita Jhunjhunwala noted, [...] "Kajol completely comes into her own here as an ailing woman unaware of her vulnerability and delicate situation. She is superb." [...] Raja Sen added, [...] " [...] can span through happy-breezy <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> and so the first half doesn't even pose her a challenge, but when Alzheimer's strikes Piya and she begins to forget all that matters in her life, Kajol raises the bar strikingly high." [...] The following year, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Weeping Angels are not statue props {{but young}} women wearing masks, costumes, and paint that took {{two to three}} hours to apply. Director Adam Smith called them [...] "an {{absolute}} nightmare to film with" [...] because {{it took a long time}} for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. In the climactic scene Gillan had to walk <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> which she said was difficult and challenging as the ground was uneven and muddy. She stated that [...] "it was the most scary thing" [...] when she had to trip over a step and fall, even though she was aware of the crash mat. As she was not able to express herself through her eyes, Gillan had to make herself more animated to convey emotion. The scene in which the Doctor, Amy and River are horizontal in mid-air when the gravity field fails on the Byzantium was achieved by using wires and powerful wind machines. The blue in Amy's bedroom was an idea of Adam Smith to show that it was inspired by the TARDIS from Amy's encounter with the Doctor when she was young.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Earth Intruders" [...] was {{directed}} by Michel Ocelot. It features Björk's face floating in the background, first upside down, then upright, singing <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> In the foreground, {{a large group of}} silhouetted tribal warriors dance in time to the music. The video features psychedelic colours and patterns imposed on an earthy backdrop. The video ends with Björk's face slowly fading into the middle of a glade, her eyes being opened just as she sings the last lyric. Ocelot stated that Björk had originally wanted Kirikou to be featured as a 20-year-old in the video. It was accomplished within strict time constraints through a combination of live-action, silhouette animation, 3D computer graphics, traditional animation, cut-outs and other special effects. [...] "Kirikou" [...] was danced by Legrand Bemba-Debert in a costume made, based on Ocelot's ideas, by paper sculptor Anne-Lise Kœhler. The full video was made available in the iTunes Store on April 24, 2007. It was nominated for the 2007 Q Award for Best Video.|$|E
60|$|All this reacted on Evelyn's nerves, and one hot {{afternoon}} she felt ready to welcome any change {{as she sat}} in a shaded room. Her hands were wet with perspiration, the flies that buzzed about her face exasperated her, and she found the musky smell that filled the house intolerable. Señora Herrero lay in a big cane chair, looking strangely bulky and shapeless in her tight black dress, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> half <b>closed</b> and no sign of intelligence in her heavily powdered face. Evelyn longed to wake her and make her talk.|$|R
5000|$|When Anasuya was {{completing}} {{her second}} year, she once sat under a pomegranate tree in [...] "padmasana" [...] (Lotus Posture) and attained a transcendental meditation state, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> half <b>closed.</b> Every one mistook it as {{a fit of}} epilepsy and not noticing the 'yogasana' she had assumed. She returned to her normal consciousness in an hour. On yet another occasion, she was seen sitting in a strange posture <b>with</b> <b>her</b> breath suspended and the eyes turned completely inside. When someone asked her later as to what she was doing, she replied she was in 'Shambhavi Mudra'.` ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{wheel of}} Regent's Park was coming full circle, {{and the sun}} was up behind the houses, but still no sound of traffic stirred. She stopped before a flower-bed where was some heliotrope, and took a long, luxurious sniff: She could not resist {{plucking}} a sprig, too, and holding it to her nose. A sudden want of love had run through every nerve and fibre of her; she shivered, standing there <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> half <b>closed,</b> above the pale violet blossom. Then, noting by her wrist-watch that it was four o'clock, she hurried on, to get to her bed, for she would have to be on duty again at noon. Oh! the war! She was tired! If only it were over, and one could live!...|$|R

60|$|During the afternoon, {{the doctors}} ordered that Mrs. Sherwin {{should not be}} allowed to see her husband or her child again, without their permission. There was little need of taking such a {{precaution}} to preserve the tranquillity of her last moments. As the day began to decline, she sank again into insensibility: her life was just not death, and that was all. She lingered on in this quiet way, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> peacefully <b>closed,</b> and <b>her</b> breathing so gentle as to be quite inaudible, until late in the evening. Just as it grew quite dark, and the candle was lit in the sick room, the servant who was helping to watch by her, drew aside the curtain to look at her mistress; and saw that, though <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were still <b>closed,</b> she was smiling. The girl turned round, and beckoned to the nurse to come to the bedside. When they lifted the curtains again to look at her, she was dead.|$|R
6000|$|At {{moments like}} these {{there is no}} doubt--and psychologists {{actually}} assert it--that there is in us a sense which has {{absolutely nothing to do}} with the other five: it is not that we see, it is not that we hear or touch, yet we seem to do all three at once. Marguerite sat there <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> apparently <b>closed.</b> Sir Andrew was immediately behind her, and on her right was the table with the five-armed candelabra upon it. Before her mental vision there was absolutely nothing but Armand's face. Armand, whose life was in the most imminent danger, and who seemed to be looking at her from a background upon which were dimly painted the seething crowd of Paris, the bare walls of the Tribunal of Public Safety, with Foucquier-Tinville, the Public Prosecutor, demanding Armand's life in the name of the people of France, and the lurid guillotine with its stained knife waiting for another victim [...] . Armand! [...] .|$|R
5000|$|Some {{students}} {{believe that}} {{one way to find}} one's true love is to sit under Benny and kiss him or <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>closed</b> <b>eyes.</b> If Benny's wings flap, then the love is true; if no flapping occurs, then the love is not meant to be. [...] Another myth suggests that the severed heads of each of the five Ball Brothers rest in individual urns {{on the top of the}} respective pillar; however, all five brothers are buried at Beech Grove Cemetery in Muncie. Perhaps the most notable legend states that a female student is not officially a coed until she is kissed by a male student beneath the statue.|$|R

5000|$|In episode 9, Cox {{became a}} {{contender}} again after photographer Simon Upton stated, [...] "I was really impressed with Montana. She {{is the one}} to beat in this competition". In episode 10, Cox gained her third first call-out for her vintage lingerie photo shoot. In episode 11, Cox won the go-see challenge after designer Fernando Frisoni stated, [...] "I would book <b>her</b> <b>with</b> my <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> I'd consider <b>her</b> opening my show". In the same episode, {{she was the first}} girl through to the finale at the Sydney Opera House. In episode 12, the final three flew to Dubai, United Arab Emirates where they participated in two high-fashion photo shoots. Photographer Georges Antoni stated that Cox was his favourite after both shoots.|$|R
500|$|The CD single {{contains}} both [...] "Baby Don't Cry" [...] and [...] "Nobody", plus shortened {{versions of}} the tracks. These versions were used for various Japanese television commercials. The CD artwork features a close-up facial shot of Amuro, whilst the DVD single has a close up <b>with</b> <b>her</b> face and <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> The DVD single includes the music video to [...] "Baby Don't Cry". Both formats features an extra lyric booklet, printed on plain white paper. Musically, [...] "Baby Don't Cry" [...] is a pop ballad, influenced by R and J-pop music. Japanese music editor Random J compared the composition to the works of American recording artist, Janet Jackson. CD Journal staff member's felt the song's composition was [...] "simplistic", and described the lyrical content as [...] "painful".|$|R
40|$|A 43 -year-old woman {{presented}} {{after a week}} {{of upper}} respiratory tract infection symptoms. She had been evaluated the week prior and treated <b>with</b> cephalexin. Since <b>her</b> initial evaluation she had complained of continued dry mouth, sore throat, diplopia, and episodes of slurred speech. On evaluation in a California emergency department, the patient complained of diplopia and trouble swallowing. She was noted to be “sleepy”, with drooping eyelids, but she was able to answer all questions appropriately and did not appear intoxicated. On careful questioning, the patient admitted to being an injection drug abuser. Past medical history was non-contributory. She used no medications and denied any surgical history. She had no history of drug allergies and family history was negative. Physical exam demonstrated a women sitting on a gurney <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> partially <b>closed.</b> She answered all questions without any sign of confusion. Airway was open, but the patient had to repeatedly clear her throat. Pulse was 105, BP 125 / 90 lying and 93 / 70 standing, and respiratory rate was 18. Temperature was 37. 1 and oxygen saturation was 98 % on room air. The patient’s pupils were equal at 7 mm and reacted to light. Bilateral ptosis was noted. Her soft palate was symmetrical. A mild facial asymmetry. Upper extremity strength was noted to be 4 +/ 5, while lower extremities were 5 / 5. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrically decreased...|$|R
60|$|Roger {{followed}} Malinche {{into her}} room. Amenche was lying, without a vestige of color on her face, and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> and her breathing so faint that Roger, {{as he looked}} at her, thought that she was dead.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{started on}} his errand, and soon {{came back with}} the water, such as it was. Mrs. Yeobright {{attempted}} to drink, but it was so warm as to give her nausea, and she threw it away. Afterwards she still remained sitting, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why then,' said Mrs Boffin, {{speaking}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> and {{her left}} hand thoughtfully touching her brow, 'then, there they are!

60|$|Lucy {{did as she}} was bidden {{and pulled}} the blanket over her. The place was gloomy and still. She {{heard the sound of}} mustangs' teeth on grass, and the soft footfalls of the men. Presently these sounds ceased. A cold wind blew over her face and rustled in the sage near her. Gradually the chill passed away, and a {{stealing}} warmth took its place. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> grew tired. What had happened to <b>her?</b> <b>With</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> she thought it was all a dream. Then the feeling of the hard saddle as a pillow under her head told her she was indeed far from her comfortable little room. What would poor Aunt Jane do in the morning when she discovered who was missing? What would Holley do? When would Bostil return? It might be soon and it might be days. And Slone--Lucy felt sorriest for him. For he loved her best. She thrilled at thought of Slone on that grand horse--on <b>her</b> Wildfire. And <b>with</b> <b>her</b> mind running on and on, seemingly making sleep impossible, the thoughts at last became dreams. Lucy awakened at dawn. One hand ached with cold, for it had been outside the blanket. Her hard bed had cramped her muscles. She heard the crackling of fire and smelled cedar smoke. In the gray of morning she saw the Creeches round a camp-fire.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>her</b> head moved <b>with</b> a mournful {{but decided}} dissent.|$|R

60|$|As soon as {{the crowd}} had turned away, Dr. Arrowsmith {{made his way to}} the point where Ruth had been standing. Somewhat to his {{surprise}} he found her still on her feet.

60|$|When half-past eleven came, she {{was seated}} in a large easy chair over the drawing-room fire, with a little table by her side, on which a novel was lying.
