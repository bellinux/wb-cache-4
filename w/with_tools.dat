During his childhood, he played <b>with</b> <b>tools</b> in his father's {{hardware}} store and learned model railroading. He was a precocious child, skipping two grades at high school, and he matriculated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) aged 16. Although his interest in computers began at Vineland High School, his first practical experience of computing came at MIT; there he developed a habit of working late at night when more computer time was available.|$|E

5|$|Since 1957, {{there have}} been five Gold Glove batteries. The pitcher and catcher, collectively known as the battery, {{are the only two}} players on the field {{involved}} in every pitch. In particular, the pitcher and catcher control the running game <b>with</b> <b>tools</b> such as pickoffs or the strength of the catcher's throwing arm. The first pitcher and catcher on the same team to win Gold Gloves in the same year were Jim Kaat and Earl Battey, with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. Only two pairs of batterymates have won Gold Gloves together more than once: Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers won with the Texas Rangers in 2000, and again with the Detroit Tigers in 2004 and 2006. Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright matched the feat, winning in both 2009 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|The usual grave for a thrall was {{probably}} {{not much more than}} a hole in the ground. He {{was probably}} buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often <b>with</b> <b>tools</b> for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg Ship burial, which was for a woman (probably a queen or a priestess) who lived in the 9th century.|$|E

They will pluck the hidden treasure from the bowels of the earth, enable us to soar in the air, or explore the depths of the water. They will weave a network of communication over our island continent, dot it with the homes of a happy people, and minister to our wants in providing not only the necessities and comforts of life, but the most refined luxuries that are needed to satisfy the novel and exacting wants which arise every day, as the standard of intellectual and technical cultivation is raised and extended among us...|$|E
