5|$|According {{to a story}} {{related by}} Niketas Choniates, in 1189 the gate was walled off by Emperor Isaac II Angelos, because {{according}} to a prophecy, it was this gate that Western Emperor Frederick Barbarossa <b>would</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> city through. It was re-opened in 1346, but closed again before the siege of 1453 and remained closed until 1886, leading to its early Ottoman name, Kapalı Kapı ("Closed Gate").|$|E

5|$|The Misericorde Sisters {{were not}} well liked by the Montreal community. Throughout {{the early years}} of the Hospice de Sainte-Pélagie and the Institute, the {{locations}} in which Jetté and the Sisters worked were kept secret, in order to protect the single mothers from public hostility towards prostitutes and unwed mothers.

5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union <b>would</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> war against Germany sooner or later. He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 Bottomley entered {{parliament}} as Liberal Party {{member for}} Hackney South. In {{the same year}} he founded the popular magazine John Bull, which became a platform for Bottomley's trenchant populist views. Financial extravagance and mismanagement continued to blight his career, and in 1912 he had to resign from parliament after being declared bankrupt. The outbreak of war in 1914 revived his fortunes; as a journalist and orator Bottomley became a leading propagandist for the war effort, addressing well over 300 public meetings. His influence was such that it was widely expected that he <b>would</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> War Cabinet, although he received no such offer.|$|E
5|$|Protestants in Franche-Comté {{had been}} {{expelled}} from the region, and had met in Montbéliard and Switzerland to organise the capture of Besançon. Desiring assistance, they enlisted some Swiss and Montbéliards to fight with them. Originally, the soldiers were incredibly well organised, with 300 soldiers coming from Switzerland and 150 coming from Montbéliard. No less than 6,000 men would be provided by the Holy Roman Empire if the city fell. The people of Besançon were on their guard, and the assault was carefully designed to be unexpected. According to their plans, the soldiers from Neuchâtel would enter Besançon through the Notre-Dame, and those from Montbéliard <b>would</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> city through the Battant.|$|E

5|$|The German {{government}} {{had been hoping}} that the Ottomans <b>would</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> war to support them but the government in Istanbul was undecided. The Germanophile Ottoman War Minister, Enver Pasha, began conspiring with the German ambassador to bring the empire into the war. Attempts to secure widespread support in the government failed, so Enver decided conflict {{would have to be}} instigated. With the help of the Ottoman naval minister and German Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, Enver arranged for the Ottoman fleet to go out to sea on 29 October supposedly to perform maneuvers. They were to provoke Russian vessels into opening fire and then accuse them of inciting war. Instead, Souchon raided the Russian coast in a flagrant display of hostility, causing little lasting damage but enraging the Russians.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} preseason predictions {{were made}} {{the day after}} the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, before final decisions by college players about declaring for the 2013 NBA Draft and before many high-school players signed a National Letter of Intent about their 2013 matriculation. With the expectation that most of the talented players from the previous season (Burke, Robinson, Hardaway and McGary) <b>would</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> draft, Michigan was not projected as a ranked team by ESPN. USA Today projected that if one of the four possible 2013 NBA draft entrants returned, Michigan would be ranked 24th; if all returned, Michigan would be the preseason #1.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} was designed, as was its predecessor at Watten, to receive, process and launch V-2 rockets {{at a high}} rate. Trains carrying V-2s <b>would</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> heart of the complex through the Ida rail tunnel, {{where they would be}} unloaded. A large number of V-2s could be stored in the side tunnels; LOX would also be produced on-site ready for use. When the time came, the rockets would be moved into the octagonal preparation chamber where they would be lifted to a vertical position for fuelling and arming. From there they would be transported on motorised launch carriages, still in a vertical position, through the Gustav and Gretchen passageways. The launch pads were located {{at the end of the}} track on the floor of the quarry, from where the missiles would be fired.|$|E
