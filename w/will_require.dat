After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making packs lighter, smaller, and cheaper.|$|E

A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E

Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder devices have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches {{and the introduction of}} exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers <b>will</b> <b>require</b> international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.|$|E
