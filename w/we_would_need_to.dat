2500|$|Minneapolis Mayor R. T. Rybak (DFL) {{said that}} future needs and policy {{considerations}} shouldn't be {{ignored in the}} rush to build a replacement and sought a new bridge able to handle increased traffic as well as mass transit. Meetings between state transportation officials (Mn/DOT), Rybak, State Transportation Commissioner Carol Molnau, and Governor Tim Pawlenty yielded a desire to build a 10 lane bridge that will last 100 years, with the possibility of bus rapid transit or light rail lines. Rybak said, [...] "Transit needs to play some role in this or otherwise <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> build a much wider bridge in the future." [...] At a public forum in Roseville, hundreds of Twin Cities residents participated in a discussion about the bridge design. The overriding theme of the crowd was a desire to plan for the bridge's use of mass transit. Commissioner Molnau, in conjunction with Metropolitan Council Chairman Peter Bell, recommended that light rail not be incorporated in the new bridge design. [...] But Pawlenty, responding to constituents and the mayor, directed Mn/DOT to design the bridge to be light rail-ready. He said the estimated additional $20 to $35 million would be paid for by the state.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, {{if we were}} {{to assume}} that all of the {{aforementioned}} were not true, and that one cortical cell could indeed record one specific detail, then {{based on the fact that}} cells die <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have the same information contained in a back-up cell (similar to how you back up files on your computer).

5000|$|By {{regarding}} each Arrow security {{price as}} a probability, {{we see that}} the portfolio price P(0) is the expected value of C under the risk-neutral probabilities. If the interest rate R were not zero, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> discount the expected value appropriately to get the price. In particular, the portfolio consisting of each Arrow security now has a present value of , so the risk-neutral probability of state i becomes [...] times the price of each Arrow security Ai, or its forward price.|$|E
50|$|However, {{for early}} exercise, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know the option value at the {{intermediate}} times between the simulation start {{time and the}} option expiry time.

30|$|To follow Kraepelin’s example, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> the courage, while {{starting}} with clinically defined populations {{to allow the}} longitudinal data to guide diagnostic definitions, {{rather than the other}} way around. <b>We</b> also <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> slow down the process, and obtain data for longer periods, rather than weeks or months, and from much larger groups of patients and controls, before drawing meaningful conclusions. New statistical methods are also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> make sense of the large amount of data collected (Torous et al. 2015). We also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be thoughtful about how we employ these technologies. The foundation of health is trust, and thus there must be more emphasis on transparency and data security.
