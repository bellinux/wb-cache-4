25|$|According to John K. Whitmore of the Cornell University, Lê Văn Hưu and Ngô Sĩ Liên harshly criticized Đỗ Anh Vũ because firstly they {{evaluated}} {{the events in}} {{the point of view of}} outsiders while Đỗ Anh Vũ acted as an insider of the royal court, and secondly these historians only analysed the accounts written by the outsiders of the imperial palace <b>when</b> <b>Đỗ</b> Anh Vũ was active inside, which meant the story might be distorted from the fact. Moreover, Lê Văn Hưu and Ngô Sĩ Liên belonged to another dynasties, hence they could hardly praise the achievements of a different dynasty with its officials like the Lý Dynasty with its Đỗ Anh Vũ.|$|E

25|$|As {{noted by}} Tinley (1969), typical {{habitats}} of Kirk's dik-dik consist of thicket mosaics characterized by well-developed shrub layers and scant short grass cover. Dik-diks live in pairs on territories of 2–86 acres, depending on cover and resources. If no unfavorable events occur {{a pair of}} Kirk's dik-dik may reside within the same territory for life. Males are the main defenders of territories, as females are unable to maintain territories themselves. (Kingdon 1982) According to MacDonald (1985), territorial conflicts over quality habitat are not frequent, however, <b>when</b> <b>do</b> they occur, males charge one another, stopping just short of physical contact, before repeating the process by running from a longer distance. Furthermore, the encounter ends when one male surrenders, which results in both males scratching at the ground, urinating, and defecating".|$|E

2500|$|During the regency of the Empress Mother Lê thị {{when the}} young emperor only ruled in name, Đỗ Anh Vũ was the {{favorite}} official of the Empress Mother and thus became the most powerful figure in the royal court who held both military and civil matters of the country. In 1147 {{he went to a}} mission of inspecting the system of mandarins and domestic records in Phú Lương. According to Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, Đỗ Anh Vũ sent his wife to act as servant of the Empress Mother and profited his wife's position to secretly establish an intimate relation with the Empress Mother, as a result he got the favouritism of the Empress Mother Lê thị. Holding the most important position in the royal court, Đỗ Anh Vũ became arrogant and despised other officials, hence they began to form a group to topple Đỗ Anh Vũ from power. The conspirators were several prominent figures in the royal court such as military commanders Vũ Đái, Lương Thượng Cá, Đồng Lợi, mandarins Đỗ Ất, Dương Tự Minh and {{members of the royal family}} Prince Trí Minh, Marquis Bảo Ninh. The careful plan of Vũ Đái's group was partly successful <b>when</b> <b>Đỗ</b> Anh Vũ was imprisoned by the soldiers loyal to the group. But with the support of the Empress Mother, Đỗ Anh Vũ was able to bribe some members of the group, therefore he was only tried by the emperor instead of being immediately killed as the initial plan. Following the order of Lý Anh Tông, Đỗ Anh Vũ was deprived of all titles and demoted to farmer for the dynasty (cảo điền nhi). Again with the backing of the Empress Mother Lê thị, Đỗ Anh Vũ was pardonned several times and rapidly restored his position in the royal court and finally took the position of Chancellor Regent (Thái úy phụ chính) with even more power than before.|$|E
