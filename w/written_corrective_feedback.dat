Teacher gets to decide their very own <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback.</b> There are many types of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> that can be used in the classroom. They are direct <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback,</b> indirect, and metalinguistic. The paper presents the effect of using indirect <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> to improve students’ writing accuracy. The paper is intended to find the best <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> strategy in the classroom. The study is conducted to 35 low-proficiency ESL students. The writing pretest and posttest are used to measure students’ writing accuracy. The researcher uses a t-test to analyze the data. The result is satisfying. 35 students have shown statistically significant progress in their writing accuracy. The posttest result has outscored the pretest score. Furthermore, it is also shown that indirect <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> also elicits students’ autonomous learning.

However, the writing skills could be mastered if teachers give good <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> to the students. This study investigated a teacher’s <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in responding to students’ English written compositions in a private school in Subang Jaya, Selangor. It examines a teacher’s beliefs and practices towards <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback.</b> The theoretical framework that underlined this study is the ‘noticing hypothesis’ where teacher’s feedback is intended to trigger noticing and it is important in language learning. A teacher participated in this study and 58 Year Four students contributed in this study through their written compositions. This study is primarily a qualitative research involving frequency counts of the types of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> used by the teacher in the students’ compositions and qualitative analysis which is based on the questionnaire on the teacher’s beliefs and practices in giving <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback.</b> The study found that the teacher used direct, metalinguistic and unfocused <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in her student’s compositions. Based on the teacher’s questionnaire and students’ compositions, it was found that most of the teacher’s beliefs and practices aligned. The mismatches on the teacher’s beliefs and her practices in giving <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> were marginal. The implications of the findings suggested the teacher to take note of her <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> because it is crucial to be noted by language teachers in order to give good <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in students’ compositions. Thus, effective <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> from the language teachers would help the students’ to master the writing skill...|$|E

The research was conducted to see if the Metalinguistic feedback is more effective for the High English Proficiency students or the Low English Proficiency students. The study was on controlled marking. Therefore, the study only focused on correcting students’ usage of the Simple Past Tense. The research problems were 1) How effective was the <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> Metalinguistic <b>Feedback</b> among Low English Proficiency students? 2) How effective was the <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> Metalinguistic <b>feedback</b> among the High English Proficiency students? 3) The correlation between students opinion of the metalinguistic feedback and their improvement in writing. Pre-Test, Post Test 1 and Post Test 2 were carried out among 30 High English proficiency students and 30 Low English Proficiency students. T-Test was carried out to see effectiveness in the metalinguistic feedback. For the third research objective, Pearson Correlation test was carried out to see the correlation between students’ opinion of the <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> Metalinguistic <b>feedback</b> and their improvement in writing. The result of the study seem to show that the Low English Proficiency students seem to benefit more from the <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> Metalinguistic <b>feedback</b> and they are more keen to see metalinguistic feedback as compared to the High English proficiency group.

It was also aimed to reveal the students’ attitude to the use of oral <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback.</b> The study employed a qualitative case study design. The data were gathered from two main sources, which were classroom observation and interview. This study revealed three findings. Firstly, there was a difference in number of types of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> used for low, mid and high proficiency students. Of the eight types of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> proposed by Lyster and Ranta (1997), Panova and Lyster (2002), and Ellis (2009), all of them were used to correct the error in low level. Meanwhile, there were only seven types of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> used in mid level, and five types of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> used in high level. Secondly, each types of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> had a different effect on the uptake in each level. In low level, the types of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> which provided the students with the corrected form of their error (input providing feedback), such as recast and explicit correction, resulted in more number of uptake compared to the types of feedback which prompted the students to do self-correction (output prompting feedback), such as metalinguistic feedback, repetition, and paralinguistic signal. On the other hand, in mid and high levels, output prompting feedback resulted in more number of uptake rather than input providing feedback. Third, most of the students in three proficiency levels had positive attitude to the implementation of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback.</b> Unfortunately, some of low level students felt embrrassed and afraid of making mistakes after they got the correction from the teacher. Based on the findings above, this study recommends the teacher apply the <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> by suiting them with the students’ proficiency levels.

40|$|AbstractIn {{learning}} a foreign language, making error is an indispensible part of learning process. Finely tuned and pertinent <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> {{is an important}} tool for teachers to prevent their learners’ errors from getting fossilized and help them progress along their interlanguage continuum. There are different factors contributing to efficacy of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> among which is taking into consideration proficiency level of learners in choosing <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> techniques. In this study the researcher used a database of 360 <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> moves which two EFL teachers provided to their learners at three levels of proficiency. Eight types of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> were identified and their distribution in relation to proficiency levels of learners was determined. The results revealed that recast was {{the most frequently used}} type of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> by the teachers at all three levels of proficiency. However, as the learners became more proficient the teachers reduced recasts and incorporated other self correction techniques...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in {{the realm}} of ESL/EFL has gained more {{attention}} from researchers in the last 10 years, and the latest innovation in the practice is the integration of video in the delivery of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> (Stannard, 2008). However, research on video-based <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> (VWCF) in EFL/ESL writing instructions so far has only revealed its qualitative strengths (Stannard, 2008; Mathisen, 2012) —that is, in terms of students’ responses towards its application, a gap that the current paper intends to address. The present study reported in this paper is a classroom action research (CAR) aiming at increasing the writing accuracy of a group of students of a state university in Bali, Indonesia through the integration of video in the corrective feedback practice. The writing instruction in the study is carried out in a blended learning fashion combining the traditional learning mode with an email-based correspondence between the tutor and the students. The findings seem to indicate that video-taped orally-delivered direct corrective feedback has a relatively small impact on student accuracy improvement percentage. However, the integration of video in the feedback provision appears to have a potential in terms of increasing students’ motivation in their learning of writing. The research results can provide some interesting insight to teachers who want to implement video-based feedback and future research on this type of feedback.

The {{study was conducted in}} a six-week period with 43 Indonesian university student participants majoring IT. The results of the pre- and post-writing tests showed that 1) the writing accuracy improvement of the students receiving direct WCF was statistically significant while the writing accuracy improvement of the students given the indirect WCF treatment was not; 2) the accuracy improvement in the untreatable error rate of the direct WCF group was the most significant compared to all types of error in both WFC student groups. The study concludes that considering the students 2 ̆ 7 current English proficiency level and learning setting with limited English exposure, <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback,</b> especially the direct one, helps the university students improve their writing accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} whether direct focused corrective feedback and direct unfocused corrective feedback caused any differential {{effects on the}} accurate use of English articles by EFL learners across two different proficiency levels (low and high). The participants were divided into low and high proficiency levels by administering a TOEFL test. Then, sixty learners in each proficiency level formed two experimental groups and one control group, 20 learners in each group. One experimental group received focused <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> and the other experimental group received unfocused <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback.</b> The statistical analysis indicated that focused group did better than both unfocused and control groups in terms of accurate use of English articles in both proficiency levels. Therefore, these results suggested that unfocused corrective feedback is of limited pedagogical value, whereas focused corrective feedback promoted learners ' grammatical accuracy in L 2 writing more effectively.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> and uptake {{that occurs in}} ESL classrooms in a public secondary school in Malaysia. It looked at the kind of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> that teachers give to students when they made spoken errors as well students' response or uptake following the given <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback.</b> The study was sparked by similar studies in the field particularly the one done by Lyster and Ranata (1997) which indicates that certain types of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> is more effective in eliciting students' uptake. The study involved 174 Form 3 students from four classes; two classes of the higher English proficiency and another two classes of the lower English proficiency. The researcher observed 12 hours of English lessons {{in order to find}} out the kind of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> which teacher employed as well as students' uptake following it. The researcher also interviewed the two English teachers observed in the classroom observation in order to find out more on their <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> practice. The study found recast to be the most preferred <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> and also the least likely to lead to students' uptake. Students were most likely to produce uptake following metalinguistic feedback, elicitation and repetition. Metalinguistic feedback was also found to be most effective in leading towards student-generated repair as opposed to teachergenerated repair. The interview revealed that teacher's choice of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> was not guided by formal knowledge on <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> and uptake but by instinct and practicality.
