25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed {{and ought to be}} rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E

The band was conceived in 1998, when Chiwaki mentioned to Chara {{that she thought}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> start up a girls' rock band. One of the tenets of the band was that all members {{would have to do}} something they'd never tried before, landing Chara on drums. The band first practiced in 1999, and continued to sporadically practice throughout 2000, despite different members' schedules.|$|E

After seeing American Tejano pop singer Selena perform at a showcase event, Torres immediately wanted to record a duet with her. He said in Selena Remembered; a documentary about her career, [...] "...she had an attractive way about her that was always present. We got along very well and a friendship developed from that point on. Several months later I wrote a song which I thought <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> record a duet with Selena." [...] "Buenos Amigos" [...] was recorded for Torres' tenth studio album Nada Se Compara Contigo (1991).|$|E
500|$|After signing to DGC Records, Nirvana began {{recording}} {{its second}} album Nevermind in May 1991. [...] "In Bloom" [...] {{was one of}} the first songs the band recorded during the album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California; Vig thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> start recording a song previously recorded at Smart Studios. The arrangements for [...] "In Bloom" [...] and the other songs previously recorded with Vig in 1990 were largely unchanged; the recently hired drummer Dave Grohl stayed mostly with what his predecessor Chad Channing had recorded, but added more power and precision to the recording. Cobain sang progressively [...] "harder" [...] during the recording of the song, which made it difficult for Vig to balance the volume levels between the verses and choruses. Vig recalled that he had to change the input level [...] "on the fly" [...] and hoped that Cobain would not [...] "change the phrasing or do something different" [...] while recording.|$|E

500|$|In {{the time}} after Morning Phases release and general {{critical}} success, Beck {{mentioned that he}} had been working on another album at around the same time, but that the new album would be more of a pop record. Shortly after Morning Phases Grammy wins, on June 15, 2015, Beck released the first single titled [...] "Dreams" [...] off this upcoming thirteenth studio album. [...] "I was really trying to make something that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> play live," [...] he said shortly after its release. However, no further word was heard from Beck pertaining to the release of the album. On June 2, 2016, almost a year after the initial release of [...] "Dreams," [...] Beck released a new single titled [...] "Wow", along with a lyric video of the song and an announcement that his still untitled album would be released on October 21, 2016. In September 2016, the album was delayed with no new release date announced and, on September 24, Beck said he didn't know [...] "when it’s coming out. It’s probably in a few months." [...] Once again, however, no further singles were released and no new release date was scheduled for the album.|$|E
500|$|After meeting U2 in 1987, Steinberg {{stayed in}} touch with Bono and when the group was putting the Zoo TV Tour {{together}} in 1992, the lead singer thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have a choreographer to critique his moves on stage. Steinberg worked during the tour's pre-production to show the group how to communicate their ideas {{all the way to}} the last rows of a venue. Recognizing Bono was not a dancer, she focused on movements he could do, and sought to help him pace himself and not get lost visually in the show's enormous stage set. The group's hit [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] had featured a belly dancer in its music video, and the group decided to incorporate one in their on-stage performance of the song. The original dancer left when the tour moved to its outdoor stadium legs. According to Steinberg, having a belly dancer on the tour originated as [...] "a bit of a joke". Steinberg began by training the dancer, and when that dancer left the tour, a replacement was needed. Bono asked Steinberg if she would like to take over and she agreed, although she had never belly danced before and by her own description did not have the voluptuous body usually associated with the form.|$|E

2500|$|Young said he {{traveled}} to Seattle to record the record for a [...] "challenge." [...] He said, [...] "Recording Mirror Ball was like audio vérité, just a snapshot of what's happening.

[...] He stated that he [...] "played his ass off on every take at every session," [...] and added, [...] "I can't say enough good things about him." [...] Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder was not around much for the recording sessions. Vedder {{explained that he was}} [...] "in the midst of a pretty intense stalker problem," [...] adding that [...] "leaving the house wasn't the easiest thing to do." [...] Vedder would refer to the issue in the song [...] "Lukin" [...] from Pearl Jam's 1996 album, No Code. Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard said that Mirror Ball [...] "came {{at a time when we}} needed it, that Neil thought we were a band that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> make a record with. He probably felt sorry for us. He made it all right for us to be who we were. He's not taking his career so seriously that he can't take chances. Suddenly, our band seemed too serious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Instead he {{presented}} a comprehensive plan, which he himself called [...] "fantastic", for {{the reorganization of}} the Middle East. Jordan, he observed, was not viable as an independent state and should therefore be divided. Iraq would get the East Bank {{in return for a}} promise to settle the Palestinian refugees there and to make peace with Israel while the West Bank would be attached to Israel as a semi-autonomous region. Lebanon suffered from having a large Muslim population which was concentrated in the south. The problem could be solved by Israel’s expansion up to the Litani River, thereby helping to turn Lebanon into a more compact Christian state. ... Israel declares its intention to keep her forces for the purpose of permanent annexation of the entire area east of the El Arish-Abu Ageila, Nakhl-Sharm el-Sheikh, in order to maintain for the long term the freedom of navigation in the Straits of Eilat and in order to free herself from the scourge of the infiltrators and from the danger posed by the Egyptian army bases in Sinai. ... "I told him about the discovery of oil in southern and western Sinai, and that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> tear this peninsula from Egypt because it did not belong to her, rather it was the English who stole it from the Turks when they believed that Egypt was in their pocket.
