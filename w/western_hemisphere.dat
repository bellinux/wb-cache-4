5|$|On November 12, 2013, the Height Committee of the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) {{made the}} {{controversial}} announcement that One World Trade Center was the tallest {{building in the}} United States at 1,776 feet, declaring that the mast {{on top of the}} building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building's architecture.

30|$|More specifically, Koper and Pyle (2004) {{measured}} PKiKP/PcP amplitude ratios from seismograms filtered between 1 and 3  Hz. Their analysis did {{not reveal}} any differences between the eastern and <b>western</b> <b>hemispheres</b> of the inner core. Using phases from a Mariana event observed in Japan, whose raypaths sampled the ICB beneath the western Pacific, Kawakatsu (2006) found little scattering energy in the PKiKP coda. However, Leyton and Koper (2007 b) analyzed the coda of PKiKP and suggested the existence of small-scale heterogeneities in the uppermost inner core. This result indicates that the strong scattering region is located beneath the Pacific Ocean and Asia, which covers parts of the eastern and <b>western</b> <b>hemispheres.</b> On the basis of scattering properties and Q structure, Cormier (2007) inferred textural differences between the eastern and <b>western</b> <b>hemispheres</b> near {{the surface of the}} inner core, including vertically oriented structures in the eastern hemisphere.|$|R
5|$|The {{latitude}} and longitude are expressed in , in which a positive latitude value refers to the northern hemisphere, and a negative value refers to the southern hemisphere.

5|$|As vice president, Brundage {{served on}} a {{commission}} appointed at the IOC's London session in 1948 to recommend whether the 1906 Intercalated Games, held in Athens, {{should be considered a}} full Olympic Games. All three members of what {{came to be known as}} the Brundage Commission were from the <b>Western</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that there was nothing to be gained by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent.

50|$|This {{principle}} of classification was extended by Ascherson and Graebner (1907) {{to cover all}} lupins from the eastern and <b>western</b> <b>hemispheres.</b> Lupinus L. was {{for the first time}} subdivided into two subgenera: A. Eulupinus and B. Platycarpos (Ascherson and Graebner, 1907). Quantity of ovules (seedbuds) in the ovary and seeds in the pod was also accepted as the criterion for this division. Most of the described species from the eastern and <b>western</b> <b>hemispheres</b> were referred to subgen. A. Eulupinus. Subgen. B. Platycarpos included several annual species from the eastern hemisphere with two seedbuds and seeds in the bean (the same species, as the one specified by S. Watson).|$|R

5|$|The Andalusian {{is closely}} related to the Lusitano of Portugal, and has been used to develop many other breeds, {{especially}} in Europe and the Americas. Breeds with Andalusian ancestry include many of the warmbloods in Europe as well as <b>western</b> <b>hemisphere</b> breeds such as the Azteca. Over its centuries of development, the Andalusian breed has been selected for athleticism and stamina. The horses were originally used for classical dressage, driving, bullfighting, and as stock horses. Modern Andalusians are used for many equestrian activities, including dressage, show jumping and driving. The breed is also used extensively in movies, especially historical pictures and fantasy epics.|$|E
5|$|The Armada was {{constantly}} being modernized {{with the latest}} developments in naval warfare.

5|$|The Spanish {{probably}} obtained spotted horses through {{trade with}} southern Austria and Hungary, where the color pattern {{was known to}} exist.
