Although a Library of Congress expert said the paper on the card dated back to 1910, the three men decided to submit the card for a <b>water</b> <b>test,</b> using chemicals to determine the card's authenticity.

25|$|In chemistry, {{biochemistry}} {{and environmental}} sciences, deuterium {{is used as}} a non-radioactive, stable isotopic tracer, for example, in the doubly labeled <b>water</b> <b>test.</b> In chemical reactions and metabolic pathways, deuterium behaves somewhat similarly to ordinary hydrogen (with a few chemical differences, as noted). It can be distinguished from ordinary hydrogen most easily by its mass, using mass spectrometry or infrared spectrometry. Deuterium can be detected by femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, since the mass difference drastically affects the frequency of molecular vibrations; deuterium-carbon bond vibrations are found in spectral regions free of other signals.|$|E
25|$|The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) {{has made}} many changes since 2008, {{including}} doubling {{the number of}} oil and gas inspection staff and implementing new water quality standards. In 2010, amendments to Pennsylvania law regarding casing and cementing requirements for wells were revised and routine inspections of existing wells are now required. Gas companies are also required to submit pre-drilling <b>water</b> <b>test</b> results to the PA DEP and to water supply owners under these new amendments. Also in 2010, the Pennsylvania Environmental Quality Board revised regulations regarding wastewater treatment and disposal. Only wastewater that is treated at a centralized wastewater treatment facility and that meets certain quality standards can be disposed of in surface waters.|$|E
500|$|Shooting at sea led to many delays: {{unwanted}} sailboats {{drifted into}} frame, cameras got soaked, and the Orca once began to sink with the actors on board. The prop sharks frequently malfunctioned owing {{to a series}} of problems including bad weather, pneumatic hoses taking on salt water, frames fracturing due to water resistance, corroding skin, and electrolysis. From the first <b>water</b> <b>test</b> onward, the [...] "non-absorbent" [...] neoprene foam that made up the sharks' skin soaked up liquid, causing the sharks to balloon, and the sea-sled model frequently got entangled among forests of seaweed. Spielberg later calculated that during the 12-hour daily work schedule, on average only four hours were actually spent filming. Gottlieb was nearly decapitated by the boat's propellers, and Dreyfuss was almost imprisoned in the steel cage. The actors were frequently seasick. Shaw also fled to Canada whenever he could due to tax problems, engaged in binge drinking, and developed a grudge against Dreyfuss, who was getting rave reviews for his performance in Duddy Kravitz. Editor Verna Fields rarely had material to work with during principal photography, as according to Spielberg [...] "we would shoot five scenes in a good day, three in an average day, and none in a bad day." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{sentence}} {{for an individual}} found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, and in previous centuries, typically included either burning at the stake or being tested with the [...] "ordeal of cold water" [...] or judicium aquae frigidae. [...] The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but {{was used as a}} method of truth in Russia prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy. [...] Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them [...] "brought back," [...] but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold <b>water</b> <b>test</b> was used as a precursor to execution.|$|E

[...] Game that has been handled in any way, whether it be live or dead game, may not be used for testing dogs in any part of a field trial. [...] The only exception to this rule is where dead game may be used in the conduct of a <b>water</b> <b>test</b> at a field trial. [...] The reason this exception exists it to acknowledge the fact that game will not necessarily be shot over water, although for dogs to qualify for titles in field trials will be required to demonstrate their ability to retrieve from water.|$|E

The survey (43 questions) assessed <b>water</b> use, <b>testing</b> behaviors, perceptions about risk, reasons for testing/not testing, and preferences for getting information. Results (68 % response rate) indicated most respondents felt their well water was safe or very safe (67 %). Over 50 % were not worried about the safety of their water; however, 48 % believed there was a serious or very serious problem with ground water safety in their township. About 20 % of respondents had never had their well <b>water</b> <b>tested.</b> People said they would get their <b>water</b> <b>tested</b> if they learned that a neighbor’s well was contaminated (86 %), if there was a change in taste or appearance (86 %), or if their family had unexplained health problems (63 %).
