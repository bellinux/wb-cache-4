5|$|After Harrison {{returned}} to the United States from Colombia, he settled on his farm in North Bend, Ohio, his adopted home state, living in relative retirement after nearly four decades of government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the distillery. In a later address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making <b>whiskey,</b> <b>and</b> hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.|$|E

5|$|Frontier {{physician}} Andrew Taylor Still, M.D., DO, {{founded the}} American School of Osteopathy (now the A.T. Still University-Kirksville (Mo.) College of Osteopathic Medicine) in Kirksville, MO, in 1892 as a radical {{protest against the}} turn-of-the-century medical system. A. T. Still believed that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease. He founded osteopathic medicine in rural Missouri {{at a time when}} medications, surgery, and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good. Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic, castor oil, <b>whiskey,</b> <b>and</b> opium. In addition, unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in more deaths than cures.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{sales of}} spirits {{increased}} 9% {{over the previous}} year. <b>Whiskey</b> <b>and</b> vodka were the top sellers, while tequila had the largest percentage increase. Oregonian's top buy was Jack Daniel's, with 412,000 bottles sold. This was during a national spirits trend where manufacturers introduced new products and advertising aimed at young drinkers. Again in 2007, Oregon's 2.6 million adults on average drank 32 gallons of beer each, versus 4 gallons of wine and 2 gallons of spirits, but sales of beer hadn't increased like sales of spirits. The Oregon Department of Human Services reported that while drinking among 8th11th graders has fallen nationally, it has increased in Oregon. The number of DUI offenses dropped between 2002 and 2005, from 25,342 to 23,455.|$|E

In September 1883, Thomas Higgins, then 45, became yet {{another member of the}} household to fall mysteriously ill. His stomach pains were severe enough that Doctor Whitford was called; the doctor attributed Higgins's illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap <b>whiskey</b> <b>and</b> prescribed opium and castor oil. Higgins died after two days of illness. Days later, the same doctor was contacted and asked to provide a death certificate. He did so, attributing the death to dysentery.|$|E

Dimmitt hired two gunsmiths who were able to bring the remaining weapons into service. The food, clothing, blankets, and other provisions were valued at US$10,000. The new quartermaster at the fort, John J. Linn, reported that 175barrels of flour were confiscated, along with a large supply of sugar, coffee, <b>whiskey,</b> <b>and</b> rum.

5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes {{that they would be}} protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the whites. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, <b>whiskey,</b> <b>and</b> guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E

Other band members include bassist Stefan Lessard, violinist Boyd Tinsley, and drummer Carter Beauford.

Hoffman convinced Matthews to create a demo album of a few songs that he had written. Matthews then shared the demo with other musicians, including Beauford and Moore. Both of them, who were jazz musicians at the time, joined Matthews after hearing the demo. The band has released eight studio albums, all with RCA Records: Under the Table and Dreaming (1994), Crash (1996), Before These Crowded Streets (1998), Everyday (2001), Busted Stuff (2002), Stand Up (2005), Big <b>Whiskey</b> <b>and</b> the GrooGrux King (2009), Away from the World (2012).

5|$|Further {{down the}} hill, along the Military Road, is a two-story house, known as The Stewards House or as Killakee House (not to be {{confused}} with the now-demolished Killakee House that served as the residence of the Massy family who owned the adjacent Killakee Estate). It was built around 1765 by the Conolly family as a hunting lodge. Over the years, it has served as a dower house and as a residence for the agent who managed the Killakee Estate. To the rear is a belfry; this was once a common feature of large farmhouses and was used to call the workers for meals. The Hell Fire Club held meetings here for a time following the fire that damaged Mount Pelier lodge. The house has a reputation for being haunted, particularly by a large black cat. Stories regarding the origin of this spectre either connect it with the account of the priest who exorcised a cat at the Hell Fire Club or with a cat that was doused in <b>whiskey</b> <b>and</b> set alight by members of the Hell Fire Club before escaping across the mountains with its fur aflame.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 27, Anderson left his camp with about 75 men to scout for Union forces. They soon arrived at {{the small town of}} Centralia and {{proceeded}} to loot it, robbing people and searching the town for valuables. They found a large supply of <b>whiskey</b> <b>and</b> all began drinking. Anderson retreated into the lobby of the town hotel to drink and rest. A stagecoach soon arrived, and Anderson's men robbed the passengers, including Congressman James S. Rollins and a plainclothes sheriff. The two were prominent Unionists, and hid their identities from the guerrillas. As the guerrillas robbed the stagecoach passengers, a train arrived. The guerrillas blocked the railroad, forcing the train to stop. Anderson's men quickly took control of the train, which included 23 off-duty Union soldiers as passengers. This was the first capture of a Union passenger train in the war.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of <b>whiskey</b> <b>and</b> drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E

5|$|Leslie quickly seeks revenge against Lindsay {{by getting}} her parks {{employees}} to throw garbage over the Eagleton {{side of the}} fence. When Lindsay arrives to stop it, the two get into a fight amid the garbage bags. The police arrive and arrest both women: Lindsay is jailed in Pawnee, while Leslie is jailed in Eagleton's pristine and hotel-like holding cell. After Ann bails Leslie out, she tells her that Lindsay built the fence because she is jealous that Leslie was offered the Eagleton job first and wants to get a rise out of her. Ann suggests that Lindsay should be hit with a baseball bat, which gives Leslie the idea to turn Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park into a wiffle ball field, with the fence serving as the outfield wall. Lindsay is impressed by how fast Leslie turned the fence into something positive, and remembers why she and Leslie joined the parks department in the first place. With their relationship on the mend, the two agree {{to get a drink}} together. Later, Leslie returns to the office to throw Ron's party: she takes him to an empty room with steak, <b>whiskey</b> <b>and</b> his favorite movies waiting for him, and reveals that April and Andy's duties were false leads to trick him. Leslie explains she made a party that he would want and leaves a content Ron alone to enjoy his birthday.|$|E
