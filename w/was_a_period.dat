5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E
5|$|English has {{developed}} {{over the course of}} more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> in which the language was influenced by French. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London and the King James Bible, and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.|$|E

In early 1941 a number of raids were undertaken but No. 6 Commando did not conduct its first operation until later in the year.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and {{military}} change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover. Her son and successor, Edward VII, inaugurated the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the line of his father.|$|E
5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 {{geologist}} Thomas Jaggar {{founded the}} Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The facility {{was taken over}} in 1919 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and in 1924 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which marked the start of continuous volcano observation on Hawaii island. The next century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of thorough investigation, marked by contributions from many top scientists. The first complete evolutionary model was first formulated in 1946, by USGS geologist and hydrologist Harold T. Stearns. Since that time, advances have enabled the study of previously limited areas of observation (e.g. improved rock dating methods and submarine volcanic stages).|$|E

5|$|Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) {{acknowledged}} {{the existence of}} the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, he argued that the Renaissance <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much that was important. The Latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of deep economic recession. Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed. Finally, Joan Kelly argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Multi-platform {{releases}} {{were common}} {{in the early days}} of RPGs, but there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> during the 1990s when this was not generally the case. The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume the practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles. The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of programming tools. Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of the development budget than in the past, are easily transferable between multiple platforms.|$|E
5|$|The 1850s <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of {{transition}} for the ice trade. The industry was already quite large: in 1855 around $6–7 million ($118–138 million in 2010 terms) was {{invested in the}} industry in the U.S. and an estimated two million tons (two billion kg) of ice was kept in storage {{at any one time}} in warehouses across the nation. Over the coming decade, however, the focus of the growing trade shifted away from relying upon the international export market in favour of supplying first the growing, eastern cities of the US, and then the rest of the rapidly expanding country.|$|E

Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941, sixteen British cities were hit by major aerial raids. Beginning on 7 September 1940, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. Overall, {{more than one million}} London houses were destroyed or damaged during the Blitz, and more than 40,000 civilians were killed, almost half of them in London.|$|E
5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered to have begun about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival of Europeans in Indiana. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which {{has yet to be}} explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to attribute the forts to Welsh Indians who supposedly arrived centuries before Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have found no evidence for that theory and believe that the cultural development was engendered by the Mississippian culture.|$|E

5|$|The late 18th century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> {{of change}} in the {{interior}} design of English country houses. The Baroque concept of the principal floor, or piano nobile, with a large bedroom suite known as the state apartments, was gradually abandoned in favour of smaller, more private bedrooms on the upper floors. The principal floor became a series of reception rooms, each with a designated purpose, creating separate withdrawing, dining, music, and ballrooms. In the late-18th century, it became common to arrange reception and public rooms on a lower floor, with bedrooms and more private rooms above. West Wycombe perfectly reflects this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the sixth century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of {{political}} disorder in Arabia and communication routes were no longer secure. Religious divisions were an important cause of the crisis. Judaism became the dominant religion in Yemen while Christianity took root in the Persian Gulf area. In line with broader trends of the ancient world, the region witnessed a decline in the practice of polytheistic cults and a growing interest in a more spiritual form of religion. While many were reluctant to convert to a foreign faith, those faiths provided intellectual and spiritual reference points.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> {{of renewed}} {{lobbying}} for a road crossing in the 1920s and 1930s, {{at which time}} the only vehicle crossing was a single passenger and vehicle ferry. Sir William Denny championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s, providing and operating {{on behalf of the}} London and North Eastern Railway two additional ferries that aimed to supplement the services of the adjacent railway bridge. Their success allowed for the addition of two more craft in the 1940s and 1950s, by which time the ferries were making 40,000 crossings annually, carrying 1.5 million passengers and 800,000 vehicles.|$|E

Isaacs's successor, Genista McIntosh, resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health. Her post was filled by Mary Allen, who {{moved into the}} job from the Arts Council. Allen's selection did not comply with the Council's rules for such appointments, and following a critical House of Commons Select Committee report on {{the management of the}} opera house she resigned in March 1998, as did the entire board of the opera house, including the chairman, Lord Chadlington. A new board appointed Michael Kaiser as general director in September 1998. He oversaw the restoration of the two companies' finances and the re-opening of the opera house. He was widely regarded as a success, and there was some surprise when he left in June 2000 after less than two years to run the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|As some warmer air {{began to}} move in above the surface, the snow mixed with and changed to sleet and {{freezing}} rain between 6 PM and 7 PM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties, then between 7 PM and 11 PM across most other areas in eastern Pennsylvania. The southern Poconos saw less mixed precipitation, however there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> of mixed precipitation between about 7:30 PM on the 13th and 11:30 AM on the 14th. For a brief time during {{the afternoon of the}} 14th, temperatures rose a couple of degrees above freezing with no precipitation falling. Temperatures then dropped below freezing again by the late afternoon of the 14th with a period of snow before the precipitation came to an end between 8:30 PM and 10 PM on the 14th. Wraparound snow showers lingered in Monroe and Carbon Counties until 2 AM EST on the 15th.|$|E

The 113 acts passed {{in the three years}} of the second Fisher government exceeded even the output of the second Deakin government over a similar period.
