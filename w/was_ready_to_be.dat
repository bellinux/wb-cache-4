During the same year, Sir Samuel Davenport purchased the house and land from Bishop Short and lived in 'The Lodge', a small cottage {{at the entrance to}} what became the driveway to Beaumont House, until Short vacated Claremont.|$|E
5|$|Ballard was {{selected}} in the first round, 11th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. The choice {{was seen as a}} surprise by draft observers, as he was projected to be a late first-round to second-round pick. Ballard himself professed the early selection to be unexpected, saying he <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drafted between the 20th and 40th positions. Scouting reports listed him as a puck-rushing offensive defenseman with comparisons to Phil Housley. Before making his NHL debut, he was traded twice. He was initially dealt by Buffalo to the Colorado Avalanche on July 3, 2003, for Steven Reinprecht. The following year, he was traded again to the Phoenix Coyotes, along with defenseman Derek Morris, for forward Chris Gratton, defenseman Ossi Väänänen and a second-round selection in the 2005 draft.|$|E

5|$|The couple met at Liège before {{travelling}} to Utrecht where, on 10 April, {{they became}} officially betrothed. On 25 July Matilda was crowned Queen of the Romans {{in a ceremony}} at Mainz. There was a considerable age gap between the couple, as Matilda was only eight years old while Henry was 24. After the betrothal she was placed into the custody of Bruno, the Archbishop of Trier, who was tasked with educating her in German culture, manners and government. In January 1114 Matilda <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married to Henry, and their wedding {{was held at the}} city of Worms amid extravagant celebrations. Matilda now entered public life in Germany, complete with her own household.|$|E
5|$|Derfflinger was {{constructed}} at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg under construction number 213. She {{was the least}} expensive of the three ships, {{at a cost of}} 56 million gold marks. The ship <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> launched on 14 June 1913, but during the ceremony, one of the wooden sledges upon which the hull rested became jammed. It took until 12 July for her to enter the water. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. Lützow was built at the Schichau dockyard in Danzig under construction number 885, at the cost of 58million gold marks. The ship was launched on 29 November 1913, and after lengthy trials, commissioned on 8 August 1915. Hindenburg, the final member of the class, was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, under construction number 34. The ship was built at a cost of 59million gold marks, the most expensive of the three vessels. She was launched on 1 August 1915 and commissioned on 10 May 1917.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland, {{named after}} the {{ceremonial}} county, was ordered on 2 September 1861 from the Millwall Ironworks. She was laid down on 10 October 1861 at its shipyard in Millwall, London. She was altered while on the building slip after Sir Edward Reed succeeded Isaac Watts as Chief Constructor. Unlike her half-sisters, the ship spent five years on the stocks before she <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> launched, partially due to frequent changes in design, although Northumberland was much closer to completion. The additional weight caused her stick for {{an hour on the}} slipway before she slid halfway down with her stern only supported by air, threatening to buckle the ship. Efforts by hydraulic jacks and tugboats failed to get her into the water on the next spring tide failed, but the use of pontoons on 17 April 1866 proved successful. Her builders went into bankruptcy while the ship was being launched and the liquidators seized Northumberland as a company asset once she was in the water. Eight months passed before the Admiralty could take possession and begin fitting out the ship. She was commissioned in October 1868 and completed on 8 October for a cost a total of £444,256.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944 5MWS {{became part}} of a force of RAAF and United States Army {{aviation}} engineer units which were selected to build airfields at Aitape in New Guinea from which air support would be provided to Allied operations around Hollandia after US Army forces landed there on 22April. 5MWS departed Melbourne on 15February, and eventually joined up with {{the main body of}} the airfield engineer force at Lae on 1April where it received training in infantry tactics. The Landing at Aitape took place on 22April, and 5MWS came ashore the next day. The airfield at Aitape <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used from 25April and was later expanded by the aviation engineers. On 6July 5MWS landed on Noemfoor Island where it again formed part of an aviation engineer force tasked with repairing and expanding the island's airfields. Allied forces had first landed on the island on 2July, and it was still not secure when construction work began. As a result, 5MWS personnel were required to man perimeter defences, during which they captured 12 Japanese personnel. While at Noemfoor 5MWS was redesignated No.5 Airfield Construction Squadron (5ACS) on 18July. As at 25November, No. 4 Airfield Construction Squadron and 5ACS were the main units of No. 62 Wing. This wing formed part of the Australian First Tactical Air Force, which was the RAAF's main mobile force.|$|E

During the printing Theodosius substituted Peychinovich's original introduction with his own one, but still preserved the text that referred to the language of the work as the 'common Bulgarian language of Lower Moesia, of Skopje and Tetovo' (простїй Ѧзыкъ болгарский долнїѦ Мүссїи Скопсский и Тетовский).|$|E

25|$|This plan <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> set {{in action}} in early March 1864, after {{somewhat}} belated communication initiated by Banks to inform Sherman and Porter of {{their roles in}} Halleck's strategy. Banks sent Sherman, Halleck, and Porter a report prepared by Major David Houston clearly showing the near impossibility of maintaining an occupation in Shreveport and east Texas without major resources. Most of Banks' men, accompanied by a large, poorly trained, cavalry force would march north toward the middle river. Banks would allow cotton speculators to come along, and Porter was bringing barges to collect cotton as lucrative naval prizes.|$|E

25|$|The DDX {{proposed}} {{to use a}} permanent-magnet motor (PMM) within the hull. An alternate twin pod arrangement was rejected as the ramifications of pod drives would require too much development and validation cost to the vessel. The PMM {{is considered to be}} another technology leap and is the cause of some concern (along with the radar system) from Congress. As part of the design phase, Northrop Grumman had the world's largest permanent magnet motor, designed and fabricated by DRS Technologies. This proposal was dropped when the PMM motor failed to demonstrate that it <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> installed in time.|$|E

The project was put out to bid three times before an offer was returned within the range that the committee could afford. With a construction contractor confirmed and work set to begin, the memorial steering committee held a groundbreaking ceremony on May 22, 2009 at what was to be the future site of the memorial. Joining the steering committee that day were local military veterans and residents, as well as town and state officials.|$|E

The company eventually settled on a dilapidated building on 42nd Street in New York City as the assembly site, and began ordering the 1813 separate parts from a host of manufacturers across the country. The first five sets were assembled at Bell Labs in July 1944, and another 33 were completed by August and the last of the 50 preproduction sets in September. The first production sets from the new plant arrived on 28 September, with 40 more in October, and another 142 in November.|$|E

25|$|Frescoes demanded more {{complicated}} treatment. Normally water, once it evaporates, will leave {{a layer of}} residual salt {{on the surface of}} the wall that absorbed it. In some instances, the resultant efflorescence obscured painted images. In other cases, the impermeability of the fresco plaster caused the salt to become trapped beneath the surface, causing bubbles to form and erupt, and the paint to fall. The adhesion of the plaster to the wall was often also seriously compromised. A fresco could only be detached when fully dry. To dry a fresco, workers cut narrow tunnels beneath it, in which heaters were placed to draw out moisture from below (instead of outwards, which would have further damaged the paintings). Within a few days, the fresco <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detached.|$|E
25|$|Carl Hårleman died in 1753, and {{his work}} was {{continued}} by Carl Johan Cronstedt and Carl Gustaf Tessin who finished the palace together. Some parts of the palace where the Royal family would live, the northern row and what is presently the State Apartmens, were also completed that year. The Stockholm Palace <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in 1754. The Royal Family {{who had lived in}} the Wrangel Palace on Riddarholmen since the fire in the old castle, moved to their new residence on the First Advent that same year. Instead of living in the State Apartment the Royal Family choose to stay in the part now known as the Bernadotte Apartments. The work on the interior continued even after the Royal Family had settled in. Priority was given to the interior rather than the completion of the Slottsbacken and Lejonbacken.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May, large rocks {{fell into}} the valley once again, burying the railway tracks for 250 metres and also making the road along the valley impassable. Moreover, the {{alluvial}} fan dammed up the Vispa, causing {{the lower part of}} the hamlet slowly to become flooded. After heavy rains on 18 Juny 1991, the station was similarly left under water. Planning immediately began for a new route for rail and road that would by pass the disaster area. The new rail alignment, totalling 2860 m, <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> opened on 1 August 1991. However, a heavy thunderstorm on 8 August led to a blockage of the newly excavated river channel of the Vispa by washed up glacial rubble, which meant a second flooding of the station. After the water had flowed away to a sufficient extent, the rail traffic could once again be resumed on 10 August.|$|E
