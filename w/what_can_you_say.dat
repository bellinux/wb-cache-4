500|$|The {{relationship}} between both managers was evidently hostile to begin with. Ferguson noted that Wenger {{was the only}} manager he came across in the league not to share a drink with after matches â€“ an English football [...] "tradition". In a joint interview with The Times and Daily Mail in 2009, Wenger said his discourtesy was mistaken for mistrust and managers [...] "cannot be completely friendly and open up."

500|$|... "Electioneering", {{featuring}} a cowbell and a distorted guitar solo, is the album's most rock-oriented track {{and one of}} the heaviest songs Radiohead has recorded. It has been compared to Radiohead's earlier style on Pablo Honey. The cynical [...] "Electioneering" [...] is the album's most directly political song, with lyrics inspired by the Poll Tax Riots. The song was also inspired by Chomsky's , a book analysing contemporary mass media under the propaganda model. Yorke likened its lyrics, which focus on political and artistic compromise, to [...] "a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones." [...] Regarding its oblique political references, Yorke said, [...] "What can you say about the IMF, or politicians? Or people selling arms to African countries, employing slave labour or whatever. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> You just write down 'Cattle prods and the IMF' and people who know, know."

This iteration of Small Faces recorded two albums: [...] Playmates (1977) and 78 In The Shade (1978), released on Atlantic Records. Guitarist Jimmy McCulloch also briefly joined this line-up after leaving Wings. When McCulloch phoned Paul McCartney, who had found him increasingly difficult to work with, to announce he was joining Marriott, McCartney reportedly said [...] "I was a little put out at first, but, well, <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to that?"

It was voted by listeners of BBC Radio 2 {{as one of}} the three songs that changes people's lives. In its list of the 100 best singles of the last 50 years, Popdose ranked [...] "God Only Knows" [...] at number 1, saying: [...] "It is simply one of the most beautifully composed and arranged songs in the history of not just pop music, but Western music. To place 'God Only Knows' in its proper context is to compare it not just to 1966 Paul McCartney, but 1836 Frederic Chopin." [...] English broadcaster Dominic King deemed it the most [...] "perfectly constructed song in pop history".

6000|$|On a small canal, not {{far from}} the {{railroad}} station, the gondoliers show you a house, by no means notable (except for the noble statue of a knight, occupying a niche in one corner), as the house of Othello. It was once the palace of the patrician family Moro, a name well known in the annals of the Republic, and one which, it has been suggested, misled Shakespeare into the invention of a Moor of Venice. Whether this is possibly the fact, or whether there is any tradition of a tragic incident {{in the history of the}} Moro family similar to that upon which the play is founded, I do not know; but it is certain that the story of Othello, very nearly as Shakespeare tells it, is popularly known in Venice; and the gondoliers have fixed upon the Casa Moro in question as the edifice best calculated to give satisfaction to strangers in search of the True and the Memorable. The statue is happily darkened by time, and thus serves admirably to represent Othello's complexion, and to place beyond the shadow of a doubt the fact of his residence in the house. Indeed, <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to the gondolier, who, in answer to your cavils, points to the knight, with the convincing argument, [...] "There is his statue!" ...|$|E
60|$|You find, then, Mr. Hastings first {{leaving this}} {{sum of money}} {{for a year and}} three months in the hands of Gunga Govind Sing; you find, that, when an exigence pressed him by the Mahrattas {{suddenly}} invading Bengal, and he was obliged to refer to his bribe-fund, he finds that fund empty, and that, in supplying money for this exigence, he takes a bond for two thirds of his own money and one third of the Company's. For, as I stated before, Mr. Larkins proves of one of these accounts, that he took, in the month of January, for this bribe-money, which, according to the principles he lays down, was the Company's money, three bonds as for money advanced from his own cash. Now this sum of three lacs, instead of being all his own, as it should appear to be in the month of January, when he took the bonds, or two thirds his own and one third the Company's, as he said in his letter of the 29th of November, turns out, by Mr. Larkins's account, paragraph 9, which I wish to mark to your Lordships, to be two thirds the Company's money and one third his own; and yet it is all confounded under bonds, as if the money had been his own. <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to this heroic sharper disguised under the name of a patriot, when you find him to be nothing but a downright cheat, first taking money under the Company's name, then taking their securities to him for their own money, and afterwards entering a false account of them, contradicting that by another account?--and God knows whether the third be true or false. These are not things that I am to make out by any conclusion of mine; here they are, made out by himself and Mr. Larkins, and, comparing them with his letter of the 27th, you find a gross fraud covered by a direct falsehood.|$|E

5000|$|Although Tepin {{remained}} the top ranked turf mare in the United States, some feared she had passed her prime. In the Breeders' Cup Mile, she faced an excellent field led by Limato (July Cup, Prix de la ForÃªt) and Alice Springs (Falmouth, Matron, Sun Chariot). Behind a rapid early pace, Tepin settled into seventh {{position on the}} outside just behind Limato. In front of them was Tourist, who kicked for home first and sailed up the rail to the lead. Four wide around the final turn, Tepin made a late charge but missed by half a length. The time for the race was 1:31.71 - the fastest Breeders' Cup Mile ever run and just off the Santa Anita course record of 1:31.69. [...] "We had a good race", said Leparoux.

6000|$|And he {{took the}} Sappho from the Prytaneum, the work of Silanion! a thing of such beauty that no other man can have the like of {{it in his own}} private house; yet Verres has it--a man hardly fit to carry such a work of art as a burden, not possess it as a {{treasure}} of his own. [...] "What, too!" [...] he says, [...] "have you not stolen PÃ¦an from the temple of Ã†sculapius--a statue so remarkable for its beauty, so well-known for the worship attached to it, that all the world has been wont to visit it? What! has not the image of AristÃ¦us been taken by you from the temple of Bacchus? Have you not even stolen the statue of Jupiter Imperator, so sacred in the eyes of all men--that Jupiter which the Greeks call Ourios? You have not hesitated to rob the temple of Proserpine of the lovely head in Parian marble."[128] Then Cicero speaks of the worship due to all these gods as though he himself believed in their godhead.

But so great a rage did my scoffing and yet severe jest put him into, {{that he was going to}} fly at me and {{undoubtedly}} had attempted to kill me if he had been possessed of weapons, and had not been prevented by three Spaniards. This unparalleled and villainous carriage, made us seriously consider what was to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spaniard, who had saved the poor Indian's life, mightily petitioned me to hang one of them, for an example to the others, which should be him that had twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet, it being at that time thought impossible the poor slave should recover. But they could never gain my consent to put him to death, for the reasons above mentioned, since it was an Englishman (even yourself) who was my deliverer; and as merciful counsels are most prevailing when earnestly pressed, so I got them to be of the same opinion as to clemency. But to prevent them doing us any farther mischief; we all agreed, that they should have no weapons, as sword, gun, powder, or shot, but be expelled from the society, to live as they pleased by themselves; that neither the two Englishmen, nor the rest of the Spaniards, should have conversation with them upon any account whatsoever; that they should be kept from coming within a certain distance of our castle; and if they dared to offer us any violence, either by spoiling, burning, killing, or destroying any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle, belonging to the society, we would shoot them as freely as we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever places we should find them.|$|E
