5|$|The Torah {{provides}} four details {{regarding the}} traditions surrounding Joseph’s remains. The account in Genesis relates that, before his death, {{he had his}} brothers swear they would carry his bones out of Egypt to Canaan. He is then {{said to have been}} embalmed then placed in a coffin in Egypt. In Exodus, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Moses fulfilled the pledge by taking Joseph's bones with him when he left Egypt. In Joshua, Joseph’s bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by the Children of Israel and interred in Shechem.The bones of Joseph, which the Children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver (qeśîṭâ)..|$|E
25|$|The Shannon reputedly hosts a river monster named Cata, first {{appearing}} in the medieval Book of Lismore. In this manuscript <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Senán, patron saint of County Clare, defeated the monster at Inis Cathaigh. Cata {{is described as a}} large monster with a horse's mane, gleaming eyes, thick feet, nails of iron and a whale's tail.|$|E
25|$|It was {{probably}} this work which contained {{a story about}} souls, where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> there were once spirits {{who lived in a}} state of bliss, but having committed a crime (the nature of which is unknown) they were punished by being forced to become mortal beings, reincarnated from body to body. Humans, animals, and even plants are such spirits. The moral conduct recommended in the poem may allow us to become like gods again.|$|E

50|$|My wife I and {{our child}} (1 year old) were tricked by one loop agent on the street. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have a {{discount}} {{and get all}} service for 45$ each. Even though its the highest price they can charge you. After 2 hours in bus without AC <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> don't have an access to the company ship to the statue of Liberty and should pay extra 35 per person. Thats how they steal money from people. One tells you {{that you can use}} full service. Another that you have to pay extra.|$|R
25|$|Say <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> a {{woman has}} two children. If we ask whether either {{of them is a}} girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|E
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E
500|$|After {{speaking}} about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on {{to tell us that}} the word 'molecule' is a modern word. [...] He states, [...] "it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. [...] The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry." [...] <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. [...] At this point, however, Maxwell notes that no one has ever seen or handled a molecule.|$|E

5000|$|Photographs {{of extreme}} cases {{of mental illness}} were shown to us. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> ... the {{institutions}} from which the mentally ill were to be taken were needed as military hospitals. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> further <b>told</b> <b>that</b> gas chambers <b>were</b> {{to be built in}} which the victims would be gassed, after which they would <b>be</b> cremated. <b>We,</b> anyway, would {{have nothing to do with}} the killings, we would only have to cremate the corpses.|$|R

[...] <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> when the Savior caught sight of her and saw that they were ready to stone her, he said to those who wanted to throw stones at her: Let the one who has not sinned, lift a stone and throw it. If someone is certain that he has not sinned, let him take a stone and hit her. And no one dared to do so. [...] When they examined themselves and they recognized that they too bore responsibility for certain actions, they did not dare to stone her.

2500|$|Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah {{is claimed}} to have {{repaired}} the Cairo to Red Sea passageway, but only briefly, circa 1000 AD, as it soon [...] "became choked with sand."

6000|$|The week consumed. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> {{going on}} such a day, that his {{destination}} was [...] "Basseterre in Guadaloupe:" [...] the business which called him abroad related to a friend's interests, not his own: I thought as much.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the queen's {{residence}} was at {{the extreme}} end of the village; so, without waiting for the doctor to procure a fiddle, we suddenly resolved upon going thither at once, and learning whether any privy counsellorships were vacant.|$|R
2500|$|However, the Israelites {{born in the}} {{wilderness}} after the exodus from Egypt apparently did not carry out the practice of circumcision.

In any case, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Joshua, before {{the celebration of the}} Passover, had them circumcised at Gilgal.|$|E
2500|$|Precisely by inculcating a {{critical}} attitude, the [...] "canon" [...] served to demythologize the conventional pieties of the American bourgeoisie {{and provided the}} student with a perspective from which to critically analyze American culture and institutions. Ironically, the same tradition is now regarded as oppressive. The texts once served an unmasking function; now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> it is the texts which must be unmasked.|$|E

2500|$|These {{modifications}} seem {{to concern}} chiefly {{the parts of}} the Mass outside the Canon. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Gregory added to the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] the continuation [...] "diesque nostros in tuâ pace disponas" [...] etc. (ib.). We have already noticed that this second part was originally a fragment of a prayer for the dead. St. Gregory's addition may then very well mean, not that he composed it, but that he joined it to the [...] "Hanc igitur", having removed it from its original place.|$|E

2500|$|Jehoshaphat also pursued {{alliances with}} the {{northern}} kingdom. Jehoshaphat's son Jehoram married Ahab's daughter Athaliah. In the eighteenth year of his reign Jehosaphat visited Ahab in Samaria, and nearly lost his life accompanying his ally to the siege of Ramoth-Gilead. While Jehoshaphat safely returned from this battle, he was reproached by the prophet Jehu, son of Hanani, about this alliance. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Jehoshaphat repented, {{and returned to his}} former course of opposition to all idolatry, and promoting the worship of God and in the government of his people (...)

2500|$|Other {{critics were}} less kind. Robert Barnard wrote [...] "Another murder-in-the-past case, with nobody able to {{remember}} anything clearly, including, alas, the author. At one time <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> General Ravenscroft and his wife (the dead pair) were respectively sixty and thirty-five; later we are told he {{had fallen in love}} with his wife's twin sister 'as a young man'. The murder/suicide is once said to have taken place ten to twelve years before, elsewhere fifteen, or twenty. Acres of meandering conversations, hundreds of speeches beginning with 'Well, …' That sort of thing may happen in life, but one doesn't want to read it." [...] According to The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, this novel is one of the [...] "execrable last novels" [...] where Christie [...] "loses her grip altogether".|$|E
2500|$|The {{history is}} similar to that of the Cooke manuscript. In this case <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the first charges {{proceeded}} from Euclid's instruction of the sons of the Egyptian Lords. The Master Mason at the construction of the Temple of Solomon is a son of King Hiram of Tyre called Avnon. Again masonry diffuses from the Temple and enters Saint Alban's England from France. The science suffers in the wars following Alban's death, but is restored under Athelstan. His son, now named as Edwinne, is the expert geometrician who obtains his father's charter for an annual assembly of masons, that should be [...] "renewed from Kinge to Kinge". The assembly under Edwin is for the first time identified as having occurred at York. The articles and points are now replaced with a series of charges, in the form of an oath.|$|E
