5|$|On 19 December 1914, near Givenchy, {{during a}} night attack, Lt. Bruce was {{in command of}} a small party which {{captured}} one of the enemy's trenches. In spite of being severely wounded in the neck, he <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the trench, encouraging his men to hold on against several counter-attacks for some hours until killed. The fire from rifles and bombs was very heavy all day, and {{it was due to}} the skilful disposition made, and the example and encouragement shown by Lt. Bruce that his men were able to hold out until dusk, when the trench was finally captured by the enemy.|$|E
25|$|Meantime, I {{had found}} me {{quarters}} in Villiers Street, Strand, which forty-six {{years ago was}} primitive and passionate in its habits and population. My rooms were small, not over-clean or well-kept, but from my desk I could look out of my window through the fanlight of Gatti's Music-Hall entrance, across the street, almost on to its stage. The Charing Cross trains rumbled through my dreams on one side, the boom of the Strand on the other, while, before my windows, Father Thames under the Shot tower <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with his traffic.|$|E
25|$|In September 1826, Lovejoy {{graduated}} from Waterville College with first-class honors {{at the top}} of his class. During the winter and spring, he taught at China Academy. Dissatisfied with daily teaching, Lovejoy thought about moving to the South or Western United States. His former teachers at Waterville College advised him that he would best serve God in the West. Agreeing, Lovejoy in May 1827 moved to Boston to earn money for his journey, having settled on Illinois as his destination. Unsuccessful at finding work, he started to Illinois by foot. He stopped in New York City in mid-June, to try to find work. He eventually landed a position with the Saturday Evening Gazette as a newspaper subscription peddler. For nearly five weeks, he <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> streets, knocking on peoples' doors and wheedling passersby, in hopes of getting them to subscribe to the newspaper. Struggling with his finances, he wrote to Jeremiah Chaplin, the president of Waterville College, explaining his situation. Chaplin sent the money that his former student so needed. Lovejoy promptly embarked on his journey to Illinois, reaching Hillsboro, Montgomery County, in the fall of 1827. Lovejoy did not think he could do well in Illinois's scantly settled land, so he headed for St. Louis.|$|E
6000|$|Instead of at once {{complying}} with her wishes, he paused--hesitated--and made a strange request. [...] "Will you forgive my rudeness, if I ask leave to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the room while I talk? I am a restless man. <b>Walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{helps me to}} express myself freely." ...|$|R

25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into {{the wounds of}} an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|E
25|$|About 1650 Burges {{obtained}} {{an appointment}} at Wells as preacher in the cathedral. In July 1656 {{there was a}} warm dispute about his exclusive right to officiate there. Burges objected to an arrangement by which the inhabitants of St. Cuthbert's parish were to hold their services in the cathedral. The ground of his objection does not appear; Stoughton conjectures that the other congregation was of the independent sort. His preaching was unwelcome. The citizens <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the cloisters all sermon-time, and the constables had to be called in. About this time Burges invested his property in the purchase of alienated church lands, including the manor of Wells and the deanery which he rebuilt. He {{is said to have}} behaved with great rapacity, to have stripped the lead from the cathedral, to have used the proceeds to enlarge the deanery in which he lived, and to have let out the gate-houses as cottages. At the Restoration his investment (for which he had been offered over £12,000 in the previous year) was taken from him without recompense. Hence he was reduced to want, his pension was gone, he was suffering from cancer in the neck and cheek. He still had a house at Watford, and there he lived, attending the church in which he had formerly preached; he was compelled to part with his library for bread. He made application to Sir Richard Browne, Lord Mayor of London in 1660, who promised to provide for him if he would preach a recantation sermon in St. Paul's, and on his refusal flung him a gratuity of £3. Calamy describes him as ejected from St. Andrew's, Wells (which is the cathedral); this must have taken place before the Act of Uniformity. He was a worn-out man, yet, but for his maladies, he might have kept his old lead. It was his hand that drew up the 'Reasons' of the country ministers desiring reforms in the church at the Restoration, to which the authorities turned a deaf ear. He died at Watford, where he was buried in the church on 9 June 1665. He was married and left a son. By his will, dated Watford, 16 May 1665, he bequeathed his collection of prayer-books, the sole treasures saved from his library, to his 'dear and much-honoured mother, the renowned university of Oxford'.|$|E
500|$|From Monday to Saturday he <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{the street}} until 6:30 pm, reduced {{to four days}} a week from 1985. Saturday evenings were spent with the cinema crowds in Leicester Square. He would go to bed at 12:30 am after saying a prayer. [...] "Quite a good prayer, unselfish too", he told the Sunday Times. [...] "It is a sort of {{acknowledgment}} of God, just in case there happens to be one." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{shooting}} all six shotgun rounds, Kazmierczak {{fired on}} the room's remaining occupants with the 9mm Glock pistol, firing {{a total of}} approximately 50 rounds. He {{was reported to have}} <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the west aisle and directly in front of or on the stage, firing at people as he went. He shot and killed himself before police reached the room. The police recovered 55 un-expended rounds of ammunition from the scene, including two fully loaded magazines containing rounds for a [...]380 semi-automatic pistol.|$|E
500|$|She {{then went}} out on a rainy night and [...] "to make her clothes heavy with water, she <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> about half an hour" [...] before jumping into the River Thames, but a {{stranger}} saw her jump and rescued her. Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination {{is not to be}} baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, {{which was one of the}} calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the evening}} we bade them adieu and took horse, being {{resolved}} that, {{instead of the}} race which fails us, {{we would go to}} Epsom When we come there we could hear of no lodging, the town so full, but which was better, I went towards Ashsted, and there we got a lodging in a little hole we could not stand upright in While supper was getting I <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> behind my cosen [...] Pepys's house that was, which I find comes little short of what I took it to be when I was a little boy.|$|E

2500|$|Blackham's veteran {{teammate}} George Giffen, however, slept {{right through}} the storm and was blissfully unaware of it when he got up the following morning, a bright and sunny one. Giffen greeted his captain cheerily at breakfast but was met with a face as [...] "long as a coffee-pot". Blackham told him {{what had happened and}} forecast ominously the danger as the Australian team travelled to the ground, the carriage leaving deep furrows in the moist turf. Blackham was right to be so concerned: on a horrific [...] "sticky dog", his side eventually collapsed to 166 all out, losing the match by ten runs. At the close, with the Englishmen celebrating, [...] "Blackham <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the balcony like a caged tiger, muttering 'Cruel luck - cruel luck'.... In short, the team were thoroughly cut up seeing victory thus snatched away.... 'The rain beat us,' said some of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the film}} was finished, a showing was planned at the Museum of Modern Art. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) {{surrounded}} the building, in a protest led by Elaine Parker. Gregg Kilday of the Los Angeles Times interviewed Larry Kardish, a museum staff member, and Kardish recalled that [...] "About halfway into the film about ten members of CORE showed up. They <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the aisles and were very belligerent. In my estimation they were determined not to like the film. Apparently some of their friends had read the script of the movie and in their belief it was detrimental {{to the image of}} blacks [...] The question-and-answer session with Bakshi that followed quickly collapsed into the chaos of a shouting match." [...] Animation historian Jerry Beck did not recall any disturbance during the screening, but said there were racist catcalls during the question-and-answer session, and Bakshi's talk was cut short. [...] "It wasn't much of a madhouse, but it was kind of wild for the Museum of Modern Art." ...|$|E
