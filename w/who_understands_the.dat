5|$|In the Mahabharata retelling, when Sugriva re-challenges Vali, Tara dissuades Vali {{from going}} to the fight and points out that Sugriva may have found a protector. Tara, {{described}} as lustrous like the moon, is praised by Vali as one <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> language of all creatures and is astute to clarify her statement. Tara warns him about Sugriva's alliance with Rama and the plotting of Vali's death {{at the hands of}} Sugriva and his advisers. Vali not only disregards Tara's advice, but also suspects Tara of cheating on him with Sugriva. Vali leaves, speaking harshly to Tara.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E

His ardent disciples Devavimal Gani composed Hira Saubhagya Kavya and another disciple Padmasagara composed Jagatguru Kavya in his honour. Both works of poetry written in Sanskrit were composed in 1590 C.E. and give an authenticate account of relationship of Suri with Akbar.

500|$|In 2013, The Islamic Society in Denmark {{stated that}} they regretted their visit to Lebanon and Egypt in 2006 to show the caricatures because the {{consequences}} had been much more serious than they expected. In August 2013, Ahmed Akkari expressed his regret {{for his role in}} the Imams' tour of the Middle East, stating [...] "I want to be clear today about the trip: It was totally wrong. At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." [...] Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." [...] A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said [...] "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad. We have not changed our position." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of the book's episodes {{have drawn}} {{attention}} for the insight they offer into the culture, structure and conflicts of traditional society before 1900. Commenting on this characteristic, Djuvara asserted: [...] "even {{if we take}} into account that the grown-up will embellish, transfigure, 'enrich' the memories of his childhood, how could we not recognize the sincerity in Creangă's heart-warming evocation of his childhood's village?" [...] The book stays true to life in depicting ancient customs: discussing the impact of paganism on traditional Romanian customs, Marcu Beza communicated a detail of Creangă's account, which shows how January 1 celebrations of Saint Basil opposed the loud buhai players reenacting a fertility rite to people preferring a quieter celebration. The work also offers details on the traditional roles of a rural society such as that of Humulești, in the context of social change. Muguraș Constantinescu highlights the important roles of old men and women within Nică's universe, and especially that of his grandfather and [...] "clan leader" [...] David Creangă. The latter, she notes, is an [...] "enlightened man" [...] displaying [...] "the wisdom and balance of the ripe age", a person able to insist on the importance of education, and a churchgoer who frowns on [...] "his wife's bigotry." [...] The seniors' regulatory role within the village is evidenced throughout the book, notoriously so in the episode where the boy captures a hoopoe who bothers his morning sleep, only to be tricked into releasing it by old man, <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> bird's vital role as village alarm clock.|$|E

[...] "To anyone <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> patois of the legal profession, {{there is no reason}} to assume — from the court's decision — that such testimony must have been given," [...] since the Franklin County judge could have overturned the athletic association's decision for a number of reasons and the column itself notes the denial of due process as the reason.|$|E
2500|$|Practical Education (1798) is a {{progressive}} work on education that combines {{the ideas of}} Locke and Rousseau with scientific inquiry. Edgeworth asserts that [...] "learning should be a positive experience and that the discipline of education is more important during the formative years than the acquisition of knowledge." [...] The system attempted to [...] "adapt both the curriculum and methods of teaching {{to the needs of}} the child; the endeavour to explain moral habits and the learning process through associationism; and most important, the effort to entrust the child with the responsibility for his own mental culture."

She is one of those actresses <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> power of a look, and the one of regret and then resignation that overtakes her when Leonard professes his love is steeped in sadness".

2500|$|Connectors are {{the people}} in a {{community}} who know {{large numbers of people}} and who are in the habit of making introductions. A connector is essentially the social equivalent of a computer network hub. They usually know people across an array of social, cultural, professional, and economic circles, and make a habit of introducing people who work or live in different circles. They are people who [...] "link us up with the world...people with a special gift for bringing the world together". They are [...] "a handful of people with a truly extraordinary knack [...] making friends and acquaintances". Gladwell characterizes these individuals as having social networks of over one hundred people. To illustrate, he cites the following examples: the midnight ride of Paul Revere, Milgram's experiments in the small world problem, the [...] "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" [...] trivia game, Dallas businessman Roger Horchow, and Chicagoan Lois Weisberg, a person <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> concept of the weak tie. Gladwell attributes the social success of Connectors to the fact that [...] "their ability to span many different worlds is a function of something intrinsic to their personality, some combination of curiosity, self-confidence, sociability, and energy".|$|E
2500|$|She {{also had}} her critics, {{particularly}} in her later years {{among the new}} generation of playwrights who advocated a more naturalistic style of acting. George Bernard Shaw wrote of the [...] "childishly egotistical character of her acting, which is not the art of making you think more highly or feel more deeply but the art of making you admire her, pity her, champion her, weep with her, laugh at her jokes, follow her fortunes breathlessly and applaud her widely when the curtain falls... It is the art of fooling you." [...] Ivan Turgenev wrote: [...] "All she has is a marvelous voice. The rest is cold, false, and affected; the worst kind of repulsive chic Parisienne!" [...] Russian dramatist Anton Chekhov, then a young medical student, was paying for his studies by writing reviews for a Moscow newspaper. He stated that [...] "We are far from admiring the talent of Sarah Bernhardt. She is a woman who is very intelligent and knows how to produce an effect, who has immense taste, <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> human heart, but she wanted too much to astonish and overwhelm her audience." [...] He wrote that in her roles, [...] "enchantment is smothered in artifice." ...|$|E
2500|$|During Guo Yuan's {{tenure in}} Wei Commandery, {{there was an}} {{incident}} where an anonymous person wrote libelous pamphlets and circulated them. Cao Cao, who hated defamatory behaviour, ordered Guo Yuan to investigate and find out who the culprit was. Guo Yuan kept the pamphlets and ordered his subordinates to keep it secret. After examining the pamphlets, he realised that they contained lines from the two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies". He instructed one of his subordinates: [...] "Wei Commandery is a big commandery. Even {{though it is a}} capital city, there are few scholars living here. These pamphlets can serve as something for the young to study. I want you to find three persons to study under the scholars." [...] After his subordinate found him three young men, Guo Yuan told them, [...] "You still have much to learn. The two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies" [...] are important works of literature, yet they are often neglected and very few scholars understand them. You should find a scholar <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies" [...] and ask him to teach you." [...] He then secretly gave them other instructions. The three men found a scholar who was well-versed in the two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies", got him to write an article, and passed it to Guo Yuan. Guo Yuan compared the scholar's handwriting with the handwriting in the pamphlets and saw that they were similar. He then arrested and questioned the scholar, who admitted that he was the culprit and confessed everything.|$|E

2500|$|Younge and Muhammad {{looked at}} all of the {{different}} sounds of Harlem, including hip-hop, jazz, blues, and psychedelic rock, to give each character [...] "their own theme and their own sound" [...] that was all still representative of the culture. For Luke Cage specifically, Coker noted that he is a character <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> roots of the modern culture, and understands where modern Harlem and hip-hop sensibilities originated, so Younge and Muhammad looked to the beginnings of modern hip-hop for his sound. For Cage's more dramatic or emotional moments, vocalist Loren Oden was used as [...] "kind of like [...] inner voice". For the character of Diamondback, opera singer Brooke deRosa, whom Younge had often worked with before, was used. To reflect the character Cottonmouth's status in the series as a musician who primarily plays the Fender Rhodes, the composers [...] "pretty much exclusively use Fender Rhodes keyboards for him. That is who he is." [...] The most difficult episode for the composers was the fourth, which features flashbacks to Cage's time in prison. They felt that the episode's temp music was [...] "all over the place, and it didn’t feel cohesive", and were unsure whether to illustrate the idea of an incarcerated black man using [...] "old slave-blues-type" [...] music, to go with a [...] "Bernard Herrmann–Alfred Hitchcock-type scary vibe", or to stick with [...] "straight hip-hop, '90s stuff". Younge offered that there was [...] "some intense thinking, but it wasn’t necessarily difficult to execute once we figured it out." ...|$|E
