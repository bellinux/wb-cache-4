25|$|Set {{off from}} Paris on Friday 21 June 1895 at 5.25am from the Porte Maillot, where Monsieur Haufert, {{timekeeper}} of the Union, {{gave us the}} starting signal, <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Bois de Boulogne towards Versailles. The weather was cold, that damp coldness of some mornings in June which makes you search for a light jacket and freezes your hands; but we were full of ardour, replete with good advice and lots of energy and it was happily that Richard and I on the tandem and our trainer Lambert on a bicycle started our long journey for the record from Paris to Agen.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that <b>we</b> <b>crossed,</b> <b>the</b> racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the other}} two plays {{that made up the}} trilogy that {{included}} Seven Against Thebes, Laius and Oedipus, and of its satyr play The Sphinx, few fragments have survived. [...] The only fragment definitively assigned to Oedipus is a line translated by Herbert Weir Smyth as [...] "We were coming on our journey to the place from which three highways part in the branching roads, where <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> junction of the triple roads at Potniae." [...] The only two fragments definitively assigned to The Sphinx were translated by Smyth as [...] "For the stranger a garland, an ancient crown, the best of bonds, as Prometheus said," [...] and [...] "The Sphinx, the Watch-dog that presideth over evil days." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 16, {{two days}} after the first ascent and the catastrophe, Jean-Antoine Carrel set out to crown Whymper's victory by proving that the Italian side was not unconquerable. He was {{accompanied}} by Amé Gorret, a priest who had shared with him the first attempt on the mountain back in 1857. Jean-Baptiste Bich and Jean-Augustin Meynet completed the party. Giordano would have joined them, but Carrel refused absolutely to take him with them; he said he would not have the strength to guide a traveller, and could neither answer for the result nor for any one's life. After hearing Sunday mass at the chapel of Breuil, the party started. Amé Gorret has described this ascent with enthusiasm: [...] "At last <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Col du Lion and set foot upon the pyramid of the Matterhorn!" [...] On the following day, the 17th, they continued the ascent and reached Tyndall's flagstaff. [...] "We were about to enter unknown country," [...] wrote Gorret, [...] "for no man had gone beyond this point." [...] Here opinions were divided; Gorret suggested ascending by the ridge and scaling the last tower straight up. Carrel was inclined to traverse {{to the west of the}} peak, and thence go up on the Zmutt side. Naturally the wish of Carrel prevailed, for he was the leader and had not lost the habit of command, notwithstanding his recent defeat.|$|E
2500|$|Posing as {{a married}} couple, Argüello and Khaled boarded the plane using Honduran passports—having {{passed through a}} {{security}} check of their luggage—and were seated in the second row of tourist class. Once the plane was approaching the British coast, they drew their guns and grenades and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance. According to Khaled, {{in an interview in}} 2000,"So half an hour (after take off) we had to move. We stood up. I had my two hand grenades and I showed everybody I was taking the pins out with my teeth. Patrick stood up. We heard shooting just the same minute and when <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> first class, people were shouting but I didn't see who was shooting because it was behind us. So Patrick told me 'go forward I protect your back.' So I went and then he found a hostess {{and she was going to}} catch me round the legs. So I rushed, reached to the cockpit, it was closed. [...] So I was screaming 'open the door.' Then the hostess came; she said 'she has two hand grenades,' but they did not open (the cockpit door) and suddenly I was threatening to blow up the plane. I was saying 'I will count and if you don't open I will blow up the plane.'" ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> lawn, Miss Halcombe {{looked at}} me significantly, and shook her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it will be}} no {{barrier between}} my ladies and <b>the</b> marauder, should <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> river, and travel on the right," [...] {{answered}} the Scot.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the neck," [...] he said. [...] "The log <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> {{river on}} is somewhere abreast of it. We surely can't {{have passed the}} thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{expected}} this. If <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> end of {{the hill}} going southeast, we would strike the sands somewhere abreast of the wreck?" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{left the}} room. As <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> hall, a gentleman came forward, {{and spoke to}} Mr. Bernard.|$|E
60|$|It {{was eleven}} o'clock when <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> wooden foot-bridge {{of the station}} and emerged upon the street.|$|E
60|$|Much {{time might}} have been saved had <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Mohawk to the southward, without venturing near the camps of the British.|$|E
6000|$|And as <b>we</b> <b>crossd</b> <b>the</b> Bateable Land, When to the English side we held, The first o {{men that}} we met wi, Whae sould it be but fause Sakelde! ...|$|R
60|$|But now <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Arve into a {{grove of}} pines, and direct {{our way to the}} ascent. We begin to thread a zigzag path {{on the sides of the}} mountain.|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect {{she is the}} Cayman and {{the other}} is the Lucia. It looks as if Musgrave had got <b>the</b> men. Shall <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> harbour and see the boats arrive?" ...|$|R
60|$|That night I slept little, but {{the very}} time I wanted to be awake--when <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi--I was slumbering soundly, and so missed it.|$|E
60|$|Thus <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> square, {{and went}} to the Duomo, to render thanks. We knelt at the altar-rail, and Gervasio knelt above us upon the altar's lowest step.|$|E
6000|$|... "Weel," [...] said Pete, [...] "they're surely nearer than I thought, {{and might}} see where <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> burn. There's nought for't but the shieling on the knowe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Bias River {{again we}} will talk of izzat,' Scott replied. 'Till that day thou and the policemen shall be {{sweepers}} to the camp, if I give the order.' ...|$|R
3000|$|... {{and read}} off the labels on arcs {{encountered}} (if <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> an arc, labelled x say, {{in the direction}} of its normal orientation, then we read x, whereas if <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> arc {{in the direction of}} its opposite orientation, then we read [...]...|$|R
50|$|The first camp we make, {{we shall}} {{call it the}} Quart Pot,Caboolture, then Kilcoy, and Colinton's Hut,We'll pull up at the Stone House, Bob Williamson's paddock,And early next morning <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Blackbutt.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> {{great divide}} and saw [...] The sun-lit valleys far below us wind; [...] Before us opened {{cloudless}} sky; the raw, [...] Gray rain swept close behind.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Vistula {{opposite}} Marienwerder, and had {{got as far}} as Riesenberg, when Major Legendre {{came into}} my room in the post-house with an open paper in his hand.|$|E
60|$|Here <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Wengern Alps to Grindelwald. The Jungfrau {{is right}} over against us--her glaciers purer, tenderer, more dazzlingly beautiful, if possible, {{than those of}} Mont Blanc. Slept at Grindelwald.|$|E
6000|$|Vanish, ye mists! Not yet do we repair [...] To {{the still}} {{country of the}} {{piercing}} air; [...] But seek, before <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> troubled seas, [...] An English hearth and Devon's waving trees.|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Bias River {{again we}} will talk of izzat," [...] Scott replied. [...] "Till that day thou and the policemen shall be {{sweepers}} to the camp, if I give the order." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yon," [...] said Pete, [...] "is Bewcastle dale, and I ken where we'll find {{a welcome}} when <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> water o' Line. But I'm {{thinking}} we'll keep the big flow in our left han'." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> lawn in {{the dying}} day No fairy {{led us to}} meet the May, But the very Goddess loved by lovers, In {{mourning}} raiment of green and grey.|$|E
60|$|But {{we never}} saved {{any more money}} in that way. When <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> river after that, we went over the toll-bridge, and we paid our pennies, like other {{sensible}} people.|$|E
60|$|When {{we reached}} the rectory gate, he had cooled a little. As <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> garden, he {{reminded}} me that I stood pledged to be present when the bandage was taken off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite true, Hans, but now I mean to show Zikali that I am not his messenger, {{for south}} or north or east or west. So to-morrow morning <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> river and trek for Natal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My advice," [...] said Karlsefin, [...] "is, that <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> {{river and}} get on yonder height, which from its {{position}} must needs overlook the camp of the savages, and there reconnoitre and form our plans." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There can't be {{any number}} of Injuns here," [...] said the elderly man who {{appeared}} to be in command. [...] "We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> great mountains." ...|$|R
