40|$|Rapid and {{unplanned}} {{growth of}} Kathmandu Valley towns {{over the past}} decades {{has resulted in the}} haphazard development of <b>new</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> with significant consequences on their public space. This paper examines the development of public space in the valley’s <b>new</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> {{in the context of the}} current urban growth. A case study approach of three <b>new</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> was developed to examine the provision of public space with data collected from site observations, interviews with neighbourhood residents and other secondary sources. The cases studies consist of both planned and unplanned <b>new</b> <b>neighbourhoods.</b> Findings reveal a severe loss of public space in the unplanned <b>new</b> <b>neighbourhoods.</b> In planned <b>new</b> <b>neighbourhoods,</b> the provision of public space remains poor in terms of physical features, and thus, does not support community activities and needs. Several factors, which are an outcome of the lack of proper urban growth initiatives and control measures, such as an overall drawback in the formation of <b>new</b> <b>neighbourhoods,</b> the poor capacity of local community-based organisations and the encroachment of public land are responsible for the present development of neighbourhood public space. The problems with ongoing management of public spaces are a significant issue in both unplanned and planned <b>new</b> <b>neighbourhoods...</b>|$|R
