5|$|On 7 September La Fleche {{ran in the}} St Leger on a <b>wet</b> <b>day</b> at Doncaster. Orme, who had {{returned}} from his problems to win the Eclipse Stakes started favourite, with La Fleche, ridden on this occasion by John Watts, strongly supported at 7/2. Watts settled the filly {{in the early stages}} as Orme set off in front. Just after the turn into the straight, La Fleche, travelling strongly, moved alongside her stable companion and then pulled clear. She won easily by two lengths from the fast-finishing Sir Hugo, with Orme fading into fifth. On 24 September, La Fleche ran against older and younger horses in the £10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse. Ridden by Barrett, she tracked the leaders until the straight, where she accelerated impressively to win by three lengths from Orvieto, with Sir Hugo unplaced.|$|E

Stieglitz photographed {{extensively}} on the trip, producing some of his early famous images such as A Venetian Canal, The Net Mender and A <b>Wet</b> <b>Day</b> on the Boulevard, Paris. While in Paris, Stieglitz met French photographer Robert Demachy, who became a lifelong correspondent and colleague. In London, Stieglitz met The Linked Ring founders George Davison and Alfred Horsley Hinton, both of whom remained his friends and colleagues throughout much of his life.|$|E
25|$|Shefflin {{made his}} senior {{competitive}} debut for Kilkenny on 21 February 1999 in a 0-14 to 1-9 league defeat by Cork. That campaign ended at the semi-final stage, however, Shefflin retained his {{place on the}} starting fifteen for the subsequent championship, making his provincial debut in a 6-21 to 1-14 semi-final trouncing of Laois. Kilkenny later faced Offaly in the provincial final. A huge 5–14 to 1–16 victory over their near rivals and reigning All-Ireland champions gave Kilkenny the win and gave Shefflin a first Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Kilkenny face Cork on 12 September 1999. In a dour contest played on a <b>wet</b> <b>day,</b> Cork trailed by 0-5 to 0-4 after a low-scoring first half. Kilkenny increased the pace after the interval, pulling into a four-point lead. Cork moved up a gear and through Joe Deane, Ben O'Connor and Seánie McGrath Cork scored five unanswered points. Kilkenny could only manage one more score – a point from a Shefflin free – and Cork held out to win by 0-13 to 0-12.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{investigates the}} interannual {{variability}} {{of the frequency}} of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> {{during the rainy season}} over southwestern Madagascar, and its associated regional and global circulation patterns. The number of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> was counted for each summer season (December to March) of the period 1971 to 2000 at four rainfall stations in southwestern Madagascar. For each station, the frequency of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> was correlated with ENSO indices, SIOD index, SST, 850 hPa geopotential height, zonal and meridional winds at the surface. Composite anomalies of moisture flux and moisture flux convergence at 850 hPa, 500 hPa omega and velocity potential at. 995 sigma level, using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, associated with El Niño events, La Niña events that occurred during the period of study were examined. Also, circulation anomalies during neutral years having anomalously high frequency of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> or anomalously low frequency of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> were analysed separately. It was found that the number of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> rarely exceeds half of the total days in summer for each station. Inverse relationship between the equatorial Pacific SST anomalies and the frequency of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> anomalies was identified. Statistics showed that years characterised by high frequency of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> often occur with La Niña seasons whereas years having low frequency of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> tend to occur with El Niño seasons. A strong relationship between the southern Indian Ocean SST and the frequency of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> was found at Ranohira (45. 3 ° E, 22. 5 ° S) and Toliara (43. 72 ° E, 23. 38 ° S). Increased number of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> over southwestern Madagascar is associated with low atmospheric pressure over the southern Mozambique Channel. Neutral years having anomalously high (low) frequency of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> are marked by northwesterly (southeasterly) moisture flux anomalies at 850 hPa over southwestern Madagascar...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effect of climate change on daily rainfall, {{especially}} on {{the mean number of}} <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> and the mean rainfall intensity. Assuming that the mechanism of daily rainfall occurrences follows the first-order Markov chain model, the possible changes in the transition probabilities are estimated by considering the climate change scenarios. Also, the change of the stationary probabilities of <b>wet</b> and dry <b>day</b> occurrences and finally the change in the number of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> are derived for the comparison of current (1 x CO 2) and 2 x CO 2 conditions. As a result of this study, the increase or decrease in the mean number of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> was found to be not enough to explain all of the change in monthly rainfall amounts, so rainfall intensity should also be modified. The application to the Seoul weather station in Korea shows that about 30 % of the total change in monthly rainfall amount {{can be explained by the}} change in the number of <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> and the remaining 70 % by the change in the rainfall intensity. That is, as an effect of climate change, the increase in the rainfall intensity could be more significant than the increase in the <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> and, thus, the risk of flood will be much highly increased...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that extreme precipitation events accounted for a disproportionate share of the nearly 2 % increase in precipitation in China over the period of 1960 - 2000. Michaels et al. challenged a similar finding in the USA, arguing that fixed-bin methods for analysing extreme events obscure underlying precipitation patterns, and proposing a method that focusses on trends of the 10 <b>wettest</b> <b>days</b> of the year. Applying this method to China, we find that trends of precipitation on the 10 <b>wettest</b> <b>days</b> are generally proportional to changes in annual total precipitation. Regionally, a disproportionate increase is observed in southwest China. While the greatest absolute increase in precipitation on the <b>wettest</b> 10 <b>days</b> is seen in east China, the trend {{as a percentage of the}} annual total is not statistically significant. In the other six climate regions, the annual total rainfall is increasing at a proportionally greater rate than the 10 <b>wettest</b> <b>days.</b> Seasonally, the changes in precipitation on the five <b>wettest</b> <b>days</b> show increasing trend both nationally and for most of the climate regions. The greatest absolute increase in precipitation on the <b>wettest</b> five <b>days</b> is seen in east China in both summer and winter half-years. Only in southwest China during the summer half-year do we see a significant, disproportional increase in the precipitation falling on the five <b>wettest</b> <b>days.</b> Nationally, there has been an increasing trend in the frequency of precipitation exceeding the long-term mean 97. 5 th percentile and 99 th percentile values. Although the annual increasing precipitation on the 10 <b>wettest</b> <b>days</b> corresponds with a similar increase in water vapour pressure in China nationally, regional results suggest that change in humidity is not the only factor that influences the changes in heavy precipitation.

500|$|When Harrison came to Washington, {{he wanted}} to show both that he was still the steadfast hero of Tippecanoe, and that he was a better educated and {{thoughtful}} man than the backwoods caricature portrayed in the campaign. He took the oath of office on Thursday, March 4, 1841, a cold and <b>wet</b> <b>day.</b> He wore neither an overcoat nor hat, rode on horseback to the ceremony rather than in the closed carriage that had been offered him, and delivered the longest inaugural address in American history. At 8,445 words, it took him nearly two hours to read, although his friend and fellow Whig Daniel Webster had edited it for length. After becoming the first head of state to have his photograph taken, Harrison then rode through the streets in the inaugural parade, and that evening attended three inaugural balls, including one at Carusi's Saloon entitled the [...] "Tippecanoe" [...] ball, which at a price of US$10 per person (equal to $ today) attracted 1,000 guests.|$|E
500|$|The {{journalist}} Ray Robinson {{wrote that}} [...] "of all Australian captains he came closest {{to being a}} disciplinarian". [...] Regardless, his team mates continued to select him as captain, trusting in his {{knowledge and understanding of}} the game. On a <b>wet</b> <b>day</b> during the 1899 tour, a delay in play saw some of the Australians accept an invitation to the Player's tobacco factory in Nottingham. While away, the weather cleared and play began with Darling leading a team of five Australians and five substitutes onto the field. Darling later called a team meeting that saw the culprits fined ₤5 for breaching team rules. His approach to the hard-drinking Ernie Jones was similarly tough. To ensure that the fast bowler would not drink to excess, he selected Jones as twelfth man in a match against an English county team. When Jones refused to play, a team meeting saw him facing expulsion from the team. Darling spoke to him privately and made it clear that without an apology to his team mates and a promise to curb his drinking, he would be on the next boat bound for Australia. The firm and prompt action had a lasting effect on team discipline during his time as Australian captain. Wisden noted that [...] "as a captain he inspired his men to reveal their best form." [...] As a captain he was a reformer, suggesting rule changes that included making six runs the reward for clearing the boundary rather than the entire ground, and using of sawdust to fill holes in bowler's run-ups.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the trends of extreme daily rainfall indices over the Indochina Peninsula from 1960 to 2007. The trends {{were obtained from}} high-resolution gridded daily rainfall data compiled by APHRODITE with coordinates of 4 °N– 25 °N and 90 E°– 112 °E. The indices were selected {{from the list of}} climate change indices recommended by ETCCDI, which is a joint group of WMO CCl, CLIVAR and JCOMM. The indices are {{based on the number of}} heavy rainfall days (≥ 10 mm), number of very heavy rainfall days (≥ 20 mm), number of extremely heavy rainfall days (≥ 25 mm), consecutive dry days (< 1 mm), consecutive <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> (≥ 1 mm), daily maximum rainfall, five-day maximum rainfall, annual wet-day rainfall total, Simple Daily Intensity Index, very <b>wet</b> <b>days,</b> and extremely <b>wet</b> <b>days.</b> The indices were simulated by calculating different extreme characteristics according to wet and dry conditions, frequency, and intensity. Linear trends were calculated by using a least squares fit and significant or non-significant trends were identified using the Mann–Kendall test. The results of this study revealed contrasting trends in extreme rainfall in eastern and western Indochina Peninsula. The changes in extreme rainfall events in the east primarily indicate positive trends in the number of heavy rainfall days, very heavy rainfall days, extremely heavy rainfall <b>days,</b> consecutive <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> and annual wet-day rainfall total, with significant trends at times. These events correlated with the northeastern monsoon that influences the Indochina Peninsula from October to February annually. The results in the west primarily indicate negative trends in consecutive <b>wet</b> <b>days,</b> where significant trends were correlated with decreasing number of annual wet-day rainfall total, heavy rainfall days, very heavy rainfall days, and extremely heavy rainfall days. Daily maximum rainfall, five-day maximum rainfall, very <b>wet</b> <b>days,</b> and extremely <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> show random positive (negative) significant (non-significant) trends, while the simple daily intensity index shows positive trends that dominate the southern part of the Indochina Peninsula, with some grids show significant trends...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to verify if the {{occurrence}} of dry and <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> are conditionally dependent on the sequences of the dry and <b>wet</b> three preceding <b>days,</b> in a rainfall homogeneous area, using the nonhomogeneous third-order Markov chains. The results showed that daily transition probabilities can be properly estimated from two-month aggregate data, and then adjusted by means of sinusoidal functions. Besides, it was evidenced that everyday rain events in that area are conditionally dependent on the sequences of the dry and <b>wet</b> three <b>days</b> previous to occurrences. The third-order nonhomogeneous Markov chains are an important instrument {{for the analysis of}} the dependence between sequences of dry and <b>wet</b> <b>days</b> in certain areas...|$|R

A game of two halves followed at Burnley on Good Friday; playing with the wind, Robertson opened the scoring for the visitors after four minutes and several shots hit the woodwork, but on change of ends Burnley forced the pace and had a goal disallowed before scoring the equaliser. The next day, Sheffield Wednesday took a 3–0 half-time lead playing into the sun and wind. Perhaps with the approaching FA Cup Final on their minds, they took it easy in the second half, but a weakened Small Heath team, with Fountain, Jones and Pratt replacing Hands, Haddon and Lester, were still unable to score. The Sheffield Independent picked out Leake at centre half as playing excellently, and the full-backs Oliver and Pratt as [...] "safe, but not too speedy". On Easter Monday, a goalless draw at West Bromwich Albion, thanks largely to Joe Fall and his defence, kept Small Heath out of the bottom two places with two games left to play.|$|E
