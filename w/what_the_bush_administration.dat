40|$|The {{relations}} between the United States and its traditional ally, Venezuela, experienced {{a turn for the}} worse during the presidency of George W. <b>Bush.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> reacted to <b>the</b> radical president Hugo Chavez with an increase in funding of the so-called democracy promotion in Venezuela and with a silent support of the unsuccessful coup in 2002. The long history of U. S. interventions in Latin America during the cold war gives ground to the criticism by many authors who see these steps as an attempt to get rid of a democratically elected president just because he is confronting the American vision about a political and economic system desirable for the region. This work focuses on democracy promotion as a tool of the U. S. foreign policy, which is on one hand related to the identity of the United States as a unique historical democratic experiment, but also reacts to a threat posed to the national interests by other states. It deals with the types of threats that Hugo Chavez could have possibly presented, and thus shows to <b>what</b> extent <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> used democracy promotion in a pragmatic way. The analysis of Chavez's actions in oil politics, economic integration and security issues, and its comparison with the trend in democracy promotion shows that the U.

5000|$|Aaron L. Friedberg, {{professor}} {{of politics and}} international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, believes U.S. strategy toward China has coupled engagement with balancing. [...] "The engagement half of this strategy has been geared toward enmeshing China in global trade and international institutions, discouraging it from challenging the status quo, and giving it incentives to become <b>what</b> <b>the</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> termed a 'responsible stakeholder' in the existing international system." [...] The other half attempts to maintain the balance of power, deter aggression, and mitigate any attempts of coercion. Friedberg believes more emphasis {{has been placed on}} the former and not the latter. [...] "The problem with the pivot is that to date it lacks serious substance. The actions it has entailed either have been merely symbolic, such as the pending deployment of a small number of U.S. marines to Australia, or have involved simply the reallocation of existing air and naval assets from other theaters." ...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{study of}} how the United States has used {{different}} diplomatic strategies towards Iran and North Korea. The concept of coercive diplomacy is defined and explained, in or-der {{to see if it}} has been used by the United States, and if so, to what extent. After giving a brief historical background between the U. S and the two countries, the study will put a fo-cus on <b>what</b> and why <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> has acted <b>the</b> way they have in their diplo-matic relation with Iran and North Korea. The study presents cases where you can see par-allels between strategies used, but also some significant differences. The latter part of the study will examine the reasoning behind the different strategies used. Conclusion drawn from this study was that, in the case of Iran, the United States has been forced to act in a certain way due to the other conflicts they are involved with in the region, i. e. the war in Iraq and the situation in Afghanistan. Due to the fear for North Koreas al-ready existing nuclear arsenal, the U. S. has shown a more restricted diplomatic policy to-wards the country, not wanting to push them towards starting a nuclear war...|$|R

The results of this sleuthing often find their way to the 9/11 families, and in particular, to the by now mythic Jersey Girls, as the leaders of the survivors' families have come to be called. The researchers are in many ways similar to the team Scott Armstrong, the former Washington Post reporter, recruited in the mid 1980s to uncover the roots of Reagan's secret Iran-Contra deals. ... At the hub of the 9-11 research is Paul Thompson's intricate timeline. ... Still other timelines delve into official 'lies' from 1979 forward. ... Derek Mitchell's aim is to keep the entries as neutrally written and as well sourced as he can." [...] In his 2005 book, The Five Unanswered Questions of 9/11, Ridgeway referred to Thompson's book, The Terror Timeline, as [...] "still the most comprehensive summary of the events related to the 9/11 attacks."

40|$|Barack Obama {{came into}} office {{promising}} a major departure from the policies of his predecessor regarding the so-called Global War on Terror. This paper compares {{the policies of the}} Bush and Obama administrations on four issues: 1) treatment of prisoners, particularly indefinite detention at Guantánamo Bay and trial by military commissions; 2) kidnapping, “extraordinary rendition,” and torture of terrorist suspects; 3) targeted killings by unpiloted aerial vehicles or “drones;” and 4) preventive wars and “humanitarian interventions. ” It considers four main indicators of change: 1) whether the Obama administration continued existing policies or stopped them; 2) whether it publicly stigmatized illegal practices or remained silent; 3) whether or not it investigated crimes of Bush officials and punished the perpetrators; and 4) whether the Obama administration expanded the practices of its predecessors. The fourth indicator is most relevant to the topic of drone attacks, where the administration extended the practice of targeting killing by drones in number, frequency, space, and by category of target beyond <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> did.

40|$|This {{review of}} Richard Posner 2 ̆ 7 s Not a Suicide Pact: The Constitution in a Time of National Emergency argues that Posner 2 ̆ 7 s {{particular}} brand of pragmatic utilitarianism is particularly ill-suited to constitutional interpretation, {{as it seems}} to negate the very idea of precommitment that is so essential to constitutionalism. Instead, Posner treats the Constitution as little more than an invitation to pragmatic policy judgment, and then employs that judgment through speculative cost-benefit balancing to find constitutionally unobjectionable most of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> has done thus far in the war on terror, including coercive interrogation, incommunicado detention, warrantless wiretapping, and ethnic profiling. Indeed, Posner 2 ̆ 7 s Constitution would permit the Administration to go much further than it has - among other things, he defends indefinite preventive detention, banning Islamic extremist rhetoric, mass wiretapping of the entire nation, and making it a crime for newspapers to publish classified information. All of this is permissible, Posner argues, because unless the Constitution bend[s] in the face of threats to our national security, it will break. Ironically, Posner reaches these results with a constitutional theory more in keeping with Chief Justice Earl Warren than Justice Antonin Scalia. Eschewing popular conservative attacks on judicial activism, Posner argues that given the open-ended character of many of the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s most important terms, it is not objectionable, but inevitable, that constitutional law is judge-made. He dismisses the constitutional theories of textualism and originalism favored by many conservative judges and scholars as canards. But having rejected textualism and originalism, Posner proceeds unwittingly to offer a book-length demonstration of what textualists and originalists most fear from constitutional theorists who emphasize the document 2 ̆ 7 s open-ended and evolving character. In Posner 2 ̆ 7 s approach, the Constitution loses almost any sense of a binding precommitment, and is reduced to a cover for judges to impose their own subjective value judgments on others. The review first discusses Posner 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of several specific security-liberty issues, in order to illustrate how his method works in concrete scenarios. I then turn to the broader implications his theory has for constitutional law, which in my view are quite dangerous...|$|E
