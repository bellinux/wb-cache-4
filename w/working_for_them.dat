5|$|While her car {{is being}} serviced, Amy checks into the B where she meets Val and Eric and {{claims to be}} a trainee nurse to get a discount; but tells Victoria that she is {{actually}} 16 and has run away from foster care. Victoria tries to sneak Amy out without paying but Val catches her so she offers to pay her debt by <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> The police arrive and inform Val that Amy stole her foster parents' car and she leaves with a social worker. Victoria stays in touch with Amy and when she runs away again, Victoria hides her in the B's basement. Val finds her and lets her stay but Eric insists she leave. Amy visits Val again and tells her that her foster parents have separated and she is moving to a care home. Amy locks herself in a bathroom and workers at the care home telephone Val, claiming she will not come out until Val arrives. Val arranges for Amy to stay at the B and later fosters her.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to helping Stone develop as an orator, the antislavery agency {{introduced her to}} a network of progressive reformers within the Garrisonian wing of the abolition movement who assisted her women’s rights work. In the fall of 1848, she received an invitation from Phoebe Hathaway of Farmington, New York, to lecture for the women who had organized the Seneca Falls women’s rights convention and the Rochester women’s rights convention earlier that summer. These rights convention provided continuity for the woman's rights movement, even though no official organization was actually formed prior to the Civil War. Most of the well-known leaders at the time attended these conventions, except {{for those who were}} ill or sick. The best-known of them, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone, met, and worked together harmoniously as they wrote, discussed, and circulated petitions for the woman's rights movement. Although Stone accepted and expected to begin <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> in the fall of 1849, the agency never materialized. In April, 1849, Stone was invited to lecture for the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society, and Lucretia Mott took advantage of her presence to hold Pennsylvania’s first women’s rights meeting on May 4, 1849. With the help of abolitionists, Stone conducted Massachusetts’ first petition campaigns for the right of women to vote and hold public office. Wendell Phillips drafted the first petitions and accompanying appeals for circulation, and William Lloyd Garrison published them in the Liberator for readers to copy and circulate. When Stone sent petitions to the legislature in February, 1850, over half were from towns where she had lectured.|$|E

25|$|Employees have a {{right under}} s94 of the Act not to be unfairly dismissed. This is {{probably}} the most important right, because it would usually be under an action after dismissal that a former employee would complain that his other rights were breached.

The official statistics of blacks killed in action are inaccurate. Most of the bodies were dumped in unmarked graves.

Concentration camp superintendents did not always record the deaths of black inmates in the camps.|$|E

When Kuipers' son {{and other members of the}} Resistance are captured, Ellis agrees to help by seducing local SD commander Hauptsturmführer Ludwig Müntze (Sebastian Koch), bleaching all of her hair blonde. Müntze invites her to a party at the local SD headquarters, and there, Ellis recognises Obersturmführer Günther Franken (Waldemar Kobus), Müntze's brutal deputy, as the SS officer who oversaw the massacre of her refugee party. She obtains a job as a secretary at the SD headquarters while also falling in love with Müntze, who, in contrast to Franken, is not abusive or sadistic. He realises that her hair is bleached and she is a Jew, but does not care. She also becomes friends with her Dutch colleague Ronnie (Halina Reijn), who collaborates with the Germans, <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> being sexually available to them (particularly Franken), and accepting stolen gifts from them.|$|E

25|$|There were {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} the operation of the contracts and the management of the men. During the period 1870–1875, power gradually transferred from the Provinces to the central government, partly because of the railway question. The Bill to abolish the Provinces was carried in October 1875 and implemented a year later. However, in the interim {{it was very difficult for}} Brogdens to get clear prompt decisions. Brogdens got less work than they had hoped and it became available more slowly than expected. Communications between UK and New Zealand were obviously slow so it was difficult to know how many men to send at any given time. Sometimes Brogdens could not find work for the men when they arrived. Men reneged on their promissory notes. There were disputes over working hours, wages and whether they should be paid when the weather stopped the work. Gradually the men drifted away. By August 1873, 2172 English immigrants had been brought out. They included 1299 working-age men who were contracted to work for Brogdens for two years but only 287 of them were still <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Most of the men were agricultural labourers, rather than true navvies and they found local agricultural labour and working conditions more attractive than navvy work.|$|E
