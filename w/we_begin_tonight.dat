60|$|Miss Calista {{was still}} rather nervous {{when she went}} to bed that night, but she was a woman of sound sense and was {{determined}} not to give way to foolish fears. She locked doors and windows carefully, as was her habit, and saw that the fastenings were good and secure. The one on the dining-room window, looking out on the back yard, wasn't; in fact, it was broken altogether; but, as Miss Calista told herself, it had been broken just so for the last six years, and nobody had ever tried to get in at it yet, and it wasn't likely anyone would <b>begin</b> <b>tonight.</b>|$|R

The director explained the rewrite, [...] "We thought the idea was cool, but we did want to lighten it up. We all did." [...] Before filming <b>began,</b> <b>Tonight,</b> He Comes was retitled John Hancock, and it was eventually shortened to Hancock.|$|R

2500|$|Obama won the Iowa caucuses with 38% of the vote, over Edwards, 30%, and Clinton, 29%.

In a speech that evening, he defined change as the primary theme of his campaign and said, [...] "On this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do." [...] The delegate count was virtually tied, but Clinton's surprising third-place finish in the popular vote damaged her image as the [...] "inevitable" [...] nominee. However, she remained upbeat, saying [...] "This race <b>begins</b> <b>tonight</b> and ends when Democrats throughout America have their say. Our campaign was built for a marathon." [...] The following day, reports described [...] "panic" [...] among some Clinton donors, and rumors of a staff shake-up began to circulate. Biden and Dodd withdrew from the race.|$|R
