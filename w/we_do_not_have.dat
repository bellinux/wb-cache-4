Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked.

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{as a body}} {{remained}} {{devoid of}} any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats. Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, {{given the fact that}} <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E

25|$|Gerard {{was born}} in Cremona in {{northern}} Italy. Dissatisfied with the meager philosophies of his Italian teachers, Gerard went to Toledo. There he learned Arabic, initially {{so that he could}} read Ptolemy's Almagest, which had a traditionally high reputation among scholars, but which, before his departure to Castile, was not yet known in Latin translation. The first Latin translation was made, from the Greek around 1160 in Sicily. Although <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> detailed information of the date when Gerard went to Castile, it was no later than 1144.|$|E

The Board of Reference in South Australia includes business-people, members of the medical profession, as well as ministers and people from Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran, Uniting and other church groups. The rapid national growth of the party leading into this election and the late decision to contest in all seats possible, has meant that in some states there are candidates, with strong family values, who have been introduced to the party through the personal relationships they have from their involvement in community/church networks.|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas finds {{these two}} moral {{theories}} very limiting {{because they are}} quandary ethics, cases that rely on extreme situations. He believes {{that there needs to}} be a third reasoning that falls somewhere in between these two. He believes that the basic doctor-patient relationship should be built on trust and caring. This characterizes him as more of deontological thinker; however, he does believe in research on human beings. Hauerwas’s perspective is {{that there needs to be}} a middle ground between these two perspectives. The patient becomes dehumanized through research; however, without this research there would be little medical improvement. Hauerwas therefore believes this middle ground should focus on caring for the patient instead of curing. With this, Hauerwas believes <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the moral understanding to handle current medicine.|$|E
25|$|The Western Wall {{served as}} the {{retaining}} wall {{of the first and}} second Temple. According to tradition, its sanctity is two-fold – it is the closest spot on earth to the location of the first and second Temples that Jews are allowed to access. Tradition holds that there are areas of the Temple Mount that are forbidden for any Jew in a state of ritual impurity to traverse. Since <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a Temple now, we cannot expunge ritual impurity, thus should a Jew walk atop the Temple Mount, he or she may be defiling certain sacred areas. In addition to the proximity to the Temple Mount, tradition holds that the Western Wall was built by donations made by the poor of Israel and that such self-sacrifice confers a special protection to the site. The Temple Mount is now occupied by the Al Aksa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. In Islamic tradition, Mohammed ascended to heaven from the Temple Mount.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{argued that}} our {{experiences}} are structured by necessary features of our minds. In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant {{believed that the}} concepts {{of space and time}} are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. One important consequence of this view is that our experience of things is always of the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses: <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> direct access to things in themselves, the so-called noumenal world. Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included the Critique of Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and the Critique of Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} Colombia had about 5 million inhabitants, {{with a large}} number of people not able to read or write, and {{communications}} between Colombia and the rest of the world were limited to a few commercial companies. The main route to the ports was by boat on the Magdalena river and it took at least two weeks to reach the coast. The carrying of mail, as well as its distribution, was in the hands of personnel and companies under contract to the government. The quantities printed were extremely small in comparison with any other country during that period. This is why Colombian stamps are nowadays very scarce and of great interest to philatelists. Of the 42 stamps, only seven complete sheets of stamps are recorded, and with some stamps a pair represents the largest multiple known. Various attempts have been made to reconstruct the remaining sheets of stamps, but even after 150 years this task has not been completed. There are various stamps for which <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> records of a single cover, another reason for collecting the very rare stamps of the classic period. At the end of the 19th century Colombia was very fashionable, which is also the reason why 39 of the 42 stamps have been extensively forged, mainly due to demand by collectors and because of the small quantities printed.|$|E

Timoshkina said that Canada's responses to human trafficking have been sporadic and that, even if a national action plan was implemented, Canada needed to begin engaging with other countries on this issue.

In response to a question about Iran's treatment of women and homosexuals, he asserted that women are respected in Iran and that [...] "In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country... In Iran, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> this phenomenon. I don't know who told you this." [...] The latter statement drew laughter from the audience.

500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so {{seems to me to be}} intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|There is {{evidence}} of ballads from this period. Some may {{date back to the}} late Medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century, including [...] "Sir Patrick Spens" [...] and [...] "Thomas the Rhymer", but for which <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> evidence until the eighteenth century. Scottish ballads are distinct, showing pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as the fairies in the Scottish ballad [...] "Tam Lin". They remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the eighteenth century led collectors such as Bishop Thomas Percy to publish volumes of popular ballads. The oppression of secular music and dancing began to ease between about 1715 and 1725 and the level of musical activity was reflected in a flood of musical publications in broadsheets and compendiums of music such as the makar Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table Miscellany (1723) and William Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius (1725).|$|E
500|$|Bothwell and Kilbourn {{describe}} Howe's speech {{opening the}} Pipeline Debate as [...] "probably {{the best of}} his career". He told the Commons that waiting a year would be imprudent, given the worldwide shortage of steel pipe, and unfair to those who owned natural gas wells in western Canada, which were presently capped. Howe told the House he believed this to be a great project, [...] "of truly national scope, which we must either launch now or see languish for years to come." [...] He completed his address by giving notice that the following day, the Government intended to invoke closure. Social Credit, with many members from Alberta, supported the bill, while the Tories and CCF engaged in weeks of bitter debate and parliamentary wrangling. This culminated on 1 June, dubbed by the Tories [...] "Black Friday", when Speaker René Beaudoin reversed a ruling he had made the previous evening which would have allowed the Opposition to continue the debate past the deadline. The Opposition accused the Speaker of yielding to Government pressure. The bill passed within the deadline, and construction on the pipeline began immediately. Howe wrote, [...] "I should not like to face a general election at this moment. Fortunately <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to." ...|$|E
