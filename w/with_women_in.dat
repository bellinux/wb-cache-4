She demonstrated <b>with</b> <b>Women</b> <b>in</b> Black against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp. She was heckled by three members of Women in Green as she arrived to meet with leading Israeli feminists.|$|E
5|$|Pedro's {{character}} {{was marked by}} an energetic drive that bordered on hyperactivity. He was impetuous with {{a tendency to be}} domineering and short-tempered. Easily bored or distracted, in his personal life he entertained himself with dalliances <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> addition to his hunting and equestrian activities. His restless spirit compelled him to search for adventure, and, sometimes in disguise as a traveler, he frequented taverns in Rio de Janeiro's disreputable districts. He rarely drank alcohol, but was an incorrigible womanizer. His earliest known lasting affair was with a French dancer called Noémi Thierry, who had a stillborn child by him. Pedro's father, who had ascended the throne as JoãoVI, sent Thierry away to avoid jeopardizing the prince's betrothal to Archduchess Maria Leopoldina, daughter of Emperor FranzI of Austria (formerly FranzII, Holy Roman Emperor).|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} hype related to {{commercials}} {{in the months}} leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like YouTube. Frito-Lay announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their Doritos brand and vote on the best one, which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two of the ads due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and a woman that feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their Chevrolet brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> it and stripping off their clothes and giving it a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans' disappointment that their teams' season was over.|$|E

Throughout the country, she met <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> support of his campaign, but remained doubtful of his chances of winning. The resentment toward the campaign continued with her rejecting any criticism of her son said in her presence and refused to watch any debates, a contrast to her husband's willingness to listen and his watching of every debate, creating friction between the couple.|$|E
25|$|Under English law {{effective}} {{during the}} {{ratification of the}} U.S. Constitution, including the Treason Act 1351, there were essentially five species of treason. Of the five, the Constitution adopted only two: levying war and adhering to enemies. Omitted were species of treason involving encompassing (or imagining) {{the death of the}} king, certain types of counterfeiting, and finally fornication <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the royal family of the sort which could call into question the parentage of royal successors. James Wilson wrote the original draft of this section, and he was involved as a defense attorney for some accused of treason against the Patriot cause.|$|E
25|$|Seward {{remained}} resolutely single {{throughout her}} life, despite many offers, and friendships, and was quite outspoken about {{the institution of}} marriage, not unlike her heroine in Louisa, a position that would later be echoed in the novels of her step-niece, Maria Edgeworth. She shunned both marriage and sexual love, as inferior to Aristotelian friendship, based more on equality and virtue. However she had friends of both genders, although only seeking romantic relationships <b>with</b> <b>women.</b> <b>In</b> 1985 Lillian Faderman suggested that her orientation was lesbian, although there is little known evidence of either the erotic or sexual, in her relationships, though the term relates more to twentieth rather than eighteenth century concepts of identity. However, since 1985 Seward remains within the lesbian poetic canon. However Teresa Barnard argues against this based more on examination of her correspondence than merely her poetry, while more recently Barrett has argued for it, based on other sources.|$|E

25|$|The United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve (WR) was the World War II women's {{branch of}} the United States Marine Corps Reserve. It was {{authorized}} by the U.S. Congress and {{signed into law by}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 30July 1942, yet the Marine Corps delayed the formation of the WR until 13February 1943. The law provided that members of the WR may be commissioned or enlisted in such ranks and ratings equal to the regular Marine Corps, and effective {{for the duration of the}} war plus six months. Its purpose was to release officers and men for combat and to replace them <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> shore stations. Ruth Cheney Streeter was appointed the first director of the WR. She was sworn in with the rank of major and later was promoted to a full colonel. After attending Bryn Mawr College, Streeter was involved in health and welfare work. The WR did not have an official nickname, as did the other World WarII women's military services, although many unofficial and uncomplimentary nicknames were used to describe the women.|$|E
25|$|Women {{participating}} in polygynous marriages share common marital problems <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> a monogamous marriage; however, {{there are issues}} uniquely related to polygyny which affects their overall life satisfaction and have severe implications for women's health. Women practicing polygyny are susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, and mental health complications. Among the Logoli of Kenya, the fear of AIDS or becoming infected with the HIV virus has informed women's decisions about entering polygynous marriages. Some view polygyny {{as a means to}} prevent men from taking random sexual partners and potentially introducing STDs into relationships. Interviews conducted with some of the Logoli tribe in Kenya suggested they feared polygynous marriages because of what they have witnessed in the lives of other women who are currently in such relationships. The observed experiences of some of the women in polygynous unions tend to be characterized by frequent jealousy, conflicts, competition, tensions, and psychological stresses. Some of the husbands fail to share love and other resources equally; and envy and hatred, and sometimes violent physical confrontations become {{the order of the day}} among co-wives and their children. This discourages women from entering a polygynous marriage. Research shows that competition and conflict can intensify to unbearable level for co- wives causing women to commit suicide due to psychological distress. Findings show that the wife order can affect life satisfaction. According to Bove and Valeggia, women who are senior wives often misuse their position to obtain healthcare benefits in countries one wife can become a recipient. The conflict between co-wives can attribute to the higher rates of mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and paranoia.|$|E

500|$|JC's Girls, {{also called}} the JC's Girls Girls Girls Ministry, is an Evangelical {{organization}} that calls itself [...] "a biblically-based Christian ministry". JC's Girls is less focused on seeking conversions than on communicating the message to women in the sex industry that Christians exist {{who are willing to}} non-judgmentally accept them. Initially, the organization focused on evangelizing to strippers and erotic dancers, but later began to engage <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> other areas of the sex industry, such as softcore pornographic models and call girls. The organization also diversified to support people with pornography addiction. Members of the organization evangelize at adult entertainment conventions and strip clubs.|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} in Madrid, and Clarke's love of theatrics, raised awkward {{questions about his}} sexuality. His arrest was somewhat hushed up at the time, which may have raised more questions than it prevented. There {{is no indication that}} Clarke was homosexual. He was involved in two bad relationships <b>with</b> <b>women.</b> <b>In</b> 1922 he met a Slavic woman called Nina in Wiesbaden, but she disappeared after Clarke smuggled currency to her friend in Bulgaria. Then in the late 1920s a woman in Sussex, who [...] "meant everything in the world" [...] to him, refused an offer of marriage. He often claimed to hate children and never married. Despite this Clarke was known for having beautiful female acquaintances, to whom his friends referred as [...] "Dudley's Duchesses".|$|E
500|$|Though {{television}} did {{not begin}} to use recurring homosexual characters until the late 1980s, some early situation comedies used a stock character that author Stephen Tropiano calls [...] "gay-straight": supporting characters who were quirky, did not comply with gender norms, or had ambiguous personal lives, that [...] "for all purposes should be gay". These included Zelda from The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, Miss Hathaway from The Beverly Hillbillies, and Jo from The Facts of Life. In the mid-1980s through the 1990s, sitcoms frequently employed a [...] "coming out" [...] episode, where a friend {{of one of the}} stars admits she is a lesbian, forcing the cast to deal with the issue. Designing Women, The Golden Girls, and Friends used this device <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> particular.|$|E
