5|$|Modern Sonic and Tails {{eventually}} {{meet their}} Classic counterparts, and form an alliance to restore their world. The two travel through locations from their past they find in <b>White</b> <b>Space,</b> restoring them to normal. They rescue {{many of their}} friends, including Knuckles, Amy, Rouge, Cream, Blaze and the Chaotix, while battling old enemies for the Chaos Emeralds. The two eventually confront Classic and Modern Eggman, who overpower them using the Time Eater. However, the two Sonics use the Chaos Emeralds to transform into their super forms and defeat the Time Eater, restoring the timeline to normal. Everyone resumes celebrating Modern Sonic's birthday while Classic Sonic and Tails bid farewell and return to their time. Meanwhile, both Classic and Modern Eggman are left trapped in <b>White</b> <b>Space.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in Sonic Colors, Doctor Eggman is left {{stranded}} {{in outer space}} with his robot henchmen Orbot and Cubot. A mysterious time-traveling entity known as the Time Eater appears; Eggman, realizing its potential, uses it {{to go back in}} time and team up with his past ("Classic") self. The two convert it to a robot to erase their past defeats from history. The Time Eater proceeds to attack Classic Sonic as he travels through Green Hill {{at the beginning of the}} original Sonic the Hedgehog, and interrupts a birthday celebration being held for the present ("Modern") Sonic by his friends, scattering them. Modern Sonic awakens in <b>White</b> <b>Space</b> and rescues Tails after traveling through Green Hill.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> identification {{is an important}} milestone for the wide deployment of next generation cognitive wireless networks. However, spectrum holes detection tools used for <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> discovery are still either in the infancy stage or too expensive to enable massive <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> exploitation. Building upon cheap hardware equipment, this paper presents experiments conducted {{in the town of}} Trieste in Italy to sense the environment and find out which frequencies are not being used in a particular place and time-of-the-day. As a first step towards <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> exploitation, we believe that our experimental frequency exploration is an important milestone upon which <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> patterns recognition will be built with the aim of using these patterns in wireless network planning and management...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, {{the use of}} TV <b>White</b> <b>Spaces</b> for {{broadband}} communication has raised interest. <b>White</b> <b>Spaces</b> refer to regions of radio spectrum that are not used {{all the time in}} a specific geographical location. This paper presents the preliminary performance assessment of a TV <b>White</b> <b>Spaces</b> deployment in Malawi. The method used involved coverage simulations at the TV <b>White</b> <b>Spaces</b> frequencies, deployment of the network, monitoring and performance analysis. The preliminary results report usable coverage distance up to 7. 5 km which has allowed that remote students access the content of the university library and interact with the university faculty. The results thus show that the TV <b>White</b> <b>Spaces</b> technology can be used for broadband connectivity in rural and undeserved areas even when the WiFi and broadcasting spectrum is already utilized. A typical application that supports remote access of e-library resources from a rural Secondary School was developed using DSpace architecture over the <b>White</b> <b>Spaces</b> infrastructure is discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>White</b> <b>spaces</b> {{represent}} unoccupied TV spectrum {{that could}} be used for wireless communication by unlicensed devices, just like Wi-Fi and ZigBee devices can use the ISM bands. This low-frequency spectrum enables high bandwidth communication at long transmission ranges. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the benefits of <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> for sensor networks, with a view to overcoming the limitations associated with coverage, bandwidth, time synchronization, and scalability of cur-rent wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the applications and requirements of WSNs pose interest-ing challenges for adopting <b>white</b> <b>spaces.</b> In this chal-lenge paper, we address both the opportunities and the challenges of using <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> for WSNs. 1...|$|R

5|$|Comcast's {{office space}} was {{designed}} by Daroff Design + DDI Architects and Gensler. Comcast's space is topped by a conference room floor with the executive offices on the four floors below it. Below that are more offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging from the open <b>white</b> <b>space</b> of the upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include a glass and stainless steel staircase that wraps around a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Since the FCC’s {{approval}} of unlicensed use of TV <b>white</b> <b>spaces,</b> {{the issue of}} how to use these <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> has led to innovative technologies such as cognitive radios as well as a variety of spectrum policy proposals. There have been proposals to devise alternate rules for spectrum usage citing the overly conservative restrictions on secondary transmissions to protect incumbents. In this paper, instead, we propose to utilize <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> for a backhaul network for internet traffic based on existing restrictions. Using the available <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> and backhaul traffic demands in New Jersey as a case study, we evaluate the feasibility of such backhauling and present a methodology {{that can be used for}} other areas as well. Using a basic design involving fixed towers and directional antennas, our results show that the TV <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> can be an effective medium for radio backhaul as an alternative to the costly laying of optical fiber. We also show that meeting FCC requirements on sensing and avoiding harm to wireless microphones will have only a minor impact on capacity. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} partitioning-based placement tool {{in terms of}} the half-perimeter wirelength. In contrast to placement tools that exploit <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> to reduce the routing congestion, our placement tool exploits <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> to reduce the total wirelength. In particular, we generate <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> during the legalization step and treat <b>white</b> <b>spaces</b> as pseudo cells during the detailed placement step. On IBM benchmarks, our results are better than those of Feng Shui [1] and Capo [4] by 1. 8 % and 11. 1 %, respectively, on the average. Our results are comparable to those of Dragon [17]. On the synthetic benchmarks PEKO, our placement tool outperforms all other placement tools except mPL [6]. On another suite of synthetic benchmarks PEKU with global nets, our results are the best among all the existing public academic placement tools...|$|R

25|$|As {{part of his}} recovery, Dr. Jacobson advised Munch to only {{socialize with}} good friends and avoid {{drinking}} in public. Munch followed this advice {{and in the process}} produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons—honest portrayals devoid of flattery. He also created landscapes and scenes of people at work and play, using a new optimistic style—broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of <b>white</b> <b>space</b> and rare use of black—with only occasional references to his morbid themes. With more income, Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family.|$|E
25|$|To {{those who}} worked with him at Bazaar, the {{pinnacle}} of Brodovitch's career as a designer was the unfailing elegance of his pages. This elegance, combined with an element of innovation was the ideal mix for a fashion magazine. The quality that guaranteed his success was his devotion to the new, unending surprise and vitality. Frances MacFadden, Bazaars managing editor for much of Brodovitch's tenure, explained his working method:It was a pleasure to watch him work. He was so swift and sure. In emergencies, like the time the Clipper bearing the report of the Paris Collections was held up in Bermuda, his speed was dazzling. A quick splash or two on the cutting board, a minute's juggling of the photostats, a slather of art gum, and the sixteen pages were complete. His layouts, of course, were the despair of copywriters whose cherished tone poems on girdles or minks had to be sacrificed to his sacred <b>white</b> <b>space.</b> Just before we went to press, all the layouts were laid out in sequence on Carmel Snow's floor, and there, under his eye, re-arranged until the rhythm of the magazine suited him.|$|E
