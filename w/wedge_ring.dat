The observations were made using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array with a spatial resolution of ∼ 1. 5 ^" and sensitives about 0. 07 K and ∼ 0. 18 K for continuum and line, respectively. The observational {{results showed that the}} gas in the Orion KL region consists of jet-propelled cores at the ridge and dense cores at east and south of the region, shaped like a <b>wedge</b> <b>ring.</b> The outflow has multiple lobes, which may originate from an explosive ejection and is not driven by young stellar objects. Four infrared bubbles were found in the Spitzer/IRAC emissions. These bubbles, the distributions of the previously found H_ 2 jets, the young stellar objects and molecular gas suggested that BN is the explosive center. The burst time was estimated to be ≤ 1300 years. In the mean time, signatures of gravitational collapse toward Source I and hot core were detected with material infall velocities of 1. 5 km s^- 1 and ∼ 0. 6 km s^- 1, corresponding to mass accretion rates of 1. 2 × 10 ^- 3 M_/Yr and 8. 0 × 10 ^- 5 M_/Yr, respectively.

40|$|Many {{experiments}} measuring blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) data assume that the BOLD signal is predominantly linear in space and time. Previous investigations of temporal linearity have reported that the temporal BOLD response contains both linear and nonlinear components. Here, we used a novel method to investigate spatial linearity of BOLD within area V 1. The visual field was divided into regions shaped like <b>wedges,</b> <b>rings,</b> or the intersections of the <b>wedges</b> and <b>rings.</b> The appearance of a flickering checkerboard texture within each region was governed by an independent M-sequence. fMRI data were acquired as the human subjects maintained visual fixation on a central cross. The time series data from each voxel were crosscorrelated with every stimulus sequence to estimate each voxel’s BOLD responses to all independent regions of the visual field. Linearity by spatial summation was assessed directly by comparing responses to <b>wedges</b> and <b>rings</b> with sums of responses to component patches. The BOLD responses of voxels responding positively to stimuli, measured with independent stimuli subtending several degrees of visual angle, were well predicted by linear spatial summation...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of anatomical and growth ring analyses of Badenian fossil wood from the Roztocze region. All the wood specimens examined are classified as Taxodioxylon taxodii Goth. The growth rings of these woods are very narrow, and they vary consid-erably in width. Tracheids have large diameters and thin cell walls. The latewood zone is wide; the transition between early and latewood is gradual. Both false and <b>wedge</b> <b>rings</b> and also reaction wood zones are often found. These characteristics of the fossil wood make it a suitable aid to reconstructing the environmental conditions prevailing while the trees were alive. The environmental requirements of these ancient Roztocze trees are interpreted by comparison with those of their nearest living relatives, with the conclusion that they lived in waterlogged or temporarily flooded stands under seasonally changing environmental conditions and with a long growing season. The climate was warm and humid and characterized by significant variability, mainly as regards the amount of precipitation...|$|R
40|$|Partitioning of geo-spatial {{data for}} efcient {{allocation}} of resources such as schools and emergency health care services is driven by a need to provide better and more effective services. Partitioning of spatial data is a complex process that depends on numerous fac-tors such as population, costs incurred in deploying or utilizing re-sources and target capacity of a resource. Moreover, complex data such as population distributions are dynamic i. e. they may change over time. Simple animation may not effectively show temporal changes in spatial data. We propose the use of three temporal vi-sualization techniques- <b>wedges,</b> <b>rings</b> and time slices- to display the nature of change in temporal data in a single view. Along with maximizing resource utilization and minimizing utilization costs, a partition should also ensure the long-term effectiveness of the plan. We use multi-attribute visualization techniques to highlight the strengths and identify the weaknesses of a partition. Compara-tive visualization techniques allow multiple partitions to be viewed simultaneously. Users can make informed decisions about how to partition geo-spatial data by {{using a combination of}} our techniques for multi-attribute visualization, temporal visualization and com-parative visualization...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} introduced deer on understory vegetation in some islands of Haida Gwaii by studying affected and control individuals of Salal, Red Huckleberry and Sitka Spruce. We analysed how browsing influences architecture, growth in diameter and the occurrence of traumatic anatomical features on cross-sections. For shrubs, a classical dendrochronological assessment of deer impact on growth has limited value because of high inter-shrub variance in ring-width series. However, samples from deer affected populations are characterized by abrupt changes in growth, {{that are associated with}} browsing scars, and by non circular cross-sections with altered wood areas, eccentric piths and several discontinuous or <b>wedging</b> <b>rings.</b> Deer affected and control populations differed statistically in these features. In spruce, severe browsing causes a shrubby growth form, with an overbranched crown and narrow growth rings. Browsing significantly decreases apical growth. When an individual tree becomes released from browsing, a sudden change in ring growth occurs. We studied the length of the time necessary for that change to occur and show that browsing induces, on average, an 8 year increase in the recruitment period in windthrows, delaying the process of habitat closing...|$|R

40|$|Common juniper (Juniperus communis L.) {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} conifer in the world. However, tree-ring research dealing with this species is still scarce, mainly due to the difficulty in crossdating associated with the irregular stem shape with strip-bark growth form in older individuals and the high number of missing and <b>wedging</b> <b>rings.</b> Given that many different species of the same genus have been successfully used in tree-ring investigations and proved to be reliable climate proxies, this study aims to (i) test the possibility to successfully apply dendrochronological techniques on common juniper growing above the treeline and (ii) verify the climate sensitivity of the species with special regard to winter precipitation, a climatic factor that generally does not affect tree-ring growth in all Alpine high-elevation tree species. Almost 90 samples have been collected in three sites in the central and eastern Alps, all between 2100 and 2400 m in elevation. Despite cross-dating difficulties, we were able to build a reliable chronology for each site, each spanning over 200 years. Climate-growth relationships computed over the last century highlight that juniper growth is mainly controlled by the amount of winter precipitation. The high variability of the climate-growth associations among sites, corresponds well to the low spatial dependence of this meteorological factor. Fairly long chronologies and the presence of a significant precipitation signal open up the possibility to reconstruct past winter precipitation...|$|R

Teak is found on the island of East Timor but no information is available on teak growth from this region. A pure stand planted in 1940 - 50 in the North of East Timor and left unmanaged was studied. Fifteen trees were sampled in October-November 2003 and stem discs taken at three height levels of its height (1. 7 m, 9. 5 m and 18. 7 m), and cores were collected at DBH. Transverse surfaces of the discs and cores were polished for ring identification. Core cross sections were first digitized and disc cross sections were observed under the microscope. Three randomly selected radii were analyzed in each disc. Ring width measurement and ring counting were done using image analysis software. The distinction between heartwood and sapwood was performed macroscopically by colour difference, and heartwood radius and sapwood width were measured. The relationship between stem and heartwood radius was studied for each disc and heartwood percentage by radius was determined. Radial ring width curves are presented for the different axial positions within the stem, and ring width variability was analyzed. Growth rates were calculated and age-radius relationships were estimated using cumulative growth curves. Growth rings were large and well defined in the juvenile phase, reflecting the specie’s fast-growing character. The year-to-year variation of ring width showed a similar pattern among trees. Mean ring width ranged between 4. 3 - 7. 3 mm for the first 20 years and 3. 3 - 5. 1 mm for 30 to 45 years. Pith eccentricity was evident in the lower part of the stem and <b>ring</b> <b>wedging</b> occurred. On average, heartwood represented 84 % of the radius and sapwood contained 6 to 11 rings.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lapping {{process is}} {{characterized}} by its low speed, low pressure, and low material removal rate. This process is used in achieving finer surfaces and closer fits, correction of minor imperfections, and maintaining close tolerances. During the process of lapping, the mechanisms of surface formation and removal rate are decisively influenced by the movement type of the individual grains within the lapping abrasive. A gate valve is used to start and {{stop the flow of}} fluid. So the <b>wedge</b> and seat <b>ring</b> of a valve are in continuous pressure of fluid flow and due to opening and closing of valve these component get wear and they need lapping during reconditioning.

It will elaborate the effect of abrasive particals, working speed, surface roughness and other related parameters.

40|$|In Amazonian non-flooded forests with a {{moderate}} dry season, many trees do not form anatomically definite annual rings. Alternative indicators of annual rings, {{such as the}} oxygen (δ 18 Owc) and carbon stable isotope ratios of wood cellulose (δ 13 Cwc), have been proposed; however, their applicability in Amazonian forests remains unclear. We examined seasonal variations in the δ 18 Owc and δ 13 Cwc of three common species (Eschweilera coriacea, Iryanthera coriacea, and Protium hebetatum) in Manaus, Brazil (Central Amazon). E. coriacea was also sampled in two other regions to determine the synchronicity of the isotopic signals among different regions. The annual cyclicity of δ 18 Owc variation was cross-checked by 14 C dating. The δ 18 Owc showed distinct seasonal variations that matched the amplitude observed in the δ 18 O of precipitation, whereas seasonal δ 13 Cwc variations were less distinct in most cases. The δ 18 Owc variation patterns were similar within and between some individual trees in Manaus. However, the δ 18 Owc patterns of E. coriacea differed by region. The ages of some samples estimated from the δ 18 Owc cycles were offset from the ages estimated by 14 C dating. In the case of E. coriacea, this phenomenon suggested that missing or <b>wedging</b> <b>rings</b> may occur frequently even in well-grown individuals. Successful cross-dating may be facilitated by establishing δ 18 Owc master chronologies at both seasonal and inter-annual scales for tree species with distinct annual rings in each region...|$|R

The first type is rough set based classifier operating is highly discretized feature space. This is the consequence of the granular nature of knowledge representation {{in the theory of}} rough sets. The second type is artificial neural network, which processes information taken from continuous feature space. The paper deals with the issues which arise when these {{two types of}} feature space coexist in one pattern recognition problem. In particular these issues are illustrated in the example of system used for recognition of speckle images of intermodal interference. In both cases the feature extraction is performed with the use of holographic <b>ring</b> <b>wedge</b> detector, generating the continuous feature space. This is the feature space natural for application of the artificial neural network in a classification subsystem. However, the optimization of feature extractor proposed in earlier papers, uses rough set theory, requiring the discretization of conditional attributes generating the feature space. Therefore such optimization is more suitable for rough set classifiers. Advantages and drawbacks of both solutions are presented in the paper.

However, it remains largely untested how stable pRF estimates are over time. Here we measured the intersession reliability of pRF parameter estimates for the central visual field and near periphery, using a combined <b>wedge</b> and <b>ring</b> stimulus containing natural images. Sixteen healthy human participants completed two scanning sessions separated by 10 – 114 days. Individual participants showed very similar visual field maps for V 1 -V 4 on both sessions. Intersession reliability for eccentricity and polar angle estimates was close to ceiling for most visual field maps (r>. 8 for V 1 - 3). PRF size and cortical magnification (CMF) estimates showed strong but lower overall intersession reliability (r≈. 4 –. 6). Group level results for pRF size and CMF were highly similar between sessions.

40|$|Population {{receptive}} field (pRF) mapping {{is a widely}} used approach to measuring aggregate human visual {{receptive field}} properties by recording non-invasive signals using functional MRI. Despite growing interest, no study to date has systematically investigated the effects of different stimulus configurations on pRF estimates from human visual cortex. Here we compared the effects of three different stimulus configurations on a model-based approach to pRF estimation: size-invariant bars and eccentricity-scaled bars defined in Cartesian coordinates and traveling along the cardinal axes, and a novel simultaneous ‘wedge and ring’ stimulus defined in polar coordinates, systematically covering polar and eccentricity axes. We found that {{the presence or absence}} of eccentricity scaling had a significant effect on goodness of fit and pRF size estimates. Further, variability in pRF size estimates was directly influenced by stimulus configuration, particularly for higher visual areas including V 5 /MT+. Finally, we compared eccentricity estimation between phase-encoded and model-based pRF approaches. We observed a tendency for more peripheral eccentricity estimates using phase-encoded methods, independent of stimulus size. We conclude that both eccentricity scaling and polar rather than Cartesian stimulus configuration are important considerations for optimal experimental design in pRF mapping. While all stimulus configurations produce adequate estimates, simultaneous <b>wedge</b> and <b>ring</b> stimulation produced higher fit reliability, with a significant advantage in reduced acquisition time...|$|R
40|$|The {{visual field}} map is {{produced}} by mapping the active voxels of the visual cortex to a circular region corresponding to the points of the circular image. Activation of the voxels is determined by matching the fMRI time series to a time series based on a complex visual stimulus consisting of rotating <b>wedges</b> and <b>rings</b> expanding from the center to the boundary of the disk. Each scan (pre-surgical, post-surgical) produces {{a different set of}} points due to due to noise in the fMRI response to the visual target, hemodynamic variability and variability in the position of the head between scans and. A spatial-temporal non-homogeneous Poisson process is used to model the density of the active voxels.

Two types of changes may occur post-surgery: (1) thinning of the response or (2) actual “holes ” in the visual response.

40|$|High-resolution paleoclimatic {{data for}} West Africa {{are needed to}} provide context for {{contemporary}} climatic and ecological dynamics. Six hundred trees (22 botanical families, 43 genera and over 70 species) from semi-arid West Africa were evaluated for their suitability for dendrochronological research; specifically ring development. The samples were classified as 'potentially useful', 'problematic', or 'poor' based on the presence and distinctiveness of annual rings, ability to achieve crossdating between radii using skeleton plots on at least some samples, circuit uniformity, <b>ring</b> <b>wedging,</b> and variability of ring widths. Samples were classified as potentially useful if (a) they exhibited distinctive annual rings that could be identified and counted with little uncertainty and be independently verified by a second person {{with little or no}} error, (b) crossdating between radii could be successfully achieved, at least on some samples, (c) the rings were generally consistent throughout the stem cross section, (d) <b>ring</b> <b>wedging</b> was minimal (in the relative sense) or absent, and (e) the ring widths were variable, indicating the possibility of climatic sensitivity. Seven species, including five from the Caesalpiniaceae family (Cassia sieberiana, Cordyla pinnata, Daniella oliveri, Isoberlinia doka, Tamarindus indica), and one each from Mimosaceae (Acacia seyal) and Verbenaceae (Gmelina arborea) families, that most closely satisfied these criteria were classified as 'potentially useful'. The 'problematic' category includes those samples that satisfied some of the criteria but for which greater diligence is required to detect rings. Eight species from three families were classified in this category. Finally those samples on which ring detection appears futile given current methods and techniques were classified as 'poor'. Most of the samples classified as 'potentially useful' belong to three botanical families, Caesalpiniaceae, Mimosacae, and Verbenaceae. These results are consistent with the findings of other studies, and therefore support further investigation of the potential of West African trees for tree-ring analysis focusing on these families. Furthermore, inability to crossdate between trees and to explain several ring anatomical features underscores the pressing need for comprehensive field studies of cambial activity during the growing season, and for the identification of dormant seasons. This requirement, and other difficulties discussed suggest a need for increasing the local dendrochronological expertise in West Africa...|$|R

La teca se encuentra en la isla de Timor Leste, pero no existe información disponible sobre su crecimiento en esta región. Se estudió una plantación pura no manejada que fue establecida entre 1940 y 1950 en el Norte de Timor Leste.

Las curvas de variación del ancho de los anillos se presentan para las diferentes posiciones axiales dentro del tronco y se analizó la variabilidad del ancho de los anillos. Las tasas de crecimiento fueron calculadas y las relaciones de radio con la edad se calcularon usando las curvas de crecimiento acumulado. Los anillos de crecimiento eran grandes y bien definidos en la fase juvenil, lo que refleja el carácter de crecimiento rápido de esta especie.

The practices evaluated included different nitrogen levels (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N ha− 1) under both rainfed and irrigated conditions, as well as different combinations of plant population densities (300 000, 400 000, 500 000 and 600 000 plants ha− 1) and row spacing (0. 17, 0. 34 and 0. 50 m) under rainfed conditions. In most cases N, water and plant population density were the principal factors affecting the number of fibre rings and fibre bundles, but not the number of fibre wedges. Higher levels of N and more water increased the number of fibre rings and fibre bundles, whereas at higher plant population densities, these decreased. No clear trends were observed with regards to row spacing. The results of this study suggested that under local conditions, 150 kg N ha− 1 applied in two splits, 300 000 plants ha− 1 and 0. 50 m row spacing was the optimal combination of agronomic practices in terms of fibre development per plant. This paper gives a more complete explanation of fibre development in kenaf and shows how plant anatomy can be used as a tool to assess fibre development.

40|$|Fire-scarred {{cross-sections}} {{from coast}} redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) at two sites were dendrochronologically dated {{and used to}} develop a fire history. Redwood offers a challenge for dendrochronological study due to <b>ring</b> <b>wedging</b> and complacency. Crossdating was successful in 12 of 24 trees. The fire history was developed by comparison of fire scars and fire-associated ring characteristics (resin ducts, double latewood, growth releases, and ring separations) recorded in ring series. Using only dates of fire scars from the first fire in 1714 to the last in 1962, the mean fire interval (MFI) was 9. 9 years. MFI for the best represented presettlement segment 1714 - 1881 was 8. 0 years. Using all fire-associated ring features, MFI 1714 - 1962 was 7. 0 years and 1714 - 1881, 6. 0 years. Use of all fire-associated ring characteristics is argued {{to be a more}} accurate representation of past fire frequency. MFIs determined are less than others reported for coast redwood and suggest fire frequency in redwood may have been underestimated in past studies...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that human observers locate audiovisual (AV) signals in space by averaging auditory (A) and visual (V) spatial signals according to their relative sensory reliabilities (=inverse of variance) (Ernst Banks, 2002; Alais Burr, 2004). This form of AV integration is optimal in that it provides the most reliable percept. Yet, the neural systems mediating integration of spatial inputs remain unclear. Multisensory integration of spatial signals has previously been related to higher order association areas such as intraparietal sulcus (IPS) as well as early sensory areas like the planum temporale (Bonath et al., 2007). In the current fMRI study, we investigated whether and how early visual (V 1 -V 3) and higher association (IPS) areas represent A and V spatial information given their retinotopic organization. One subject was presented with synchronous audiovisual signals, at spatially congruent or discrepant locations along the azimuth and at two levels of sensory reliability. Hence, the experimental design factorially manipulated: (1) V location, (2) A location, (3) V reliability. The subject’s task was to localize the A signal. Retinotopic maps in visual areas and IPS were measured with standard <b>wedge</b> and <b>ring</b> checkerboard stimuli. At the behavioral level, the perceived location of the A input was shifted towards the location of the V input depending on the relative A and V reliabilities. At the neural level, the cue locations represented in retinotopic maps were decoded by computing a population vector estimate (Pouget et al., 2000) from the voxels’ BOLD responses to the AV cues given the voxels’ preferred visual field coordinate. In early visual areas (V 1 -V 3), the decoded cue locations were determined by the V spatial signal but were independent from the A spatial signal. In IPS, the decoded cue locations were determined by the V and the A spatial signals if relative V reliability was low. In conclusion, our results suggest that the brain represents AV spatial location in IPS in qualitative agreement with reliability-weighted multisensory integration...|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{the primary}} visual cortex (V 1) {{as a result of}} stroke or other brain {{diseases}} can lead to a loss of conscious vision in the contralateral visual hemifield. Cortical blindness affects many activities on a patient's daily life and {{is considered to be a}} heavy burden while there are few, if any, options for rehabilitation and recovery. A much debated issue is whether the visual cortex is able to reorganize after injury in adult human subjects, and if so, what may be the mechanism of reorganization. Here we apply an important new approach introduced by Dumoulin and Wandell (Doumoulin SO, Wandell BA, Population receptive field estimates in human visual cortex, Neuroimage 39, 2008), which uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the aggregate receptive field properties of neuronal populations voxel by voxel in the visual cortex. The purpose of this study is to compare receptive field measurements in patients with cortical lesions with controls and to investigate whether these measurements change following injury. Patients were fixating in the magnet and fMRI measurements were obtained during the presentation of standard visual stimuli used in retinotopic mapping (rotating <b>wedges,</b> expanding <b>rings,</b> horizontally and vertically moving bars). The patient’s intact hemisphere, as well as normal subjects were used as controls. In some controls an area of the stimulus was obscured (“artificial scotoma”) to simulate as much as possible the real scotoma of the patients. Preliminary results suggest that receptive field measurements obtained in patients and in subjects examined under the artificial scotoma condition differ from measurements obtained in controls under the normal visual stimulation condition. We are in the process of obtaining further control tests and measurements to confirm these findings and to assess to what degree they correspond to cortical reorganization. Future research will focus on using these methods to study the capacity of various visual rehabilitation training methods to induce visual cortex reorganization...|$|R
5000|$|Historically, in Europe, {{from the}} pre-Roman period on, the rings {{composing}} {{a piece of}} mail would be riveted closed to reduce the chance of the rings splitting open when subjected to a thrusting attack or a hit by an arrow. Up until the 14th century European mail was made of alternating rows of round riveted rings and solid rings. Sometime during the 14th century European mail makers started to transition from round rivets to wedge shaped rivets but continued using alternating rows of solid rings. Eventually European mail makers stopped using solid rings and almost all European mail was made from <b>wedge</b> riveted <b>rings</b> only with no solid rings. Both were commonly made of wrought iron, but some later pieces were made of heat-treated steel. Wire for the riveted rings was formed by either of two methods. One was to hammer out wrought iron into plates and cut or slit the plates. These thin pieces were then pulled through a draw plate repeatedly until the desired diameter was achieved. Waterwheel powered drawing mills are pictured in several period manuscripts. Another method was to simply forge down an iron billet into a rod and then proceed to draw it out into wire. The solid links would {{have been made by}} punching from a sheet. Guild marks were often stamped on the rings to show their origin and craftsmanship. Forge welding was also used to create solid links, but there are few possible examples known; the only well documented example from Europe is that of the camail (mail neck-defence) of the 7th century Coppergate helmet. Outside of Europe this practice was more common such as [...] "theta" [...] links from India. Very few examples of historic butted mail have been found and it is generally accepted that butted mail was never in wide use historically except in Japan where mail (kusari) was commonly made from butted links.|$|R
40|$|Research {{into the}} {{organization}} of high-level visual cortex has mainly used discrete object classes (eg faces and buildings). In contrast, {{the lower levels of}} the visual cortex have also been studied using phase-encoding techniques with gradually changing rotating <b>wedges</b> and expanding/contracting <b>rings.</b> The gradual stimulus changes cause traveling waves on the cortical surface, and time delays of each cortical location are related to stimulus preference. We propose to extend this method to study higher-order properties of visual objects. We validated this method with a face/house morphing continuum. We also included contracting/expanding rings cut out from natural scenes. Face- and house-selective regions (fusiform face area or FFA; parahippocampal place area or PPA) were defined with traditional block-design localizers. The method worked as intended: activity in FFA corresponded to presentation of face(-like) stimuli, and activity in PPA corresponded to the presentation of building(-like) stimuli. Additionally, confirming existing literature with discrete object classes, activity in FFA and PPA was time-locked to the presentation of foveal and eccentric rings, respectively. The results, however, contradict large-scale continuous maps across the ventral visual stream. Nevertheless, the results show that phase-encoding techniques can be applied to stimuli with feature variations more suited to investigate high-level visual regionsstatus: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The next {{match was}} the WWE World Heavyweight Championship {{contract}} Money in the Bank ladder match involving Kofi Kingston, Jack Swagger, Rob Van Dam, Dolph Ziggler, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins. During the match, Ambrose pushed a ladder, causing Kingston {{to fall off}} the top rope onto Swagger, Ziggler and Van Dam. Van Dam executed a Rolling Thunder Senton on Rollins, who was lay on a ladder <b>wedged</b> in the <b>ring</b> corner. Swagger performed a Powerbomb off a ladder on Van Dam, which was followed by Ambrose performing a Suplex off the ladder on Rollins. Ambrose injured his shoulder, leading to him being taken backstage by medical personnel. Kingston performed a Back Body Drop on Rollins atop a ladder, causing Rollins to fall onto another ladder bridged between the ladder and the ropes. Ziggler executed a Zig Zag onto a ladder on Kingston. Ziggler attempted to retrieve the briefcase but Rollins hit Ziggler with a chair. Rollins attempted to retrieve the briefcase but Ambrose came back out and hit Rollins with the chair. Ambrose attempted to retrieve the briefcase but Kane {{came down to the}} ring and executed a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver on Ambrose. Rollins retrieved the briefcase to win the match.|$|R
