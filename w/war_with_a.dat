5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Ruanda-Urundi (of which Rwanda formed the northern part) as a UN Trust Territory after the Second World <b>War,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mandate to oversee eventual independence. Tension escalated between the Tutsi, who favoured early independence, and the Hutu emancipation movement, {{culminating in the}} 1959 Rwandan Revolution: Hutu activists began killing Tutsi and destroying their houses, forcing more than 100,000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. In 1961, the suddenly pro-Hutu Belgians held a referendum in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy. Rwanda was separated from Burundi and gained independence in 1962. Cycles of violence followed, with exiled Tutsi attacking from neighbouring countries and the Hutu retaliating with large-scale slaughter and repression of the Tutsi. In 1973, Juvénal Habyarimana took power in a military coup. Pro-Hutu discrimination continued, but there was greater economic prosperity and a reduced amount of violence against Tutsi. The Twa remained marginalised, and by 1990 were almost entirely {{forced out of the}} forests by the government; many became beggars. Rwanda's population had increased from 1.6million people in 1934 to 7.1million in 1989, leading to competition for land.|$|E

5|$|Design {{work on the}} Sachsen class {{began in}} 1872 and lasted until 1874. The ships were {{intended}} {{to operate in the}} Baltic Sea as a primary component of an integrated coastal defense system proposed by General Albrecht von Stosch, the Chief of the Admiralty. Stosch designated the ships Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes), denoting their intended use. In the event of <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> superior naval power and the imposition of a naval blockade, the Sachsen-class ships would sortie from fortified bases to attack the blockaders. They also had the task of breaking up landing attempts. The German railway network linked the bases so ground forces could be transferred to the sites of enemy landings.|$|E
5|$|Göring (who {{controlled}} Rheinmetall-Borsig) supplied {{arms to the}} Republicans; {{shipped to}} Greece supposedly for their use, the arms were transferred by Bodosakis to ships supposedly sailing to Mexico. He was also supplying the Nationalists, who got the best and latest weapons while the Republicans got the oldest and least serviceable. This supply peaked in 1937–38. Nationalists identified 18 vessels to Republican ports from 3 January 1937 and 11 May 1938, and estimated that Goering received the equivalent of one pound sterling per rifle. An earlier shipment from Hamburg to Alicante on 1 October 1936 by the Welsh ship Bramhill had 19,000 rifles, 101 machine guns and more than 20 million cartridges for the CNT militia in Barcelona. Nazi Germany also helped the propaganda <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gift of a Telefunken transmitter for the newly created national radio service.|$|E
