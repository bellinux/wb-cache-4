50|$|Wild lupine is {{the sole}} larval food source of the Karner blue butterfly. Adult Karner blue {{butterflies}} obtain nectar from several native and nonnative species. Karner blue butterflies have been reported feeding on the nectar of 41 different species in a single study in west-central Wisconsin. Broods differ significantly in the species used for nectaring, likely {{due to differences in}} their phenology. Several blackberries have been documented as food sources for the spring brood, while spotted beebalm, <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus alba), and flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), are widely cited sources of nectar in the summer. Common cinquefoil (Potentilla simplex) is used as a nectar species for both broods. Karner blue butterflies' preferred nectar species may include butterfly weed in New York and Michigan and lyrate rockcress (Arabis lyrata), lanceleaf tickseed (Coreopsis lanceolata), <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover,</b> and northern dewberry (Rubus flagellaris) at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Differences in nectar species used between male and female Karner blue butterflies and across locations have been reported. Other often mentioned nectar sources include New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), wild lupine, goldenrods (Solidago spp.), and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa).|$|E
50|$|Acorns are {{commonly}} eaten by brush mice {{wherever they are}} available. Arthropods and cutworms (Protorthodes rufula) are also eaten throughout the year. A variety of fruits and seeds from Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), pinyon, California buckeye, manzanita (A. patula and A. viscida), silktassel (Garrya spp.), oneseed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), hackberries (Celtis spp.), New Mexico groundsel (Senecio neomexicanus var. neomexicanus), trailing fleabane (Erigeron flagellaris), annual sunflower (Helianthus annuus), broom snakeweed, common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), western yarrow (Achillea millefolium), <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus albus), threenerve goldenrod (Solidago velutina), prickly-pear, desert wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) are eaten throughout the year when available. Other plant parts, such as leaves, stems, flowers, pollen cones, and new sprouts are typically eaten in lower quantities than other foods. Fungi are typically consumed when other foods are scarce. Infrequently, stomach contents of brush mice contained pieces of mammals, birds, and fence lizards (Sceloporus spp.).|$|E
40|$|<b>White</b> <b>sweetclover</b> and {{narrowleaf hawksbeard}} are nonindigenous {{invasive}} plant species in Alaska that are rapidly spreading, including into {{areas that are}} otherwise free of nonindigenous plants. There has been concern that native moose could be dispersing germinable seed from these plants after ingestion. To address this concern, a study was conducted involving tame moose at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station, Matanuska Experiment Farm, Palmer, AK. Objectives were to determine if seeds from these two plant species could survive mastication and digestive passage through moose, whether this passage impacted seed germination, and whether seed passage rates {{were the same as}} similar sized Cr-mordanted fiber. In this study, narrowleaf hawksbeard seed rarely survived mastication and digestion with only five seedlings recovered from 42, 000 germinable seed fed to the moose. About 16 % of germinable <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> seed (3, 595 of 22, 000) fed to the moose produced seedlings. Most of the sweetclover seedlings came from feces produced 2 and 3 d after feeding. In two moose, sweetclover seedlings were grown from fecal material that was passed 11 d after feeding, raising the possibility that seeds could be transported long distances after ingestion. Cr-mordanted fiber passage did not closely follow seedling producing seed, possibly because time in the rumen might reduce seed germination. Once roadsides in Alaska become infested with <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover,</b> moose can then serve as a transport vector of these weeds into river channels and floodplains, which are distant from roads. This information will impact <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> management programs and alert land managers to the potential for other instances of wildlife-mediated seed dispersal...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of nitrogen-fixing nodules of the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, especially {{the early stages}} of root hair deformation and curling, infection thread formation, and nodule initiation, has been well studied from a genetic standpoint. In contrast, the factors important for the colonization of surfaces by rhizobia, including roots-an important prerequisite for nodule formation-have not been as thoroughly investigated. We developed conditions for analyzing the ability of two fast-growing rhizobia, Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae, to produce biofilms on abiotic surfaces such as glass, plastic microtiter plates, sand and soil as a prelude to characterizing the genes important for aggregation and attachment. Factors involved in adherence to abiotic surfaces are likely to be used in rhizobial attachment to legume root cells. In this report, we show that S. meliloti exopolysaccharide-deficient mutants as well as exopolysaccharide overproducers exhibit reduced biofilm phenotypes that show parallels with their nodulation abilities. We also investigated two flagella-less S. meliloti mutants and found them to have reduced biofilming capabilities. To investigate whether there was a symbiotic phenotype, we tested one of the Fla(-) mutants on two different S. meliloti hosts, alfalfa and <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover,</b> and found that nodule formation was significantly delayed on the latter...|$|E
40|$|The {{collection}} of symbiotic (sym) mutants of <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus alba Desr.) provides a developmental sequence of mutants blocked early in infection or nodule organogenesis. Mutant phenotypes include non-nodulating mutants that exhibit root-hair deformations {{in response to}} Rhizobium meliloti, mutants that form ineffective nodules lacking infection threads, and mutants that form infection threads and ineffective nodules. Mutant alleles from both the sym- 1 and the sym- 3 loci exhibited a non-nodulating phenotype in response to R. meliloti, although one allele in the sym- 1 locus formed ineffective nodules at a low frequency. Spot-inoculation experiments on a non-nodulating allele in the sym- 3 locus indicated that this mutant lacked cortical cell divisions following inoculation with R. meliloti. The auxin transport inhibitor N-(1 -naphthyl) phthalamic acid elicited development of pseudonodules at a high frequency {{on all of the}} sweetclover sym mutants, including the non-nodulating mutants, in which the early nodulin ENOD 2 was expressed. This suggests that N-(1 -naphthyl) phthalamic acid activates cortical cell divisions by circumventing a secondary signal transduction event that is lacking in the non-nodulating sweetclover mutants. The sym- 3 locus and possibly the sym- 1 locus appear to be essential to early host plant responses essential to nodule organogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Legume lectins {{have been}} {{proposed}} to have important symbiotic roles during Rhizobium-legume symbioses. To test this hypothesis, the symbiotic responses of transgenic alfalfa plants that express {{a portion of the}} putative alfalfa lectin gene MsLEC 1 or MsLEC 2 in either the antisense or sense orientation were analyzed following inoculation with wild-type Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021. MsLEC 1 -antisense (LEC 1 AS) plants were stunted, exhibited hypernodulation, and developed not only abnormally large nodules but also numerous small nodules, both of which senesced prematurely. MsLEC 2 -antisense plants were intermediate in growth and nodule number compared with LEC 1 AS and vector control plants. The symbiotic abnormalities of MsLEC 1 -sense transgene plants were similar to but milder than the responses shown by the LEC 1 AS plants, whereas MsLEC 2 -sense transgene plants exhibited symbiotic responses that were identical to those of vector and nontransgenic control plants. MsLEC 1 mRNA accumulation was not detected in nodule RNA by Northern blot analysis but was localized to alfalfa nodule meristems and the adjacent cells of the invasion zone by in situ hybridization; transcripts were also detected in root meristems. A similar spatial pattern of MsLEC 2 expression was found by using a whole-mount in situ hybridization procedure. Moreover, mRNAs for an orthologous lectin gene (MaLEC) were detected in <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus alba) nodules and root tips...|$|E
40|$|Expansins are {{a highly}} conserved group of cell wall-localized {{proteins}} {{that appear to}} mediate changes in cell wall plasticity during cell expansion or differentiation. The accumulation of expansin protein or the mRNA for specific expansin gene family members has been correlated {{with the growth of}} various plant organs. Because expansin proteins are closely associated with plant cell wall expansion, and {{as part of a larger}} study to determine the role of different gene products in the legume-Rhizobium spp. symbiosis, we investigated whether a Melilotus alba (<b>white</b> <b>sweetclover)</b> expansin gene is expressed during nodule development. A cDNA fragment encoding an expansin gene (EXP) was isolated from Sinorhizobium meliloti-inoculated sweetclover root RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers, and a full-length sweetclover expansin sequence (MaEXP 1) was obtained using 5 ' and 3 ' rapid amplification of cDNA end cloning. The predicted amino acid of the sweetclover expansin is highly conserved with the various alpha-expansins in the GenBank database. MaEXP 1 contains a series of eight cysteines and four tryptophans that are conserved in the alpha-expansin protein family. Northern analysis and whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses indicate that MaEXP 1 mRNA expression is enhanced in roots within hours after inoculation with S. meliloti and in nodules. Western and immunolocalization studies using a cucumber expansin antibody demonstrated that a cross-reacting protein accumulated in the expanding cells of the nodule...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. The nitrogen-fixing {{symbiosis}} between Rhizobiaceae and legumes {{is one of}} the best-studied interactions established between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The plant develops root nodules in which the bacteria are housed, and atmospheric nitrogen is fixed into ammonia by the rhizobia and made available to the plant in exchange for carbon compounds. It has been hypothesized that this symbiosis evolved from the more ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, in which the fungus associates with roots and aids the plant in the absorption of mineral nutrients, particularly phosphate. Support comes from several fronts: 1) legume mutants where Nod 2 and Myc 2 co-segregate, and 2) the fact that various early nodulin (ENOD) genes are expressed in legume AM. Both strongly argue for the idea that the signal transduction pathways between the two symbioses are conserved. We have analyzed the responses of four classes of non-nodulating Melilotus alba (<b>white</b> <b>sweetclover)</b> mutants to Glomus intraradices (the mycorrhizal symbiont) to investigate how Nod 2 mutations affect the establishment of this symbiosis. We also re-examined the root hair responses of the non-nodulating mutants to Sinorhizobium meliloti (the nitrogen-fixing symbiont). Of the four classes, several sweetclover sym mutants are both Nod 2 and Myc 2. In an attempt to decipher the relationship between nodulation and mycorrhiza formation, we also performed co-inoculation experiments with mutant rhizobia and Glomus intraradices on Medicago sativa, a close relative of M. alba. Even though sulfated Nod factor was supplied by some of the bacterial mutants, the fungus did not complement symbiotically defective rhizobia for nodulation...|$|E
40|$|Several nonnodulating, nonmycorrhizal (Nod−Myc−) mutants of Melilotus alba Desr. (<b>white</b> <b>sweetclover)</b> {{have been}} described. However, {{the details of}} their {{responses}} to Sinorhizobium meliloti have not been fully elucidated. We investigated rhizobial entry and colonization using Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy on the Masym 1 – 5 mutants and isolated an early nodulin (ENOD 40) gene from wild-type M. alba. We focused on Masym 3, the least responsive of the mutants to S. meliloti and VA-fungi, to determine its response to cytokinin. Cytokinin appears to be a downstream signal in the nodule developmental pathway based not only on our previous observations whereby Nod−Myc− alfalfa roots treated with cytokinin accumulated several ENOD gene transcripts, but also on recent reports showing the importance of cytokinin receptors for nodulation. Here we show that applying 10 − 6 M 6 -benzylaminopurine to uninoculated Masym 3 roots elicited ENOD 40 transcript accumulation. In addition, Masym 3 root hairs inoculated with either wild-type S. meliloti or Nod− S. meliloti expressing the trans-zeatin synthase gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens exhibited tip swelling, suggesting that cytokinin mediated this response. However, Masym 3 root hair tips swelled following inoculation with Nod− S. meliloti or after mock-inoculation, a response resembling the phenotype of root hairs, after handling, of the Medicago truncatula mutant, dmi 2. Mtdmi 2 is Nod−Myc− due to a defect in a gene encoding a Nodule Receptor Kinase (NORK). Like Mtdmi 2, the root hair swelling response appears in part to be mediated by touch because Masym 3 root hairs not contacted by either bacteria or drops of water or buffer remain elongated and do not exhibit tip swelling...|$|E
40|$|While {{boreal forest}} {{habitats}} {{have historically been}} relatively free from invasive plants, there have been recent increases in the diversity and range of invasive plants in Alaska. It is critical that we understand how disturbances influence invasibility in northern boreal forests, to avoid the economic damage other regions have experienced from invasive plants. Black spruce (Picea mariana) is the dominant forest type in interior Alaska, and wildfire is the dominant disturbance in these forests. Furthermore, disturbances {{in the form of}} management for fire suppression are common in forests close to urban areas. I surveyed recently burned, managed, and undisturbed black spruce forests for invasive plants to determine if fire and management facilitate invasive plant colonization. I also conducted an experimental seeding trial with three invasive plants common to Alaska (bird vetch (Vicia cracca), common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), and <b>white</b> <b>sweetclover</b> (Melilotus officinalis) in burned and mature black spruce forest to determine if fire facilitates invasive plant germination. To determine the effect of substrate type on invasive plant germination, I planted seeds on a variety of substrates in the burned forest. Results indicate that fire and fire suppression treatments promote invasive plant colonization, as invasive plants were observed in burned and managed areas, but not in mature stands. Analysis of environmental data taken at survey sites indicate that fire mediates invasibility through its effects on substrate quality. In burned stands, invasive plants are most likely to colonize areas of shallow post-fire organic depth. Results from the seeding trials were consistent with results from invasive plant surveys, with reduced germination in mature compared to burned forest, and no germination on the residual organic layer in the burned forest. The highest germination occurred on mineral soil in burned forest, indicating that severe fires that combust the organic layer are likely to increase invasibility. The {{results of this study suggest}} that invasive species control efforts should be prioritized to disturbed forests, particularly areas where the disturbance has exposed mineral soil...|$|E
