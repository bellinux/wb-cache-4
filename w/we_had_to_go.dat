5|$|The {{team was}} {{generally}} very well received outside London, {{and especially in}} north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted {{not so much on}} the field of play as off it".|$|E

500|$|The {{team had}} been {{listening}} to American hits and [...] "trying to measure up". They remixed American hip-hop and R songs, adding layers of melody to suit the European radio audience. In the wake of their early successes, the team had to choose whether to remain in Norway or move to pursue their goals: [...] "We knew that to make the records {{we really wanted to}} make, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to America." [...] Hermansen and Eriksen chose to produce records in the United States, while Rustan preferred to remain a producer in Norway because {{he did not want to}} leave his family behind.|$|E
500|$|On July 14, 1999, former drummer Gar Samuelson died {{of liver}} failure at age 41 in Orange City, Florida. Three days later, during Megadeth's {{performance}} at Woodstock 1999, Mustaine dedicated [...] "Peace Sells" [...] to Samuelson's memory. That month, Megadeth also recorded a cover {{version of the}} Black Sabbath's [...] "Never Say Die" [...] for the second Nativity in Black tribute album. The band began a world tour in support of Risk in September, playing with Iron Maiden during the European leg. Three months into the tour, Friedman announced his resignation from Megadeth, citing musical differences. Mustaine later said: [...] "I told [...] after Risk that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to our roots and play metal, and he quit." [...] In January 2000, guitarist Al Pitrelli, formerly of Savatage and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, became Friedman's replacement.|$|E

500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone.

500|$|On July 25, 1967, Forrestal reached Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin {{and joined}} Operation Rolling Thunder, the 1965–1968 air interdiction and {{strategic}} bombing campaign against North Vietnam. [...] The alpha strikes flown from Forrestal were against specific, pre-selected targets such as arms depots, factories, and bridges. [...] They were quite dangerous, {{due to the}} strength of the North Vietnamese air defenses, which used Soviet-designed and -supplied surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and MiG jet interceptors. [...] McCain's first five attack missions over North Vietnam went without incident, and while still unconcerned with minor Navy regulations, McCain had garnered the reputation of a serious aviator. McCain and his fellow pilots were frustrated by the micromanagement of Rolling Thunder from Washington; he later wrote, [...] "The target list was so restricted that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and hit the same targets over and over again... Most of our pilots flying the missions believed that our targets were virtually worthless. In all candor, we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn't have the least notion of what it took to win the war." ...|$|E
500|$|U2 {{returned}} to Dublin for Christmas, where they discussed their future together and all recommitted to the group. Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded {{better than they}} originally thought. They briefly {{returned to}} Berlin in January 1991 to finish their work at Hansa. Reflecting on their time in Berlin, Clayton called the sessions a [...] "baptism of fire" [...] and said, [...] "It was something <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through to realize {{what we were trying}} to get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city—that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down." [...] Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain [...] "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.|$|E

It's definitely a club banger. You know the first time I heard it, I went bananas." [...] At Pat Field's Disco Party in New York, she told Universal Music Group executives [...] "I know in my gut that it felt good. Nobody could take my thoughts away from that. I doesn't need anyone else to tell me it's good". The song was released on May 17 and May 18, 2010 to the iTunes Stores, in France and the United States, respectively. The official extended dance remix was released alongside the main single on May 18, 2010. In the United Kingdom, [...] "Commander" [...] was planned for a June 28, 2010 release. Love and Rowland would later unveil plans for an urban mix of the song with a slower, smoother sound. American rapper Nelly heard the new version in its early stages and asked if he could be featured on the remix. It was released as part of the UK Remixes EP. as well as the second U.S. remixes EP. The official press from Universal Motown Records on May 19, 2010 confirmed that [...] "Commander" [...] would serve only as the [...] "international lead single", leading to speculation another song would be released domestically. This speculation was confirmed when the Ne-Yo-penned, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off" [...] was set to impact on radio stations in the United States. However those plans were changed and on June 29, 2010 two singles were serviced to impact in the United States. [...] "Grown Woman" [...] was sent to urban contemporary/rhythmic contemporary radio stations and [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] for pop radio.|$|E
500|$|The {{team working}} on the film {{commuted}} between the project and the series, pushing both to scheduling extremes (changes to Bigger, Longer & Uncut were made as late as two weeks before its release) and fighting constantly with Paramount. [...] "They wanted a Disney kind of trailer. We said no. They put together a totally un-South Park MTV video for the song 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?'. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> make our own version." [...] Paramount's first trailer for the film advertised it, according to Parker, as [...] "the laughiest movie of the summer", and promoted {{it in a way}} that South Park [...] "was completely against". Parker and Stone told the studio of their dissatisfaction with the trailer, and upon the creation of a second trailer with minimal changes, the two broke the videocassette in half and sent it back in its original envelope. [...] "It was war," [...] said Stone in 2000. [...] "They were saying, 'Are you telling us how to do our job?' And I was going, 'Yes, because you're fucking stupid and you don't know what you're doing.'" [...] In another instance, Paramount took the songs from the film and created a music video to be aired on MTV. In accordance with broadcast standards, the studio cut various [...] "R-rated" [...] parts out and edited it into what Parker described as a [...] "horrible little medley with all humor absent". The studio sent the original tape to Parker and Stone over a weekend, with plans to send it to MTV on Monday to prepare it for airtime beginning Wednesday. Stone instead put the tape in the trunk of his car and went home. Paramount threatened to sue Parker and Stone in response. Parker also noted that the title was an obvious innuendo, and [...] "they (the MPAA) just didn't get it".|$|E

2500|$|Bernal Díaz del Castillo barely {{tries to}} conceal that the much-repeated Indians had {{something}} to do with the project, although authors such as Salvador de Madariaga prefer to conclude that the objective was a much more noble one, [...] "to discover, to occupy ourselves and do things worthy of being told". But, in addition, governor Diego Velázquez himself wanted to participate in the project and he lent the money to build a boat, [...] "...with the condition that [...] <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with three boats to some little islets that are between the island of Cuba and Honduras, that are now known as the islands of Los Guanaxes , and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in arms and fill up the boats with a cargo of Indians from those islets to serve as slaves" [...] (here Bernal uses the word esclavos, [...] "slaves", against Velázquez, whereas he had previously avoided speaking of the Indians whom Velázquez had promised to him). The chronicler immediately denied that he admits this pretension of Velázquez's: [...] "we responded to him that what he said was not the command of God nor king, to make free men into slaves". If we are to believe Bernal, the governor sportingly admitted the denial and despite all this lent the money for the boat.|$|E

2500|$|Khan has {{published}} six works of non-fiction, including an autobiography co-written with Patrick Murphy. He periodically writes editorials on cricket and Pakistani politics in several leading Pakistani and British newspapers. It was revealed in 2008 that Khan's second book, Indus Journey: A Personal View of Pakistan, had required heavy editing from the publisher. [...] The publisher Jeremy Lewis revealed in a memoir {{that when he}} asked Khan to show his writing for publication, [...] "he handed me a leatherbound notebook or diary containing a few jottings and autobiographical snippets.

2500|$|The {{alternate}} {{version was}} leaked {{on the internet}} via Napster and other methods in the early 2000s, and was also played infrequently on some radio stations. According to then-member of the Boys' backing band, Tommy Smith, the album version is the [...] "original version"; the alternate version was recorded because the chorus of the album version did not make sense. In an interview with HitQuarters, Andreas Carlsson confessed that the song was a play with words. According to him, [...] "When Max {{came up with the}} original idea for the song, it already had the line 'you are my fire, the one desire'. We tried a million different variations on the second verse, and finally <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to what was sounding so great, 'you are my fire, the one desire'.
