5|$|American Samoa is a {{territory}} of the United States that lies in the South Pacific Ocean {{to the far east}} of Australia. The dependency's debut at the Olympics was at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Between 1988 and 2008, American Samoa sent a delegation to participate at seven Olympic games (six Summer Olympics and one Winter Olympics), not missing a single Summer Olympics since its first time in the competition. In 2008, American Samoa's delegation was composed of four athletes, including two women, which is the greatest number of <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> competed for American Samoa at any one games.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{argued for}} girls and boys to have equal {{recreational}} and educational opportunities and for <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fair wages. Dalton advocated exercise for girls, including swimming and shooting. She believed that women {{had the right to}} suffrage, education, property, control over their earned money, and custody of their children. She was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued that parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did not permit, to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E

5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
5|$|Magdalena Moshi also {{received}} a universality place for the women's 50 m freestyle, but {{failed to make the}} semi-finals at the Games, placing equal 67th (with Angelika Ouedraogo of Burkino Faso) overall. She had been placed in heat four, which was won by Colleen Furgeson of the Marshall Islands, and came in fifth with a time of 29.44. Born in Australia, but raised in Tanzania, she trained in the country of her birth and was a veteran of the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics as Tanzania's first female swimmer. This made her one of only two Tanzanian <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> competed in three editions of the Games as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E

In 2007, {{they were the}} first to win two consecutive Women's World Cup titles and they achieved the biggest win in tournament history by beating Argentina 11–0. Germany is also the only team to win either the men's or women's World Cup without conceding a goal and the only country to win both World Cups. With 14 goals, Prinz became the overall top goalscorer at the Women's World Cup in 2007, and she and Brazilian Marta are the only <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> received the FIFA World Player of the Year award at least three times.|$|E
5|$|Women in India {{also did}} not have rights to their families' or husbands' property. Periyar fought {{fiercely}} for this and also advocated for the <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the right to separate or divorce their husbands under reasonable circumstances. While birth control remained taboo in society of Periyar's time, he advocated for it {{not only for the}} health of women and population control, but for the liberation of women.|$|E
5|$|During Linnaeus' time it {{was normal}} for upper class <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing {{campaign}} to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In {{the tradition of the}} period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' dissertation was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.|$|E

She is one of three <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been both Miss Missouri USA and Miss Missouri and the only Missourian to have been Miss USA. Her first runner-up finish at Miss Universe was the best placement in the 2000s and was the best United States placement between Brook Mahealani Lee's Miss Universe 1997 competition victory and Olivia Culpo's Miss Universe 2012 pageant win.|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> long hair and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E
5|$|South Africa {{have played}} 71 Twenty20 Internationals under six {{different}} captains. In 2009, South Africa {{were one of}} eight teams which competed in the inaugural ICC Women's World Twenty20 held in England, but failed to progress beyond the group stage. They played their first home match during the 2009–10 season, hosting West Indies for three matches {{as part of a}} larger tour. South Africa's first victory in Twenty20 International cricket came against Ireland in August 2008. Mignon du Preez is South Africa's all-time leading run-scorer with 1166 runs. Shandre Fritz is the only South African <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> scored a century in a Twenty20 International, scoring the second highest total in any women's Twenty20 International with a score of 116 not out against the Netherlands.

5|$|South Africa {{have played}} twelve Test matches, seven {{of which were}} played pre-exclusion, and five of them post-exclusion. Two players, Jennifer Gove and Lorna Ward, have played all seven matches pre-exclusion. Yvonne van Mentz, Brenda Williams and Mignon du Preez are the only South African <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> scored Test centuries, while Jean McNaughton, Lorna Ward and Sunette Loubser have all taken five-wicket hauls, with Ward doing it on three occasions. This list {{contains}} every woman who has played Test cricket for South Africa. The list is initially arranged in {{the order in which}} each player won her Test cap. Where more than one player won her first Test cap in the same Test match, those players are initially listed alphabetically by the surname the player was using {{at the time of the}} match.|$|E
5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E
