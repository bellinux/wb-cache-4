40|$|We {{present a}} survey of policy search {{algorithms}} in reinforcement learning. The foundations of reinforcement learning and {{the historical development of}} policy search are discussed. Policy search algorithms are divided and examined along three axes. First, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> search methodology utilized by <b>the</b> algorithm. Second, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> representational structure of <b>the</b> policy.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on three essays that study operational strategies to manage environmental uncertainty. In essay 1, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> {{costs and benefits of}} different supply chain structures in managing multi-product demand uncertainty. In particular we analyze the strategic performance of delayed differentiation and early differentiation in supply chains. We demonstrate that the conventional wisdom arguing for delayed differentiation may be strategically unsound. In essay 2, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> role of strategies that mitigate the effects of product development uncertainty. We create a multi-year data-set on product development pipelines and the financial performance of large pharmaceutical firms. <b>We</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> effect of risk mitigating strategies, such as development of backup compounds on the financial performance of firms and find that these strategies lead to superior financial outcomes. In essay 3, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> role of demand uncertainty on a multi-tier supply chain. <b>We</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> structure of advanced purchase discounts that lead to efficient information transmission in the supply chain. We characterize their benefits, costs and provide recommendations on administration of advance purchase discounts. ...|$|R

I have already explained to you that the secret of these tasteful and beautiful walks, so near, and sometimes in the very heart (as at Dresden) of the large German towns, is in the circumstance of the old fortifications being destroyed, and the space thus obtained having been wisely appropriated to health and air. Leipsig, in particular, enjoys a picturesque garden, where formerly there stood nothing but grim guns, and frowning ramparts.|$|E
