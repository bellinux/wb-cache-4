25|$|The abadan {{island is}} an {{important}} area {{for the production of}} datepalms, but it has suffered from the invasion of the Iraqi army during the Iraq-Iran war. The palm groves are irrigated by tidal irrigation.

At low tide, the canals drain the unused part of the water back to the river.|$|E
25|$|A {{tidal bore}} is a {{hydraulic}} jump which {{occurs when the}} incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travel up a river or narrow bay against {{the direction of the}} current. As is true for hydraulic jumps in general, bores take on various forms depending upon the difference in the <b>waterlevel</b> upstream and down, ranging from an undular wavefront to a shock-wave-like wall of water. Figure 3 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to shallow upstream water – a large elevation difference is observed. Figure 4 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to deep upstream water – a small elevation difference is observed and the wavefront undulates. In both cases the tidal wave moves at the speed characteristic of waves in water of the depth found immediately behind the wave front. A key feature of tidal bores and positive surges is the intense turbulent mixing induced by the passage of the bore front and by the following wave motion.|$|E

40|$|A {{hydrological}} model simulation {{study has}} been carried out in the Elbe basin using detailed data obtained from the relevant Czech and German institutes. The LISFLOOD model has been calibrated for the Elbe river basin using these data. Using this calibrated model setup, two studies have been carried out in the framework of the Action Plan for Flood Protection of the International Commission for the Protection of the Elbe River (ICPER/IKSE/MKOL). The 2002 flood without dyke-breaks: The first part of the simulation study was a simulation of the 2002 summer flood without dyke-breaks. It has been estimated here that without dyke-breaks, the discharge in {{the lower part of the}} Elbe river would have been 2. 6 ¿ 9. 1 % higher (117 - 384 m 3 /s). <b>Waterlevels</b> would have between 18 and 54 cm higher. Reservoir Study: The planned scenario for Saale reservoir steering investigated here does not have any significant influence on the discharge of the Elbe. The influence of changing the flood storage in the Bleiloch and Hohenwarte reservoirs in winter from 40 to 55 Mm 3 and in summer from 25 to 35 Mm 3 on river discharge has been assessed. The scenario results have shown that this planned scenario for reservoir steering in the Saale cascade does not have a significant influence on the discharge of the river Elbe, for the investigated flood events in 1994, 2002 und 2003 at gauging station Calbe-Griezehne (lower Saale). Also the influence on the discharge in the river Elbe is marginal: changes in peak discharge downstream the Saale-confluence are in the order of 0. 2 % (difference in discharge 4 - 8 m 3 /s). Furthermore, the influence of the Vltava reservoir cascade was investigated using two datasets provided by the Czech Hydro-Meteorological Institute (CHMI) : one dataset with the actual situation and steering of the Vltava cascade, and a scenario without the Vltava cascade. For floods with a magnitude such as in August 2002, the difference between the scenario with and without the Vltava cascade is between 1. 6 and 3. 7 % (84 - 171 m 3 /s) in the German part of the Elbe river. Polder and Dyke-shift Study: The potential effects of 5 polders and 20 dyke-shifts on discharge in the river Elbe have been estimated. The main outcomes are the following: The 20 planned dyke-shifts reduce the peak discharge of the 2002 summer flood with 1. 3 - 4. 6 % (58 - 202 m 3 /s). <b>Waterlevels</b> would have been 10 - 31 cm lower. For the 2006 flood the results are similar in character, but lower in magnitude. The measures reduce the peak discharge of the 2006 spring flood with 0. 4 - 1. 3 % (10 - 48 m 3 /s). <b>Waterlevels</b> would have been 3 - 10 cm lower. The 5 planned polders and 20 planned dyke-shifts simulated here, reduce the peak discharge of the 2002 summer flood with 3. 9 - 10. 8 % (178 - 469 m 3 /s). <b>Waterlevels</b> would have been 23 - 74 cm lower. For the 2006 flood, the results are again lower: the measures reduce the peak discharge of the 2006 spring flood with 1. 2 - 3. 3 % (31 - 121 m 3 /s). <b>Waterlevels</b> would have been 8 - 21 cm lower.

40|$|Determining how to {{approach}} the rate boundary of the Gaussian interference channel in practical system is a big concern. In this paper, a distributed rate-splitting (DRS) scheme is proposed {{to approach}} the rate region boundary of the Gaussian interference channel.

Therefore, an iterative multiple <b>waterlevels</b> water-filling algorithm (IML-WFA) is developed to efficiently reach the SE of the non-cooperative game. The existence of SE is established for the game. Numerical examples show that the rate-tuples achieved by the DRS {{are very close to}} the boundary of the well-known HK region.

40|$|An ice-control {{structure}} (ICS) for Cazenovia Creek in West Seneca, NY will arrest breakup ice {{runs and}} hold the resulting ice jams essentially throughout typical breakup events. While this will reduce flood damages downstream, <b>waterlevels</b> upstream of the ICS will be higher than currently experienced, and upstream property owners must be compensated. We used HEC-RAS to model ice-jam hydraulics upstream of the ICS {{as a function of}} water discharge and ice volume. The initial ice-jam volume was the ice supply estimated from field data, less 30 % transport losses. At each discharge, we reduced the available ice volume to account for melting by water entering the jam at 1 °C and minor washouts through the ICS at a rate of 1 % of discharge. Although these appear to be conservative choices, ice losses become increasingly significant as discharge rises. They thus {{play an important role in}} reducing the stream-wise extent of high water caused by the ICS.

40|$|The Friesche Zeegat area is {{situated}} in the northeast of the Netherlands and {{is a part of}} the Dutch Waddensea. The Friesche Zeegat area consists of the barrier Islands Ameland and Schiermonnikoog and a part of the Waddensea. Drainage occurs through tidal channels and the major tidal inlets. Seawards of the inlet, an ebb-tidal delta occurs. The ebb-tidal delta, the tidal inlet, the adjacent parts of the islands and the channels and shoals of the inlet system represent one dynamic entity. Developments in different parts are strongly related and are largely defined by the tidal prism. By the artificial closure of the Lauwersea in 1969, the tidal prism decreased with a third. Due to the closure, the ebb-tide delta was suddenly too large and started to erode. Also the main tidal channels were too deep relative to the decreased tidal prism. This system hasn't found a equilibrium until now. The main inlet system has greatly changed in these years. This reduction has made the wave influence much bigger on the morphology of the whole area. In this master thesis, current and water/eveIs in the Friesche Zeegat area for the nothwest storm of October 9, 1992 are simulated with the numerical model WAQUA. The simulations are validated with measured currents and <b>waterlevels.</b> The calculated currents and <b>waterlevels</b> are used as input in the wave model SWAN on 6 : 00, 9 : 00 and 12 : 00 am around high water. The Friesche Zeegat Model is being calibrated and a sensitivity analysis has been carried out for several parameters, which influence the water motion. The simulation model WAQUA is developed by Rijkswaterstaat, and is able to perform two-dimensional (horizontal) computations The field measurements are delivered by the RIKZ (National Institute for Coastal & Marine Management) in a very preliminary format. These field measurements are sorted, checked and compared with the calculations. The current measurements are also sorted for the database system DONAR of Rijkswaterstaat and in this format these measurements will be available for future users. The sensitivity study of the Friesche Zeegat Model demonstrates a dominant influence of the boundary conditions on the water movement in the whole area (especially Northsea boundaries). An new (more recent for the year 1992) digital elevation model has been constructed for the Friesche Zeegat Model to make more accurate calculations for the current fields. Many tidal flats appear in the Waddensea area of the model. The WAQUA model seem not able to simulate the flooding and drying procedure of several gridpoints in the process of the calculations. A solution has been found in using an altered calculation routine of solVing the continuity equation. This altered calculation routine increased the simulation time of the calculations with 30 percent. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
