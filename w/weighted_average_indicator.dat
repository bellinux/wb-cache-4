40|$|Snow, an {{effective}} insulator and a mediator of soil microclimate, determines the abundance and plant species richness {{patterns in the}} alpine life zone. The aims of this study are: first, to investigate the species composition of lichens and vascular plant species and relate it with microtopography at fine scale, second, to show the pattern of species richness of total plant species and other life forms with <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> snow <b>indicator</b> values and third, to investigate whether microtopography causes any significant differences in species richness for total plant species and other life forms. All species (69) in 151 plots of 4 m 2 in 23 transects {{were used in the}} analysis. I performed detrended correspondence analysis to explore how microtopographical gradient was related to the variation in the species composition. Afterwards, the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> snow <b>indicator</b> value was calculated and used as snow cover gradient. A generalised linear model was used to reveal species richness patterns along the snow cover gradient. One-way ANOVA was performed on the 69 plots, distributed on the 23 transects to identify topographic variability in species richness. DCA analysis reveals that the first axis represents the complex gradient from snow free ridge to wet snowbed habitats and the second axis represents a gradient from acidic to calcareous sites. Species richness for total plant species, vascular plant species and herbaceous plant species increased with increase in WASI value, whilst species richness for lichen species declined substantially towards the maximum <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> snow <b>indicator</b> value. In contrast, species richness for dwarf shrub species showed a unimodal relationship with hump shaped pattern against WASI. Lichen’s species richness is greater in ridge and less in snowbeds, while all other life forms follow the opposite trend. Here, liquid water availability determines species richness in mountains, particularly in my study which is controlled by snow cover and prevalent wind direction. The short growing season limits species richness, although there is enough available water, which shows that time is an important vector that determines the species richness along the microtopographical gradient. Hence, this study illustrates that small-scale data reveals local variations, which are overlooked when using regional scale data, but provide important knowledge on how to optimise predictions for plant species composition and richness in space and time...|$|R

Ground vegetation of 80 - 100 years old Pinus sylvestris L. stands attributable to Vaccinio-myrtillosa site type was chosen as an object. <b>Weighted</b> <b>averages</b> of <b>indicator</b> values for nitrogen (E N) close to the plant decline with the distance from the emission source. The relative share of nitrogen indicating species was significantly higher in the impact zone (E N = 2. 7) than in the control (E N = 1. 5). The increased abundance of nitrogen indicators in the forest ground vegetation could partly be attributed to an increase in atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the forests. <b>Weighted</b> <b>averages</b> of Ellenberg's <b>indicator</b> values for soil reaction (E R) along the study transect were not significantly correlated with the distance from "Achema". In the closest to "Achema" vicinity (2 km east and 5 - 8 km north-east) E R was significantly lower in comparison to the control (p L), there were no significant differences at different distances. In comparison to the control <b>indicator</b> the <b>averages</b> for light were higher but not significantly (p > 0. 05).

A permutation test on correlation coefficients revealed whether differences between methods were significant or not. Results: Optimization of a general weighting function did not produce a significantly higher correlation than disregarding cover and calculating the average as the arithmetical mean of indicator values. Giving a higher weight to species {{at both ends of}} the indicator scale and using indifferent species as indicators of mediocre conditions did improve the correlation significantly. Weighting species proportionate to their cover yielded a significantly lower correlation than the correlation obtained with the method that disregards cover.

The approach presented is an alternative to indicator Kriging. Soils are classified through a binary indicator function defined as 0 for a low and as 1 for a high conductivity soil. Estimates of the probability of occurrence of a high or low conductivity soil are made on a three dimensional grid. Each such estimate is formed as a local <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> of the <b>indicator</b> function values that lie within an averaging interval or bandwidth of the point of estimate.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} under certain conditions, adaptive one-factor-at-a-time (aOFAT) methods outperform more commonly used fractional factorial methods. This study sought to corroborate these claims by analyzing a case study of a real-life experiment. A full factorial experiment was conducted to collect data for simulations of fractional factorial and adaptive one-factor-at-a-time experiments. The experiment used a reconfigurable paper aircraft template with four three-level control factors. Results indicated that the exploitation of control factor interactions by adaptive one-factor-at-a-time occurred at similar rates as predicted by Frey and Wang (2006). AOFAT experiments proved particularly effective at avoiding factor levels that led to poor performance. with rates of avoidance approaching 100 % for the worst levels. When bias in the full factorial experiment was eliminated, aOFAT methods even returned a higher (<b>weighted</b> <b>average)</b> leading quality <b>indicator</b> value than full factorial methods. by Jeffrey B.

40|$|The <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> {{is by far}} {{the most}} popular {{approach}} to combining multiple forecasts of some future outcome. This paper shows that both for probability or real-valued forecasts, a non-trivial <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> of different forecasts is always sub-optimal. More specifically, it is not consistent with any set of information about the future outcome even if the individual forecasts are. Furthermore, <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> does not behave as if it collects information from the forecasters and hence needs to be extremized, that is, systematically transformed away from the marginal mean. This paper proposes a linear extremization technique for improving the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> of real-valued forecasts.

40|$|Abstract—Voting {{algorithms}} {{are used}} in a wide area of control systems from real-time and safety-critical control systems to pattern recognition, image processing and human organization systems in order to arbitrating among redundant results of processing in redundant hardware modules or software versions. From a point of view, voting algorithms can be categorized to agreement-based voters like plurality and majority or some voters which produce output regardless to agreement existence among the results of redundant variants. In some applications {{it is necessary to}} use second type voters including median and <b>weighted</b> <b>average.</b> Although both of median and <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> voters are the choicest voters for highly available application, <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> voting is often more trustable than median. Meanwhile median voter simply selects the mid-value of results; <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> voter assigns weight to each input, based on their pre-determined priority or their differences, so that the share of more trustable inputs will increase rather than the inputs with low probable correctness. This paper introduces a novel <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> voting algorithm based on neural networks that is capable of improving the rate of system reliability. Our experimental results showed that the neural <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> voter has increases the reliability 116. 63 % in general and 309. 82 %, 130. 27 % and 9. 37 % respectively for large, medium and small errors in comparison with <b>weighted</b> <b>average,</b> and 73. 87 % in general and 160. 44 %, 83. 59 % and 7. 52 % respectively for large, medium and small errors in comparison with median voter.
