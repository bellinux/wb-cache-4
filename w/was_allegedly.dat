50|$|During the {{abduction}} the hostages <b>were</b> <b>allegedly</b> robbed {{of their money}} and jewelry before being forced at gunpoint to swim to the boat waiting offshore. The hostages <b>were</b> then <b>allegedly</b> transported about an hour away to Jolo island, in the Sulu Archipelago of the southern Philippines.

5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, <b>was</b> <b>allegedly</b> used in poison-gas attacks by the Assad government in 2014.

5|$|Domitian <b>was</b> <b>allegedly</b> {{extremely}} sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised {{in later life}} by wearing wigs. According to Suetonius, he even wrote {{a book on the}} subject of hair care. With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Money <b>was</b> <b>allegedly</b> lent by {{the banks}} to their {{employees}} and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans.

These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.|$|E

The company went defunct around the time of Jernigan's divorce from his wife, the secretary-treasurer of the company, in December 1980. Jernigan's son, Victor, continued to work for Wilkinson in another capacity until 1982.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), {{is that at}} least parts of the room {{were found in the}} Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room <b>was</b> <b>allegedly</b> still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E

Of his two grown sons by Cwenburh of Mercia, Osfrith died at Hatfield, and Eadfrith was captured by Penda and killed some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} {{arriving}} in North America from Moscow {{with his father and}} brother on September 6, 1991, (his mother Tatiana arrived two months later), Bure married an American fashion model, later revealed to be Jayme Bohn, in a civil ceremony. The marriage <b>was</b> <b>allegedly</b> set up by Bure's agents as a preventative measure against deportation in the event he and the Canucks could not come to terms with a contract. Bure derived no immigration benefit from the marriage, which was dissolved the following year. Bohn became a costume designer in the film and television industry.|$|E
5|$|Football lore has {{numerous}} legends relating {{when and}} where the bicycle kick was first performed and who created it. According to Brazilian anthropologist Antonio Jorge Soares, the bicycle kick's origin is important only {{as an example of}} how folklore is created. Popular opinion continues to debate its exact origin, particularly in the locations where the manoeuvre <b>was</b> <b>allegedly</b> created (e.g., Brazil, Chile, and Peru). Regardless, the available facts and dates tell a straightforward narrative.|$|E

5|$|Henry <b>was</b> <b>allegedly</b> {{buried in}} Nousiainen, from where his bones—or at least {{something}} that {{was thought to be}} his bones—were transported to Turku in 1300. In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation of traditions in the early 13th century, but no abrupt changes are apparent in the religious environment among the 12th century finds.|$|E
5|$|His {{place in}} the genealogical {{tradition}} of the MacDonalds is the only reason for believing in his existence, a genealogical tradition that not all historians have accepted. Beyond his actual existence, there is little that is certain. Three entries in Irish annals may discuss him, though he is never named; a praise poem surviving from the Early Modern period may be descended from a poem originally written for him; a miracle in a Manx chronicle {{may or may not}} have Domhnall as its subject; and a doubtful charter surviving from a similarly late era <b>was</b> <b>allegedly</b> issued by him.|$|E
5|$|In July, BLM activists {{across the}} United States began protests {{over the death}} of Sandra Bland, an African-American woman, who <b>was</b> <b>allegedly</b> found hanged in a jail cell in Waller County, Texas.

In Newark, New Jersey, over a {{thousand}} BLM activists marched against police brutality, racial injustice, and economic inequality. Also in July, BLM protested the death of Jonathan Sanders who died while being arrested by police in Mississippi.|$|E
