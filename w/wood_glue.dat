Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs {{call for the}} removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it lets go, so the plate does not crack. Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular <b>wood</b> <b>glue,</b> because it cannot be steamed open when a repair has to be made by a luthier.|$|E
500|$|Acetic acid is {{the second}} {{simplest}} carboxylic acid (after formic acid). [...] It consists of a methyl group attached to a carboxyl group. It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, used primarily {{in the production of}} cellulose acetate for photographic film, polyvinyl acetate for <b>wood</b> <b>glue,</b> and synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in descaling agents. In the food industry, acetic acid is controlled by the food additive code E260 as an acidity regulator and as a condiment. As a food additive it is approved for usage in many countries, including Canada, the European Union, the United States, Australia and New Zealand. In biochemistry, the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats.|$|E

5000|$|Several <b>wood</b> <b>glues</b> have poor [...] "gap-filling" [...] ability, {{meaning they}} either soak {{into the wood}} and leave the gap empty, or remain {{to fill the gap}} but have little {{structural}} integrity. Therefore, woodworkers commonly use tight-fitting joints that need surprisingly little glue to hold large pieces of <b>wood.</b> Most <b>wood</b> <b>glues</b> need to be clamped while the glue sets. Epoxy resins and some other glues can be thickened with structural fillers (or with thicker formulations of the resin) to help fill gaps, however it is preferable to try to minimize gaps in the first place.|$|R
