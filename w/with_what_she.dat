5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of the House of Habsburg, Maria Theresa was a Roman Catholic, and a devout one. She {{believed}} that religious unity was necessary for a peaceful public life and explicitly rejected the idea of religious toleration. However, she never allowed the Church to interfere <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> considered to be prerogatives of a monarch and kept Rome at arm's length. She controlled the selection of archbishops, bishops and abbots.|$|E

5|$|New York City actress Ash ("Liz") Sroka voices Tali {{throughout}} the Mass Effect trilogy, her first {{role in a}} video game. Sroka auditioned for three different roles: the female Commander Shepard, Tali'Zorah, and one other female character. After initially receiving the role of Tali, she was still unsure of how much material there was. Ginny McSwain gave voice direction, and would generally take two takes—the first to use, the second as back-up, and occasionally a third or more if the recording did not fit <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted. Recording sessions would generally last about four hours. Sroka herself is not a gamer, though she says she enjoys the character of Tali and is happy to have landed the role.|$|E

Lee) tells Dexter the gas in the cabin was turned on while the stove was lit, and when Dexter sees his own satellite navigation system while cataloging evidence, he realizes that Lila must have found the cabin. He meets with her at the aquarium and tells her that he, like her, has no emotion and lives a life devoid of feeling. They form plans to leave Miami together, though Dexter secretly intends to kill her. When he visits her apartment the next day, though, he finds Debra there, trying to persuade Lila to leave town. Dexter is forced to lie about running away with Lila in front of Debra, so a hurt Lila then leaves <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> recognizes as Dexter's bag of murder equipment. She goes to Rita's house and drugs the babysitter so that she can abduct the children, Astor and Cody (Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey). When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing, he goes straight to Lila's apartment, where she lights another fire and locks the three of them inside. Rita calls Debra for her help, and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon with Lundy to help with finding the children. Dexter manages to free Astor and Cody through a small window and eventually rams down a thin wall allowing him to escape.|$|E

25|$|From her {{experiences}} as a psychiatrist, Horney named ten patterns of neurotic needs. These ten needs are based upon things which she thought all humans require to succeed in life. Horney modified these needs somewhat to correspond <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> believed were individuals' neuroses. A neurotic person could theoretically exhibit all of these needs, though in practice much fewer than the ten here need to be present {{for a person to}} be considered a neurotic.|$|E

But in the first season finale, he would later show up to see her, and upon learning that he was a father, he walked out on Sophie and left her devastated, only to return hours later to see Sophie with her ex-boyfriend Rick at her apartment.|$|E

500|$|According to James Montgomery of MTV News, [...] "Auras lyrics equate {{celebrity and}} stardom with {{religious}} oppression and subjugation. The {{beginning of the}} song, implying that the singer destroyed her old self to become Gaga the artist, examines {{the loss of a}} private life and constant media scrutiny (noting that they are by choice). The track's central metaphor is a burqa as a [...] "veil of fame", sexualizing it with the line [...] "Do you wanna see me naked, lover?" [...] Montgomery said that criticism of Gaga's use of the word [...] "burqa" [...] is countered in the lyrics, when she sings [...] "Enigma popstar is fun, she wears burqa for fashion". [...] "Aura" [...] expresses Gaga's solidarity <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> considers her sisterhood.|$|E

500|$|Hooper {{employed}} {{a number of}} cinematic techniques to evoke the King's feelings of constriction. He and cinematographer Danny Cohen used wider than normal lenses to photograph the film, typically 14mm, 18mm, 21mm, 25mm and 27mm, where the subtle distortion of the picture helps to convey the King's discomfort. For instance, the subjective point of view shot during the Empire exhibition speech used a close up of the microphone with a wider lens, similar to the filming technique used {{for one of the}} Duke's early consultations with a physician. In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that the feeling of entrapment inside the King's head was rendered overly literal <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> believed to be a fisheye lens, though in these scenes the wider lenses were used. Hooper also discussed using the 18mm lens, one he likes [...] "because it puts human beings in their context".|$|E
500|$|Obvious Child {{originated}} as a {{short film}} {{of the same name}} about an unemployed woman who decides to terminate her pregnancy resulting from a one-night stand, which was written by Gillian Robespierre, Anna Bean and Karen Maine. Robespierre said that the story was spawned from her frustration <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> perceived as a [...] "misrepresentation of women on screen when it came to unplanned pregnancy", in films such as Juno (2007), Knocked Up (2007) and Waitress (2007). Robespierre, Bean and Maine, feeling [...] "disenchanted with the representation of young women's experience with becoming pregnant", wanted to make a film that destigmatized an abortion by featuring a woman who terminates a pregnancy without regretting her decision. Jenny Slate was cast as the lead after Robespierre and Bean saw Slate performing stand-up comedy. The short was produced in 2009 and released on the video-sharing website Vimeo, where it was watched by 40,000 people.|$|E

Beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter [...] "what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music... he is lyrical and raw". In February 2013, Beyoncé said that Madonna inspired her to take control of her own career. She commented: [...] "I think about Madonna and how she took all of the great things she achieved and started the label and developed other artists. But there are not enough of those women.".|$|E
