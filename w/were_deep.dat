5|$|Encompassing , the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building stood {{three stories}} tall. The second and first floors (the latter of which lies {{partially}} below ground) contained laboratory space while {{the third floor}} consisted of communal and teaching spaces like classrooms and offices. Other offices {{on the first floor}} were lit via skylights. The stairwells in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get {{from one side of the}} building to the other. In spite of this, Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 that students had taken to passing through the building as a shortcut instead of going around it. Furnishings and carpeting in the building <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> blue and rust-colored.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him {{at least part of}} the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Postclassic, {{the greater}} Q'umarkaj area is {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} population of around 15,000. The inhabitants of Q'umarkaj were divided socially between the nobility and their vassals. The nobles were known as the ajaw, while the vassals were known as the al k'ajol. The nobility were the patrilineal descendents of the founding warlords who appear to have entered as conquerors from the Gulf coast around AD 1200 and who eventually lost their original language and adopted that of their subjects. The nobles were regarded as sacred and bore royal imagery. Their vassals served as foot-soldiers and were subject to the laws laid out by the nobility, although they could receive military titles {{as a result of their}} battlefield prowess. The social divisions <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> seated and were equivalent to strictly observed castes. The merchants were a privileged class, although they had to make tributary payments to the nobility. In addition to these classes, the population included rural labourers and artisans. Slaves were also held and included both sentenced criminals and prisoners of war.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 25 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> indigo blue, {{with a narrow}} deep coppery-red terminal fascia. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> indigo blue, but the posterior half <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> coppery red.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> orange-yellow with blackish markings. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> orange-yellow with waved blackish lines.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{underground}} stations on the line <b>are</b> significantly <b>deeper</b> than the others. Tsim Sha Tsui and Admiralty stations <b>are</b> <b>deeper</b> because they precede harbour crossings. Admiralty and Central <b>are</b> <b>deeper</b> they provide cross-platform interchange with the deep-level Island Line.|$|R
5|$|Lead mining {{peaked in}} the 17th and 18th centuries; high {{concentrations}} of lead {{have been found in}} the area dating back from this period, as well as discovering peat on Kinder Scout suggesting that lead smelting occurred. Lead mining began to decline from the mid-19th century, with the last major mine closing in 1939, though lead remains a by-product of fluorite, baryte and calcite mining. Not all mines <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> underground; Bell pits were a cheap and easy way at getting at an ore that lay close to the surface of flat land. A shaft was sunk into the ore and enlarged at the bottom for extraction. The pit was then enlarged further until it became unsafe or worked out, then another pit would be sunk adjacent to the existing one.|$|E
5|$|Picton's probing {{attacks against}} the French center also met stiff resistance. Picton split the 3rd Division, sending Thomas Brisbane's brigade up the right spur toward Foy's {{position}} and Keane's brigade up the left spur toward Darmagnac's division. Keane was supported by Manley Power's Portuguese brigade from 3rd Division. Brisbane was followed up the right spur by Clinton's 6th Division. Since the valleys between the spurs <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> and muddy, both advances were restricted to narrow fronts. Picton's skirmishers quickly drove back the French outposts. When the leading brigades came under accurate artillery fire from the Escorial and Lafaurie knolls, Picton held back his formed troops and reinforced his skirmish line to seven British light companies, three 5th/60th Foot rifle companies and the entire 11th Caçadores Battalion. This heavy skirmish line moved forward until it {{came into contact with}} Soult's main defense line, but it was unable to press any farther. For two hours, Picton waited for Beresford's attack to make progress as the two sides skirmished.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći {{was not much}} different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, {{and to be able to}} communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E

5|$|Departing from Brest on 13 December 1805, it was 12 {{days before}} the Admiralty in London {{were aware of the}} French movements, by which time the French squadrons <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> in the Atlantic, one under Vice-Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues {{intending}} to cruise in the Caribbean and the other, under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, sailing for the South Atlantic. Two British squadrons were hastily mustered and dispatched in pursuit, one under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and the other under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. These squadrons were joined by a third under Rear-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth, who had deserted his station off Cadiz when he learned news of a French squadron to his south and subsequently crossed the Atlantic in pursuit of Willaumez. Although Willaumez managed to escape into the South Atlantic, Leissègues was less successful and was discovered and destroyed at the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806 by a combined force under Duckworth and Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Other squadrons already at sea became embroiled in the campaign: a smaller squadron that had been raiding the African coast under Commodore Jean-Marthe-Adrien L'Hermite since August 1805 provided a diversion to the major campaign but failed to draw off significant British forces, while the remnants of a French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois that had been operating in the Indian Ocean since 1803 was intercepted and defeated by Warren in March, after a chance encounter on its journey back to France.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} November, 1793, Robert Southey was envisioning a utopia in the US. In June 1794, Coleridge left Cambridge to visit Oxford, and there met Southey, {{a student and}} poet. Within weeks, Southey and Coleridge <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> in the {{planning}} stages of Pantisocracy.|$|E
25|$|The Mersey Railway was {{formally}} opened on 20 January 1886 and public services started on 1 February. The route had four new stations: Green Lane, Birkenhead Central and Hamilton Square in Birkenhead and James Street station in Liverpool. Green Lane and Birkenhead Central were below ground level in open cuttings whereas James Street and Hamilton Square <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> underground and accessed by lifts.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 20 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> purplish brown. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> smoky {{with a faint}} purplish tinge. Adults have been recorded on wing from February to July.|$|R

25|$|In the 1975 Cricket World Cup Final against Australia, the West Indies <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> {{in trouble}} at 3/50 when Lloyd {{strode to the}} crease. He duly made 102 from 88 balls, the only limited overs {{international}} century of his career. With Rohan Kanhai he added 149 for the West Indies to win by 17 runs. Play ended at 8:40pm London time and was the longest days' play ever at Lords.|$|E
25|$|Along {{the way in}} Millard Canyon, {{a special}} station stop was made at Dawn Station above the Dawn Mines, an old gold mining operation. The mines <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> in the canyon and {{visitors}} stopping off to see the digs spent an exorbitant amount of time {{getting back to the}} train. A false adit was dug just a hundred feet below the track to trick people into thinking they had visited the mine and were shortly ready to return to the train.|$|E
25|$|Rothschild and Martin {{looked for}} {{evidence}} that mosasaurs {{suffered from the}} bends {{as a result of}} their diving and ascent activities. Avascular necrosis resulting from the bends was completely absent in fossils of the genus Clidastes, suggesting that it preferred to stay near the surface. In contrast, Rothschild and Martin observed avascular necrosis in nearly every specimen of Platecarpus and Tylosaurus that they surveyed. The presence and ubiquity of the avascular necrosis is consistent with the idea that these <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> diving animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 90-95 mm. The uppersides of the forewings, head, thorax and abdomen <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> olive green. There is a stripe {{running from}} the forewing base to the palp. The lateral patch on the abdomen and the undersides {{of the body and}} wings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> carmine-red. The forewing upperside <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> olive green, although the interspaces have a silky blue-grey gloss. There are three antemedian lines, of which the second and third are merged.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 9-12 mm. The anterior {{part of the}} forewings <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> purple, with a round white basal spot. The posterior part of {{the wing}} <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> crimson. The hindwings are grey fuscous with a golden gloss.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 23 mm {{for males and}} 27 mm for females. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> colonial buff with several buffy olive lines. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> colonial buff with a reticulated pattern of light brownish olive.|$|R
25|$|There {{was also}} intense {{pressure}} from the Soviet government {{to open up a}} second front in Western Europe. By early 1942, the Wehrmacht's Operation Barbarossa had clearly failed to destroy the Soviet Union. However, the Germans in a much less ambitious summer offensive launched in June <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> into southern Soviet territory, pushing toward Stalingrad. Joseph Stalin himself repeatedly demanded that the Allies create a second front in France to force the Germans to move at least 40 divisions away from the Eastern Front to remove some of the pressure on the Red Army.|$|E
25|$|Since Maryland had {{remained}} in the Union during the Civil War, the state was {{not covered by the}} Reconstruction Act, as were states of the former Confederacy. But, it had been a slave state; albeit one in which by 1860, 49% of blacks were free. After the war, many white Maryland residents struggled to re-establish white supremacy over freedmen and formerly free blacks, and racial tensions rose. There <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> divisions in the state between those who fought for the North and those who fought for the South, which were also difficult to reconcile.|$|E
25|$|The regions were {{to provide}} {{locations}} {{in which to}} confront an enemy and from which to launch an offensive to carry the battle onto enemy territory. The Metz region was considered a potential base for a counter-offensive should border defenses be pierced and Lorraine threatened, possibly using the former German fortifications of Metz and Strasbourg. The previous fortifications of the Séré de Rivières system of the 1880s were designed to defend the frontiers of France that existed following the Franco-Prussian War, in which France had lost Alsace and Lorraine. With the recovery of these territories following World War I, most of the Séré de Rivières forts <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> {{in the interior of}} northeastern France and not useful.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 22 mm {{for males and}} 26 mm for females. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> colonial buff with several buffy-olive lines from the costa to the dorsum. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> colonial buff with a buffy-olive patch.|$|R
50|$|These <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> burials.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 14 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> reddish orange, but cream white in the subcostal area and the external third of the wing. The markings are blue-black. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> reddish orange with violet-black marginal spots.|$|R
25|$|Farmers {{cleared the}} land of trees and drained the swamps, but farming was {{difficult}} due to the glacial till beneath the shallow soil. Other settlers turned to the natural resources left by the glaciers and mined sand and gravel deposits. Limestone and clay mines were opened in the area; shale was discovered and was mined, as well as bituminous coal. Coal mining was a profitable enterprise and seven coal beds <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> mined and later strip mined. Later still, wells were drilled to extract {{oil and natural gas}} from deep within the Earth. When the mines were cleared and the wells tapped out, the land was left barren. Since the mines were left uncapped, the topsoil eroded from the land.|$|E
25|$|Carrington and {{a detail}} of 80 men marched {{cautiously}} out of Fort Kearny on December 22, as the blizzard was approaching, and gathered the remaining bodies of those killed. All except the bugler, Adolph Metzger, had been mutilated. His corpse {{was covered with}} a buffalo robe, a sign, the whites believed, of respect for his courage. Ritual mutilation of their enemies was a Lakota custom, believed to prevent them from enjoying the physical pleasures of an afterlife. On December 26, the soldiers buried the bodies of Fetterman, his officers, and his men in a common trench. By January 1, Carrington's fears of an Indian attack on the fort had subsided. The snows <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> and Jim Bridger advised him that the Indians would hole up for the winter.|$|E
25|$|The {{streets were}} broad, well paved {{and laid out}} at right angles; many were named after temples: the main street, called the Golden, ran across the city from west to east, {{beginning}} probably from the temple of Zeus Akraios on the west slope of Pagus, and running round the lower slopes of Pagus (like a necklace on the statue, to use the favorite terms of Aristides the orator) towards Tepecik outside {{the city on the}} east, where probably stood the temple of Cybele, worshipped under the name of Meter Sipylene, the patroness of the city. The name is from the nearby Mount Sipylus, which bounds the valley of the city's backlands. The plain towards the sea was too low to be properly drained, and in rainy weather, the streets of the lower town <b>were</b> <b>deep</b> with mud and water.|$|E
