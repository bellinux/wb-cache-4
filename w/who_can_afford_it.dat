2500|$|In the United Kingdom for example, a {{relatively}} comprehensive, [...] "free {{at the point}} of delivery" [...] health care system exists, funded by the state. Hospital care is thus relatively easily available to all legal residents, although free emergency care is available to anyone, regardless of nationality or status. As hospitals prioritise their limited resources, there is a tendency for 'waiting lists' for non-crucial treatment in countries with such systems, as opposed to letting higher-payers get treated first, so sometimes those <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> take out private health care to get treatment more quickly. On the other hand, some countries, including the USA, have in the twentieth century introduced a private-based, for-profit-approach to providing hospital care, with few state-money supported 'charity' hospitals remaining today. Where for-profit hospitals in such countries admit uninsured patients in emergency situations (such as during and after Hurricane Katrina in the USA), they incur direct financial losses, ensuring that there is a clear disincentive to admit such patients. In the United States, laws exist to ensure patients receive care in life-threatening emergency situations regardless of the patient's ability to pay.|$|E

5|$|On announcing {{its plans}} for Steam Direct, Valve {{suggested}} the fee {{would be in}} the range of $100–5,000, meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and weed out poor quality titles that are treated as shovelware, improving the discovery pipeline to Steam's customers. Smaller developers raised concerns about the Direct fee harming them, and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam marketplace. Valve opted to set the Direct fee at $100 after reviewing concerns from the community, recognizing the need to keep this at a low amount for small developers, and outlining plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement to help these. Valve then refunds the fee should the game exceed $1,000 in sales. In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to Direct, Valve mass-approved most of the 3,400 remaining titles that were still in Greenlight, though the company noted that not all of these were at a state to be published. Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with Direct in place.

40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, volume crimes dropped {{substantially}} {{in most countries}} with reliable crime-trend estimates. In England andWales, domestic burglary fell by 58 per cent between 1995 and 2008 / 09, the trend levelling off after 2005 / 06. Wider use of more and better security arguably contributed to these drops. The availability of enhanced and especially basic security increased between 1997 and 2005 / 06, while burglary risk fell for all population income groups. Considering, however, the fi-nancial cost of burglary-protection devices, {{it is not surprising}} that enhanced security continues to be more accessible to better-off households. In 2005 / 06, the most affluent households were 60 per cent more likely to have such devices compared to the poorest. This is consistent with the finding that nationally burglary drops have occurred least amongst the poorest segments of the population. The better-off continue to benefit most in terms of crime protection: burglary-risk differentials between the lowest and all other income groups widened during the decade up to 2005 / 06.

40|$|Alcohol use {{has been}} linked to a number of crimes {{including}} assault, violence and sexual crimes. Research is now looking deeper into the relationships between alcohol, the alcohol environment and crime. The majority of these studies have investigated alcohol outlet density but {{there is a lack of}} research in this area in Britain and Scotland. This study used a combination of ordinal logistic regression and Kruskal-Wallis tests with alcohol outlet data sources from Scotland’s 32 liquor licensing boards in conjunction with Government deprivation and crime data to investigate the relationships between deprivation and alcohol outlet density and alcohol outlet density and crime in Scotland, alongside a case study centred around Scotland’s largest city Glasgow which employed police violent crime data. The results of the study suggested a strong positive relationship for off-licence outlets with deprivation, and crime. The relationships involving on-licence outlets were significant but more difficult to interpret, possibly due to wide range of on-licence outlets (pubs, night clubs, and restaurants). Total outlet results followed close to on-licence due to the large proportion of on licenses which make total. Nationally the study suggests a disproportionate association between off-licence alcohol outlet density and crime and that these higher densities are found in the more deprived areas of Scotland placing an increased burden on the communities <b>who</b> <b>can</b> least <b>afford</b> <b>it...</b>|$|R

40|$|TROPICAL rainforests are {{the most}} biologically diverse {{terrestrial}} habitats on earth yet nearly all such ecosystems are located in developing countries (Ghazoul and Sheil 2010). Responsibility for stewardship of species richness is therefore borne by those <b>who</b> <b>can</b> least <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> In many areas, poor people have few choices but {{to make a living}} by exploiting natural resources in ecologically valuable habitats. Limited education in developing countries can compound the difficulties of trying to develop and enforce conservation practices. The remote Indonesian Banggai Archipelago, is characterized by high biological diversity and contrastingly low income of its inhabitants. One main obstacle to maintaining the biodiversity is a vicious cycle whereby run-off from shifting agriculture in the forest deposits silt on coral reefs, putting further pressure on a fish stock already depleted by overfishing and coral reef destruction. This leads to a shortage of animal protein available to the islanders, prompting them to over-hunt forest vertebrates, which are already stressed from habitat destruction. Biodiversity conservation is complicated by the interplay of many factors outside the realm of biology, societal dynamics, including politics at many levels, decision-makers unschooled in conservation and limited collaboration between scientists and decision-makers. Therefore conservation practice needs to marry theory with pragmatism, eventually influencing the behavior, values, and decision-making of citizens and politicians alike (Reyers et al. 2010). Local and scientific knowledge can be integrated to provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex and dynamic socio-ecological systems. Only when relevant stakeholders are systematically represented can there be effective participation (Reed 2008). We investigated linking the conservation of flora and fauna with the livelihoods of the Banggai people, in particular possible trade offs and incentives that may encourage local participation and investment in conservation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{health care system is}} to {{preserve}} and improve health. While most people would agree with this simple premise, health care in the United States does not adequately achieve this purpose. Although many doctors, community clinics and public hospitals serve our health, a significant segment of the health care industry is designed to maximize profit rather than care. Indeed, private insurers and providers have a legal obligation to their shareholders and investors to make a profit. In this model, health care is a commodity. This has grave consequences for our health: studies have shown that maximizing profit generally correlates with minimizing care, higher rates of death, unnecessary suffering, and loss of health (see box). The commodity-based approach to health care is fundamentally flawed. It restricts access to health care to those <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to buy <b>it</b> and assumes that prices will be reasonable because supply and demand are linked. With most products, consumers limit their demand based on price. But in the case of health care, demand is not price sensitive – when you are sick you don’t have a choice. Supply, on the other hand, is most profitable if care is either charged at expensive rates, in the case of providers, or avoided altogether, in the case of private insurers. Insurance companies operate under incentives to reduce care and do not need to deliver a quality product or service in order to make money...|$|R

In their interactions with libraries, societies may appear primarily as publishers of newsletters, books, reports, journals, indexes, and databases, but they also promote the creation and diffusion of knowledge by serving as hubs for professional activity, contributors to the making of public policy and opinion, providers of education, representatives of the interests of their members, and, more generally, shapers of the institutions and purposes of higher education. Society operations and education or outreach programs depend to varying degrees on revenues from publishing programs and membership dues.
