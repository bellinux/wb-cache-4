5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward. Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on a fork in the road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E
5|$|Mario is {{the main}} {{character}} of The Thousand-Year Door, although the game will frequently cut to Princess Peach in the X-Naut Fortress. Much time is spent on her interaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> TEC, which has suffered from a glitch and has {{fallen in love with}} Peach, much to her surprise. The main antagonist of the Mario series, Bowser, tries to collect the Crystal Stars before Mario does instead of directly opposing Mario, though his attempts mostly become comedic relief. Luigi's role in the game consists of recounting his slapstick adventures in the Waffle Kingdom, and appears with party members of his own, many of whom do not like Luigi at all for unrelated reasons, juxtaposing the universal respect Mario's partners have for Mario.|$|E

The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, and was later released in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer,</b> but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed to come in the next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Nolan Bushnell {{founded a}} new computer-guided {{animation}} studio called Kadabrascope as {{a subsidiary of}} his Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatres company, {{which was founded in}} 1977. Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas movie for NBC starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots. The animation movement would be made using Tweening instead of traditional cel animation. After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) would be sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope would be sold to LucasFilm. The Kadabrascope assets would be combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Computer</b> Division of LucasFilm. Coincidentally, Steve Jobs, a main Apple shareholder and former CEO, worked under Bushnell in 1973 as a technician at his other company Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in 1976 to focus on PTT. PTT would later go bankrupt in 1985 and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place.|$|E

However, the Resistance disobeys Ashdown's orders and instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer,</b> and disables perimeter defenses so that Connor can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Wright learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen), that he was created and built from the original Wright's corpse to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish in the past. The hidden signal that the Resistance received earlier is revealed {{to have been a}} ruse, and Skynet uses it to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.|$|E

25|$|In this study, {{participants}} {{were assigned to}} one of two conditions. In the first condition they would be paired with a computer and would become the blue team. The computer had a blue sticker and the human wore a blue wristband to signify that they were in fact a team. The second condition was blue individual, in which a person would use a computer but they were not considered teammates, rather the computer was just a resource. The task was to complete a “Desert Survival Guide” activity in which participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island. Human participants initially completed the activity on their own and then completed it using a computer (either as a teammate where both the computer and human were evaluated or just using the computer as a resource). Finally, the {{participants were}} allowed to revise their rankings, if they wished to do so. The results of this study indicated that participants who worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> as a teammate viewed the computer as more like them, worked in a similar style to their own, was more cooperative and friendlier than people who worked individually. Another finding of this study showed that participants who worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> as a teammate were more likely to change their behavior and conform to the group ideal even when the teammate was a computer. This study supports the notion that developing a sense of interdependency is the key to establishing team affiliation.|$|E

Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled Douglas Adams Starship Titanic, since Adams was too busy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> game to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the h2g2 collaborative writing project, an experimental attempt at making The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a reality, and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the internet community.

25|$|Every player's {{character}} is assigned six clones, {{known as a}} six-pack, which are used to replace the preceding clone upon his or her death. The game lacks a conventional health system; most wounds the player characters can suffer {{are assumed to be}} fatal. As a result, Paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed, yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game. This easy spending of clones tends to lead to frequent firefights, gruesome slapstick, and the horrible yet humorous demise of most if not all of the player character's clone family. Additional clones can be purchased if one gains sufficient favour <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Computer.</b>|$|E
