In {{protest of}} his jailing, Charles Ruthenberg led {{a parade of}} unionists, socialists, anarchists and communists to march on May 1 (May Day) 1919, in Cleveland, Ohio. The event quickly broke into the violent May Day Riots of 1919.|$|E
5|$|Novelist Inez Asher {{was among}} those who wrote for the series, while other scripts were {{produced}} by writers blacklisted during the heyday of McCarthyism and the House Un-American Activities Committee. These writers included Robert Lees (credited as J. E. Selby) and Adrian Scott, one of the Hollywood Ten who <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> for contempt of the United States Congress. His wife, Joan Scott writing as Joanne Court, attended story conferences and gave her husband notes so he could do rewrites.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} took direct {{aim at the}} U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial. The case hinged {{on whether or not}} mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.|$|E

25|$|The {{strike was}} broken up by United States Marshals and some 2,000 United States Army troops, {{commanded}} by Nelson Miles, sent in by President Grover Cleveland {{on the premise}} that the strike interfered with the delivery of U.S. Mail. During the course of the strike, 13 strikers were killed and 57 were wounded. An estimated $340,000 worth of property damage occurred during the strike. Debs <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> for six months for violating the federal court order, and the ARU disintegrated.|$|E
25|$|Princess Tarakanova (1753–1775) {{declared}} {{herself in}} Paris in 1774 as Elizabeth's daughter by Alexis Razumovsky {{and as the}} sister of Pugachev. The Empress Catherine dispatched Alexey Orlov to Italy, where he captured Tarakanova in Livorno. When brought to Russia in 1775, Tarakanova <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> in the Peter and Paul Fortress, where she died of tuberculosis in December 1775. There are rumours that her death was faked {{and that she was}} confined to a nunnery in Moscow in 1785, where she died in 1810.|$|E
25|$|Within {{weeks of}} the killing, ten women and one man were arrested in {{connection}} with the murder. They were convicted in February 1975. All but one, a minor whose sentence was suspended, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> The murder caused widespread revulsion, shock and horror throughout Northern Ireland and remained long in the public psyche even at a time when bombings and killings were daily occurrences. The Ann Ogilby murder was investigated by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) which was established by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to investigate the most controversial killings carried out during the Troubles.|$|E

25|$|In 1911, {{he helped}} defend union members John J. and James B. McNamara {{after they were}} charged with bombing the Los Angeles Times {{building}} and causing the deaths of 21 people. The McNamaras eventually confessed: John <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> for life, and James served a 10-year sentence. For daring to defend the brothers, Times publisher Harrison Gray Otis (a virulent opponent of labor unions) attacked Scott in the paper's pages {{for the next several}} years. In 1913, Scott sued Otis, the Times, and the Times-Mirror Company for libel. After three separate trials, Scott won judgments of nearly $70,000 (more than $1,700,000 in 2017 dollars).|$|E
25|$|Uncertainty {{began to}} {{dominate}} the global financial and economic environment. Business and consumer confidence in New Zealand plummeted as dozens of finance companies collapsed. To try and stop a flight of funds from New Zealand institutions to those in Australia, the Government established the Crown Retail Deposit Guarantee Scheme to cover depositors funds {{in the event that}} a bank or finance company went broke. This protected some investors but nevertheless, at least 67 finance companies collapsed within a short period of time. The largest of these was South Canterbury Finance which cost taxpayers NZ$1.58 billion when the company collapsed in August 2010. The directors of many of these finance companies were subsequently investigated for fraud and some high-profile directors <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{one visit}} to Benalla in 1876, Dan {{was arrested for}} {{stealing}} a saddle. The police let him go when they could not get enough evidence. Dan and his cousins got into trouble with the police in October 1877. They {{had gone to a}} shop to pick up food and other supplies, but the shop was shut. When the owner refused to open the shop, Dan Kelly broke down the door. They were charged with violent assault, damage to property (the door), breaking into houses and stealing things worth £113. The boys went into hiding, and the police spent three weeks looking for them. Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick told Ned Kelly to get them to give themselves up. In court, the police were not able to prove most of the charges, but Dan <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> for one month for damaging property worth £10.|$|E

25|$|After {{concluding}} the Harris Commission investigation, Congress {{passed a}} law prohibiting the fixing of quiz shows (and {{any other form of}} contest). These public hearings triggered amendments passed to the Communications Act in 1960. Therefore, the bill that President Eisenhower signed into law on September 13, 1960, was a fairly mild improvement to the broadcast industry. It allowed the FCC to require license renewals of less than the legally required three years if the agency believes {{it would be in the}} public interest, prohibited gifts to FCC members, and declared illegal any contest or game with intent to deceive the audience. However, at the time, while the actions may have been disreputable, they were not illegal. As a result, no one <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> for rigging game shows. The individuals who were prosecuted were charged because of attempts to cover up their actions, either by obstruction of justice or perjury.|$|E
25|$|The churches showed {{much less}} pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God, based in Anderson, Indiana, {{had a strong}} pacifist element, {{reaching}} a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked. Likewise the Quakers generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors. The Mennonites and Brethren continued their pacifism, but {{the federal government was}} much less hostile than in the previous war. These churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation. Goshen College set up a training program for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals. The Jehovah Witness denomination, however, refused to participate in any forms of service, and thousands of its young men refused to register and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b>|$|E

He <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> on several occasions when Bhutto and General Zia ul Haq were in power for his opposition to both. He {{was elected to the}} National Assembly in 1997 and 2002. He was elected as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Information and Media Development. He staunchly opposed the 15th Amendment to the Constitution (‘Shariat Bill’) during the Prime Minister ship of Nawaz Sharif. He resigned from membership of the National Assembly as a mark of protest against the 15th Amendment, saying that if passed in its original form, it would negate Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s pluralistic and progressive vision of Pakistan. He left the foreign office to join the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy in 1981 and {{was subsequently}} arrested.|$|E

25|$|After being {{released}} from a short stint in prison, Phil attempts to tell Ian privately on his wedding day that Kathy is alive, but cannot {{go through with it}} when Ben (Harry Reid) walks in on their conversation. Phil later meets Kathy in secret and tells her that, despite her wishes, he cannot allow her to return home, concerned about the effect on Ben and Ian. A few months later, Phil meets her in a café, and hands her an envelope of cash, with the promise this is the last payment he has for her. Seemingly out of the blue, months on, Kathy visits Phil at his garage in Walford, begging for fake documentation for her controlling husband Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas), so she can reveal that she faked her death, without implicating him. Phil agrees to help her leave London and meets her at St Pancras International, but Sharon, who is now married to Phil, arrives, suspecting he is meeting someone he is having an affair with. Ian accompanies her and Kathy disappears, having spotted Ian {{for the first time in}} 10 years. As she leaves, she runs into Gavin, who has been aware of her plan all along. Phil's cousin Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) discovers Kathy is alive, and Phil has been aware for three years, since Ben <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> for murdering Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison).|$|E

[...] After his parole in 1952 he quickly rose to become one of the organization's most influential leaders, serving as the public face of the controversial group for a dozen years. In his autobiography, MalcolmX wrote proudly of some of the social achievements the Nation made while he was a member, particularly its free drug rehabilitation program. The Nation promoted black supremacy, advocated the separation of black and white Americans, and rejected the civil rights movement for its emphasis on integration.|$|E

[...] Vreeland allowed Nancy Colbath to adopt the child, {{with the understanding that}} she would be raised by Henry Wilson and his wife.
