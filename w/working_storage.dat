Post-training intrahippocampal scopolamine infusion (2 and 4 µg/side) produced a more marked reduction in response latencies in the lesioned animals compared to the sham-lesioned rats.

40|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) persists frequently into adulthood. The decomposition of endophenotypes by means of experimental neuro-cognitive assessment {{has the potential to}} improve diagnostic assessment, evaluation of treatment response, and disentanglement of genetic and environmental influences. We assessed four parameters of attentional capacity and selectivity derived from simple psychophysical tasks (verbal report of briefly presented letter displays) and based on a “theory of visual attention. ” These parameters are mathematically independent, quantitative measures, and previous studies have shown that they are highly sensitive for subtle attention deficits. Potential reductions of attentional capacity, that is, of perceptual processing speed and <b>working</b> memory <b>storage</b> capacity, were assessed with a whole report paradigm. Furthermore, possible pathologies of attentional selectivity, that is, selection of task-relevant information and bias in the spatial distribution of attention, were measured with a partial report paradigm. A group of 30 unmedicated adult ADHD patients and a group of 30 demographically matched healthy controls were tested. ADHD patients showed significant reductions of <b>working</b> memory <b>storage</b> capacity of a moderate to large effect size. Perceptual processing speed, task-based, and spatial selection were unaffected. The results imply a working memory deficit as an important source of behavioral impairments. The theory of visual attention parameter <b>working</b> memory <b>storage</b> capacity might constitute a quantifiable and testable endophenotype of ADHD...|$|R

40|$|Dispositional {{anxiety is}} a {{well-established}} {{risk factor for}} the development of psychiatric disorders along the internalizing spectrum, including anxiety and depression. Importantly, many of the maladaptive behaviors characteristic of anxiety, such as anticipatory apprehension, occur when threat is absent. This raises the possibility that anxious individuals are less efficient at gating threat’s access to working memory, a limited capacity workspace where information is actively retained, manipulated, and used to flexibly guide goal-directed behavior when it is no longer present in the external environment. Using a well-validated neurophysiological index of <b>working</b> memory <b>storage,</b> we demonstrate that threat-related distracters were difficult to filter on average and that this difficulty was exaggerated among anxious individuals. These results indicate that dispositionally anxious individuals allocate excessive <b>working</b> memory <b>storage</b> to threat, even when it is irrelevant to the task at hand. More broadly, these results provide a novel framework for understanding the maladaptive thoughts and actions characteristic of internalizing disorders...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] There is some evidence that positive mood might influence cognitive control and that extraverts might perform better than introverts when experiencing a positive mood. The current project investigated whether positive mood has differential effects on two cognitive control mechanisms, goal maintenance and <b>working</b> memory <b>storage</b> capacity, and whether the influence of positive mood on cognitive control varies by level of extraversion. In Study 1, following either a positive or a neutral mood induction, participants completed the Running Memory Span (RMS) task, a measure of <b>working</b> memory <b>storage</b> capacity, and the Stroop task, a measure of goal maintenance. Results show that the positive mood group performed worse on the RMS task, but the mood groups did not differ in their performance on the Stroop task. In Study 2, a within-subjects mood manipulation was utilized. Participants completed the RMS task and another measure of goal maintenance, the Flanker task. Findings show that when in a positive mood state, participants performed worse on the RMS task, but performance on the Flanker task did not vary by mood condition. In addition to completing mood measures, participants completed questionnaires assessing personality characteristics. There was no interaction between state mood ratings and trait levels of positive mood in either study. Overall, evidence from this project suggests that positive mood has differential effects on cognitive control, impairing <b>working</b> memory <b>storage</b> capacity but having no effect on goal maintenance...|$|R
